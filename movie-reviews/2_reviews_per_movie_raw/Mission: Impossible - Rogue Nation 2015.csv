","Another energetic, pleasingly implausible through ride with Ethan hunt and company. This time he gets His best female rival/love interest since Emanuelle Beart in the original. Like in ghost protocol, the action is nearly nonstop but creatively drawn such as a hair-raising motorcycle chase and then under water infiltration that you don't feel like you're watching the same thing again and again. just throw out that my two and three and you've got one of the greatest action movie trilogies."
"Prashast_Singh","10","18","19","27 October 2018"," A solid entry in the MI series; a stunning action movie.
","ROGUE NATION has a lot of excellent action sequences which make it one of the best action movies of all time. Tom Cruise drives all the action with energy, while Christopher McQuarrie directs with full intensity. Rebecca Ferguson is a worthy inclusion in the cast. She excels in the action sequences, making her one of the top action heroines in today's times. The entire cast acts with the same energy and intensity. Action sequences elevate the film to a higher level. The chase sequences are so breakneck that you'd have to be an ignorant viewer not to like them. There are good twists as well, and the scale is huge as always. The MI franchise has always improved on the next film, and this one proves me right."
"shadowyx12","9","214","317","1 August 2015"," Christopher McQuarrie makes this the best entry in the series yet!
","Having seen the previous four 'Mission Impossible' films, I have to admit that none of them impressed me to the degree that I had hoped. I guess my expectations for action thrillers centering on secret agents were set too high because I saw the 'Bourne' trilogy and Daniel Craig's James Bond films first. The first three 'MI' films all seemed a little too slow, cheesy or convoluted on my first viewing. The fourth one was pretty good, even if the story does feel a little forgettable<br/><br/>So, where does that bring me for the fifth entry of the franchise? My expectations were set at average around this time, despite all the good word-of-mouth I've been hearing. However, it wouldn't have mattered if my expectations were set around the same level for the latest 'Bourne' or James Bond film (very high) – 'MI:5' blew everything I'd expected from it and then some! <br/><br/>Where to begin? The film possible contains the biggest, and possibly best, story out if all the other installments. It is fascinatingly complex and dynamic – moving from country to country, dealing with characters who have questionable allegiances – all on top of Ethan Hunt trying to outrun the CIA while trying to get to the bottom of what the Syndicate really wants. It may seem like a lot, but the script is really well structured and paced. Even though the film does take a few liberties with how some of its characters will ultimately act in the end, the plot isn't nearly as predictable as one would make it out to be. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie also manages to squeeze in some surprisingly silly moments at the most random of moments.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this film are also some of the best in this franchise. Soon after showing Ethan Hunt take off on the side of an airbus, the film kicks it into overdrive and delivers an adrenaline rush packed with REALLY well done car chases, okay hand-to-hand combat scenes (they're kind of choppy), and ONE very suspenseful, pulse-pounding scene involving multiple snipers. McQuarrie's direction over the editing of these sequences is incredibly nuanced – so much so that I found myself repeatedly leaning over the edge of my seat with excitement.<br/><br/>People who weren't fans of the cheese factor (forced romances, convenient gadgets, and the overuse of face masks) of the previous films would be glad to know that it's been done away with in this film. And for people fearing that this is a film that takes itself too seriously, let me be one of the first to say: it doesn't. One may draw parallels between the events that have happened in this film to some of the recent events in our world, but I see it as a clever way for the franchise to keep up with our times.<br/><br/>'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is without a doubt one of the most exciting films I've had the pleasure of experiencing this year. It completely took me by surprise with how well-done it was, and should just about take anyone else to the same conclusion."
"kanona29","10","223","345","29 July 2015"," Thank You! A Must See!
","All I can say is Thank You!!! This is what I want to see when I go to the movies looking to enjoy a good summer blockbuster!!! Man, talk about a fun ride. It was humorous, exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise really gets it when it comes to entertaining your average moviegoer and he doesn't disappoint. But the truth is, no one disappoints in this summer flick. All parties brought their 'A' game and played their part perfectly. The female lead (Rebecca Ferguson) really held her own alongside Ethan Hunt and the crew and hopefully we'll see her in future installments, if there is more. Based on this current installment, there should definitely be more.<br/><br/>MI:1 is a classic in my eyes and I've watched it countless times, but I must say, Rogue Nation...well, it's a lot more fun and I do feel it is a better film overall. I will be watching this one again and again. And don't wait for it to come to video...this is a movie you must see in theaters for the full experience.<br/><br/>Also, let me just say the stunt sequences are thrilling...thrilling I say!! Very limited CGI in this film, which made the action scenes even more exciting and dare I say it again...thrilling! Lots of gasp worthy moments.<br/><br/>I won't give away any spoilers as that would ruin the exciting action sequences and fun twists. This is enjoyable from beginning to end. So just go see it!!!"
"themadmovieman","8","180","279","29 July 2015"," This franchise just keeps getting better and better!
","You would think that after five films this would have become a tired premise, but the way that it takes on the spy genre as both an intelligent espionage thriller as well as a big-budget blockbuster makes it even better than the new James Bond films. <br/><br/>It's exciting, slick, cool and fun, but this series, most of all in this film, has got an amazingly inexhaustible energy to it that makes it so brilliant.<br/><br/>Let's start, then, with the main attraction of this film: the action. Simply, it's stunning. There are five separate big action sequences here, each lasting around ten minutes more or less, and they are all high-octane thrill-rides that never let up and make this such an entertaining film.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise proves once again that he's a blockbuster star like no other, giving his all in the action here, whether it's attaching himself to a plane, jumping in a chasm of water or riding a superbike through the desert (in what was, in my opinion, the greatest, most exhilarating car chase ever).<br/><br/>On that note, actually, the incredible bike chase is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the great action, but credit has to go to director Christopher McQuarrie for excellently turning this into a good-looking and intense action thriller, using great camera work (avoiding shaky cam) to make it so brilliantly entertaining.<br/><br/>Away from the stunts, this film has still got a very good plot to it. There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish.<br/><br/>There are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be properly engrossed in the current story.<br/><br/>Finally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes that this is set in all over the world. <br/><br/>From the mesmerising desert of Morocco to the foggy alleys of London, this is a global journey that goes even further than the previous films, and comes out with a stunning result, the best of the series in my opinion!<br/><br/>www.themadmovieman.com"
"atlasmb","10","129","209","31 July 2015"," This Is What An Action Film Should Be
","I saw this film on an IMAX screen and I'm glad I did. Although IMAX cameras were not used in the filming, I think the larger screen creates a more immersive experience and the sound was spectacular. But this film would be great in any format.<br/><br/>""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" is one of the best action films I have ever seen. The story is clever and action packed. The photography is amazing and the music is fantastic.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the stunt work, especially that done by Tom Cruise himself. It did not disappoint. And the action and chase sequences are as exciting as any I have seen.<br/><br/>We can thank the writing for the well-defined and engaging characters. Some Bond films have villains that are rather cartoonish, but in MI:RN the danger feels real, helping to drive the suspense.<br/><br/>The female lead, Rebecca Ferguson, deserves special mention. Her portrayal of Ilsa Faust is a wonderful blend of intelligence, beauty and strength and definitely one of the best in any action film. I can only hope she shows up in the next installment. some of the credit goes to the writers who created the character.<br/><br/>In all, this film offers everything you want in an action film and deserves a ""10"" for its place in the genre."
"melcraig204","6","86","139","30 July 2015"," Seen it all before
","I'm a fan of Tom Cruise and really like the last movie in the franchise but I couldn't get over the feeling that I'd seen it all before. Every hair raising stunt, every corner Ethan Hunt is backed into you just know he's going to win. The movie itself was good but for me it seemed a little stale. The action sequences were huge and impressive but it just seems that Hunt is indestructible. He can ride one of the fastest super-bikes in the world and crash without a helmet and the guy doesn't even get a gravel rash! I know other people are loving it so don't let my lack of enthusiasm put you off going to the cinema to see it. It's certainly worth the ticked price."
"reubencherian","10","154","263","30 July 2015"," Mission ACCOMPOLISHED!
","Me and a friend again had the opportunity to see an early screening of the movie 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'. One word. Excellent. Everything about that movie was just perfect! It had the right amount of every element that would make a movie simply brilliant! This sequel for me, was definitely the best Mission movie yet. And at the same time it recalls so many details from the first mission impossible movie. And most of all the action. WOW. Every action scene in this movie was breath taking and there will be moments when you would just want to get up and start clapping. They did a good amount of the stunts without CGI and that will make you appreciate the action even more. Oh and if you thought that plane scene in the trailer was crazy, then you are in for a treat! When it comes to acting, Tom Cruise easily convinces us that he is a top notch agent of IMF(Impossible Mission Force). This time every member of the team has something to give in comparison to Ghost Protocol. Kudos to Simon Pegg for his impeccable timing for humor. And the villain was perfect! They made the villain perfect for the IMF and the ending of this movie is so satisfying. One of the few movies where the ending just pleases you so much. On the whole, Don't miss this movie!! Seriously.. Don't! It is a movie mean't to be watched by everyone!"

"guilhermeoc","9","99","169","30 July 2015"," Entertaining without being over the top!
","TL;DR: Visually stunning, action filled and down to earth action sequences (no over the top BS). Storyline with nice twists and pretty good for an action movie, though watching Ghost Protocol helps getting to know the IMF crew (there's no introduction this time around).<br/><br/>**spoiler-free**<br/><br/>Rogue Nation, like the latest movies in the franchise and others in the spy/action genre, starts with a small crew, with little support, against huge odds, having to deal with challenges that seem impossible (no pun intended). <br/><br/>What makes Rogue Nation better than most is that it makes it all plausible without super-human characters, crazy gizmos (except one that I shaw not mention, but it is not overused like in M:I II), and brilliantly made down-to-earth action sequences. The latest 007 movies are following the same ideals, but M:I has made a solid choice of supporting actors (specially Simon Pegg) that add a subtle layer of comedy and improvisation, which helps a lot into building some suspense in the audience - it feels like as if they are as clueless as we are of what is going to happen.<br/><br/>Another great aspect that sets this moving apart are the terrific action sequences which are paired with outstanding sound effects and music score (without spoiling, there is an entire action sequence that plays with this very aspect). Was lucky enough to watch a pre-screening on IMAX, and strongly recommend watching it on IMAX or a theater with a good audio setup. <br/><br/>The storyline, while not hard to follow, benefits from having watched at least Ghost Protocol, since key characters are back and lack some introduction, and the story somewhat picks from what took place in the last instance. Much like Ghost Protocol, the storyline packs some interesting twists and doesn't seem obvious - even though we all know that the good guys win, Rogue Nation adds some shady characters which are not as black and white, making for some interesting development.<br/><br/>Overall a highly entertaining movie, packed with stunning action sequences and a storyline that is well thought-out and manages to keep the audience hooked until the end. A solid addition to the franchise that keeps one-upping itself on every new release."

"prospectus_capricornium","9","105","185","30 July 2015"," Most Explosive MI, Yet.
","Even two hours won't be enough for ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'"" to be able to unravel all its exhilaratingly high-octane action and drama. This fifth installment in the franchise surges with death-defying action proceedings, riveting and pulsing with the relentlessness and explosiveness of its spiking adrenaline, to deliver the franchise's most thrilling outing, yet.<br/><br/>That relentlessness is true and screaming right at the opening sequence of the film, where IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), is seen dangling from the door of an airbus, already adrift in the air as it ascends even further to the skies. That's the first of too many, and you wouldn't care less of the logic behind such impossible knockout stunt demonstrations, because once the momentum crashes past the speedometer's limit, there's no other choice left but to get consumed by the electrifying influx of near-impossible action setpieces. This doesn't mean there's barely any sense to take in, in fact you would be awed to realize that in spite of its speed and strength-defying physicalities, characterizations are still working along the explosive chaos, and the behavior of the characters, and the emotional aspect of the narrative, still follows acceptable reasoning.<br/><br/>The whole of 'Rogue Nation' can be seen as Hunt's team desperate attempt to keep IMF running, and save it, and the world it intends to protect, from extinction. This time, the major figure of terror, is the mysterious organization, 'The Syndicate', headed by the despicably steel-fisted Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) . Ethan is joined by co-IMF agent, William Brandt (Jeremmy Renner), and suspicious British agent, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). The comic effort comes mostly from Hunt's sidekick, Benji (Simon Pegg), and Brandt, who spends most of the time running and chasing after the shadow-terrorist group, The Syndicate.<br/><br/>Much of the movie's strength emanates from its seemingly unstoppable delivery of edge-of-your-seat action, but you can't ignore the grandeur of its camera shots and the palatable efforts of its lead characters and supports. There's much to say about how inconsistent and illogical some of the narrative choices that the screenwritersn took are, but they get overshadowed by the more relevant, and on this case, more effectively utilized, high-tension action extravaganza.<br/><br/>One can inevitably notice how Cruise has aged through the franchise's almost two-decade history. He's more tired-looking here, but you can't question his commitment to the franchise. In 'Rogue Nation', he's definitely back, running after, and wrestling against, the equally desperate claws of 'The Syndicate'. He hops across the world to trump the enemy, and in every city, he inevitably gets himself involved in deadly strangulations. At such moments, cinematography is top notch, and the breathtaking panorama becomes an exquisite backdrop for the ever-imminent rumbles. This is where this installment is strongest and most engaging, a strength that should warrant a sixth outing."

","Quite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable. That being said, this movie is everything you can expect it to be.

As for acting: Rebecca Ferguson's lovely, Simon Pegg'g good, Ving Rhames Jeremy Renner and Simon McBurney are adequate for their characters, and Tom Cruise... well he's the way he is, if you love him you'll love him here and if he annoys you... ;) All in all it's an action movie and if that's what you expect than you surely won't be disappointed."
"robybaggio18","4","93","188","2 August 2015"," Don't believe the hype, the worst sequel by far
","Saw it in the theater yesterday, couldn't wait for it to finish. Became very boring half way through, the plot is just childish and lacks any credibility or seriousness. I know this should be a no-brain summer flick, but M:I films always go for the shocks and suspense. It was non-existent here, the lack of any seriousness meant that nothing really moved me. Even the high-profile figure being assassinated didn't really mean anything because it seems that the whole world forgot about it the second after it happened. <br/><br/>The first film had a somewhat complicated plot, a few really breathtaking scenes and Tom Cruise young enough to deliver a fresh performance. The second film had a really silly plot, but the no- CGI motorcycle chase scene and Limp Bizkit soundtrack at least created some legacy. The third installment had a forgettable plot, but a really convincing bad guy played by the late Mr. Hoffman. The fourth film was silly enough, but the Burj Khalifa stunts made by Tom Cruise really stood out. This sequel has none of that. It relies purely on CGI and no plot development, it seems like characters jump from place to place without any motive or any explanation. I am aware of the fact that this lazy approach sells tickets these days, but in order to have a mission impossible really be a mission impossible it needs to have a context where it really seems serious and impossible. People who watched the first sequel remember that the Langley heist was introduced to the audience, planning was made and execution was slow, but exciting. This director could not deliver any of that. <br/><br/>I hope they stop now, I guess in the next sequel they could go into space or make Tom Cruise might fight a tiger in a cage. Even if he does it will be a CGI tiger, or a CGI Tom Cruise. In a CGI cage, with CGI blood.<br/><br/>Big disappointment, really."
"gianlucamarzano16","10","67","134","31 July 2015"," Best MI yet.
","Mission impossible Rouge Nation is directed by Christopher McQuarrie and stars Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg. Most of the time when a series gets to its fifth movie, they ether have to reboot it some way or its just very bad but the mission impossible is not doing that, it is improving and getting better and better. Rouge nation might be the best MI movie yet, what makes it so great is that it takes parts of the other movies and puts them together. Rouge Nation adds more humor, more gadgets, more suspense, more everything. The acting was fantastic by everyone. Tom Cruise was amazing and the fact that he does all his stunts, just makes him one of the best action stars today. Simon Pegg stands out a lot in this one, they gave him more screen time, which is great because the chemistry between Cruise and Pegg is also great. The action was incredible and you could tell the actors were very doing it. Overall Rouge Nation was amazing and improved in everything. The action and acting was fantastic. Definitely needs to be seen in IMAX."
"ohyeahmeow","9","21","37","29 August 2015"," Rebecca Ferguson , excellent choice !!!
","Unlike most overly beautiful actresses, Rebecca has an everyday beautiful face if I just only look at her. As she places those ugly, vagina shaped pumps on the table at her first scene and interrogates Tom Cruise with her Russian accent, I thought she was just some chick in a scene. As soon as the actions come on, the way she acts, the way she moves then comes her classy English accent, I could not take my eyes off her through the entire film. She is so hauntingly sexy. What a perfect cast! Really, Tom Cruise did us proud by casting Rebecca Ferguson. Perfection! I also thought not only Rogue Nation using the iconic scene from Casablanca from the same name Ilsa to her timeless dress as a fashion statement from the 40s, Rebecca Ferguson also looks so much resemblant to Ingrid Bergman. The movie is done so creatively from plotting to action. It's to me the best out of all Mission Impossibles."

"PartyMouse","6","71","147","4 August 2015"," Here we go again... again
","I remember when I first saw this film in theaters and the lights dimmed the first thought that ran through my head was ""Here we go again"" as I released an involuntary sigh of apathy. Somewhere along the line, before seeing this latest installment, I had decided to re-watch the original four films and realized that the character of Ethan Hunt really has no defining characteristics beyond just basically being Tom Cruise. This bothered me for some reason. Jason Bourne was a fully fleshed out character and even the new Bond films had added newer elements to give a traditionally stereotypical character more depth and complexity, but Ethan Hunt is just...bland. He has no personality. What seemed even stranger to me was the fact that Mission Impossible was supposed to revolve around a team, yet Tom Cruise is seemingly always the only one who ever does anything. So basically these films boil down to watching Tom Cruise perform his own stunts, which I will admit are extremely impressive, especially in this latest escapade. However the plots of all five films are basically nonsense to try and connect each elaborate stunt to the next. Then I realized that all 5 films have remarkably similar story lines as well. Tom Cruise has a mission, something goes wrong, he goes rouge, needs to find some kind of MacGuffin, the villain is some kind of terrorist arms dealer, insert random forgettable love interest here, big stunts, the end.<br/><br/>that being said, the film's action scenes are amazing, and really make you question the sanity of Cruise, who needlessly continues to insist on doing all of his stunts. Basically it's another Tom Cruise Hollywood blockbuster, which at the end of the day made me finally realize, ""Why was I ever expecting anything else in the first place?"""
"crybabystinkypoo","5","47","95","9 August 2015"," Mission mediocrity
","Ho hum; seen it all before. I don't understand why people seem so enamoured by this. It's like a made for TV James Bond on a bad day. Ethan Hunt isn't interesting. IMF isn't interesting. The first half was okay, but it soon degenerated into mediocrity. Too many characters, too many locations; no central focus or essential core. It wasn't really about anything. And the end; what a cop out. The writers just had to find a way to finish it; it felt rushed. I was bored with this film; it really wasn't great. And like MI:3 the music sucked; just noise pollution. Were any of the Mission Impossible movies ever that good? I don't think so. Just another movie to soon be forgotten about. Watch James Bond instead. Mission mediocrity."

","Fifth movie in the Mission Impossible franchise has Ethan Hunt & IMF friends trying to stop a mysterious group known as the Syndicate, despite the IMF being shut down by the government and Ethan being wanted by the CIA. Enjoyable actioner but there's not much new here. Tom Cruise continues to prove he's one of the more consistent stars out there as he always seems to put out solid popcorn movies and occasionally something more than that. The supporting cast is good, with Simon Pegg stealing every scene he's in and Rebecca Ferguson as the attractive assassin who saves Tom throughout the movie. Is she good or is she bad? Will you care? Ving Rhames gets little to do. Sean Harris plays the forgettable villain. Alec Baldwin is the red herring who, along with Jeremy Renner, seems almost unnecessary in making this work. The action is solid and the humor (mostly from Pegg) is appreciated. I have to say that this is not my favorite Mission Impossible movie or even top three. There's something nondescript about it all, similar to the last film. At least the first three each had something about them that was memorable. Now it seems the series is satisfied just putting out a solid action thriller with more focus on stunts than characters, plot, or even style. Watchable for fans but really nothing special."
"kdavies-69347","7","10","16","18 November 2015"," A good action flick. Not the worst entry in the series.
","I officially watched all of these films back to back (yes, I have no life) to get a feel for the overall Mission Impossible story-line. I actually enjoyed this one much more than a few of the other entries in the series.<br/><br/>In terms of action, it's packed right from the get go! The stunts that they used in this film are unbelievable. Of course everyone was talking about the opening scene with the aircraft that was used in the trailer, but it doesn't end there. That's literally just the beginning. So if action is what you want, that's what you'll get. It could have benefited from less CGI in the driving sequences, but they're fun to watch (II and III are much worse by comparison).<br/><br/>The plot line by itself is a bit convoluted, as they were trying to emphasize the spy vs spy story-line that can be expected from every Mission Impossible film. The dialogue is also fairly complex to follow, which makes the storyline even harder to follow. The 'doublespeak' they used was pretty confusing to say the least, which has become the trend in most politically themed films. It doesn't ruin the film, but you don't watch something like this for the story. It kinda feels like they were going for a plot twist moment in every block of dialogue, which just ruins a storyline for me.<br/><br/>And of course there is Tom Cruise. The seminal character that links all of these films together. He does a good job of maintaining the character of Ethan Hunt throughout the series, but in this entry into the series, this his him at his most over-the-top. Tom Cruise did some pretty great action sequences, and it paid off. I won't say anything negative about the actor himself, but I respect his stunt performances, driving ability, and what he brought into this film as an actor. Simon Pegg had some fairly decent dramatic moments, (and he even has a fight sequence!!!). Most of the previous characters from the other Mission films return to bring a sense of unity to the series.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for some pretty amazing action, check it out. If you want an incredible spy film, this isn't it.<br/><br/>7/10"
"MessMaker","10","45","93","29 July 2015"," An awesome experience!
","My most anticipated movie of this year and luckily enough, I had the pleasure... the utmost pleasure of watching it at an advance screening! Loving Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol so much that I'd given it a near perfect rating, I was skeptical and expecting at least a bit of a letdown as I simply couldn't see how they'd top that. Also, I had only limited myself to 2 trailers as I already felt I knew far too much, which only increased my anxiety. Still, I couldn't help but have expectations; my excitement level had peaked before even going into the cinema!<br/><br/>And the movie surpassed my expectations; just blew me away... multiple times. The best elements from all the previous four films are adapted and have been vastly improved upon.<br/><br/>Sean Harris is the antagonist and he does a fantastic job of it. Cruel, mysterious, calculating, manipulating, menacing... just evil to the point that Hunt is at the end of his wits, feeling helpless. His luck seems to be running out... his skills, his way of operating, all his usual tricks and methods - they've all been exhausted and you are actually scared for him!<br/><br/>The way this movie is presented to us, the audience, we aren't just viewing it; it's made to feel just as much of an experience. That's how the whole film is and I am in awe of the ingenuity. Just when you think you've got it all figured out - how the scene and then the movie are gonna play out, it twists & turns and throws you off. And then, in the back of your mind, whilst taking in all of this unexpected awesomeness, you're off again... trying to figure out where that shot and the entire film is headed. It just takes you on an exhilarating ride. For the most part, the movie feels so perfectly realistic even with all the crazy awesomeness going on. And I love how unpredictable it was.<br/><br/>In regards to the characters in general - actions taken by them, the pieces of dialogue they speak with everything occurring in the background and taking into consideration everything that has happened so far you find yourself being uncertain what their motivations and intentions are, what they're thinking, what they are going to do next, what's going to happen, what's the plan, etcetera etcetera – every character; not just the new ones but even the previously established ones. That is how exceptional the performances are, in tune with the direction of the story... the entire cast has their A game on!<br/><br/>Also, there's a lot of humour, scattered all over the movie and that makes the movie more fun. There is development, too, with most of the characters - especially Hunt.<br/><br/>The action in the movie is just insane... they went all out! From stunts to fight sequences and chases - absolutely sensational; it's like you're feeling every hit and every move. The whole scene where Tom Cruise actually clings onto the door of a plane while it's taking off - my heart was racing so fast. It was very well shot and the fact that he actually performed the insane stunt adds to the feeling; CGI just cannot compare. This intensity and excitement is constant throughout the movie, on some level. Also, Tom Cruise is riding a motorcycle once again and it is sweeeeeeeeeeeet! There's a scene of him running, as well, as usual.<br/><br/>The cinematography is just spectacular and quite literally breathtaking throughout the film. Be it action sequences, landscape, anything... there's amazing wide-angle shots, there's POV shots that feel like you're really there, the whole lot. The movie looks and feels so great.<br/><br/>The gadgets and gear in this movie are unreal! I don't mean they are unrealistic; they are believable in a very plausible-in-the-future way, creative and incredible. <br/><br/>There's more than a few things going on in the movie, yet none of it feels forced or unnecessary and it all works together very well. It runs at a tense, thrilling and suspenseful pace - in an enjoyable way. Not a single moment is wasted; every scene on the screen is essential and every shot is impeccably acted, directed and delivered. I could go on & on about how every little aspect of the film was awesome, but to conclude, I loved it all.<br/><br/>Also, TOM CRUISE IS A GODDAMN LEGEND!"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","25","48","29 July 2015"," Today is the day the IMF's luck runs out...
","I've discovered a pattern with the Mission: Impossible films that I like: it's the odd numbered ones, as I think the first is still the best, found the second one average, really liked the third, and then hate-watched the fourth due to it crossing the line into sci-fi territory too much for my liking and wasting Léa Seydoux, among other things. I found Ghost Protocol was so overrated and cartoonish, I'd have rather rewatched M:I 2 again. After seeing this latest installment, I'd have to rank the films as follows (from best to worst): 1, 3, 5, 2 and lastly 4. A good thing about the films is each one's more or less standalone (with some connections from film to film in the last few). With each new director, they've put their own stamp on the franchise, some faring better than others. Thankfully, I found this one less boring/forgettable than the last. While Rogue Nation certainly doesn't match Brian DePalma's original classic spy thriller movie or J.J. Abrams' exciting but emotional third film, it is certainly better than the other two. <br/><br/>The gist of this film is Ethan Hunt and his team taking on the Syndicate, an International rogue organisation committed to destroying the IMF. The opening features Tom Cruise, as Hunt, performing his own death-defying stunt, climbing on the outside of a flying plane without the use of special effects or a stunt double...so it's easy to see why he apparently injured himself 6 times during the making of the movie. Although this scene has been heavily promoted, Cruise deserves all the credit he's getting for performing it. Say what you will about him, he at least puts LOTS of effort in - which is appreciated in these days of heavy reliance on CGI. Those put off the M:I movies simply because of the craziness that is Tom Cruise should give this one a chance. He's also, from time to time, actually *good* in things, and the M:I movies are an example of him at his best. Not to be outdone, Simon Pegg (along with Cruise) performs his own driving stunts - which, when you see them, is quite the feat. There's also what we've come to expect from Cruise in these movies: him running, on a motorcycle (though not running *on* a motorcycle...at least not yet), without a shirt, and having a shout-y moment.<br/><br/>After the thrilling opening sequence, the following scene involving Hunt, a character simply credited as 'Record Shop Girl' and the film's baddie (who's not up to Philip Seymour Hoffman in M:I 3 standard, but is at least more menacing/memorable than M:I 4's bad guy) is surprisingly effective on an emotional level, given that Hunt and the girl only share a brief exchange. It's remembering to give the film these character moments that helps elevate it from being just non-stop action sequences with no heart. The scene is also important in regards to near the end of the film, and consequently the payoff is quite satisfying. While I felt Simon Pegg's Benji character was a bit overused in the last film, and relied too heavily upon for laughs, I think this movie - while still heavily featuring him - dialed things back a notch and allowed the character to have some strong character beats amongst all the funny lines/moments. One could say that the 'bromance' between Hunt and Benji is the emotional core of this film. Both actors are believable with the friendship they convey, and it's nice to see Pegg given some genuinely dramatic moments to play. <br/><br/>For Jeremy Renner fans, his character doesn't do much in the first half of this film besides trying to remain loyal to both Hunt and the agency he works for (although he has some humorous moments with Alec Baldwin's Hunley). It's in the second half that Brandt gets in on the action, along with fan favourite, Luther. At least Ving Rhames gets to do more here than the last film. Of particular note is the new addition of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, making one hell of an impression in her introductory scene). Apparently she was 'unanimously the second choice for the role, as the studio, Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie liked her work on The White Queen' (which I too have seen and really enjoyed her in)...so I guess we can thank Jessica Chastain for declining the role first offered to her, as Ferguson proves she's more than fit for the part. Ilsa has it all, she's intelligent, mysterious, deadly, cuts quite the fine figure in the yellow dress she wears on a mission to the Vienna Opera (but remembering to remove her high heels when hitting leg it mode - or rather, having Hunt remove them *for* her) and, above all else, can kick all sorts of arse (whether it be hand-to-hand combat with knives or without, sniping, or riding a motorcycle in a high speed chase) whilst looking credible doing it. She more than holds her own against Cruise's Hunt and is a far more fleshed-out character than others who have come before (save for perhaps Michelle Monaghan's Julia - who I also enjoyed). With her ability to do action sequences believably, look amazing and actually *act*, Ferguson's the whole package. Both her character and her dynamic she develops with Hunt are complex, and she virtually steals the film.<br/><br/>While I think the franchise reached its peak with M:I 3, this film comes pretty close to matching it - which is quite surprising, considering most franchises tend to peter out by the third film in the series. Rogue Nation includes the best elements from some of the previous films - action, intrigue, humour, tense moments and heart - all rolled into one, and it's not too long. The inevitable next installment is going to find it hard to live up to this film, but so long as they bring back the main players from this one, it might not be...impossible."
"prabhat_kataria","1","59","127","30 July 2015"," Action Overkill, holed up plot, mediocre script...all in all felt like they should have given it more time.
","When it comes to entertainment, Tom Cruise is the one guy you can count on. His last release, Edge of Tomorrow, is a spectacular example of intelligent entertainment, with not a dull or lifeless moment in it. The last MI was the best action flick of the year. The reason it worked so well was that none of the action was forced and everything seemed to be in a flow. <br/><br/>Not so much in this one. Even the most publicized stunt, with Cruise hanging on the airplane in mid-air seemed too hurried and poorly executed.<br/><br/>The plot seemed repeated and predictable.IMF in trouble, Ethan is the lone wolf..the one man army, throw a sexy female agent and a villain who talks funny, too many Beemers, multiple intelligence agencies with secrets of their own, and there you have it !<br/><br/>The only thing constant in the film was its flaws. Hunt running down a narrow pathway while a guy shoots him from behind with a machine gun from point blank range and ...guess what. Misses! The same with the bike chase scene. Too forced and too clichéd. The casting was pretty much the same. New women, same guys, a villain so big that he controls major international happenings and disasters, can start wars with his actions, yet personally goes to murder a movie store clerk cum IMF sub agent while exposing himself to the 'living manifestation of destiny' ( cant believe that was an actual piece of dialog, uttered by the wasted Alec Baldwin).<br/><br/>The only standout was Simon Pegg as Benji ' when the cuss am i gonna get to wear a mask' Dunn. The action in some scenes was mindblowing. The underwater scene was done well. Rest all ranged from mediocre to rubbish.<br/><br/>McQuarrie and Cruise have had some fruitful collaborations in the past. Edge of tomorrow, Valkyrie, Jack Reacher all good movies. MI5 is the odd one out i guess. <br/><br/>Hope they come up with something new next time, not like this recycled James Bond wannabe mediocre-fest."

Big frigging deal why is that everyone's high point. It was 2 hours and 10 mins too long should of been a 1 hour 25 min movie. Was so drawn out. There was laughable scenes when cruise gets out of the car that had just flipped 10 times at 100mph. When he crashed the motorcycle with no helmet at 120mph he gets up with no damage like the terminator after being shot 20 times. <br/><br/>Save your money unless you get a buy one get one movie pass like I did. My chick and I walked out 1hr and 35 mins in. We couldn't take it anymore. The audience actually laughed a few times during this. Why? There was no comedy in this. A monotone bore. The first hour not 1 action scene after the stupid plane one in the beginning. I went out to a rock concert after that was more entertaining than this drivel. Some others walked out as well. The only good thing was the sour cream and chive popcorn and the fact the theater sells alcohol to numb the pain of this movie. San Andreas was better. On that note I'm off to play Xbox 360.

"JamesHitchcock","6","4","5","2 February 2018"," Time for a Rethnk?
","""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is the fifth instalment in the long-running ""Mission: Impossible"" series. It shows the obvious influence of the even-longer-running Bond series. All the films in these two franchises involve Our Hero, named either James Bond or Ethan Hunt, travelling around the world with a glamorous female sidekick to various exotic foreign locations, performing various feats of improbable (not to say impossible) derring-do in an attempt to thwart the evil schemes of some dastardly individual or organisation. <br/><br/>""Rogue Nation"" fits this template more or less exactly. Hunt, accompanied by his glamorous female sidekick Ilsa Faust, travels to Minsk, Vienna, Havana, Morocco and London, performing various feats of derring-do along the way, in an attempt to thwart the evil schemes of the Syndicate, a mysterious terrorist group. Those schemes include the assassination of various world leaders, including the Austrian Chancellor and the British Prime Minister. As the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise is an American one, London counts as an exotic foreign location in a way in which it does not in the Bond series. <br/><br/>In some respects ""Rogue Nation"" parallels recent developments in the Bond cycle. In early Bonds it was generally easy to tell who was on what side- Bond, his MI6 colleagues and the lovely Bond Girl were all on the side of right and justice whereas the villains (Dr No, Blofeld, Goldfinger, etc.) and their henchmen were first into bat for Satan's kingdom. Occasionally, as with Pussy Galore in ""Goldfinger"", the Bond Girl started off working for the baddies, but inevitably changed sides (aided by Bond's powers of seduction) when she realised just what a bastard her employer really was. <br/><br/>In more recent episodes, however, Bond has had to cope with inter-service rivalry between MI5 and MI6, former British agents going over to the dark side and colleagues who prove untrustworthy. So it proves in ""Rogue Nation"". Hunt has to do battle not only against the Syndicate but also against the CIA, who want to shut down the IMF whose agents are regarded as unreliable. (In this context ""IMF"" stands not for ""International Monetary Fund"" but ""Impossible Mission Force""). The head of the Syndicate, Solomon Lane, turns out to be a rogue British agent (just like the characters played by Sean Bean in ""Goldeneye"" and Javier Bardem in ""Skyfall""). And Hunt never knows whom he can trust- not even the lovely Ilsa and his friend colleague Benji Dunn. (Ilsa, despite her German-sounding name, is also an MI6 agent). <br/><br/>One difference between the ""Mission: Impossible"" series and the Bonds is that, although the series has been going for over twenty years, the main character has been played by the same actor throughout. Tom Cruise was 53 when ""Rogue Nation"" was made and I understand that he will return in a sixth instalment later this year, making him, at 56, older than either Sean Connery or Roger Moore when they made their final Bonds. In 2015, however, Cruise still looked youthful enough to be plausible as the hero of an action thriller, and I doubt if the intervening three years will have made much difference in this respect when ""Mission: Impossible"" emerges. Rebecca Ferguson makes a lovely heroine and there is a good cameo from Alec Baldwin as the CIA boss, although Sean Harris as Lane never seems very threatening, more like a provincial bank manager than a rogue spy or international terrorist.<br/><br/>As a thriller, in fact, ""Rogue Nation"" is quite a decent one with some good special effects and well-handled action scenes. It does, however, have two problems, which it shares with a number of recent spy films involving betrayal or double-dealing. The first is that the plot at times becomes so complex it can be difficult to understand. The second is that plots of this nature are starting to become over-familiar; increasing complexity seems to increase, rather than decrease, the feeling of ""seen-it-all=before"". Perhaps it is time for a rethink of the modern spy genre. 6/10<br/><br/>A goof. The Austrian Chancellor is referred to as a ""European head of state"". In fact, the Austrian Chancellor, like the British Prime Minister, is Head of Government but not Head of State. The Head of Sate of Austria is the President."
"autisticreviewers","9","29","58","29 July 2015"," One of the most memorable experiences we've ever had at a theater!
","We were dying to see what the critics had to see about the fifth instalment of Mission Impossible 5. We heard and received great things from so many critics about this movie. However, is it all true? Read this to find out! This movie is directed by Christopher Mcquarrie,(who also directed Jack Reacher and did the screenplay for Edge Of Tomorrow.) He has this certain style that he brings to the big screen! Very unique we might add! Her brings you action, and suspense all at the same time! But, the question is, does he bring it here? The answer is: You bet your butt he does! <br/><br/>The movie wastes no time into making action happen! In fact, it happens in 32 seconds as soon as the movie starts! Yes, we timed it! Immediately we are in for one of the best stunt/action scenes we have seen at the theatre. Yep, you guessed it, Tom Cruise on top of an aeroplane and hanging on for dear life! So straight away you know what type of a film you'll be watching all the way through! The plot of the film is very simple, and yet pretty thrilling. ""Eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF."" Mission sounds Impossible, right? Well, not when Tom cruise (Ethan Hunt) is on board! A very high skilled, trained, beautiful woman by the name of Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) gets involved in all of this mess. She is just like Ethan, knows fight moves, knows how to shoot, knows every move! However, while you are watching...you will start to wonder whether or not you should feel sorry for her or to hate her. She's one of those characters/people that just keeps changing sides until we don't know how to think anymore! <br/><br/>The villain, portrayed by Sean Harris is both creepy, and extremely intimidating. This time around the villain has a background...you know what he has done, what he is capable of, and what happens if you refuse to comply with him. This is part of the reason why Ghost Protocol failed a little bit (in my books), because that villain was not properly explained and had very little screen time, therefor, it just made me not care! But this time, the villain is explained and done properly. Keep a look out for a side villain by the name of ""The Bone Doctor."" He will scare the living poo out of you! This movie has everything you need! Fighting, shooting, car chases, thrilling under water sequences, plane scenes, fighting in an opera theater what more could you ask for? We will end this review by saying, that on a sad note, this movie had one of the rushed endings. Just as everything was going perfect it failed at the ending. It's like, everyone got tired and they just went ""screw it, everyone is tired...let's end it here."" We looked around and the theatre were shrugging and weird looks on their faces as if to say ""that's it?"" So don't be expecting a Fight scene between Sean Harris and Tom Cruise...they were too lazy to put it in there. <br/><br/>Apart from that...the movie is just perfect! We would say this is the best Mission Impossible movie to date! Highly recommended! We gave this a 9/10! -The Autistic Reviewers<br/><br/>Check us out on facebook!"
"captainmike-michael","9","18","34","1 August 2015"," Entertaining, Surprising and On Par with MI4
","This action-spy franchise follows the trend of Fast and Furious, to be more specific in terms of its smart and thrilling screenplay that keeps improving from one installment to another. Director Christopher McQuarrie has another amazing team up with Tom Cruise after Edge of Tomorrow, not only delivering an exciting thriller well balanced by suspense, actions and humors at the right moment, but also the fun, shrewd and metaphorical dialogues throughout the entire film. The well structured plot helps a lot in full character developments of all the cast while the chemistry between Cruise and Ferguson is excellent which enables the audiences to feel the interpersonal engagement and teamwork spirit in completing the impossible mission. Joe Kraemer does well in composing the scores by mixing the MI theme into different style of musics while the action sequences are captured in great cinematography angle and in a variety of shootings, hand combats and vehicles chasing. The twisting at climax and the surprising way to end the fate of the impossible villain are presented at a perfect pacing, leading this installment as the bridge connection to potentially expand further and deeper."

","Went to see it last night, after looking forward to it, but unfortunately I have to say that it is probably one of the worst MI films to date!<br/><br/>The film virtually has no storyline that you can follow or make any sense from, relies on ludicrous stunts and action sequences and seem to full of more technobabble than an ST:TNG episode!<br/><br/>Acting, whatever there was, was wooden and one dimensional. Even Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt's bright shiny teeth couldn't save this film, you would have thought all he to do was smile and the villains would have been stunned, job done! Simon Pegg tried pull of a straight role, but seemed to look blank as confused as much as the audience. The film's main villain, was typically one dimensional, all he needed was a cloak and evil laugh then he was set.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I cannot delete the film from my memory as easy they did with the stolen data.<br/><br/>Also looks like we have another MI film to look forward to, looks like Tom Cruise is trying to beat Hugh Jackman's & Robert Downey Jnr's record for playing the same character in film series, unlike them he has to rely sacrificing a decent storyline to do it.<br/><br/>Just another excuse to get as much blood out of the stone while they can."
"chesterg-67852","1","52","117","4 August 2015"," A Waste of Time and Money
","Saw the movie last Saturday, we both fell asleep during parts of the film. The length was too long and the dialog nearly incomprehensible. A terrible end to what was a good set of sequels. The opening scene was too staged and no clearly defined plot. Was that goof ball trying to open the doors did he not know Russian and on a mission inside of Russia! Unbelievable to say the least and not suspenseful or exciting in any form. The dialog between actors was so stilted as to be boring which causes us to nod off more than once during the film. MI in the past were not only exciting but kept you in suspense until nearly the very end, none of that this time around."
"craig-hopton","6","9","15","26 December 2015"," Decent but not one of the best MI movies
","This is another decent addition to the Mission Impossible series but it wasn't one of the best. It's missing the two most important ingredients:<br/><br/>1. Interesting characters, especially bad guys (think Vanessa Redgrave in MI or Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3). I hate to say it but Tom Cruise is easily the best actor in Rogue Nation.<br/><br/>2. Thrilling set-pieces (the break-in scene from MI, or the skyscraper scene from Ghost Protocol). Rogue Nation's underwater security hack just didn't quite cut it for me.<br/><br/>Aside from that, it is a perfectly good spy/action flick. The fights are good. Ethan Hunt and Lane (the bad guy) keep outwitting each other in a pretty decent plot.<br/><br/>But it didn't grip me like some of the other MI movies have."

"Troy_Campbell","8","12","22","1 August 2015"," Exhilarating and hard-hitting.
","I don't care what Tom Cruise's religious beliefs are. I don't care if he acted like a pork chop on Oprah. I don't care if the tabloids love to hate him. The Cruiser is a one-of-a-kind megastar responsible for a consistently excellent output of work since the eighties. Back for his fifth impossible mission at the spritely age of 53, he's showing no signs of slowing down either. The ridiculous pre-credits aircraft stunt, where Cruise hangs on to the side of an Airbus A400 whilst it takes off, attests to that. There's also a thrilling car-and-motorbike sequence (bringing back memories of the awesome Bourne Supremacy car chase) that sees Cruise commit to most of the high-speed driving/riding himself. It's this willingness to go above and beyond, as well as a preference of practical effects over CGI, which imbues Rogue Nation with nail biting tension and non-stop exhilaration. Not as stylish as J.J. Abrams (M:I3) or Brad Bird (M:I4), writer-director Christopher McQuarrie brings a hard-hitting brutality to the screen instead, arguably delivering the most violent entry in the franchise. McQuarrie's script is suitably meaty too, giving the cast plenty to chew on when not performing death defying acts, pummelling each other without remorse or manoeuvring in an assassination showdown. Cruise is reliably sensational as top dog and newcomers Rebecca Ferguson and Sean Harris are fantastic as, respectively, the femme fatale and unrelenting villain, but Jeremy Renner looks bored and Simon Pegg overeggs it on occasion. With ballsy action scenes that pack a punch and a gritty story to keep you excited, this is definitely worth forking out your hard earned to experience on the big screen."
"shadowtramp","5","18","36","3 August 2015"," Do not recommend
","My problems are mainly three.<br/><br/>1. This movie is like good old pron with the story: ""main characters"" do some talks and pull some faces just to walk to another room and do their ""job"" there. In MI5 main characters mostly do the same. All the clever talks and all the clever plot is just a mean to link action scenes.<br/><br/>2. You may say, that it was always the same with MI series. Well, almost. This time actors do not play at all, except for Pegg. Simon Pegg is the only main actor who performs and does his job great. Cruise just pull one of the two faces. One being of knowing smile, the other - of great worry. And both suck.<br/><br/>3. One could probably enjoy MI5 as much, as, say, F&F series. But the action scenes aren't great either. If you have seen trailer, you've seen the best one. The problem with the action scenes is that all of them end stupid.<br/><br/>I will not do nitpicking about plausibility of stunts. But this time MI came close to being comics screen adaptation. And that's bad. Not here, not there.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time and money."
"writekelvin","10","2","2","12 July 2018"," Pulls off the Impossible by being better than all the rest that came before it!
","Christopher Macquarie has written and directed the most tightly-plotted and incredible in this successful franchise. It's no surprise that he is the only director that has been invited back to script and direct the next one as well. <br/><br/>Mission Impossible pits Ethan Hunt against an enemy that is cold, calculative and brilliant. And to watch the cat and mouse game played out between the two makes for a tense and thrilling time at the movies. The ending is better than the previous installments because it is not over-the-top, but rather it comes down to a clever examination of what makes Ethan Hunt fundamentally different from his enemy at the core of their values. What is perceived as Ethan's weakness (of caring too much about his team) actually becomes the master-stroke in how he manages to defeat his most cunning enemy. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation gives us one of the best villains in the spy thriller genre, not to mention one of the best female characters who is complex and keeps us guessing to the end. Highly recommended!"
"ChristianLeFeuvre","8","2","2","23 May 2017"," A good addition to the series
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and team take on another seemingly impossible mission, tracking down the Syndicate - a highly skilled international rogue organisation, committed to destroying the IMF. This is the fifth entry in a franchise that began almost twenty years ago and all the MI films have offered memorable action and 'Rogue Nation' doesn't disappoint, from its opening plane stunt, a fight scene played out in the Vienna Opera House, a frantic car/bike chase within the narrow streets of Morocco (which are all brilliantly tense and exciting), however the one scene that failed to impress as much was the underwater vault scene. But it feels like we've been here before.... face masks, double agents, a weak villain and the 'disavowed' team proving their worth. I seriously thought this film was going to beat Ghost Protocol, judging by all the reviews, but it didn't. Ghost Protocol still remains as the best Mission Impossible film in the series in my opinion. The Bottom Line..action-packed, adventurous and entertaining, if slightly longer than it needed to be. 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation' is a good addition to the series."
"Donnie_Quixotic","4","24","51","30 July 2015"," Rogue Against Imagination
","I've come to the conclusion that I'm asking for too much with these big budget Hollywood franchises. I go in (into an actual movie theater... old- school, I know) hoping to see interesting characters embroiled in a compelling, life-threatening situation, with some laughs and cries on the way, but more often than not -- especially of late -- I come away empty.<br/><br/>The overall plot is one you could steal from any spy movie of the last fifty or sixty years. The ""MacGuffin"" (which is movie-speak for the thing every character in the movie wants, thus motivating the characters and driving the plot forward), is a USB stick with a bank balance or something on it (it really doesn't matter). In older spy movies it was the microfilm, and this thing is no different; it's just the crucial information is in digital format rather than on a small piece of film. Pretty uninteresting stuff I know, given we've seen it a thousand times before. I'm not even asking for a MacGuffin in the style of the Ark of the Covenant, as that wouldn't be appropriate for a spy flick (well maybe), but surely these professional writers and movie executives can think of something to pique more interest. Anyway it's of no real consequence, as it just provides enough of a plot thread to dangle the all-important action sequences on. And these sequences become increasingly tedious as the film goes on. Oddly, they chose to open with a bang and finish with a whimper. Normally, filmmakers would save the best for last but this movie was attempting to reverse the playbook. All the previous sequences were better than the ending. Sure, we've seen the motorcycle sequence done a million times before, but we've also seen the ending a million times before -- sigh... the ticking time bomb... again... really???<br/><br/>Maybe if I'd cared more for the characters I'd be more invested in their fate, but they're completely hollowed out. You could interchange any of the characters and it wouldn't matter because they all sound the same. In saying that, most of the dialogue is plain and perfunctory i.e. ""Where's so and so?"", ""Where's the thing?"", ""Are you okay?"", ""How do we get the thing?"" -- there's nothing delineating any real character traits, or anything remotely interesting. It's purely plot-driving dialogue. Sure the characters have different technical abilities, but who cares what their occupation or skill is compared to the personality they bring to the drama? Was Ving Rhames even necessary? Was Jeremy Renner?<br/><br/>I realized early on that they'd thrown out any element of realism, as the good guys are invincible, and the bad guys are as dumb as playing an espionage video game on the easiest setting. This throws out any sense of danger, and removes any real suspense. Speaking of suspense, it wasn't more than five or ten minutes before Tom Cruise is seen drowning that we saw Rebecca Ferguson looking at her watch after holding her breath underwater in her Casablanca pool. I'm not trying to say how perceptive I am as it was unbelievably obvious. But throughout the whole diving scene I was waiting for him to drown, and then have Rebecca come in and save him. It was telegraphed so amateurishly that all suspense was removed. Traditionally there's supposed to be a large gap of time so the audience forgets that one of the characters has this special ability that can save a person in a particular situation. I was like, ""Unless there's another underwater scene (which is highly unlikely), Tom's gonna drown here, and the strong, independent, female character is going to save him. Thus reversing the trope of the man always saving the woman."" Yep, this isn't getting predictable at all. I'm completely progressive in my philosophy, and I love Ellen Ripley and Clarice Starling, as well as many other really interesting and strong female characters, but the filmmakers could at least disguise these newly adopted Hollywood tropes so that they're not telegraphed to a degree that even the visually impaired can see them.<br/><br/>The tone of the film seemed off to me, too: it pulls its punches in the action and drama department, choosing to go cartoon and cutesy, over gritty realism, which is fine, but how about those character scenes? I mean if you're not going to go hard-boiled in the action and drama, surely you can afford some goofball character scenes: like scenes where they're drunk and embarrass themselves by saying too much; or they're depressed from a fractured relationship; or something that gives interesting insight into who these people are. Nope. There's none of this. Again we're treated to asexual, invincible, cartoon characters who I just couldn't give a fluff about.<br/><br/>The subtitle, Rogue Nation, implies that perhaps it's got some geopolitical message or commentary to it. It doesn't. I know its Mission Impossible and it's supposed to be mindless fun, but sometimes blockbusters do explore current topics and themes in an entertaining fashion. This one doesn't. Not even with satire. It's played cutesy straight. The movie simply doesn't say anything about anything. <br/><br/>It's plastic and disposable... which I guess does say something."

Then I measured it for drama, but all events are predictable to the end. In case of acting I'll give Jeremy Renner one point over Tom, to be honest.

","This is the first review I have ever done on IMDb...not because I don't like watching films..in fact, I adore films. Rather, I normally don't review just because I put a premium on my time, and don't want to spend time repeating what others may have already said about a given film; until today, that is. In my inaugural review, I was very motivated (I mean incensed) to write this review now having come back for the cinema, freshly infuriated in the realization that I can't get 2.5 hours of my life back after watching MI-5. I read glowing reviews before going to the film, to which I am now wondering if I saw the same film others who reviewed this film as ""highly enjoyable"". I am beyond puzzled how this film got good reviews, unless it is from reviewers who get easily bamboozled by special effects to forgive the need for a plot, or work for the makers of the film, or who are not of this earth. The planet to which these people who did liked this poor excuse for a ""film"" I do not know. Yes, I knew it would be an action film, and yes I knew one has to suspend disbelief to enjoy a film like this, but despite these prerequisites being in place in my mind going into the theater, this film content was so vacant and vapid it boggles my mind that I sat through its entirety and didn't walk out mid-film. The plot was not in the slightest way possible to follow, and the reviewers shouldn't confuse plot complexity (which a good story can have)with the nonsensical incongruity of this film. Tom Cruise--who was truly outstanding in Jerry Mcquire,the Firm, Vanilla Sky and Eyes Wide Shut-- was hardly that as an international spy. Mr Baldwin--another outstanding actor and wonderful in the Royal Tannenbaums and Blue Jasmine--but his role in this film was completely under-utilized. The other actors were alright, but its just that the plot and its presentation was just insulting to any intelligence. Endless product placements for BMW, and then when the locale of different places were indicated when they showed in an areal pan shot its a bit much to say show the US Congress and Washington Monument, combined with the need to type in the upper right corner...""Washington D.C."", just to make it look official and inform us that we are in Washington D.C. just in case one didn't know..I can't remember if the pan shot of Big Ben was accompanied by the words ""London, England"". If you are looking for a similar action/conspiracy spy film with slick international intrigue with believable characters, I highly recommend ""The International"" out a few years back. In sum, please, save your time, stay at home and watch paint dry for a more redeeming experience."

Here's the thing - even with so much actors, high tech cars and shitload of money they still can't make a car chase as good as Bourne movies. The movie is littered with cheap dialogues, comical acting and simply outrageous plot holes. It would blow your mind how one could sit through this garbage of nonsensical abomination. <br/><br/>I would rather repeat watching Silence Of The Lambs or letter from iwo jima or Brotherhood of War every week than watching these Michael Bay- grade stuffs.

I find myself noting a world of difference, without meaning to as all franchises mean the same to me. Something like Oblivion is not at all the same kind of thing as Edge of Tomorrow. Fury Road and Ultron are different.<br/><br/>So I thought half of Ghost Protocol had some cleverly staged illusion around the usual plot manipulation experienced by characters, showing reality as something you control and direct that referenced filmmaking. The other half was jumbled and usual. <br/><br/>This is all the latter - my guess is due to the change of maker, from a Pixar guy where some sophistication about how the viewer is going to inhabit the story is necessary and cultivated, to a working jack who just wants to cram things in a room.<br/><br/>This is all plot, silly plot like in a cartoon where cookie cutter motivation is quickly swapped from characters' mouths, ludicrous thingamajigs are produced on demand to further the plot or chased after. Characters say they won't do something but agree to in the next beat, whatever the plot demands, someone writing as he goes. Is it difficult for a character to identify someone from a police sketch among thousands in a city? Just have him mouth ""yes, but not for me"" and then just produce the plot point. Do we want plot twists, someone to not have the disc containing life-or-death info and someone else to have it? Just have the disc erased or re- discovered as never lost (someone made a copy) as it fits.<br/><br/>They try to poke some fun by having Cruise almost make it or saved by the bell, thankless. One or two decent set pieces, the rest nondescript. My most lasting impression though - so woefully written and animated as cinematic world, the worst thing that can happen to you."

Incorporates everything you want to see from MI involving getting out of impossible situations. Music is effective using the main theme and Puccini.<br/><br/>The cast may not seem very glamorous at first sight. The mainly British supporting cast are pretty droll. Strong and masterful breakout role for the ""White Queen's"" Rebecca Ferguson as an enigmatic British agent. She holds her own action wise in fight scenes and subterfuge.

The opening scene was so painfully purported, it set a bad start for rest of the movie. I mean, what was Ethan doing while the plane was getting loaded and taxing? he just shows up in time to jump on the taxing plane. There are plenty of loosely tied special effects that fail to excite as they are not adding to a gripping plot. Context not set properly for anything to make the audience invest in the moment. There is just too much of global back-n- forth in a highly purported fashion not truly relevant to story or plot, which itself is pretty much non-existent. Many situations in the story have been wasted by the director to generate excitement. The whole IMF have been presented as a set of bumbling idiots, enough for audience to laugh at them but not feel or root for them. Ghost protocol was so much better."

","An adequate actioner but not well connected to the earlier movies in the series. And aside from a hair raising opening airplane takeoff, the stunts are witless. Cruise is getting some Eastwood about him and he looks physically unwell, and can barely swallow some of the worst dialog of the year on hand right here... care of McQuarrie, whose abilities as a director outshine his writing disasters. The storyline is almost incomprehensible; when there is no humanity in the characters' behavior or motivation, then all one can do is sit back and view the film as a roller coaster ride; equal parts excessive movement and unpleasantness. The Ilsa character is typical... more of a plot device. Acting is OK, uneven; Jeremy Renner cannot overcome his character's illogic and has the worst lines; Rebecca Ferguson adds life to the movie; the rest are negligible including over the hill action star Cruise, who should be playing the Alec Baldwin part so step aside and let a new generation take over that part."

","Rogue Nation delivers set piece action and thrills to satisfy most of the intended audience, but basically they are rather hackneyed and fourth rate. They do not make up for the acres of empty space at the heart of the movie's plot and characterisation. Let alone the script and direction which are utterly predictable and gone through strictly by numbers. A just about good enough film that does not try too hard. After all, predictability is the key to a franchise success, or a dreadful bore to the uncommitted and unenthusiastic - there really is only an hour's TV episode material here. True, it carries it all off with gloss and panache, but then the Chinese backers would want to be sure on a return for their investment! Tom Cruise (looking older) gives his all-American, polished, believable performance we come to expect in his action genre films, while the support cast do their thing like moving wallpaper. Rebecca Ferguson flaunting her slightly heavy thighs at almost every opportunity is an interesting choice as the femme fatale (good or bad?), but Swedish/UK cool does not add a lot to a very clichéd role. Sean Harris (unrecognisable) tries to method act the chief villain and still manages to make no impression. Just like Philip Seymour Hoffman in an earlier MI, you have to chew a bit of scenery rather than stay cold at a very great distance! Can we have a franchise-free (particularly comic-based ones) and Matt Damon not lost in space year of movies, please, and get back to some straightforward, effects-free entertainment that Hollywood used to do so well!?"
"SquigglyCrunch","7","6","10","18 February 2016"," Very Average Spy Movie but Still Very Well Presented
","I went into this movie with some expectations. Having not seen any of the others, but hearing very good things about this one, I was curious as to what to expect. I'm happy to say that it was fairly impressive. <br/><br/>The plot of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is one that clearly has been being developed in the previous movies. However, it wasn't hard to understand the plot, despite not seeing the previous four movies. It feel like a continuation but it's still capable of standing on its own. For the most part the plot is done quite well, but I felt like a lot of it was implied more than it was actually explained. Maybe I should have seen the previous movies to understand, but I've had this same problem with a lot of other spy movies. <br/><br/>The characters aren't anything special. Very averagely developed. <br/><br/>The movie as a whole is very average. The sequence of events is one we've all seen before, so you never feel particularly tense because the end result is fairly obvious. However, the movie is paced very well, and the formula itself is overshadowed by how well done the movie is. The fights are great, the spy technology is cool. There is a lot of greatness in this movie, so it's very easy to overlook the formulaic sequence of events. <br/><br/>Overall Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a very well done spy movie. While I think some plot points should have been explained a bit better, it's done very well. I'll certainly be seeing this again, and who knows? Maybe I'll increase my rating. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone, especially people who like spy movies like this."
"The Grand Master","6","5","8","25 August 2015"," Had its moments but it's nothing that hasn't been done before.
","Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is the fifth movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise and although the trailer looked decent, I had the feel that this was nothing new. There were some moments that were good though, particularly the opening sequence where Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is hanging off the plane while it is taking off the runway.<br/><br/>Mission Inpossible - Rogue Nation sees Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) reunite after an international criminal organisation known as the Syndicate is intent on eradicating the IMF. The Syndicate is led by the sinister Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Disavowed M16 agent Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) is deep undercover within the Syndicate and although she is a secret ally to Ethan Hunt, she seemingly has a secret agenda which creates suspicions as to which side is she really on. To compound further problems for the IMF team, CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin, who is perfect for his role) is spearheading his intentions to have the IMF disbanded via a hearing by the Senate Intelligence Committee.<br/><br/>Age has not slowed Tom Cruise down at 52 years of age, and he still jumps around and leaps into action like he hasn't aged at all. It was good to see Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames again, Rebecca Ferguson was great as Isla Faust, Sean Harris made a slimy, sinister villain, and Alec Baldwin does what he does best.<br/><br/>The story itself was nothing new, and most of the action sequences seemed to be routine. I just couldn't get excited for most of the movie. I hope Mission: Impossible does not suffer the same fate as the Terminator franchise and lose its box office appeal.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is more of a time filler if you have nothing better to do. It is worth a watch, but not exactly a movie that is a must see.<br/><br/>6/10."

And also, I'd like to know where Agent Carter is... because I think she was pretty amazing in MIGP.<br/><br/>Another thing is, just after being disavowed in Ghost Protocol, MIF found itself again, having to not exist, while not existing, in it's very next installment... And Mission Impossible has been working on that premise pretty much throughout the series, so much that, I figure, for some reason, MIF will have to be dissolved again in Mission Impossible 6...

"Muhammad_Nd","9","3","4","14 July 2016"," Entertaining, Very Smart, and Thrilling
","One of the problems with the earliest Mission Impossible movies was that they appear to be too smart for their own good, and even when we liked the gimmicks and the car chases, we felt like we left out of the party. It was like they were just too good to let us in. When we watch thrillers, part of the excitement is that we sometimes know a crucial piece of information that the hero doesn't know, and we wish we could be there to help him out. ""Mission Impossible"" pushes the set up even further when we are part of the thrills, riding along, enjoying every turn, guessing like the heroes, wondering who or what is real? Where is the next double crossing coming from? It's so good that we welcome the most overused trick in the series when it finally shows up because the ride has been amazing so far, and in order to make this entry work, we need to recharge Ethan's batteries, and we have to give him a suitable new partner who is as challenging as enticing, and why not put everyone in jeopardy with a villain who is not afraid to dispose of anyone whether they are being useful or not, if the situation requires.<br/><br/>Once again, our favorite group of spies or agents are out loose and without much of the support they need, exposed to the enemy and classified as unwanted by their own boss. Things become even more convoluted when a group known as The Syndicate makes an appearance, and the question is whether this association is a real or a rumor. There is however, no time to waste because if the group is real, the consequences will be enormous.<br/><br/>In comes a lethal new female agent whose loyalties are not clear at the beginning, as she as alluring as cobra with the complication that she also is able to cast quite a spell on Ethan and the audience. We want to see more of her regardless of who she's working with, and the part demands an actress who is beautiful, attractive, capable of doing some complicated physical work, and who can project intelligence to the point that we know she is at the top of her game in addition giving her character enough mystery to make us wonder what her game really is.<br/><br/>So we follow both friend and foe, and our mystery lady throughout the world, with some incredible action pieces in London, Morocco, Vienna, and more. We never really know how things will turn out, but we get the full package, as Ethan has to endure some precarious turns inside a water tank, one very deathly motorcycle race, and a rather devious challenge in the last scenes of the film. To keep things even more interesting, there's an element of fun, and we see the different agents wink at us, or just give us a quick glance to suggest things could go just about every possible way, except the one we usually are dealt in this type of films.<br/><br/>As I said before, no one will be disappointed by any of the action, and the actors are certainly in fine shape here, but the glue that holds everything together is the very clever script that keeps the action flowing non-stop, and adds much intelligence to a film that is about intelligence because in order to survive in this universe, you need to have courage and brains, and the ability to use your talents both with some careful planning, and being able to see the immediate and the whole picture. <br/><br/>The film definitely pumps much needed energy back into a franchise that could have ended with the last film. It raises the expectations of the audience which makes the next challenge something to look forward to. Whatever happens, here is the formula, so study it, admire it, and most certainly, enjoy it."

"RforFilm","7","4","6","31 July 2015"," Even with a weak villain, Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation makes up with grand over the top stunts and an ageless Tom Cruise
","At this point, I may have to dub Tom Cruise the immortal man. I was watching him being interviewed on the John Stewart Show and he may have had the experience of a Hollywood acting master, yet he has the enthusiasm of an aspiring actor. He answered every question about his career with a smile and would go on about how each experience from The Outsiders to Rock of Ages to Mission Impossible would be his favorite. He also happens to remain one of the few international stars that can carry a picture by being himself. <br/><br/>The new millennial Hollywood wants to escape into a story rather then watch a reenactment from their favorite celebrity. If you look at older movie stars like Gene Kelly, Jimmy Stewart, Carry Grant, or even john Wayne, you can rely on their charm to carry a story you want to see them in, but not so much with their character. Today there seem to only be a few actors that have that kind of charm. Men like Will Smith, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacy are people that can play characters, but most people just see the actors. It's not a bad thing as I still enjoy Tom Cruise in movies like Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation. <br/><br/>Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) has been on the trail of a rumored underground elite called the Syndicate. One mission in London has him captured by the group that proves their existence, but a disavowed British agent Ilsa Faust (played by Rebecca Ferguson) lets him escape. Back in Washington, agent Will Brandt (played by Jeremy Renner) and CIA director Alan Hunley (played by Alec Baldwin) appear before a Senate committee to justify the IMF's actions from now and before (like the previous movie missions). Unable to reveal operational details, the group sides with Hunley, disbanding the IMF into the CIA, also making Ethan Hunt a wanted man.<br/><br/>Six months later, intelligence analyst Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) is sent tickets to an opera in Vienna. He flies over there to find that Ethan actually sent him there to recruit him for a mission to continue to track the Syndicate. They happen to find the man they are looking for, Solomon Lane (played by Sean Harris), who has sent someone from the Syndicate to assassinate the chancellor of Austria. The mission goes wrong, sending Ethan, Benji, and Ilsa on a globe trotting adventure to see if the Syndicate has greater intentions, whether Ethan may be losing his mind, and whether the CIA can find the team.<br/><br/>The problem I had before going in was knowing that Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol was already one f the best movies from 2011 and one of the best spy movies of all time At least Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation manages to be just as exciting as the last film. These movies tend to have more of an over-the-top and comedic edge against the Bourne and James Bond movies. The stunts are just as awesome as before with too many to count scenes that could easily be watched on YouTube for a quick rush. <br/><br/>Speaking of over-the-top, watching these characters interact happens to be a highlight of the series. Tom Cruise is just as cool and Simon Pegg brings a lot of quirkiness to the picture. Rebecca Ferguson has some good scenes as our ""go to double agent"". Our heroes may have been set up to fight (and fight they do!), it's unfortunate that the villain is not as interesting. Sean Harris seems to be only set on ""monotone hiss"" with his voice and doesn't have much of personality. At least there were plenty of enemies for Cruise to fight, and if the Syndicate is here to stay, maybe they can find a more interesting villain for Mission Impossible 6. <br/><br/>I'll give this seven diving stunts out of ten. Had the film's villain been more interesting, this might have been better then Ghost Protocol, but seemed more focused on setting up a group of villains instead. The stunts and banter though make up plenty and at least allow for a fun watch. So see this movieshould you chose to accept it."

","The team is targeted by, and vice versa, The Syndicate, an international, rogue spy organization that has never been proved to exist. They're behind some of the worst terrorist attacks in recent history, and they're about to get their hands on far more resources. The IMF is shut down in one of the (no, really) well-done Senate hearing scenes, meaning that, yes, as usual, they're betrayed, tricked and/or otherwise work unauthorized in the film.<br/><br/>Our crew return, all of them on point. Cruise strokes his ego and performs insane stunts, a thrill-seeker who rationalizes it by being a movie star. His directors' nerves may never recover. And yet, he's engaging to watch. Alec Baldwin is great as a political foil for our heroes. Newcomer Ilsa(Ferguson, mysterious, physical, a double agent who may betray Ethan and the others at any point, capturing the magic that was The Dark Knight Rises' Catwoman) is immensely compelling, and one of the best elements. As is Lane(Harris, intelligent, elusive), one of the smartest and most dangerous villains of the series so far, recalling Philip Seymour Hoffman of MI:3.<br/><br/>The action is varied, with shootouts, fights(hand-to-hand and with mêlée weapons) and chases, on foot and by vehicles. Exotic locales include Morocco. Setups and operations are memorable and fun. The comedy doesn't always work, but when it does, the material is hilarious and quotable. At times, this does end up repeating plot points from the previous entries, and isn't as interesting as it could be. Nevertheless, on the whole, this is fantastic.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Hollywood spy flicks. 8/10"

Rebecca Ferguson is a fantastic femme fatale bad ass – Hands down – no questions asked – she knocks it out of the park here.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into full detail here as with all action films, as not only do you need to see it for yourself, but they don't go for a big emotional point to the storyline..they go for the action and action you shall receive. In abundance.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation opens on ""Ethan Hunt"" (Tom Cruise) hanging off the side of a plane, which has been notably played up as the holy-shite-Tom-Cruise- actually-did-that-himself stunt moment. And play up they should as once you hear the familiar theme music – whoooshyou fall right in step with the action.<br/><br/>This time round the IMF team is on the track of 'The Syndicate' an evil group of agents whom are all listed as supposedly dead or MIA along with the fact that no one seems to believe they exist, leads us to understand quickly enough who the bad guys are and who the good guys are..or in the case of one character..it might beg the question..do we?<br/><br/>Simon Pegg back again as ""Benji Dunn"" adds the expected comic relief at the right intervals and is a fun watch here. Alec Baldwin as CIA naysayer ""Alan Hunley"" who believes The Syndicate might just be a figment of Ethan's imagination, and who begs the question if the IMF is really relevant any longer as he feels they've more or less just been 'lucky' so far. Jeremy Renner ""William Brandt"" & Ving Rhames ""Luther Sitckell"" are both back and here to stay. Rebecca Ferguson as ""Ilsa Faust"" is truly the one who takes it all here. She is a breath of fresh air for the franchise, the right blend of strong and sexy – not knowing if she is friend or foe makes her all the more mysterious and carries in the movie well. My motto of 'you're only as good as your villain' also comes across well with a notably beardless Sean Harris as baddie ""Solomon Lane"".<br/><br/>While Rogue Nation is most definitely an adrenaline ride fueled by high octane action sequences, it's also wittier than past M.I. films with Cruise facial reactions to some of what's going on let's you in on the secret that yes..he knows how impractical it all seems.. but yet makes you feel as it's not. There are great moments of comic relief mixed with suspense and a wonderful cast that has great chemistry with one another.<br/><br/>Cruise might have been under-appreciated in Edge of Tomorrow but it's clearer than ever that Ethan Hunt is one of Cruise's better signature roles and to that extent, just might be back. And to answer Baldwin's character's meta-question: Can Mission Impossible stay relevant in this new era of bigger and better-let's outdo the next guy film? The answer is decidedly maybe. OK..Definitely maybe. ;)<br/><br/>Grade: B- @pegsatthemovies"

","Everyone is loving on MI5 Rogue Nation. There is a reason for this. It's what a summer blockbuster movie aspires to be. Rogue Nation is fast paced, intriguing, and extremely beautiful. I wasn't bored at all through this movie. I was either too focused on the action, or trying to figure out what the villain had planned. One would think after the second Mission Impossible failed, or at least wasn't good, that the franchise would have died a few films ago. Now I'm left hoping Tom Cruise can continue as Ethan Hunt until he's 60. Love or hate Tom Cruise as a person, the man is an incredible actor. He has been on a roll with his last few films. Edge of Tomorrow is fantastic, and if you haven't seen it yet, go buy the movie because you'll want to watch it multiple times. He is amazing in MI5, and you don't doubt for a second that he is still able to do all of the action sequences. Mainly because he does all of his own stunts. I still can't believe he actually hung outside of an airplane and didn't use a stunt double. In this movie Ethan has to track down an elite evil spy network setup independent of any nation. He is pitted against the best villain of the series next to Phillip Seymour Hoffman from MI3. It is very spy vs spy. They have to outwit each other to accomplish their goals, and Ethan during the course of the movie wonders if he has finally met his match. Along for the ride are some familiar faces. Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames all reprise their roles from previous Mission Impossible film. A newcomer however, Rebecca Ferguson, steals the show. She is amazing as the female lead in this movie. She kicked major ass, and I honestly wouldn't mind seeing a spin off focused just on her character. Probably won't happen, but I think it could be fun. It's time we had a female spy movie (other than the comedy with Melissa McCarthy that came out this year). She was simply stunning in this film, with both her look and the amount of ass she kicked. I loved it, and it was believable. They also did a good job masking what side she is actually playing for. I was never quite sure, and it added to the overall intrigue of the movie. She interacts well with the whole team, but especially Tom Cruise. The rest of the team are great. Simon Pegg is fantastic as the comedic relief. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames have good chemistry and I liked their interactions. The fun everyone had making this movie comes across on the screen. It is just an extremely enjoyable time and all the actors give their A game. I was surprised by Alec Baldwin's performance. He had a nice side role and was believable in it. I feel he can overact at times, but he was perfect as the CIA director. Sean Harris plays the big bad dude, Lane. He plays a great villain and I loved how calculating he was. He had a great plan, and is extremely believable as the vicious cold blooded calculating villain. The only issue I had with him, and really the movie, was they didn't really setup why he was doing what he was doing. He was just causing acts of mayhem and didn't seem to have any overall purpose. This doesn't take away from the overall film, he's the bad guy and has to be stopped. Simple, but I would have liked to see just a bit more of the why. The only other issue I had with the movie was the blatant product placements. I don't mind product placements, but these where just a bit over the top. Let's just say, Microsoft dumped a ton of money into the film. There isn't much else wrong about this movie. I didn't see any other issues if there where. I was too busing enjoying myselfJ. The plot has a great espionage feel and the action is insanely intense. The chase scene in the middle of the movie is out of this world good. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. It's a tad unbelievable, but hey it's an action flick. I can suspend my belief and enjoy a few stunningly well shot action pieces. I can't tell you enough how intense and enjoyable these scenes are. Each good Mission Impossible has had an intense scene, and this one is no different. I don't think they equal the Dubai or the Langley sequence from previous films, but they come close. So obviously, I loved this film. It has everything a good spy movie should. Great action, a twisting plot, and fun gadgets. This is one you must see in the theaters, maybe even multiple times. Go and enjoy this flick. I don't think anyone would be disappointed when they walk out. My Rating: MUST OWN My Top Five Favorite Tom Cruise Movies: 1. Top Gun 2. A Few Good Men 3. Mission Impossible 4. Minority Report 5. The Color of Money<br/><br/>If you like this review check out my others at: http://dowerreviews.blogspot.com/"
"3xHCCH","9","7","13","30 July 2015"," Crazy Good Cruise Crushes It!
","After four years, Tom Cruise and his crew comes up with yet another episode in the ""Mission:Impossible"" film saga. I thought it would be tough to come up with something to top ""M:I Ghost Protocol"" (My Review). That 2011 film directed by Brad Bird was simply too awesome, and so far my favorite of the whole series. This new one may have just matched that awesomeness.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt and his IMF team come face to face with the Syndicate, a rogue terrorist operation led by the chillingly ruthless Solomon Lane. Equal to IMF in talent and resources, the Syndicate sends the mysterious female agent Ilsa Faust to obtain highly secure computer files from a highly secure location. The IMF team though gets caught right in the thick of this complex web that again brings them around the world from the US to Cuba, Austria, Morocco and England. Meanwhile, they also grapple with CIA head Alan Hunley who would like nothing but to see IMF dissolved. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is visibly older now, but he can still pull this Ethan Hunt character off so well. He has got his strong action star charisma going on with the bravado he displayed in those death-defying stunts he did reportedly without a double for this film. His crazy plane-hanging stunt that we see in the trailer happens before the opening credits, so do not come in late. His car and motorcycle driving skills were so fantastic in those breathtaking chase scenes. He was said to have had training to hold his breath for up to six minutes to be able to do that long thrilling underwater sequence.<br/><br/>As the lead female in the cast, Rebecca Ferguson nailed the role of Ilsa Faust. (Her name was obviously a reference to Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa Lund in ""Casablanca"", a major setting in this film.) She was the one character who had that subtle air of duplicity that makes you doubt whether you'd trust her or not. Her character was the key game changer in the story of this film, and Ms. Ferguson does not disappoint in this pivotal role. She had us on the edge of our seats in those spectacular action scenes of hers, especially that that incredibly vicious knife fight at the end. <br/><br/>The ensemble work of the cast behind Cruise and Ferguson was impeccable. Simon Pegg was perfectly droll as tech whiz Benji Dunn. This guy's comic timing was so daft, I loved it. Sean Harris was positively creepy as the villain Lane, so sinister without the excessive hysterics. Jeremy Renner (as Brandt), Ving Rhames (as Stickell), Alec Baldwin (as Hunley) and Simon McBurney (as British agent Attlee) were all on point in their portrayals of spies of various abilities and affiliations. <br/><br/>All those complex action sequences were executed faultlessly. The brilliant cinematography, fast-paced editing and the driving musical score (which had elements of the iconic M:I theme mixed with strains from ""Nessun Dorma"" from Puccini's ""Turandot"") all contributed to the success of these scenes. Among the memorable sequences this film will be remembered for are the opera house assassination attempt scene, the underwater data card-switching scene, the car chase scene through the narrow streets with Cruise driving a 2016 BMW, and the very exciting multiple motorcycle chase scene on a zigzagging road.<br/><br/>Perhaps having a new director for every film in this series has kept this franchise from becoming stale. After illustrious names like Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird at the helm previously, Christopher McQuarrie (who first gained fame as the Oscar-winning writer of ""The Usual Suspects"") writes and confidently directs ""M:I Rogue Nation"" as excellent cinematic entertainment with just the perfect mix of non-stop action, political intrigue, technological savvy and witty humor. 9/10."

","Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation Review This sequel of Mission Impossible was no different from the others in terms of the plot. There was no additional creativity and insight in the script. The plot was very similar to all action/thriller mediocre films. The sequence of events was above average but not as expected for I got bored in some parts of the movie. Many of the events didn't make any sense. The acting in the movie was good to very good. The characters were very good and suited the poor plot. The character development however was good to very good. The editing, soundtrack and special effects were more than excellent. There was a very good degree of positive messages and an above average degree of positive role models. The ending was as expected and we didn't see any twists throughout the film. Though there was many things that could really improve the movie was an enjoyable one and was worth watching.<br/><br/>Quality: Good. Rating: 32%"
"strikertom-43033","5","10","21","2 August 2015"," This film was a disgrace to the series!
","SPOILERS!! I personally went to a screening with my cousin within my local area to go watch this film we had been waiting for months to come out. We had both watched all the other films and we're excited to see this new instalment into the thrilling series which is mission impossible. When we came out of the cinema, we were disappointed and both shared the same thoughts:<br/><br/>The storyline was confusing and felt like they had cut vital scenes out when editing the film, as parts will not fit in with what had just happened or also show no context to the event that was taking part in the movie. This made it hard to watch as a viewer, but also it allowed me to feel left out, as I wasn't informed properly about what was going out in the scenes.<br/><br/>The main problem was the ideas that the writers had come up with to put in this film. The mission impossible films are always outside the box when it come to reality, like mission impossible 4's Dwbai scene, but it felt like they had gone to far in this one. The ways that they made the opera scene drag on and on for about a 10 minutes more then it needed to and also adding a secondary bike chase after Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg had just crashed a car after doing 3 flips, just left me feeling bored and occupied on other things. The big part was how they recycled lots of content from other films and TV shows, being the scooby-doo style mask revealing and also the use of Simon Pegg's comedic talent just did not work and left you feeling, why am I here?<br/><br/>Finally, the story line was weak and it was wasting a lot of talent actors being in the film, such as Jeremy Renner. This point is simple and can be seen throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>I would however recommend seeing this film just for the fact that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. This was my opinion and a lot of people watch films for enjoyment and also a day out with the family, not picking out small details. I hope you enjoy the film and try not to frown apon a rare occurrence in these types of series."

"orbisignis","4","9","19","3 August 2015"," Not a spy-movie
","It is an action packed blockbuster film. However, it is a brainless waste of budget. I hate being the ""M:I1-was-better"" guy, but M:I1 was an intelligent espionage movie with some (awesome) action scenes. The spies are really dumb, and the story has many plot holes: some events are way too forced, and the characters make decisions overlooking major failure-scenarios. Henchmen killed in previous scenes return to action not only fully-recovered and intact, but in the same ""we are the bad guys"" pose. It is closer to what viewers expect from a Bond film: luxury cars, hot women, hi-tech gadgets, etc. It has nice vintage moments, which resemble the original series, but only for the looks. The best scenes are copy-paste from Mission: Impossible 1. Great sound editing, at least in the high speed chases."
"kcninesling","2","15","36","8 August 2015"," Profits Improbable: A Likely Box Office Flop
","The studio had high hopes for this live-action cartoon, as the last entry in the series was a bit of a financial disaster. I guess losses had to be recouped, some profit made and the franchise to be revived.<br/><br/>It doesn't appear this is working out.<br/><br/>As of today, MI has done $152 million in business, worldwide, in eight days of release. Sounds impressive until you consider the economics of mainstream, wide release Hollywood ""blockbusters."" Pictures of this type are expensive to produce, market, advertise and distribute. Marketing and advertising costs generally run at a figure that's 50% of the production expense, and then distribution and general business costs to support the film are also quite high.<br/><br/>The total cost of MI will be at least $255 million. As a studio's cut of the entire box office drop is roughly 2/3, MI will have to generate about $385 million in business in order to be in the black.<br/><br/>Usually, a film of this type does 45% of its business in the first week of release, and has a useful shelf life in public appeal that lasts about a month and a half. If MI follows this general model, it will do about $320 million in total box office, which means something like $215 million in return to the studio.<br/><br/>The Friday-to-Friday gross on this film is down 60% in its second week. This is hardly encouraging.<br/><br/>You do the math. A $45 million dollar loss is significant, an amount that would be difficult to offset in the aftermarket (DVDs, Blu-rays, secondary release, broadcast rights, etc.).<br/><br/>It is likely this will be the last Tom Cruise MI flick, as the franchise is apparently exhausted in terms of economic vitality, and his brand is obviously diminished.<br/><br/>This is not surprising. Only two franchise pictures have been profitable this year, the Avengers offering and the Jurassic entry. ""Mad Max"" didn't make back its investment yet, and the current Adam Sandler piece of dreck is destined to be a big money loser, just like his last half dozen films.<br/><br/>Perhaps the studios should start rethinking their strategies. Actioners, CGI extravaganzas and childish attempts at comedies are hardly worth the investment anymore. Time to move on, apparently, to something else. Novelty and producing essentially the same picture time and time again eventually leads to diminishing returns."
"felixguyisfly","1","18","46","4 August 2015"," For The Love of God
","Literally the worst movie i have ever seen. I could not bare to watch one more moment of this film. The dialogue was terrible, the acting was terrible, pretty much everything was terrible except for the hot chick in it. I would not advise anyone to see such a movie. Please save your money and buy some food or some crap. That would be way more enjoyable. I have never left a review for a movie before this but this one deserved my opinion. I literally had to walk out of the theater because I couldn't take it anymore. <br/><br/>Not only did the movie contain the most obvious and constantly overused movie tropes, but it assumes it's audience is literally brain-dead. Furthermore, the CGI actions scenes were worse than the quality seen in Jurassic World, except the CGI in the original Jurassic Park was somehow better than the two combined. 75% of the 150 Million dollar budget was probably used to coax Simon Pegg and Alec Baldwin to star in such a train-wreck, I mean seriously, Pegg was in Hot-fuzz and Shaun of The Dead. SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Simon Peggs career is just as over as Alec Baldwins, matter of fact, the next thing you're probably going to see Simon Pegg in is a Travelocity commercial.<br/><br/>Also, I want to discuss Tom Cruise. Scientology probably had a hand in this piece of garbage, there's no way they didn't. They must be all up in Hollywood pulling strings because otherwise this piece of filth would never have made it to theaters for people to be tortured by. Tom Cruise has never, in his entire career made a good film. Top Gun might be the only debatable film because of the Kenny Loggins song. Please, please, please, for the love of God, if you respect yourself or those that you love, DO NOT take them to this film. Tom is lucky the Geneva Conventions hasn't learned of this films existence otherwise he would be on trial for war crimes against the greater good. I put this film on the same level as, that feeling you get when you eat too much spicy Mexican food. You know you messed up really bad, and now you can do nothing but sit and cry about the terrible mistakes you have made and just pray for it to be over. I have never been much of a praying man, but at this point I would like to say one thing to whatever God may, or may not be up there: I don't ask you for much, but please for the love of Christ, make this movie go away, arguably before world hunger because it is truly that bad."

","Don't buy the overwhelming positive reviews. To put things into the context, I liked the first Mission Impossible which had a cool atmosphere as a throwback to the original series presumably (which I didn't watch). The sequel was a typical John Woo action vehicle with a few MI touches added (like masks) - hated it. I really liked the rather realistically done MI3 and loved the main character's chemistry with his wife, but then it was all wasted in the 4th installment which was rather generic and boring (hated the Simon Pegg addition to be a comic relief in yet another movie).<br/><br/>Reading the reviews I had high hopes, but the movie is too long, boring with too many plot holes to comprehend, presumably due to terrible editing. There is a love interest (albeit rather one sided, it seems), but it's not developed in any way. There is a potentially interesting anti-IMF organization, but it's not developed in any way. The main infiltration seems to copy the one from the first movie with some ridiculous additions, but it's used up rather quickly leaving you to wonder what was the point of including it. I can't escape the feeling that the script was either too long or incomplete and many scenes were just improvised and tacked on as the shooting went on. I actually intend to watch the hated MI4 just to see which one made less sense."

The scene is really intense, and I am really quite amazed by the stunts. It looks real and not computer generated, which means it is really crazily dangerous for the crew and the stuntman!<br/><br/>The plot then twists and turns, and brings us to various countries. The motorcycle chase scene is very thrilling, I can really feel the speed and the ferocity of the characters relying on speed to stay alive. <br/><br/>One problem I find with ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is that it relies too much on movie logic, meaning that some plot progressions don't actually make sense. For example, the underwater scene (which is also in the trailer) ends in an implausible and actually unscientific way. And the constant manipulation and counter-manipulation between Ethan and Ilsa gets a bit confusing as well. That does not spoil the enjoyable factors of the film though. It is a good action blockbuster, but I prefer Ghost Protocol better."

"moviewizguy","8","6","12","31 July 2015"," Summer Movie Done Right
","The Mission: Impossible franchise is a lot like the Fast and Furious, in that the later sequels are better and more entertaining than the early installments. MI3 is my personal favorite in the series, which I think is vastly underrated and pretty much the quintessential action movie. Ghost Protocol, while not as amazing, was still pretty great, with Brad Bird bringing his own charm and sensibilities to the franchise. Rogue Nation continues this trend with some of the best set pieces in the entire series. You'll be glad to know the plane heist, which has been promoted to death in the trailers and poster, is actually the first scene in the film, proving director Christopher McQuarrie has more up his sleeve. And that he does. I don't want to spoil them, but the action scenes are so creative and executed extremely well, you'd be fascinated to wonder what went on in the head of McQuarrie when he had to come up with them.<br/><br/>For example, there's a stunning set piece in an opera house, which brings to mind the climax of Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) in the best possible way. In the sequence, McQuarrie has to juggle a lot of variables, but he pulls it off masterfully. And in my favorite action scene, there's an underwater set piece that could have been taken directly from Gravity. By the time the film has reached its ending, you can't help but feel exhausted. If there's one thing to complain about of the film, it's that it succumbs to the pitfall of being too long. The film didn't really need to be 131 minutes, and part of that has to do with the overlong and slightly disappointing third act. The plot is also a little convoluted for its own good, with a few too many reveals and reversals.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the ever reliable Tom Cruise brings his A game, reminding audiences why we loved him in the first place. He's the heart and soul of the Mission: Impossible franchise, and fortunately, he hasn't lost his luster yet. Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Ving Rhames return for this installment, but apart from Pegg, Renner and Rhames are mostly in the background. Rhames, in particular, is resorted to saying witty one-liners, and that's about it. However, it's Rebecca Ferguson who shines. This is the first thing I've seen her in, and she's right there alongside Cruise the whole way through. Sean Harris is unrecognizable as the film's villain and he gives a good performance, but like most of the villains in the series, he merely gets the job done. Regardless of its shortcomings, Rogue Nation is consistently good with the rest of the franchise, only ranking behind parts 3 and 4 for me. It's an enormously entertaining summer flick that contains some of the best action scenes the year has to offer so far."
"DoubleOscar","9","6","12","30 July 2015"," This Franchise Just Keeps On Cruising Along
","Being a big fan of Ghost Protocol and the entire franchise as a whole, I was very eager to see what Christopher McQuarrie would bring to the M:I franchise. He has already proved himself as a writer with works such as The Usual Suspects and helping with Edge of Tomorrow, but as a director I wasn't yet convinced of his talent... I am now.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation is quite possibly the best entry into the series thus far. The story follows Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) as a wanted man who is attempting to track a rogue agency that is believed to be nonexistent. Simultaneously, Ethan and the rest of the crew are struggling on whether to trust not only each other but a new character, Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). As with most Mission Impossible movies there are twists and turns along the way to keep the viewer engaged.<br/><br/>For me, the most important part of these kind of blockbusters is how well the action is filmed. In Rogue Nation, every fight, chase, or shootout is shot which such perfection, it brings the audience along and makes them feel like they are part of Tom Cruise's team fighting alongside him. I didn't realize it, but at some points I was gripping my seat from the tension and had to relax my hands. While in the past Ethan Hunt was shown as a super soldier who could easily accomplish any task, in Rogue Nation there are points where e and the audience is unsure of where to turn which makes him seem more human and by extension, more relatable.<br/><br/>As for characters in general, they are as compelling as ever. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt continues to solidify how much of an action star he has become. Simon Pegg remains just as likable as before as Benji Dunn. And Ving Rhames being brought back as Luther was a welcome treat. Despite all of these great actors, I believe that the standout was Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust. Her character was so mysterious, every time she was on the screen, it was so unpredictable which side she was on. Lastly, the villain was very menacing and a worthy counterpart to Ethan Hunt, which was a welcome surprise.<br/><br/>What few problems there are did nothing to affect the overall enjoyment or quality of the film. At some points, the plot seemed a bit too convoluted and one or two parts felt like unnecessary exposition. Although, as stated before none of these problems take away from the spectacle and thrill that is Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation.<br/><br/>Overall, Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is an immensely fun time to be had at the theater. It continues to reinforce the freshness of the series and the proves how much of an action star Tom Cruise while also showing potential in others like Rebecca Ferguson. Definitely check this one out if you can.<br/><br/>""Benji, open the door!"""
"erojas-47968","9","6","12","30 July 2015"," Best Mission: Impossible and one of the best action movies, even with its forgettable flaws thanks to the superb pace
","First of all, no doubt about this franchise is one of the better ones inside the action genre. Also ""Ghost Protocol"" is a great action movie and a stunning entertainment, even if its script lacks a little more of depth. But after several watches and having passed the initial acclaim, let's face that without the powerful effect of its action sequences the plot itself couldn't live up to be an awesome action movie (just look at ""Edge of tomorrow"" and the surprising rich of its story and turns that made it stands as really one of the best and most quality entertaining movies of the recent years). So, with the inventive usually relieving on how the action sequences could impress the audience, it's a powerful joy to find a ""Mission Impossible"" film that actually has a deep, complex plot with unexpected surprising twists, well developed characters and moral issues of theirs shown in their frantic mission without getting confuse or losing the audience. It's the longest running time entry, but beats ""Ghost Protocol"" as the most entertaining one, and the first one as the most Hitchcockian (aka intriguing). The marketing looks like it has shown most of the movie, but it doesn't. Thank god, and even in this times. ""Rouge Nation"" works as a stand alone installment, but there are references of the previous one (Kremlin bombing, so the IMF was disabled – The Syndicate, referenced at the very last shot of the previous before Cruise disappeared) and the plot doesn't sacrifices itself for being spectacular. That's maybe the best narrative strength of the film (specially to those of you who really care about the plot even knowing that this picture is likely a brainless movie). But that action sequences are also so compelling and exciting. If they don't surpass the Burj Khalifa and the parking scenes from ""GP"", they are at the same level of breathless greatness. The now famous ""open the door"" scene with Tom Cruise literally risking his life (one more time alongside GP climbing), as the shockingly beautiful orchestrated and suspenseful delivered Opera sequence are two big stunts ready to compete with the franchise legacy. But, sadly, there are some bits that could represent some failures or problems. Meanwhile the acting delivers (Cruise on top form, Rebecca Ferguson being a really stunning addition and at the same level of relevance and supporting weigh than Cruise, Pegg continues to stabilize his role with witty confidence) some of the big assets (Baldwin, Renner and Rhames) look like being treaty as a very minor roles (specially Renner in comparison with GP), as well the villain (Sean Harris) is not as empty as Michael Nyqvist but doesn't live up to embrace the level left of the sadly late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Also that third act that has been so talky in last months can disappoint some of the audience due to its execution and resolution. Arguably it always depends on how everyone could look at this installment and how high the hype is, because I personally enjoyed how it ended (I risk my opinion and I say that has a stronger third act than GP, thematically and in terms of suspense). But maybe the ending doesn't fully compensates all the potential of the film's plot (maybe I was looking for a darker, edgier finale, but this is a light action movie too, so it couldn't stick so well). As a conclusion: ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is a satisfying action movie, incredibly entertaining and with powerful action scenes. It can be considered as the best Mission: Impossible movie (although maybe not best Cruise movie) or ranked at the same position than ""Ghost Protocol"", but even with that highlights it falls short giving each role their importance inside the plot and the villain is not as good as he could be. It may not be a perfect movie for the most, yet it's going to be another superb time at cinemas with the usual Tom Cruise power and a surprisingly skillful mission that everyone who are looking for the magic of entertaining should accept."

","Usually, when a franchise reaches its fifth installment without being a part of some grander over arching plot, said franchise has overstayed its welcome. But not in the case of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. As the fifth movie of the franchise, Rogue Nation still manages to bring a fresh take with a more sinister villain, and surprising questions about ethics in field where ethics is a foreign concept. There are also neat little plot twist moments which keeps you on your toes and keeps the narrative from rehashing earlier movies. The action scenes in this movie are a wonderful mix of hilarity, audacity and brutality. When watching it, you know it's highly improbable, but who cares? It's great fun."

","Let me start by saying that Rogue Nation has the best ensemble out of the entire series, with everyone bringing something to the table. Cruise brings charm and likability to a character that, by this deep into a series, could be easily worn-out and tiresome. Everyone else fills their roles exactly how you would want them to, with more attention being put on Simon Pegg's Benji this time around, although the true breakout star was Rebecca Ferguson, proving that not all damsels are in distress (for the most part). <br/><br/>The movie delivers with brilliantly crafted action sequences, locations and sets that make you feel like you're really part of an adventure, and a solid enough story to keep you interested throughout with an occasional laugh on the way.

But although - like Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and all the rest of the 80s- 90s dinosaurs - he is just getting too old for this sort of thing, he insists on playing the indestructible guy.

He eventually is rescued by his super-female counterpart in another WTF stunt. But wait. There's more.

I have liked every movie in this series (yes even 2) and it's not easy to become the best of a franchise this good but this did it. All of the stunts were amazing starting with the hanging on the side of the cargo plane which was the opening scene of the movie and wasn't even the best scene in the movie. The action was great all the fist fights and the car and motorcycle chases were all so well done and ended up being some of the best I have seen in a long time. All the main characters in the movie had amazing chemistry even from characters that had never previously met like Luther and Brandt and Brandt and The head on the CIA. Rebecca Ferguson was amazing in this movie and her character was unpredictable and very mysterious. The film was also very funny at times mostly from Benji and generally every character making fun of Alec Baldwins character. The villains were very solid the syndicate as a faceless organization were threatening enough as it was but Sean Harris as Soloman Lane was a really solid villain and really felt last me Ethan Hunt has met his match. This film was in one word Amazing and met all of my expectations and I really hope more movies come in the series after this and if they can be equally as amazing as this one."

But, in addition to the action / stunts / fights / shooting that is the usual motif of this type of film, we now have the inclusion of the Sherlock Holmes factor: intelligence. Yes, folks, Ethan Hunt and his nemesis, Solomon Lane, are locked in a battle of wits. It's like Holmes and Moriarty all over again. Each of them reminds the audience at regular intervals how they have got the other's next moves all worked out. But B knows that A has got his moves all worked out. So B does something different. But A knew that B was going to do something different and had planned for that outcome. But B knew that A would realise that B would change his plan and so then B doesn't his plan after all.Or maybe he changes his plan in a different way. Who knows? Who cares? The result is a storyline of bluff laid upon double bluff laid upon triple bluff until we really have no idea which character is the most intelligent because we have no idea what is going on.

","With reviews in the 90% I expected something better. Not even great but at least fun and thrilling. Mission Impossible 5 gave me none of that and as the movie went towards the last half I felt bored. Maybe my view would have been different if I had seen any of the other Mission Impossible films and thus already formed an attachment to these characters but as it stands I felt nothing for them.<br/><br/>My problem with Ethan Hunt's character is that he is too uber. Of course you know walking into the cinema that the good guys are going to win. A good action film should challenge that by adding vulnerabilities to the hero, make it seem like he's really fighting for his life. Mission Impossible 5 is the kind of film where the main character walks in, is awesome and you never really feel a sense of danger for him.<br/><br/>Benji is probably my favourite character of this film as he is the only one that now sticks in my head. He felt the most human which I can't say about anyone else.<br/><br/>Which is not to say the movie is bad, but I found nothing likable in it so gave it five stars as it falls squarely in the middle in that place between good and bad."
"bob-the-movie-man","8","5","10","10 August 2015"," This Mission - you *should* choose to accept
","As befits a film that could be subtitled ""MI-5"", much of the action that underlies Tom Cruise's latest outing as IMF agent Ethan Hunt is set in London and concerns shady goings on at British Intelligence. After ruthlessly gunning down a fellow agent in a record shot (a delectable Hermione Corfield) Ethan Hunt is getting rather obsessed with tracking down Soloman Lane (Sean Harris from ""Prometheus""). Lane is the mastermind behind a sinister worldwide organisation (shades of ISIS here perhaps) called ""The Syndicate"". They are engineering apparently disconnected disasters, both large and small, to further their ends (with one of these, topically, being a disappearing airliner). Hunt's path crosses that of Ilsa Faust (Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson), Lane's beautiful hit-woman who may (or may not) be a double agent.<br/><br/>I must admit some bias in this review, since I love the MI series, as I loved the TV series when growing up in the 60's. The convoluted plots and the absurdly unlikely action is played just to the right side of tongue-in-cheek, and Cruise – love him or loathe him – oozes charisma at Ethan Hunt. In tone this film is closest to the slightly more plot-heavy Mission Impossible III, directed by JJ Abrams, which - counter to much opinion - was one of my favourites of the series. The convoluted story, revolving around a 'McGuffin' of an encrypted stick drive, is pretty hard to follow and doesn't bear close inspection. But the plot is merely there to string together the action sequences, and these are exceptionally well executed, pumped up by Cruise's personal involvement in the stunt work. The much-publicised Airbus A400 stunt, which opens the film, is utterly thrilling but equalled by a Casablanca-based car and bike-chase in the middle of the film. The scenes in and on the Vienna Opera House also make for a gripping sequence.<br/><br/>Cruise is starting to look a bit crinkly at the edges, but at 53 - and only a year younger than me (dammit!) – he's allowed to. He clearly keeps himself very fit, and if he did the featured gymnastic pole-escape stunt himself, then he deserves the respect of every over-50 in the country – time to start doing those morning sit-ups again!<br/><br/>The BBC ""Rev"" pairing of Tom Hollander (""About Time"") and Simon McBurney (""Magic in the Moonlight"") are both good as the British PM and top spy-master respectively, and Sean Harris makes a notable chinless but chilling villain as Lane. <br/><br/>MI regulars Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames effectively go through the motions of reprising their IMF roles, joined this time by Alec Baldwin as the CIA chief. <br/><br/>But the real find of the film is Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson (""The White Queen"", ""Hercules""). Not from the stick-thin model collection usually seen in these types of films, she makes for a memorably athletic lead, and this character could be driven forwards as a more female- focused spin-off movie franchise if the studio so wished. I'd pay to see that.<br/><br/>The writer/director is regular Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie who previously directed Cruise in ""Jack Reacher"". Also on the technical team I would call out the editing by Eddie Hamilton (""Kingsman"", ""Kick- Ass"") and the music by Joe Kraemer: together, these two drive up the adrenaline with a thrilling title sequence to get you in the mood. Kraemer's music is effective in taking Lalo Schifrin's iconic themes and tweaking them cleverly. In particular his reworking of ""The Plot"" theme to fit to the Casablanca arrival is inspired.<br/><br/>In summary, a highly enjoyable and action packed outing that should definitely be experienced on the big screen rather than the small one. In fact, this one might even deserve a revisit from me in IMAX.<br/><br/>(Please see the graphical version of this review at bob-the-movie- man.com and enter your email address there for future reviews.

","Many things in life simply are what they are, no hiding it, no shame in it and forever unchangeable and with this in mind we have the Mission Impossible series. A series which is and hopefully always will be in a simplistically uncomplicated way, a hugely fun and totally trivial thrill ride, nothing more and nothing less.<br/><br/>Since Brian De Palma's first entry into the brand names feature film canon in 1996, movie goers have been treated to five additions (including Rogue Nation) to the franchise and each one has delivered its fair share of big screen thrills and situations that prove Tom Cruise may just be the most danger loving movie star in cinema history.<br/><br/>Where the first Mission Impossible was an espionage thrill ride, the second a borderline fantastical event thanks to the always OTT John Woo, the third a perfect blend of heart and thrills and the fourth a truly eye melting spectacle, this fifth film is a neat balance of thrills and actions spills that start out with a runway bang and end with a curiously low key finale that in between has everything from extreme breath holding through to reminders that Cruise can indeed handle his cars and motorbikes like the best of them.<br/><br/>The series has really always existed to provide us with some heart in mouth moments and the story in Rogue Nation is certainly nothing to write home about with yet another nefarious organisation trying to do evil deeds and Ethan Hunt and his team of cronies' hell bent on preventing them from achieving their goals. In saying this, Usual Suspects screenwriter and now assured director Christopher McQuarrie has a way with words that makes many of Rogue Nation's more suspect scenarios ring truer than they perhaps deserve.<br/><br/>These moments in Rogue Nation do bring the film down and with a great first act and middle act the film does suffer a little from a really downplayed finale. It's refreshing to not have a typically explosive finale but Rogue Nation seems to be set upon setting up a follow up event rather than really ending this particular trip with anything memorable which does seem a little bit of a shame considering the tools at its disposal. It would've also have been nice to have a few more women share the adventure as well as while Rebecca Ferguson is good as Isla Faust, she doesn't get to do to much more than show off her legs and provide eye candy to the intended male audience.<br/><br/>With Cruise on as good as form as ever as the man on a mission and with some well-judged direction by McQuarrie, Rogue Nation is a fun trip to the movies and another solid entry into the near 20 year old franchise that does just enough to make us want to come along for the ride again in a few years' time, but it may just be the last time we feel such sentiments towards a series which provides the goods without reaching grand heights.<br/><br/>3 Halo 5 copies out of 5"

","From what I gathered from the trailers, I went into the theater expecting a great film...and I couldn't have been happier with the end result! This film was awesome from start to finish and had what I thought was one of the best villains in the series to date. Sean Harris (who played villain Solomon Lane) did an excellent job in his role, keeping Cruise and his team on their toes throughout the film. Cruise himself also did an excellent job here, too, instantly proving that he still has what it takes to continue on with this role many years into the future.<br/><br/>The central focus of Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation revolves around a mystery group called the ""Syndicate"" who basically work like an anti-IMF, with a sole focus of spreading terrorist attacks around the world, while working to establish a sense of new world order and overseeing the dismantling of the real IMF. Besides this group standing in their way, Ethan and his crew must also deal with Director Alan Hunley (played brilliantly by Alec Baldwin) who is bound and determined to think that Ethan is crazy and that the Syndicate is just in his imagination. Because of his doubts with Ethan, Hunley brings up his concerns to the oversight committee and it is decided that after the events of Ghost Protocol, which saw landmarks like the Russian Kremlin destroyed, that the IMF be dissolved effective immediately. Not long after, Hunley and his crew end up putting Ethan on a most wanted list and try to track him down to no avail, using what appears to be Agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner) as his mole, even though Brandt is working with Ethan. We later find out that Brandt was on Ethan's side all along, and simply tricked Hunley into thinking that he was really helping them, when in reality, he wasn't. The conclusion of the film reveals that the Prime Minister of England, whom Ethan and the team practically kidnapped in order to satisfy a ""request"" from Lane, actually had inside knowledge of the Syndicate after Ethan is revealed to be the Prime Minster's associate, Atlee, in disguise, to the instant disbelief of Hunley. Once the real Atlee arrives, Hunt subdues him and gets him to admit a cover-up with the Syndicate ever since Lane hijacked the project and went rogue.<br/><br/>Not long after the fact, Hunley and Brandt return to the oversight committee, where Hunley requests to re-instate all members of the IMF, claiming the reasoning behind its initial phaseout was due to allowing Hunt to go undercover. Although doubtful, the committee approves Hunley's request and the movie closes out with Brandt addressing Hunley as ""Mr. Secretary."" So in summary, whether you have been a fan of this series since its inception or just started following it after the third or fourth installment, trust me, you will love this one! It's worth every penny!"

The series' best (thus far) and giving Bond a run for his money!"
"estebangonzalez10","7","5","10","31 July 2015"," The franchise continues to be very much alive.
","""Every one of the attacks you attributed to the Syndicate, the IMF was there.""<br/><br/>It's been nearly 20 years since the first time Tom Cruise played IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and after this fifth installment of the franchise there is no sign of him stopping any time soon. Like good wine, these movies seem to get better the older Cruise gets. The weakest link in the series is by far the first sequel directed by John Woo, but J.J. Abrams managed to reinvigorate the franchise in the third Mission Impossible film with Philip Seymour Hoffman's memorable performance as the main villain and the introduction of Simon Pegg's character who brought the much needed comic relief. Brad Bird continued what Abrams started with Ghost Protocol and introduced Jeremy Renner to this world, and now it was up to Christopher McQuarrie to continue the hot streak. McQuarrie had previously worked with Cruise in Jack Reacher, a film I seem to have enjoyed more than everybody else. In Rogue Nation he followed what the previous directors brought to the series and continued to build on it with a similar tone during the action sequences that once again took us around the globe. There is a fantastic opening action scene involving Cruise jumping on a plane while it's about to take off, then it is followed by another wonderful sequence at a Vienna Opera house, and it is topped by another one involving a heist in Morocco that ends with a spectacular motorcycle chase. If there is anything negative I can say about Rogue Nation is that the film opens in such a spectacular fashion and maintains such a steady pace that by the time the bike sequence in Morocco ends the film seems to overstay its welcome. There was just no other way to top those action sequences so the final thirty minutes were a bit of a letdown with the predictable twists that any fan of the franchise could see coming. Other than that this was a fantastic ride which proves once again what a star Tom Cruise really is. <br/><br/>Upon receiving instructions for his latest mission, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), discovers that it has been compromised by a rogue organization that he refers to as the Syndicate. He is captured by its leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). While held captive, right before being tortured a mysterious woman known as Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) helps him escape. Ilsa claims to be a British Intelligence officer who has gone deep undercover to infiltrate Lane's Syndicate and win his trust. Meanwhile, William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), is forced to testify in front of the US Chairmen committee in response to the agency's latest dealings which haven't been accounted for. CIA director, Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), wants IMF disbanded because he believes Hunt is a liability. The committee decides in Hunley's favor convinced that the Syndicate doesn't exist and that Hunt is behind it all. IMF is disbanded so Brandt and Benji (Simon Pegg) are forced to work for the CIA and bring Hunt in. So Ethan is left on his own to try to stop this dangerous organization, but he always finds a way to get his crew back together and accomplish the impossible. Ving Rhames is also back for a fifth time as Luther Stickell as he and Cruise are the only characters who've been here from the start. <br/><br/>The screenplay for Rogue Nation which was written by McQuarrie himself hits pretty much the same beats as the previous two films in the franchise. It has a similar tone and it's surprising how similar these films are to each other considering they've been directed by different directors. You know what direction these spy stories are heading, but the ride is what you are here for. Rogue Nation opens with a spectacular first half and ends in a weaker note, but it is still one great experience thanks to those spectacular action sequences and Cruise's charm. McQuarrie also manages to do two things right: first of all making Sean Harris's Solomon Lane a threatening villain and second giving Rebecca Ferguson a strong female character with some great choreographed fighting scenes. These two additions provide the franchise with the freshness it needed to go along with the familiarity of what the rest of the cast always brings. Besides the three action sequences that stood out for me in this film, there is a cool moment where Ethan receives instructions for his latest assignment that is perhaps the best in the franchise. Similarly to what many action films are doing now appealing to the past and our sense of nostalgia, Ethan receives his instructions in a vintage record store in what was one of the most memorable scenes in the film and a great way to introduce the villain of the story. The early escape scene is also quite thrilling, but it was spoiled by the trailers. Rogue Nation proves once again that this franchise is very much alive and that Tom Cruise isn't getting slower despite his age. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"moviexclusive","9","5","10","30 July 2015"," The best 'MI' yet, thanks to Tom Cruise's practical stuntwork and a smart, gripping script that emphasises plot and character chemistry over empty visual spectacle
","""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" starts off with its most talked about stunt performed without any CGI by Tom Cruise himself. In order to retrieve a cache of nerve-gas missiles on board a military cargo plane piloted by a band of Chechen separatist fighters, Cruise's IMF agent Ethan Hunt hangs on for dear life from the side door of the plane, waiting for his trusty tech genius associate Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to work his way remotely through the plane's computer to get it open. It must take some gall for writer-director Christopher McQuarrie to choose to open his movie with what others would reserve for a nail-biting climax, but thankfully that bit of derring-do isn't just a red herring.<br/><br/>Instead, McQuarrie's maiden attempt at the 19-year-old spy franchise builds on Brad Bird's franchise-reviving entry to deliver a genuinely gripping tale of espionage along with the requisite jaw- dropping action for arguably the best 'Mission Impossible"" yet. In 'Rogue Nation', Hunt meets his most formidable nemesis yet in a shadowy ""anti-IMF"" terrorist organisation nicknamed ""The Syndicate"", made up of former intelligence operatives from all over the world who have since been presumed dead. Led by former Special Forces operative Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the organisation's aim is to destabilise the current global order, and are now taking their ambition to the next level by targeting world leaders for assassination.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Ethan, the Syndicate are so good at what they do that no one outside the IMF believes in their existence, a fact which CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) exploits to justify the IMF's obsolescence. After a Congressional hearing agrees with Alan's assessment that the IMF should be held responsible for the wanton damage wrought in 'Ghost Protocol', Benji and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are both assigned to work at CIA Headquarters, leaving Ethan to his own devices. But rather than turn this into a one-man show, McQuarrie shrewdly introduces a skilled MI6 agent by the name of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) to play off Ethan when his boys are away, and Ilsa turns out to be a satisfyingly intriguing complement of questionable allegiance to the stoically loyal Ethan.<br/><br/>Knowing McQuarrie, one expects Ilsa to be more than just the equivalent of a Bond girl, and true enough, she proves to be his equal not just in wit but also in agility, such that their ensuing romantic tension is well-earned. But it isn't just their dynamic that is rooted in the tropes of the best spy thrillers; indeed, McQuarrie's twisty plot involves lies, deception, subterfuge, and double/ triple-crosses.<br/><br/>Yet the language of the 'Mission Impossible' films has always been action, and so rather than bog his picture down in exposition, McQuarrie roots the twists and turns in a succession of glorious action set-pieces. An early sequence has Hunt attempting to stop the assassination of a key European leader in the middle of a performance of Turandot, leading up to a vertiginous fistfight up in the rafters of the Vienna State Opera House. Before we can catch our breath, Hunt is infiltrating a highly pressurised underwater cavern housing a critical server bank, which is followed as soon as it is over by a vehicular chase through the narrow alleys of Casablanca and a high-speed motorbike dash along its highways and winding mountain roads.<br/><br/>Rather than trying to top itself at every turn, the final act however slows down to build emphasis on character and intellect, including a brilliant sequence of duplicity involving Hunt, Brandt, an unwitting Hunley, the British Prime Minister and his MI6 director as well as a cat-and-mouse chase through the darker streets of London which culminates in a most satisfying game of wits between Hunt and Lane. Even more so than in 'Ghost Protocol', the team dynamics between Hunt, Benji, Brandt and Luther Stickwell (Ving Rhames) are a delight in themselves, so even though Ethan is often the one putting himself in the line of fire, there is no doubt how much of an asset his other team members are. In part, that is also credit to the strength of the supporting ensemble – Pegg the trusty sidekick cum comic relief, Renner the super-ego to Cruise's id and Luther the trustworthy ally since his first 'MI' days.<br/><br/>There is no forgetting however this entry's most prized addition – the Swedish actress Ferguson, who brings an athletic beauty and a sexy, enigmatic air of mystery to her character. She is easily the series' strongest female character ever, and it doesn't hurt that she and Cruise have sizzling chemistry. And at 53 years old, Cruise continues to be the defining face of this consistently excellent franchise, not least for the fact that, despite his age, he continues to insist on performing each and every one of the audacious stunts live. <br/><br/>It is no overstatement that the 'Mission Impossible' franchise is at a new peak with the relentlessly thrilling 'Rogue Nation', and more than just a triptych of spectacular action sequences, this entry boasts a smart gripping tale of old-school spy intrigue that will keep you guessing. Like we said at the start, it says a lot when a summer blockbuster kicks off with its most publicised stunt, but McQuarrie has wisely established this entry not on trying to top the CIA vault break-in from the first 'Mission Impossible' or the Burj Khalifa climb in 'Ghost Protocol' but rather on a winning combination of wit, character chemistry and skulduggery. Going rogue has never been this exhilarating, nor this immensely satisfying."

","It looks like Tom has been Cruising with another great movie, as Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation is filled with the right amount of action scenes and comic relief to make this a must see. It hooks you in with an exciting start, which in turn is a pleasant way to a vague idea of what the plot line is. After that, it steps right into what we have all wanted to see... the shot mainly focusing in on Ethan Hunt doing his thing, him working efficiently on the fringe of destruction of the world.\<br/><br/>How is this movie different from the others out there? <br/><br/>First off, Ethan Hunt is a reasonable man in his own respect - as in not blowing anybody's head off. He realizes that thinking through the situation is better than going Rambo on the front lines. Brain over Brawn. While a good thoughtless killing may be good in very certain circumstances, this movie is not meant to be on of them. It shows the genius of Tom Cruise's character and how he thinks. He shows he does the job for the reason of saving the world, not for the girls (Thanks, Bond). <br/><br/>Also, the balance of this movie from conflict to humor/diving into the story-line is impeccable. I feel I have to bring up San Andreas as a comparison. While a good movie, it involved the destruction of objects most of the time. This is not the case in Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation. When the action starts to have the potential of becoming overwhelming, a good joke pops up and makes you chuckle. Or when you might start to crave a shootout, one happens. <br/><br/>Overall, Mission Impossible keeps your eyes glued to the screen the whole time and you should spend the time to watch it and makes you want to know when Ethan gets to Hunt down his next enemy. And yes, the only thing that you are disappointed about when the credits start rolling, is that the movie ended."

The M.I. franchise is his baby and he cares what the audience wants. He still has the energy like when he was 25. And that shines through in his performance and it makes the other actors give themselves as much to the movie as he does.<br/><br/>That is particularly obvious with the hot new Swedish actress in Hollywood: Rebecca Ferguson. Not only does she have a great body as well as being beautiful, but she can also kick ass and do her own stunts as good as Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>I hope her character Ilsa Faust will be a new addition to Ethan Hunts team in future M.I. movies.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig, could learn something here. All he can do is bitch and moan about being Bond and he delivers the worst Bond ever. Thanks for nothing you ugly blond brite with pointy ears and a face like a 70 year old. <br/><br/>If you're fed up with superheroes and horrible PG13-remakes of R-rated classics and you miss those days, when they made old school action movies, that didn't have to be depressing and/or realistic, but just fun, this movie and this franchise is for you."
"RaoulGonzo","7","3","5","30 March 2016"," A slight disappointment given whats gone before!
","The Mission Impossible series has only gotten bigger since its inception on to the big screen 20 years ago opening with Brian De Palmas smaller scale slick and intense thriller where we are introduced to Tom Cruise's secret agent Ethan Hunt. John Woo then steps up the action with MI2 Slow-mo shots galore and full of the directors trademarks which work ever so well in Hard Boiled but fail Massively and is a miss-step in the franchise. JJ Abrahams directs the darkest in the series to date , portraying a more vulnerable Ethan Hunt and for my money has the best villain of the series in Phillip Seymour Hoffman. 2011s Ghost Protocol yet again ramps up the action to good effect with some of the best action set pieces of the series bringing on board Brad Bird in the hot seat and seemed to revitalize the flailing franchise.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation is the fifth installment. The IMF has been disbanded and Ethan Hunt is now an outlaw for the C.I.A. The team have their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the syndicate - A rogue organization helmed by Lane (Sean Harris) committed to destroying the IMF.<br/><br/>Full of blistering well done fast paced action as to be expected but I don't think it has moved the franchise any further, now more than ever in the Tom Cruise show has become a series of massive action sequences that could be shown in any order and it wouldn't make a difference. Nothing quite matches the stunt on the Burj Khalifa, here it seems to be a nuts and bolt affair which makes it mostly tension free which is a disappointment.<br/><br/>Christopher McQaurrie does a fine job in the directors chair but the screenplay is so-so. McQaurrie seems to be able to direct over the top action with his eyes shut one of the best in the business in this genre (The Way of the Gun is an underrated classic in action cinema). Which is why it's hard to take that MI:5 is lacklustre in almost every other aspect with the exception of a couple of great action sequences.<br/><br/>Same old, same old for the crew here Cruise the unstoppable machine with some spectacular and daring stunts which he indulges in more than ever, Simon Pegg's Benji the comic relief which for me grated at times, The ever tough and stolid Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Ving Rhame's Luther cool as a cucumber as always. A new face in Rebecca Ferguson for my money (Acting wise at least) is the star she absolutely convinces in her role and you as the viewer are never quite sure what sides she is really on.<br/><br/>There is certainly a lot of value in here for action heads it just seems for me at least to be getting somewhat stale don't get me wrong I do like it as it is one of the better franchises out there. It's the same old and that's all good if that's what you are after get some more suspending wires and tapping on laptops mid-air. Worth checking out but for me was a slight disappointment . It adds nothing new for the audience maybe it does for Cruise personally film by film outdoing himself stunt wise. As a spectacle it's decent but not the best in the series."
"Vivekmaru45","6","3","5","4 January 2016"," I still remember vividly, going to the cinema to watch the first Mission Impossible.
","How time flies. This is the fifth installment in the franchise and it shows no signs of stopping. This film deals with a shadowy organization called ""The Syndicate"". The job of The Syndicate is to eradicate all existing IMF field operatives.<br/><br/>Naturally The Syndicate crosses paths with Ethan Hunt, and then, all hell ensues. As with all the mission impossible films, action remains the prime focus. We have high-speed car chases, speed-bike chases, underwater action and plenty of gun action in between.<br/><br/>We have Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson in her debut Mission Impossible role. My favorite actor ""The Main Man"" Alec Baldwin makes his first appearance in the franchise. I'm always glad to see him. I consider him the best of the Baldwin brothers in both appearance and personality. He is capable of carrying an entire film on his own if given the opportunity. Check his films out: as Adam Maitland inBeetlejuice (1988), as Jack Ryan in the action thriller The Hunt for Red October (1990), as Lamont Cranston in The Shadow(1994 too good film), as Robert ""Bob"" Green alongside Oscar winning British actor Anthony Hopkins in The Edge and as Jed alongside Nicole kidman in Malice(1993).<br/><br/>Back to the film. Tom Cruise plays his role in a stereotypical fashion. He acts know for acting's sake and to show the world that he still is as young as he used to be. But time conquers all. As in the classic tale of the tortoise and hare, the one who started last, ends up winning. I'm referring to time/downfall as the tortoise and youth and beauty/success as the hare. Another moral: no one can claim to be immortal - good luck Mr. Cruise.<br/><br/>You can even see the class difference between Alec Baldwin and Tom Cruise. Alec is clearly a superior and much underrated actor. Alec is four years older than Tom. <br/><br/>I must again mention that casting Mr. Pegg as a sidekick to inject a dose of comedy in the movie is a bad idea. Why not instead cast Jim Carrey for the role. Probably for the reason that he'd steal the show. I also do not like Ving Rhames. I prefer Jean Reno over Rhames.<br/><br/>Verdict: Christopher McQuarrie who is mostly a writer known for winning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for The Usual Suspects, directs the film. His other directed films Jack Reacher and The Way Of The Gun. I would not call him an experienced director. Joe Kraemer handles the music in the film. He does his job well, however he has only worked in a meager amount of B-films. An Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Christopher Young, Jerry Goldsmith, Basil Poledouris, Giorgio Moroder, Danny Elfman he will never even approach those Titans Of Film Music. Robert Elswit is the real veteran cinematographer in the group and he is the one that saves this film from utter disaster. <br/><br/>Now I must mention the villain in the film: Sean Harris who I immediately recognized because he starred in Prometheus(2012). He is incompetent in the role of a villain. I have seen better villains like Allan Rickman who played Hans Gruber in Die Hard(1988), Anthony Hopkins as the nefarious doctor Hannibal Lector, Doug Bradley who played Pinhead in the Hellraiser films. <br/><br/>Overall a decent way to spend some time but inferior to the original first film which remains the best in the franchise.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review. Live long and prosper."
"Blurviewer","6","3","5","4 December 2015"," more action or more drama?
","If talking about this movie alone I would give a higher mark probably 7 because the excitement it brings, but under the title of Mission Impossible series, it is just not that good. First of all, Mission Impossible series mean excellent stories for me while this story is a disappointment. Do not expect meticulous story in this one. It becomes a simple and funny action movie with a lot of flaws. Stories are told painstakingly even lack of basic logic flow between scenes. Imaginations simply run riot and I was just looking for fun while not being persuaded at all. As an action movie, 007 is totally better than it. As a drama movie, it totally failed. I would suggest this series do not abandon their advantage in complex stories or I will go for movies like 007 directly."
"melaniealison2","4","17","52","30 July 2015"," Mission Forgettable
","I suppose car-p*rn is not my kind of film; and neither are James Bond imitations. Nonetheless, the audience seemed to enjoy it. There were intellectually challenged men in the audience (really) and they seemed to enjoy it. So, I'm not going to trash the film, because I - intelligent action fan - just wasn't the intended audience. It had nice action scenes, but was clearly aimed towards an ideal viewers IQ of 90. The babe was cute, but Tom Cruise looks old. Sorry, Tom. Life's hard. The story was messy and is best described as a long boy meets girl foreplay, consisting of car wrecks and meant to be stimulating camera flashes of women's legs. Aww, it wasn't bad for an action film. Some people will like it."
"Likes_Ninjas90","5","4","8","28 August 2015"," If a film is dedicating itself entirely to action it must still give us a reason to care about the characters and their perilous situations
","If a film is dedicating itself entirely to action it must still give us a reason to care about the characters and their perilous situations. The fifth in the Mission: Impossible series, starring Tom Cruise, is entirely action but also highly impersonal. This was never going to be a deep movie but outside of the rich cast hired to play them— including Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin, Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renner and newcomer Rebecca Ferguson (Hercules, 2014)—there's nothing distinguishable about the personalities of the film's characters. Some have already named this as the best of the series and the one which cements Cruise's status as high as James Bond or the apex of action stars. Personally, I prefer Tom Cruise films where he's asked to do more than perform elaborate stunts and where his dramatic chops are tested like in Michael Mann's Collateral (2004) and perhaps his most alarmingly dramatic work in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999). There are also smarter, deeper chase movies than the Mission Impossible series like Minority Report (2002).<br/><br/>In Rogue Nation, Cruise resumes his role as Ethan Hunt, a top secret spy whose group the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) is under fire by CIA boss Alan Hunley (Baldwin), who wants to dismantle them. Meanwhile, the group is also attacked by a counter organisation called the Syndicate, which sends Hunt and his team—including Benji (Pegg)—on the run. Helping Hunt escape capture from the opposite team is Ilsa (Ferguson), who is after a disk with the names of agents on it. But she remains untrustworthy and elusive for Hunt as she keeps switching sides. Hunt's ally Agent William Brandt (Renner) is also on the lookout for him, and trying to escape the increasing pressure from Alan, who himself wants to capture Hunt. Hunt's mission to find the disk and stop the Syndicate organisation takes him global hopping and into scenarios like a night at the opera and also a dangerous infiltration mission under the water. It's a very convoluted, crazy plot, which most won't bother to unravel if they're engaged or distracted by the big set pieces and stunts.<br/><br/>Aside from Benji, the characters in the film are boring action figurines, short on characterisation and humanity. Take the newcomer Ferguson, who admirably throws herself into all of the physicality of Ilsa. It's not a part with any backstory or personality and the reality is further diminished by the extent of her resume—including running, sniping, diving, motorcycle racing, general spy stuff, knife fights and disarming a man by leaping onto his head in an evening gown—which makes her symmetrical with video game characters like Lara Croft. Scarlett Johansson would have been worn out by this role. On top of a female lead, was someone worried Renner would further outshine Cruise? He has so little do in the film, which seems like a bizarre omission given he's proved his physicality in action films like The Hurt Locker (2008), The Bourne Legacy (2012) and the two Avengers films. Ving Rhames is the film's one African American character and the only action sequence for him is an amusing gag scene with a vehicle. For someone of Cruise's experience, Ethan Hunt is not a role which tests him outside of the stunts. He's a dull, standard can-do hero, without the personality or the fun of James Bond and no inner life either. His team regularly mentions their friendship with Hunt but there's little downtime to show their bond and any pauses are dedicated towards exposition.<br/><br/>As determined by Christopher McQuarrie—who reteams with Cruise after directing Jack Reacher—the content and the shape of the film further dispel Hunt's believability. There aren't enough spaces between some of the action sequence. In one montage or collage of stunts, Hunt drowns under water, is revived, speeds off in a car, crashes his vehicle in a series of ridiculous flips, and then he escapes from the wreckage, only to speed off on a motorcycle. Compressing the sequences together makes the film like a cartoon and hard to take seriously, which would be one of the aims of the filmmakers and Cruise, who prides himself on the stunts. One point where the film becomes enjoyable is when it reaches a new height of ridiculousness, as Alan gives a speech about Hunt being ""the living manifestation of destiny."" It's an unintentionally hilarious moment, which had a lot of the cinema laughing including myself, but true to form its proceeded by the weight of another chase scene and a knife fight. Tom Cruise has already reached his fifties and it'll be interesting to see how the backend of his career treats him and whether he looks for roles that will test his range or at least let him utilise his charisma. He needs to catch his breath."

","Went to see it in the afternoon. Only a few people were in the theatre. Have seen most of the other MI movies, but had no expectations. It was a good entertaining two hours of nonstop action. The acting was so so. Cruise is always on the top of his game. The plot was interesting, but could have been better. It is always amazing that they always happen to be at the right place at the right time in these movies. One scene where his friend just happens to drive by to pick him up where he was at, but wait, didn't he take the train to the opera? The film was not too violent as far as graphic and had little to no profanity, which is good for families. I felt the ending could have been better, but overall, regular MI and Cruise fans will not be disappointed"
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","8","6 August 2015"," Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to have fun, watching this movie. I think I kinda enjoy this movie.
","The Mission: Impossible franchise really like the word, 'disavowed'. This time, it's the whole Impossible Mission Force after CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) convinces the US Senate that the IMF is a threat to public safety. Following the near-disaster from the end of the last movie, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has gone rogue in hope to show why the IMF is needed to stop an organization of assassins and criminals known only as The Syndicate. Can Hunt prove, the existence of the Syndicate or will the IMF be disbanded, forever? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I found the story to be, same old, same old predictable story. It built on the same foundation as the four preceding films, meaning there will be a lot of same repetitive somewhat wearisome tropes. The movie was really missing the great twist and turns of the previous films. While, this movie directed by Christopher McQuarrie feels like it was on cruise control. It's still really impossible to hate this fifth film in the Mission: Impossible series. There's a lots of thrilling action, funny humor, & death-defying stunts to get you through the film. It's has enough to get audience and professional critics seem to consider this the one of best film of the franchise to date, topping the already-acclaimed 2011's Ghost Protocol in glowing reception. In my opinion, as much as I like this film, I have to say, Ghost Protocol was more memorable for me in the wow-factor scale of intense action moments. Don't get me wrong, the movie has some really eye-catching stylized and heavy choreographed scenes. I love the huge airplane chase scene opening, but the action kinda dies down, after that. The whole swimming stunt is cool, and the car chases, but the movie, sadly ends very anti-climax. I wish, the movie had a better ending. It didn't have the same solid pacing as the last movie. While, the action didn't live up to my standards, I do have to say, the movie does more nail-biting emotional-driven powerful action scenes. The whole countdown to the bomb was pretty responsive. I found the performances in the film to be, very good. Despite, what's going on, in his personal life, I have to say; Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt seem very normal and well-like. I like the fact, that Tom Cruise does his own stunts. He was injured 6 times during the making of the movie. That shows how driven, he was, to his craft. Mad props, for him performing the highly dangerous sequence where Ethan Hunt climbs on the outside of a flying airplane without the use of special effects or a stunt double. Rebecca Ferguson as British agent Ilsa Faust was well-done. She is a strong, confident female character. I like that she bear a striking resemblance to fellow Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman to the point, that her character in this movie is a film reference to Bergman's character, Ilsa Lund from 1942's Casablanca. I like that the title character last name comes from the German legend Faust. It gives the impression that the main character is making an ill-fated deal with the devil. I also love the fact, whenever, Ilsa makes a scene, you can hear the music from Turandot, playing the background. It makes a classic spy feel to her character. I also love that Simon Pegg is given more to do, in this movie, besides his comedy shtick. Kudos to Simon Pegg's acting, the fact that Benji pretty much tears up as he angrily refuses to sell out Ethan to the CIA to avoid being branded a traitor, was wonderful to watch. One thing, that I didn't like, about his character was the odd product placement of him playing Halo 5 at his work desk. Come on, movie! You didn't need to do that! Anyways, the rest of the supporting actors were, just as good as the main actors. The Synicate figurehead, played by Sean Harris is the closest Rogue Nation comes to a traditional James Bond type villain. His delivery is cold and eerily. I like how his real motivations are left unelaborated. The only actor that I left wasn't given much to do was Jeremy Renner as William Brandt. It's kinda sad, that he spent, most of the film, arguing with Alec Baldwin's character, rather than doing some action scenes. It's weird that in one time, Jeremy Renner was the man that was supposed to replace Tom Cruise. Now, I feel like, he's just getting wasted. The movie also lacks the cool exotic locations of the previous films. I felt like the scenes in Austria and Morocco, were film, way too similar to the old locations of Prague and Abu Dhabi. Then, there is the fact, that some of the scenes in the film, were way too similar, to the other spy genre films, like the James Bond series. I do like the movie doesn't shine away, that the fact, they were mirroring it. The movie even hint of a James Bond/Mission Impossible, crossover, in the end, with the cameo of Aston Martin DB5. That will be very entertaining. Anyways, it was very wise for Paramount Pictures brought forward the release of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation to avoid competing with 2015's Spectre. I love how Rogue Nation is also a more love-letter to the 1960's TV series, compare to the other films, in which, they were based on. I love the fact, that they're still using the uber-popular 1990's version of the Mission: Impossible song as well. Overall: While, the film not as good as Ghost Protocol. I still have to say, it's a good popcorn movie. It's worth the watch."
"willrussellreviews","8","4","8","1 August 2015"," Fifth installment in tremendously popular spy franchise really packs a punch.
","For a fifth installment in a franchise, this film was extraordinary. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation definitely exceeded my expectations. The fact that a good percentage of the death- defying stunts in this movie were done without the use of special effects is enough to guarantee enough ticket sales to regain the film's impressive $150 million production budget. This PG-13-rated movie delivers plenty of edge-of-your-seat action, which is aided by the perfectly-timed quips of Simon Pegg, throughout its 131-minute runtime. The cinematography is absolutely wonderful, and as for content that parents of younger children may object too, there isn't much aside from the films intense chase/combat sequences and some mild profanity sprinkled throughout the script. Overall, this is one expertly-crafted espionage thriller that you won't want to miss. <br/><br/>Score: 85% Age Recommendation: 11+"

","Plot: With the IMF now disbanded and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) out in the cold, a new threat -- called the Syndicate -- soon emerges. The Syndicate is a network of highly skilled operatives who are dedicated to establishing a new world order via an escalating series of terrorist attacks. Faced with what may be the most impossible mission yet, Ethan gathers his team and joins forces with Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), a disavowed British agent who may or may not be a member of this deadly rogue nation.<br/><br/>This is easily the best Mission Impossible film. Each scene is filled with great amounts of tension and atmosphere. The Action is superbly done especially the motorcycle chase which is exciting. Everyone in the cast is superb, Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin, and Ving Rhames are superb in their roles, but newcomer Rebecca Ferguson is fantastic as a very complex character who's very mysterious. The villain is very creepy and well thought out unlike the one in the Ghost Protocol who was entirely pointless to the whole movie. My only problem was the pacing being slow at times, but that is it.<br/><br/>Overall, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is a fun ride from start to finish with exciting action, great visuals, a talented cast and easily the best story and script of any of the films.

"sujanfaster","9","4","8","30 July 2015"," Formula'd for perfection
","You want action in the air? You got it. On land? You got it. Underwater? You got it. When it comes to the Mission Impossible series the title itself gives away that it's a no-brainer and you would be a fool only if you try to make more sense of it. After a not so entertaining Jack Reacher, Christopher McQuarrie more than makes up for it with the 5th film of the MI franchise. <br/><br/>This film picks up from where Ghost Protocol left and in fact it even almost carries the same theme of the IMF being disowned. Like Ghost Protocol, the story travels between countries and beautiful locations as well. This time Tom Cruise is working alone as Ethan Hunt trying to save the IMF from an attack by another high skilled rogue organization called 'The Syndicate' where he is later joined by Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn. Tom Cruise once again does jaw-dropping unreal stunts but with the way they have been shot one wouldn't mind watching it again and again. There is everything in this movie that a typical Mission Impossoble movie would have, an outrageous stunt, the ridiculous mas, a very good chase sequence (this time with bikes and more scenic), different countries, that last minute finishing stunt sequence which you know has a happy ending but still keeps you on your toes, the wry humour, the formulaic accusation on the lead character and him being hunted by the government and the list goes on... So what's the difference? There is no difference. The movie sticks to its old school ways and with extra humour and epic shot action sequences can almost manage a 'nothing' story. The MI franchise has become such a cult that it is hard to ignore unless it makes something way too awkward.<br/><br/>You can see stretch marks on Tom Cruise with his aging, but hey, that hardly takes away his energy. He is good as ever with the role of Ethan Hunt and still manages to keep everyone entertained with his expressions. Simon Pegg has a meatier role in this movie and through his role one can see the importance given to comedy as per the recent Hollywood trend. Simon Pegg has almost equal screen-space as Tom Cruise. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames are fun but don't have much to do as the Tom Cruise-Simon Pegg chemistry is unbeatable. Simon McBurney and Alec Baldwin fit in their typical 'boss' roles. However I found that Rebecca Ferguson's role as Ilsa could have been well written though she tries hard looking sexy. Sean Harris as Lane- the prime antagonist has a very impressive villainous voice. <br/><br/>This was one of the few movies in the recent times where I didn't even look at my watch for a second. It was very hard to take my eyes off from the movie. Yes I know its a very cheesy no-brainer formulaic movie. But everyone has a cheat meal in their diet don't they? Go indulge in one. Do watch it in IMAX!!"

I am sure it would be more interesting isn't it? XD<br/><br/>In summary it is worth to watch! :)"
"helmutty","8","4","8","30 July 2015"," An equally thrilling yet safe installment to the franchise
","Tom Cruise is back and though he is ageing, he still proves he is capable of stunts. Mission: Impossible - Rough Nation is an action-packed thrill ride but everything is familiar from the mysterious organisation to the double-cross agent. It does not deliver anything we have not seen in the Mission: Impossible franchise. Luckily, director Christopher McQuarrie injects the same thrilling energy into his set pieces and keeps the pace fast enough.<br/><br/>The story: IMF is disbanded and a wanted Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is determined to bring down a mysterious organisation, the Syndicate. Yes, that is all the story offers. The series of action set piece push the story forward. Director Christopher is known for his smaller film, Jack Reacher. From the get-go, he is determined to show that he can handle an action film on a bigger scale. The beginning shows Ethan hanging for his dear life on an airplane. And the action gets bigger and disappointingly balloons down in the climax. This is one of those action films where the climax cannot top the big action scenes in the beginning and middle. The notable action scenes are in the opera and an extended set piece where Ethan breaks into a power station and ends up on a thrilling motorcycle chase. Perhaps Christopher realised that he could not top them so he opted for a more personal and smaller scaled climax. Acting wise is the usual in the franchise. Newcomer Rebecca Ferguson plays a decent character. Music by Joe Kraemer is great.<br/><br/>Overall: Is it worthy to be in the franchise? Yes, it is. It has all what a Mission: Impossible film needs. However, as with Tom Cruise ageing, the franchise is close to loosing its steam with its already-seen-it-all plot. What this franchise could do is to have a fresh take on the spy genre. With the sixth film announced, let's hope it can be something more than just a big- bang action film."

","So I went to the premier with Jurassic World expectations(not really expecting much but hoping I have a Fun time) and it exceeded my expectations by far. The bar FOR ME was set with MI:3 which up to this point was not just the best MI film but one of my favorites films as well. Not even Ghost Protocol which I know a lot of people held as number 1 was better then MI:3 in my opinion(for me it's extremely over rated) but this Did <br/><br/>Rogue Nation is by far the best in the series in every was shape and form(except 3 still has the best Villain) it did so much for me and I loved every single minute. One of my biggest critics ms with this franchise is every film they change the team except for hunt. Here they managed to bring in the best from each team and put them in one film. Simon Pegg, Ving Rames and Jerry Renner were all great. I need to give a shout out to Rebecca Furguson cause if I don't it would be a disservice to the fans. She was phenomenal in this film. Easily the best Hunt girl(as I'm starting that name tag) She was stand out. Not only is she a beautiful woman but she kicked so much ass and really proved herself as an action star/heroin. My big disappointment is we all know she won't return. They never bring back the female leads, even Hunts Wife was written out of 4 after 3 being all about how Hunt want to have a life with her outside of IMF(big problem for me in 4) but hopefully they understand what they have here and bring her back too. <br/><br/>Now this rating my be high for a lot of you on here but as I stated this film passed MI3 which is one of my favorite films. I'm giving it a 10/10. I had no complaints even the score was a stand out which has never been done in the past. <br/><br/>Now for those who may think it's too high I really don't care. I don't look at every aspect of a film when it comes to these kinds of movie like cinematography(which was also amazing) I ask weather I enjoyed the film as a whole and I did. Is this on the same level as shawshank which may not be my Favorite film(it's up there) but in my opinion is the best film ever made of course not but when I look back I had no criticisms with it"

"tomgillespie2002","5","2","3","14 August 2018"," Lacks an identity
","One of the aspects of the Mission: Impossible franchise that really helps separate it from the conveyor belt of action/spy/thriller movies that hit our cinema screens and streaming services every year is the idea of introducing a new director for each new entry. Such an approach helps prevent fatigue from Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and whatever team he assembles, and gives each film its own feel without disrupting the flow of the series. Brian De Palma riddled his movie with unbearable moments of tension, while John Woo favoured slow-motion gunplay. J.J. Abrams introduced a darker tone to the proceedings, only for Brad Bird to lighten the tone while packing more of a physical punch. They aren't all great, but you can at least recognise a style. Christopher McQuarrie was the choice to envision part five, and with him he brings a bland, by-the-numbers style that infected his previous movie, the Tom Cruise vehicle Jack Reacher.<br/><br/>What also has helped this series to survive over the years are set-pieces built around real stunts and genuine danger. In this regard, Rogue Nation doesn't disappoint, although it clearly blows its load far too early. If you've seen the trailer, you'll know the film's signature jaw-dropping moment involves Tom Cruise clinging to the side of a plane as it takes off, the ground behind him shrinking rapidly with each passing second. Simon Pegg's Benji Dunn frantically bashes an iPad while Jeremy Renner's returning William Brandt barks panicked directions over loud-speaker, and it's all edited to guarantee maximum thrills. In fact, the entire first half of the film manages to maintain this exciting pace, delivering a high speed motorcycle chase and a stealthy mission in the Vienna Opera House. Plot has never been the strong suit of this franchise, and things grind to a halt when McQuarrie decides to slow things down for the finale. A plot involving the kidnapping of 'the British Prime Minister' (played by Tom Hollander) and a shadowy organisation called The Syndicate are plot devices straight out of James Bond, and it often feels like Rogue Nation is simply trying to be America's version of Britain's most popular fictional spy.<br/><br/>McQuarrie does have some aces hidden up his sleeve however, and the biggest of these is Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, a fellow spy working within the Syndicate for her own dubious reasons. While her character shares no chemistry with her lead co-star, she makes a fantastic impression in the action stakes as she repeatedly crosses paths with Hunt, and hordes of bad guys, in the field. Cruise does share great chemistry with Simon Pegg however, and although the Shaun of the Dead star is little more than comic relief and the guy who can push a few buttons on his laptop and open any door in the world, his screen time with Cruise helps to humanise Hunt, which is important in a universe looking to turn its hero into an unstoppable super agent. It's a perfectly passable two hours, but will likely fade from memory mere seconds after the credits have rolled. Unlike the lit fuse during the opening credits, Rogue Nation fails to explode into life, fizzling out when the film starts to think that this series can be anything more than a bunch of people chasing a McGuffin and having to retrieve a few things in spectacular fashion along the way. Woo's effort remains the worst in the series, but Rogue Nation lacks an identity. While the first hour is certainly fun, it often feels like McQuarrie is auditioning for a different franchise altogether."

","The IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is shut down as reckless, dangerous and has no proof that a shadow organization called the Syndicate exists to destroy the IMF. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is now on the run from the C.I.A.'s Hunley (Alec Baldwin) as he is blamed for assassinating a foreign minister. Hunt must gather his team to prove the Syndicate exists and to clear his name. <br/><br/>The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the special effects, CGI (and they are spectacular) and Tom Cruise who still is touted as doing his own stunts. And all of this is good, but this Mission Impossible movie is not as good as previous ones. It is simply stunt after stunt after stunt and so on. There appears to be a rush to get to these stunts seemingly to avoid real dialogues and getting to know the players. <br/><br/>However, there is a bright spot in here and that is Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa, a MI6 agent who is undercover in the Syndicate's organization run by Lane (Sean Harris) to bring it down. She is pretty, can act and she can fight which is a new wrinkle in Mission Impossible movies. <br/><br/>Notables: Jeremy Renner as Brandt, Simon Pegg as Benji, and Ving Rhames as Luther who are all part of Hunt's IMF team<br/><br/>Maybe what I am looking for is more of a story in the vein of a LeCarre novel with the CGI and Tom Cruise stunts.

","Rogue Nation has all of the attributes that made the last film a success. incredible stunt work, high-octane action and humor.

As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, they were all terrific, especially Tom Cruise, who is like a bottle of fine wine, that gets better with age. The story, which is always the weakest aspect of this type of films, was actually the most involving of the franchise; although it was a bit muddled. It looks like this franchise has a lot of life left in it. And seeing how the last two films have outdone the previous efforts, Fallout should really be something special."

"williampsamuel","9","1","1","16 March 2019"," Even Better Than Ghost Protocol
","Given the critical and commercial success that Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol enjoyed a few years ago, it was inevitable that Cruise would be back for another instalment of the franchise. And so once again it's up to Ethan Hunt to save the world from international terrorists. And this time he'll be doing it as Washington's most wanted man.<br/><br/>Hardly has the movie even begun before Impossible Missions Force is disbanded and absorbed by the CIA, which promptly declares Hunt a rogue agent and orders him brought in. So with the CIA's best men on his trail, and precious little intel to help him, he has to track down and dismantle the shadowing international terrorist group known only as the Syndicate. A group that knows far more about him than he does about it. These are long odds even for Hunt, but then doing the impossible is his business.<br/><br/>His best hope lies with Ilsa Faust, a former British agent with connections to the Syndicate and a seeming attraction to him. Played by the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson, she is a very interesting character. She's smart, seductive, and very good in a fight, but you never can tell who's side she's on, if anyone's. It's clear that she has her own agenda and it's hard to tell if anything she's saying is the truth. But she's the closest thing Ethan has to an ally, and he can't seem to resist the allure of a dangerous woman in need of help.<br/><br/>The plot is surprisingly smart for a summer popcorn flick, with sudden twists and reversals worthy of a recent Bond or Batman movie. Of course both the good guys' and bad guys' plans are excessively complicated and their success relies on a degree of timing and luck that would be impossible in real life, but who really cares? The action and plot twists are so tautly paced and slickly executed that suspension of disbelief is never a problem. It is a bit tedious how quickly the movie resorts to the clichéd plot device of the incompetent/corrupt CIA, but thankfully that ends up going in an entirely different direction than expected, with major narrative and comedic payoff.<br/><br/>The action is of course excellent, with well-staged shootouts and car chases aplenty, and an opening sequence that would do a Bond movie proud. It also goes without saying that there is plenty of the high suspense the series is known for, especially in the obligatory high tech infiltration scene. And lest things get too serious, the tension is balanced by a great deal of very effective comic relief. Simon Pegg is hilarious as always as Benjie, Hunt's high strung and not entirely field capable tech specialist; his reactions shots during the Moroccan car chase are absolutely priceless. Nor is the movie afraid to score laughs at its star's expense, even poking subtle fun at Cruise's limited stature. With its ever present sense of humor and occasionally self-deprecating tone, the MI franchise is well on its way to establishing itself as the lighter alternative to the current Bond series.<br/><br/>All in all, Rogue Nation is stylish, smart, and self aware, with just the right blend of adrenaline, suspense, and humor. Between this film and Ghost Protocol, I'd say that Cruise, director Christopher McQuarrie, and Paramount have perfected their formula for wildly entertaining spy thrillers. Here's looking forward to the next installment."

"AnishMisra","9","1","1","25 July 2018"," Mission Impossible Rogue Nation Review
","Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. After the exciting 4th instalment, I was pumped up for this one. And it again just delivers spot-on.<br/><br/>Plot: Ethan Hunt and his IMF team are against a rogue organisation, termed as the Syndicate who would wipe anyone out of their way to achieve their objective.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Chris McQuarrie and Drew Pearce (co-writer) infuse their new and vibrant energy into this franchise because of which it never feels old or run out of fuel. The story is very impressive and I liked the way the film covered the previous 4 installments. I would not be wrong saying that this film was teased during the last moments of the last part. I think the makers were going in for an arc spanning 2-3 films. But that doesn't mean the film doesn't stand on its own. It does and very beautifully. There are certain characters that are stretched and explored more which I liked. Even the new characters don't seem disposable and bring a lot to the film. The action scenes are just great and never feel over the top (especially the car and bike chase set in Morocco). The VFX of the film also does wonders and adds to the beauty of the film. The music by Joe Kraemer impresses on various levels. The cinematography and editing are top-notch. The film faltered only on one aspect: the climax. Normally, I do expect the M;I finale to be a big blast and full of tension creating adrenaline moments. But here I felt the film was going the expected way and I wasn't surprised. It felt very ordinary. Maybe FALLOUT will explain those events.<br/><br/>Performances: Tom Cruise is as usual in his best and gives a great performance. His dedication to his work and especially towards the action scenes is always felt. Jeremy Renner contributes to the film in his own special way. I liked Simon Pegg's character being more dramatic than of a comic relief. Rebecca Ferguson brings in new energy to the films and I can't wait to see her in FALLOUT. So does Alec Baldwin. Sean Harris's portrayal of Solomon Lane was kind of different and I liked the way he was characterized.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Benji confronts Ethan about Ethan sending him back to DC and Benji saying that he should be with Ethan since they are a team. This has an effect on me as it showed a different side of Benji which I never expected. Also, shown so beautifully is Ethan's concern for others.<br/><br/>Verdict: ROGUE NATION has added another fun-filled, action-thriller ride to the M: I Series. I had a fun time with the entire series. Just waiting for FALLOUT to come. Can't wait for it.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."

","I don't watch the MI franchise anymore to make a connection with what was one of my favourite TV programmes growing up. I still like it though when a subtle or sometimes not so subtle reference comes into view but let's face it, I might as well be watching the latest Bourne or Bond for all the difference between these big spy-thriller franchises.<br/><br/>Like Bond or Bourne, it will start with some jaw-droppingly stunning rescue or escape sequence to act as a prelude to the main film which then reveals itself as usually some fiendishly cunning plan by some mad scientist / megalomaniac which sees the team end up in interesting or exotic locations to resolve even if at times it seems impossible, before the big fake-out at the end puts the world back to normal.<br/><br/>Things I liked about this entry; the fast-segment sequence over the still great theme music with scenes you never remember having seen when they eventually arrive in the actual film, the way the age-old ""Your mission, should you decide to accept it"" introduction sequence was turned on its head, the tried and tested use of masks for masquerade purposes plus some of the stunts were exciting, including the plane-hitching scene-setter, and Ethan's underwater raiding of a security vault. I also liked Jeremy Renner's character in the film and the neat trap sprung on Mr Big which saved the day.<br/><br/>Things I liked less, Simon Pegg's Benjy is starting to grate on me, there was yet another high-speed car chase, this time pitting two wheels against four which had a seen-it-all-before air to it plus of course Tom Cruise as ever runs fit to burst his Fitbit.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong it was fine to disengage my brain for a couple of hours but I still think the great great TV show of my youth would have been better served by a cogent TV rather than cinematic reboot."

"Ben-Hibburd","7","1","1","29 July 2017"," Mission: Impossible Rouge Nation Review
","2015 was a prolific year for spy films, we had The Man From Uncle, Spy, Spectre, and of course Mission: Impossible - Rouge Nation which is the best of the bunch. Rouge Nation is Tom Cruise's fifth outing as IMF super spy Ethan Hunt. Mission: Impossible is a franchise that has constantly changed and evolved with every incarnation. This is mostly down to the franchise having different directors that have their own take on the story.<br/><br/>I watched this film upon its initial release in the cinema, and whilst I liked the film then, I didn't think it was particularly memorable. Whilst I still find that true to some degree, upon my re-watch it's definitely a whole lot more fun and engaging then I initially gave it credit for.<br/><br/>The opening scene is the obvious go to argument for the best set piece of the film. It's a fantastic sequence, which is perpetuated by the fact that Tom Cruise is literally hanging off the side of a plane as it's taking off. It's a piece of film-making that solidifies Tom Cruise's position as one of the most dedicated actors of his generation. The film is worth watching just for the opening five minutes. Thankfully though the film doesn't rest on its laurels as it could quite easily of done.<br/><br/>The best sequence of the film, in this humble reviewers opinion is the Opera scene. As Ethan Hunt and partner Benji(played with fantastic comedic enthusiasm by Simon Pegg.) race against time as they try to prevent the assassination of the Austrian chancellor, by a shadowy criminal organisation only known as the Syndicate. The Syndicate is lead by an ex British secret agent called Solomon Lane. Sean Harris tries his best to be a menacing figure as Lane, but fails to convince as a legitimate omnipresent villain in the film. His character is poorly thought out and given very little depth. He becomes yet another throwaway villain in the Mission: Impossible canon.<br/><br/>Whilst on the other hand newcomer to the series, and the female lead of the film Rebecca Ferguson feels like a breath of fresh air for the franchise. She plays a British double agent Ilsa Faust. She does a fantastic job of portraying a complete bad-ass that can beat up anyone in her way, or through her alluring sensuality. She's given the most depth and made the most sympathetic character as a turncoat agent whose loyalties are never trusted, at-least until she no longer requires certain characters expertise.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarie does a terrific job directing the film. The editing, and action scenes are top notch. They are well put together and the action flows seamlessly, they are coherent unlike a-lot of big budget action films. The film does have issues in the script department, especially with the main villain. It's also fairly predictable in some areas. Whilst this does slightly detract from the film, it's made up for by a fantastic female lead, and a great supporting cast. Overall Rouge Nation is a lot of fun, and one of the better action films from 2015."
"scavenius77","2","6","15","27 November 2015"," Pre-fabricated, unintelligent, UN - suspenseful ""actionfilm""
","Now this is a stupid movie!. <br/><br/>First of all. The first 10 minutes of the film doesn't make any sense. There's a guy with some grass on his head trying to communicate something ""The plane must be stopped!"" Is it really supposed to be funny? Is it a parody? Renner looks like they stripped of his Robin Hood- costume from ""The Avengers"" and then somebody gave him an Armani suit and some indifferent lines. Then Mr. Hunt shows up or Mr. Huntly!!!! as he is later called. There's was no suspense in this scene at all. It was just a stupid stunt and some ""funny"" lines as to which door the guy with the grass on his head should open so that Huntly could get into the plane and stop the bad guys!!! <br/><br/>And the rest of the movie was just a descent into more and more UN - suspenseful scenes, and then some people in a room in Armani-suits talking about NOTHING! and then another boring ""action""-sequence. <br/><br/>The actors in this movie looked and acted like they were in a car-commercial. Actually the best actor in this film was the guy with grass on his head, a least he tried. <br/><br/>Tom - hollow-man - Cruise was just so uninspired in his acting. Once he was actually a descent actor in movies like ""Born on the fourth of July"", ""the color of money"", ""Magnolia"", ""Interview with a Vampire"" etc, but the last many years he has just become more and more uninteresting and boring. There is no surprises or edges to his acting anymore. It feels like he has studied the scene in his head and maybe in front of the mirror and then when he the next day are going to perform the scene; he does precisely the same as he did the night before in his hotel. Every hand gesture, look, breath is studied, therefor there is no room for surprises, hence, as Homer would say; BOOOORING. <br/><br/>Alec Baldwin looks like he can't wait to finish his scenes and honestly he is given nothing to work with: ""Let's find Hunt!"" - ""Where is Hunt?"" - ""Have you found Hunt?"". <br/><br/>Brian De Palma made a serious and very suspenseful film with the first ""Mission Impossible"". Measured, intelligent with a few very good surprises (as there should be in these kind of films. Cruise was perfectly cast as the cocky and naive hero and the rest of the cast was supporting him and the story very well.<br/><br/>Then came in John slow-mo Woo and made an deliciously looking but stupid action film.<br/><br/>Abrahams made an OK action film in number 3. <br/><br/>Number 4 and 5 is an insult to an audience. Maybe some 8-9 year old will find it entertaining (I DOUBT IT) but I am not kidding when I am saying that we all would be better off without MI4 and especially MI5 which crosses every line of idiotic and is quite simply put not a film but a collection of commercial - like scenes which involves people looking stupid into the distance, some running, swimming, shooting etc. All of them totally drained of any suspense!<br/><br/>You want ACTION AND SUSPENSE see ""MAD MAX : FURY ROAD""<br/><br/>If you want a noisy sleeping - pill watch MI5<br/><br/>This message will not self - destruct in 10 seconds but hopefully the MI - franchise will!!"

As always it would not be Mission Impossible without the legendary Mission Impossible musical score and now 3-D printed masks. They even threw in a few extra heart-stopping, pulse racing stunt action. The motorcycle chase was even better than the Mini Cooper thrill ride of The Italian Job. <br/><br/>Simon Pegg & Ving Rhames are truly Cruise's Yin n Yang.

"schroeder-gustavo","9","4","9","1 August 2015"," Evidence the franchise still has stories left to tell
","Like all Mission: Impossible movies, Rogue Nation is directed by a different director than the last one, this time around being Christopher McQuarrie and it has Tom Cruise come back as Ethan Hunt and we get to see many of the awesome characters of the franchise back and we also get newer cool characters, as well.<br/><br/>First of all and needless to say, Cruise owns the role of Ethan Hunt. Watching him perform all his stunts and just his magnetic personality on the big screen is simply a pleasure. I love the fact that this movie brought back the cool characters of past M:I installments, such as Luther Stickell, played by Ving Rhames, who is also great; Benji, played by the incredibly funny Simon Pegg, who is, by the way a huge bright stop in this film. He brings so much comedy and charisma to the screen, he is an amazing character and I'm glad they decided to give him a bigger role in this one. Jeremy Renner also comes back and we are introduced to new great characters in Alec Baldwin's character and in the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson. She kicks so much ass in this movie and she is a great addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation combines the best elements of the franchise, being suspense and action and as a combination, this is the best job the franchise has done. I have no spoilers in this review, but there is an entire sequence in the movie involving an opera: that entire sequence is one of the BEST I HAVE SEEN in my life. The suspense was great and the build up was amazing. The use of music throughout the film is great, and it's a weird topic to bring up but the Mission: Impossible theme is used so well in this movie and better than in any other M:I film. The movie looks stunning, I love the way the movie was shot and there aren't like a million angles in every action sequence, so one can really actually sit back and enjoy the action.<br/><br/>That being said I do believe the movie is flawed, as some things may come off as a little cliché of spy-action movies and the pacing isn't always perfect. The movie is not a boring one, at all, that is not what I'm saying, but sometimes a huge action set takes place, and then the movie slows down for a while, and then it picks up back again, so it isn't constant.<br/><br/>Those are all the complaints I have about Rogue Nation, I have to say I really enjoyed it, I STILL stand by Ghost Protocol being the best in the franchise, but this definitely comes close. And this movie gets something very right that Ghost Protocol got very wrong: A compelling and interesting villain."
"subxerogravity","8","4","9","1 August 2015"," The best one yet, and one of the best spy movies yet!
","I'm very impress with Rogue Nation. Possibly the most impossible mission Rogue Nation had was trying to make an American action block buster that's sophisticated, intelligent, and heart pounding, and it pulls it off magnificently. I love the last Mission impossible and this one just out did that.<br/><br/>I would like to think that the full return of Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell had a lot to do with the success, but movie star Tom Cruise has proved that this franchise is more than just a pay check for him, he believes in the quality of his work, and we get quality. <br/><br/>""In this exciting episode"", Ethan Hunt and his team go up against The Syndicate, which acts as MIF's arch enemy being the exact opposite of what they are. The Mysterious man who leads the Syndicate was a great villain. <br/><br/>The action scenes in this movie are fantastic. Every Mission impossible movie has that one task Ethan has to do that lives up to the title, and the one he does in the movie is far more impressive than all the hoopla about Tom Cruise hanging from a plane they used to advertise the movie. Plus the chase scenes in this movie were excellent and there were a lot of them. Tom gets back on the motorcycle and it's excellent.<br/><br/>If you like Simon Pegg than you should love this film, as he acts as Tom's unlikely sidekick throughout the film. I feel sorry for Jeremy Renner who was supposed to be the sidekick according to Ghost Protocol, but Pegg's Benji Dunn makes more sense as the brains behind Hunts Brawn. Plus Cruise and Pegg do great comedy relief. Plus, Alec Baldwin is in the movie and I'm a fan.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation has up the scale on the Mission Impossible franchise. It's everything we love about all the films, but this latest episode puts it on a new level just like a great sequel should."
"griffolyon12","10","4","9","31 July 2015"," The Best Mission to Date
","It is very rare for a film series to actually get better with each subsequent installment, but that is exactly how the Mission: Impossible series rolls. Rogue Nation is the fifth installment in the film series that started all the way back in 1996 (that film in itself based off of the Sixties TV series), but Rogue Nation is really the first Mission: Impossible film to bring together every element that worked in the previous films to make the most complete Mission: Impossible to date.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise once again is the face of the IMF as agent Ethan Hunt, tracking down a clandestine shadow organization known as the Syndicate, who is always just one step ahead of Hunt. Making Hunt's mission even more impossible is the fact that the US government has shuttered the IMF after their cowboy actions in Ghost Protocol that nearly saw San Francisco obliterated by a nuke because Hunt willingly gave a terrorist nuclear launch codes in order to try and catch him. Of course, Hunt has gone rogue in every single Mission: Impossible movie that has ever been made, so it's no surprise that he continues to evade the CIA (led by Alec Baldwin) while trying to bring down the Syndicate. However, like Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation has a greater attention to the team element than most of the previous Mission films with Simon Pegg back as funny gadget guy Benji, Jeremy Renner back as analyst Brandt, and Ving Rhames back as hacker Luther. Then there is the new addition of Rebecca Ferguson as the mysterious, butt- kicking Ilsa Faust, who is either a double agent helping Ethan bring down the Syndicate from within, or is actually in the Syndicate and is playing Ethan and his team.<br/><br/>While it may seem like there is a lot going on in this film, it all feels organic and the story clips along at a very brisk pace, always making sense (which was a problem I had with Ghost Protocol). Then there is the stronger villain presence in this film than in Ghost Protocol, with Sean Harris portraying the cold-blooded head of the Syndicate who is always outsmarting Ethan at every turn (though Philip Seymour Hoffman in M:I:III is still the series best bad guy). While I have to concede that Ghost Protocol had better gags, Rogue Nation utilizes Simon Pegg better than he has been utilized in any of his previous two Mission films and that in itself leads to some good comedic beats featuring Benji. Another thing that Rogue Nation really does better than most of its predecessors is action aiding the story. All of the action scenes are exquisitely orchestrated and are some of the franchise's best. Of course, the thing that makes Rogue Nation the best Mission film is it really plays off of the relationships established between these characters in a way that no other Mission film has done.<br/><br/>Having gotten to know Simon Pegg's Benji for three films now, we actually get to see more of a friendship between Benji and Hunt than ever before, and that idea of friendship is echoed in the characters of Brandt and Luther. Most of the Mission: Impossible films never really brought back the previous teammates, but with the past two films they have made a concentrated effort at creating this team and it finally pays off here with some nice emotional moments between all of them. There is arguing between them, but there is also a level of trust and a willingness to do anything to save one another's lives that was never there in any of the previous films, which makes you care more. Then there is the new friendship forged between Ethan and Ilsa that is very engaging because it is so different from any of Ethan's previous relationships with women in these movies. It also doesn't hurt that Rebecca Ferguson is insanely awesome in this movie.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, you really feel like you have gone on a ride in Rogue Nation. The plot is full of twists and turns, something one should expect with writer/director Christopher McQuarrie having written The Usual Suspects, and the action is thrilling and intense, with McQuarrie really flexing his directorial muscles with only his third film as a director. You will have fun with Rogue Nation like you have with every previous Mission: Impossible, but you will also be treated to a smart story that you have think about with some emotional consequences at the core that McQuarrie really milks in one beautiful sequence near the end where all sound drops out of the film and we go into slo-mo. It's a smart choice in a film full of smart choices.<br/><br/>I give Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation a series best 10 out of 10!"
"roman-arbisi","9","4","9","31 July 2015"," A Mission That Is Not Impossible To Accept
","This is one mission to the movie theater that you want to accept.<br/><br/>'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' follows Ethan Hunt and his team around the world in search of an anti-IMF agency known as, the Syndicate. Tasked with their most impossible mission yet, Ethan must make new alliances and stop the Syndicate at all costs, even if the mission has been deemed.........impossible.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, and the surprising Rebecca Ferguson star in the fifth installment to the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise, and this time it's back and better than ever! With Christopher McQuarrie at the helm of this project, some were a little hesitant due to his last outing, 'Jack Reacher', but rest assured he does a great job all around.<br/><br/>'Rogue Nation' all around is a strong movie, not only in the summer blockbuster category but as a film in general. The stunts are death defying, the action is some of the most intense this year, the characters are strong, the comedy blends in perfectly with the action, the narrative is easy to follow as it never tries to over-complicate itself, and the villain's presence is felt as they(?) lurk in the shadows keeping our main set of characters on edge and always in a hurry. The pace never slows down and is very self aware when it might begin to lose traction and lose it's audience's attention. Thanks to some of the best action set pieces and a strong but simple narrative that 2015 has offered us, 'Rogue Nation' never becomes boring and always keeps us invested. The stakes are high and felt time and time again as we do find our protagonists constantly in the face of danger and peril.<br/><br/>Speaking of danger and peril, Tom Cruise once again does most if not all of his own stunts and they are breathtaking. Whether he's riding the side of a cargo plane taking flight or holding his breath underwater for six minutes you begin to grip your seat as if Tom/Ethan is actually about to lose their life. The action set pieces blew my mind and got better and better one act after the next, McQaurrie did a magnificent job crafting dangerous and believable action. Each scene, whether it's lengthy exposition or motorcycles rumbling through the streets of Morocco, are shot beautifully with engaging close up shots or awe-inspiring wide shots.<br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson has earned the Star-Lord,""Who?"" treatment. After her shining moments and kick-ass punches and leg kicks in 'Rogue Nation' she will no longer be a simple,""Who?"" Ferguson stands out not only just because she is the only main female cast member but because she kicks LOADS of ass and her character is intriguing and mysterious. Who is she? What does she stand for? What side is she really on? Are all questions that circulate in and out of your head as the movie progresses and you begin to learn more and more about this peculiar character. But Ferguson delivers and acts gracefully opposite Cruise making their scenes together all that more special, as their chemistry is handled to perfection.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does their job as Pegg, Baldwin, Renner, and Rhames play their roles respectively and further prove why they belong in this franchise. Renner's character Brandt challenges Ethan mentally, Pegg as the always lovable Benji will do anything to help Ethan, Rhames as Ethan's franchise long friend Luther is like a guardian to Ethan, and Baldwin is the newest addition but he knows just how talented Ethan really is. All of their roles were significant one way or the other and they all delivered the comedy when needed.<br/><br/>At this point you're probably asking,""Does this movie even have any negatives?"" Well I can assure you that it does, but there aren't many. The movie runs a bit too long in it's final act and you feel the film begin to drag just a bit in it's final moments. The movie has a perfect run-time of 130 minutes but the final act was missing a large set piece, and the absence of a major set piece is what causes the film to skirt to a halt. For all the major action moments during the first two acts I was expecting something super special saved for the final 25-30 minutes. What we did get was some incredibly intense exposition and that's fine but the loss of cars exploding or constant hand on hand combat sadly dried my thirst for more Tom Cruise hanging off of whatever action set piece they had in store.<br/><br/>My final point belongs to the villain(s?). There isn't much to give away here as I don't want too accidentally spoil a twist or major plot points, but the direction McQaurrie took felt right. I can see why it left people wanting more out of the antagonist but it felt proper and necessary. The villain(s?) served it's purpose well enough for narrative purposes and provided Ethan and his team the toughest challenge yet in the franchise.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is a splendid time at the movies this summer and for having just wrapped post-production less than a week ago the film is most impressive. If you're a huge fan of this franchise, Tom Cruise, or breathtaking action then this movie is the right one for you to spend your hard earned dollars on. You will not leave disappointed, I guarantee it.<br/><br/>I give 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' a 9.3 out of 10."
"ThomasDrufke","9","4","9","30 July 2015"," Desperate Times, Desperate Measures
","There are summer blockbusters, and then there are the Mission: Impossible films. I love that the franchise continues to top itself, and doing so without trying to push the envelope to far. This franchise isn't as crazy as say The Fast and Furious franchise, and it's not as serious as the Bond franchise. It finds a perfect balance of realism and absurdity. That balance is probably due to having a new director with a fresh take each and every film. They realized it was pretty hard to top the Burj Khalifa scene in M:I 4, but the stunts and action sequences are just as good. It may not have had the showmanship as that particular scene did, but I don't think an M:I film has ever been so thrilling with wall to wall action. It was also going to be difficult to top Phillip Seymour-Hoffman's villain in M:I 3, and while the villain here doesn't reach the intimate highs that Hoffman had in that film, this baddie does just as much evil being off screen as he does on screen. So I know all film is subjective, and I enjoy almost all of the M:I films, I think Rogue Nation may just be the finest installment yet.<br/><br/>This time out Ethan Hunt and his crew are on the run (or going rogue as they say it) as the IMF is on the Dl after the CIA dissolved them. Everything goes awry when Hunt is captured by Lane's crew but is quickly let go by a mysterious woman by the name of Isla. Let me just say, because I cant wait any longer, where in the world has Rebecca Ferguson been? Or rather, where did she come from? Ferguson plays Isla, and does so marvelously. Most of the film we are left guessing as to which side she truly lies her allegiance with but it really works to the characters benefit. This girl is a complete bada**, and even that doesn't do her justice. I don't know what the plans are for the 6th film, but I sure hope they bring her back. Getting back to Rogue Nation, another reason why this film is one of the best of the summer is it's unpredictability. I loved Ghost Protocol, but after watching it recently, and then now seeing this film, I don't think it holds a candle to Rogue Nation. Even going by the villain here, Solomon Lane, he's a much more maniacal, twisted, psychogenius if you will. But the film has many more surprises in store. I thought by watching all the trailers, and many times I may add, that I would know too much or have seen to much. But I was wrong, there's plenty left to be seen here.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the major action scene that everyone is talking about is the plane scene shown in all the trailers. I was thrilled and shocked to see that it was only the first few minutes and didn't even play a role in the overall plot. It just goes to show you how much the people behind the film had planned. Another great stunt was the underwater extravaganza where Cruise apparently had to learn how to hold his breath for 6 minutes at a time for shooting. Christopher McQuarrie directed this sequence in such a beautiful and surprisingly quiet manner. I loved his long and virtually silent takes as we watched Ethan Hunt nail yet another mission. But I have to be honest, I think the most thrilling part of the entire film was the motorcycle chase sequence. Talk about a gorgeously shot segment, wow. There are few chase sequences that I legitimately thought they were going the miles per hour that they want us to believe. It's one of the best chase scenes in any film for that matter.<br/><br/>The supporting cast in this film all get their time to shine. Even Ving Rhames, who resigned a few films back, gets his screen-time. Jeremy Renner, Brandt, first introduced in Ghost Protocol, doesn't have much action but still has several memorable moments. He even nailed his comedic moments as well, surprisingly. Simon Pegg is of course back as Benji, and his comedy once again hits the spot and never feels out of place. Alec Baldwin also had a small but pivotal role, and still proved to be one of the highlights of the picture. Seriously, all the performances were really great. I think my only gripe about the film was that sometimes the consequences to action sequences didn't feel real enough. I guess I felt that our characters walked away from danger too easily sometimes. Not on a Fast and Furious level, but close. No matter, the film has an incredible cast and lead villain, the first for the franchise in a few films. Not to mention just how well this film is paced from beginning to end and never feeling too long. I have to hand it to Tom Cruise and the crew. That man is mid 50's now and he may have just carried the best M:I film to date. Regardless, this film is loads of fun and definitely one of the best of the summer.<br/><br/>+Pacing <br/><br/>+Cruise still has it <br/><br/>+Everyone shines <br/><br/>+Great villain <br/><br/>+Fight scenes and action pieces <br/><br/>+Rebecca F'in Ferguson!!! <br/><br/>+Thrill ride from beginning to end <br/><br/>-Maybe a Fast and Furious moment here or there <br/><br/>9.5/10"
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","4","9","30 July 2015"," Tom Cruise's passion for this franchise continues to elevate it above more generic fare
","There aren't many film franchises that can have five solid installments, but Mission Impossible has managed it, and that's a real testament to Tom Cruise's passion for this franchise. He'll produce it, he'll throw his considerable Hollywood clout behind it, and he'll literally put his body on the line to make the most thrilling narratives. But not only are the narratives in the film brilliant, but the narrative of ""hey look what crazy stunt Tom Cruise did for his new movie"" is the best free marketing the film could ever get. That alone is worth admiring Tom Cruise for. <br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie, who won an Oscar for penning the brilliant The Usual Suspects, and also wrote one of my personal favourite films Valkyrie, was an interesting choice for director, but he does a truly fantastic job of it. The action scenes are crisp, the performances are great and the whole film strings together really well. When you watch the big conspiracy revelations, that's when you can really feel McQuarrie's mark on the project, which is always great considering that no director has stuck around for multiple films in this franchise. Brad Bird was a big step up from JJ Abrams, who was a step up from John Woo. McQuarrie I think is the best of the lot.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation fixes all of the problems I had with Ghost Protocol. It brings Ving Rhames back and gives him something to do (but not quite enough), it has a fairly decent villain (not quite Phillip Seymour Hoffman level, but a big step up from GP) and the narrative feels complete, it doesn't climax and peter out like in Ghost Protocol did. Tom Cruise is in his element as the back-against-the-wall Ethan Hunt, as always. Simon Pegg was a funny minor character in MI3, a frustrating failure to replace Ving Rhames in GP, but here I really think he hit his stride. He was terrific in the comedic relief, but he also carried one or two of the dramatic scenes with surprising skill. In one scene, Benji is called up for a polygraph and berates the examiners about how Hunt is not his friend. Its really well done by Pegg. Baldwin is always fun to watch, and his character is a believable quasi-antagonist with a great character arc. Renner is amazing in everything, even though he is sidelined with Rhames for much of the film.<br/><br/>The film's real standout is Rebecca Fergusson, this kickass female lead who came out of nowhere to be the most talked-about part of this film. Fergusson has just the right amount of sex appeal to make her engaging, but its her superb action star capability that made her so thrilling to watch. I was never really sure where her loyalties lay, which was one of the best parts of the film, and her chemistry with Cruise was terrific. What I enjoyed most, however, was that her relationship was Hunt was a respectful friendship, and they did not degrade her character by making her another love interest like they did with Thandie Newton in MI2.<br/><br/>The action sequences are thrilling - particularly the car/motorbike chase and the underwater sequence. The latter is no Burj Khalifa or Vault sequence, but those bars are set very high and that doesn't denigrate these. They're also much more memorable than anything Mad Max Fury Road has to offer. I also found the cinematography to be a noteworthy highlight, and the sound mixing and editing is probably the best of the year so far.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's passion for this film franchise, and the abundance of new talent flowing in to be discovered, will keep Mission Impossible alive for many years, and I can't wait to see what they do next. But I really hope Fergusson remains a part of it."
"Megadonna","10","4","9","30 July 2015"," The most fun spy thriller ever created!
","*This contains mild spoilers and jumps straight to the point.*<br/><br/>Yes literally the best! I will likely catch flack for naming this film the best ""spy thriller"" of all time but it is, and I stick to my word. However it isn't *just* fun its also very intelligent, thanks to its director who goes all out in all the best ways. That says a lot especially considering the film was moved up 6 or so months. And no wonder this truly is a summer blockbuster and shouldn't have to compete with any movie however even if it did it would hold its own. Now onto the review:<br/><br/>The opening stunt scene was marvelous and risky as it took the selling point of the movie and put it right at the beginning, but trust me it only gets better. Which says a whole heck of a lot. <br/><br/>Smart script makes for smart action in this scenario. The stunts tell stories, the characters make drastic shifts and the action caries the pace. With that said we also have the actors, mainly Tom Cruise who doesn't let up, let go, or stumble even. At 50+ years old he's still playing a young man's game better then anyone in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson plays the female equal of Hunt and does so marvelously. Simon Pegg is even funnier in this movie then in the previous two he has been in. Heck the whole cast is, this was by far the most amusing of the 5 yet retaining the serious stakes.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames is back and just as good as we remembered but lets not forget Jeremy Renner who was exceptional and had great chemistry with Rhames.<br/><br/>This truly was a thriller, the edge of your seat thriller. One without equal."

","A quid in a charity shop - having enjoyed most of the others, and with this one being the most recent, I couldn't believe my luck! But now I know why someone donated it, and I feel short changed...<br/><br/>The Tom Cruise action series rumbles on and does so in a text book tick- the-box fashion - car chases (tick), chases on foot with gun and fights and stuff (tick), chases in the dark (tick), world wide locations (tick), Cruise being the only one with the 'vision' (tick), Cruise going on the run (tick), subterfuge and deception as standard (tick), the authorities not appreciating Cruise and his IMF chums (tick), Cruise having to do something death defying (tick) several times (tick), Cruise on a motorbike (tick), Cruise going against the advice of his IMF colleagues (tick), guns, lots of guns and gadgets and technology (tick), Cruise saving the girl (tick), the day (tick), the world (tick), etc (tick). <br/><br/>The writers appear to have either fallen asleep or just grown lazy when coming up with this one: the CIA (boo, hiss) want to close down Cruise (hurrah!) and his playmates for not being reliable with saving the world, citing the plots of previous films (breaking into CIA headquarters, destruction of the Kremlin, the missile that didn't wipe out Seattle, etc) to which Jeremy Renner (as Brandt) has to appear before a board of bigwigs and the CIA boss (Alec Baldwin) to argue his case for them not to be closed down (wasn't Renner a field agent in the previous movies? Where was their boss anyway?), which the CIA want, purely so that they can control an out of control Ethan Hawk (Cruise). But when the IMF (Cruise's boys) subsequently gets closed down, and absorbed into the CIA, Cruise goes underground to carry on his investigation into a group that everyone except Cruise (obviously!) believes does not exist. Baldwin decides that Cruise has gone renegade and pursues him like there isn't a bigger problem in the world to occupy his time (incidentally, it is unfortunate that the world moves on and Baldwin now plays the orange US president on SNL, because that was all I could think of in every one of his scenes), even to the point of making it a shoot to kill mission, seemingly because Cruise made a fool of him. There was a beautiful British enemy agent (actually working for the British secret service - or was she?) in a bikini, there was an unemotionally evil criminal boss with a weird voice, there was an evil British government minister with ugly glasses and a dull voice, there were a few evil henchmen who looked as though central casting had been asked to just send some mean-looking east European-looking hombres (own hair not important) along, there was blundering Benji and dependable Luther to do the technical stuff, warn Cruise not to give the secret 'gadget thing' to the opposition and look scared, confused and knowing as required. <br/><br/>Like I said earlier, straight out of a text book; sometimes the end result of a scenario was practically telegraphed, it was so predictable. The mystery came from trying to figure out whether the girl would die before the end of the film, and how the baddie would die (spoiler - he doesn't).<br/><br/>On the DVD there was an additional special feature, a short called Cruise Control, about (surprise surprise) Tom Cruise, a little propaganda piece in favour of Cruise, with his colleagues (from both in front of and behind the camera) telling us that he was a dream to work with, that he was on the side of the movie goer, that he was dedicated to bringing the best film possible to the viewer, etc. My eyes glazed over and as a result I missed the end, but it is safe to assume that Cruise overcame the baddies, got the girl, and saved the world as usual. <br/><br/>I have been of the opinion that M:I2 was the worst of the bunch; it might still be if I can't convince myself that lazy and predictable equals bad."
"d-kampen","8","3","6","25 May 2016"," One of the best M:I movies
","The biggest problem I had with this movie is that it took me a very long time (about 80 minutes) until I got hooked. But from the moment that I got hooked it was great and became better and better every minute, so I thought the ending was absolutely great. The other thing that I didn't really like was that they made this movie far to difficult while the story eventually was pretty simple.<br/><br/>But the best thing in this movie was definitely the action, it's probably the M:I movie with best action. Especially the face-to-face combat was great, I didn't really like the motor chase bit though, but I always think motor/car chase scenes are boring.<br/><br/>The other thing I really liked are the returning actors, because that's the thing that makes a movie series so great, that you get to know and (most off the times) love the characters. The character in the group, Rebecca Ferguson who plays Ilsa Faust, was decent. The thing I did really like about her was that she could handle herself very well in a fight.<br/><br/>The story was okay, nothing really special. But it kinda reminded me of the recent Bond films, the Bourne films and Captain America: Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie a 7.7. I would have given it higher if it got me hooked from second one, but maybe I'll like it more on a second viewing but if that happens I'll update this review. As far as it ranks within the series part 3 is my favorite but this one definitely comes close to it."
"muhammedelgammal_","6","3","6","19 April 2016"," Back for the impossible
","Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise, is back at it again. This movie was interesting, but not quite satisfying.<br/><br/>The timeline of the movie was disappointing. The opening scene should not have been the biggest stunt scene of the movie. That had set extremely high expectations for what was going to follow. But the remainder stunts and scenes of the movie were not anything that spectacular.<br/><br/>There was one scene that was catchy in a way. The car chase did not have any music playing as it was happening. This I actually enjoyed because it drew more attention to the details of the car chase. If music was played in with it, it more than likely would have made it more or less dramatic than what it actually was.<br/><br/>Although the movie did not live up to what it had been portrayed as, it is still a good addition to the Mission Impossible series. Maybe next time, they do not open with the biggest scene of the movie."

He is so very poor in that role, unconvincing, absent of genuine emotion, what a great agent he must have.<br/><br/>And the lead, always ready, lets nothing stop him, and the best he can do when trapped in the listening room at the beginning is to bang against the door and grimace, harshly?

Thanks to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie for giving the audiences an action-packed, adrenaline pumping experience which included Tom's death-defying stunts like hanging outside an aircraft and despite the risks, he pulled it off as usual because he's a real actor who always gives 100 percent in every movie he does. The cast is amazing including Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Ving Rhames. Forget Bond and Bourne because Ethan Hunt is the best secret agent ever.

","To say that ""Rogue Nation"" is the best entry in Mission: Impossible franchise is to say a soft compliment. It's a majestic blend between pop corn blockbuster (lacking story) and an action spectacle with story (usually lacking a big scoop in most movies). Well, this one has it all. I had the honor to see this outing at the cinema and it was mind-blowing. The action and the stunts are practical, without abusing CGI and so well choreographed that doesn't need to expand it all. The story mixed the pace of the fourth installment with the suspense of the first one giving a perfect pay off in its last 30 minutes (full of breathtaking twists and real surprises). Tom Cruise is at the top of his game but the real standout is Rebecca Ferguson. If the next installments come as bright as this one I'll be delightfully. But if they fail by any chance, we will always have this adventure to remind us how high the M:I franchise set the bar."
"vincent-malisse","6","3","6","24 August 2015"," It's like an improbability drive
","There is no doubt that Tom Cruise is still a good actor if it comes down to action movies, even at his age. And as entertaining as the action sequences might be, there was one major thing very and continuously disturbing. The improbability factor (the lack of any realism) in the movie. <br/><br/>You do not walk away from a car that has just flipped 5 times over to start a high speed motorcycle chase without a helmet. I doubt you could do a high speed motorcycle chase without a helmet, period. You do not flip over a cage with bulletproof glass by pushing it a bit. And one does not hang on the side from a plane in full take-off. Just to illustrate a few.<br/><br/>That said, the story, empty as it might be, does take you around and doesn't get boring. There were probably a little too many of the ""how-is-he-going-to-get-out-of-this-one"" moments to my taste, but on the other hand, it is somewhat the signature of the movie. (doing the impossible), Having seen the other 4 movies, however, it does become more predictable.<br/><br/>The other actors hold their own against Tom Cruise and get their fair share of screen time and with a small hint of humor here and there, good special effects and the pace of action versus slow going, the result is a good mix to keep the viewer's attention.<br/><br/>All in all it was a fun movie, be it ""impossible"" ..."

Ferguson as the double agent Ilsa Faust because she was as skilled and smart as Ethan and she was the actual impetus of the movie, she almost stole him the show, a very multi-layered, heroic female character which is rare in such movies.<br/><br/>I really don't want to see another ""Fast & Furious"" version of Mission: Impossible, how about some seriousness for a change."
"MattBrady099","8","3","6","2 August 2015"," Rogue Nation was a solid movie
","""Looks like the mission just got impossible"". - Quote by Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>The story in Rogue Nation is about Ethan Hunt and his team face their biggest and most dangerous threat yet (Would you believe it) The Syndicate, an international rogue group that are as skilled as they are deadly - and their number one goal is to eliminate the IMF.<br/><br/>Before I talk about Rogue Nation here is all my thoughts on the previous Mission Impossible movies. The first movie in my opinion was decent and a lot of hard work went into that film, I mean you look at the behind the scenes of the first movie people really worked they ass of on that movie and to me it paid off nicely. I give the first movie a strong 3/5 star's.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 2 was pretty terrible to be honest. I felt like I was watching a different movie because to me I didn't feel like the first movie or even a Mission Impossible movie. I'm giving Mission Impossible 2 a 2/5 star's.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 3 really got things back on track after the messy MI 2. Philip Seymour Hoffman was a great villain and JJ. Abrams did a good job directing the action scenes and the whole movie. I'm giving the third one a 3½ / 5 star's.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol was pretty good. The actions scenes and the characters are the highlight of the movie. My only problem with the movie is that the villain was a bit weak and wasn't really that menacing. Overall I'm giving Ghost Protocol movie a solid 4/5 star's.<br/><br/>And now for Rogue Nation and it was a very enjoyable movie and I liked it a little more than Ghost Protocol.<br/><br/>I was a bit worried but at the same time interesting on what Christopher McQuarrie will bring to a franchise like this, because this is the same guy who directed Jack Reacher and I though that movie was okay but nothing special. Brad Bird was originally suppose to direct this movie but dropped out because he wanted to direct Tomorrowland and then Christopher McQuarrie stepped in. After seeing the movie I'm so happy to say that Christopher McQuarrie did a great job directing this movie as he added a lot to this movie when it comes to action and it's characters. McQuarrie really gave the actions scenes a feeling of rush and the action never got stale after wards like some action movies do after awhile. Nicely done Christopher McQuarrie.<br/><br/>It's crazy how Tom Cruise is 50 years old and he's doing all of his own stunts for his fans and keep it real and not over use CGI. He was great in this movie like in everyone movie Tom Cruise was in. You can tell by his face that he's in the zone when he dose these stunts that could kill him or hurt him really bad. Tom Cruise nailed the humor, he nailed the action scenes and he nailed the role.<br/><br/>Many people and myself had no idea who Rebecca Ferguson was before Rogue Nation. She was in last years Hercules with Dwayne Johnson that nobody remembered and I already forgotten that movie already. Rebecca Ferguson was so good in this movie that she is going places after this because of how good she was. In this movie she was like the female Liam Neeson from Taken because it's the whole ""I'm going to kill you in one blow"" kind of character. Rebecca and Cruise worked together perfectly and she nailed the role of a strong female character.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg was great in this movie playing Benji. It's surprising that not a lot of people give him credit in this movie as his known best at comedy but he's also a great action actor star as well, he proved that in Ghost protocol, Rogue Nation and Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast like: Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renner and Alec Baldwin all did great in this movie.<br/><br/>The one thing that the Mission Impossible movies doesn't do very well is it's villain. Philip Seymour Hoffman was the only good villain in Mission Impossible series but the rest of villains have been weak and pretty forgettable. But the villain in Rogue Nation has a lot of motivation and he's the kind of villain that you understand where is coming from. Sean Harris dose a great performance as this chilling character but it wasn't an incredible villain but still better than the one we got in the other movies.<br/><br/>Now for the problems: The movie itself isn't flawless as these some scenes in the movie that the pacing dragged a little bit and when the characters have conversations about the gadgets and stuff it wasn't that interesting as Ghost Protocol did it better, because Ghost Protocol was a straight up action movie filled with humor and entertaining characters and when they have conversations about gadgets it was interesting and creative.<br/><br/>Overall Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation isn't only just a good action movie it's a good movie on it's own. The movie took elements from the first movie and Ghost Protocol and puts it together in this movie which made it a very entertaining movie."
"bartonj2410","8","3","6","2 August 2015"," Strong fifth entry for one of the best action franchises out there
","Any franchise that enters its fifth film normally shows signs of fatigue, whether it be a case of same old same old or the fact that the audience just aren't interested anymore. It's rare to see a franchise go from strength to strength in its later stages but the Mission: Impossible franchise has done just that with its latest, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. <br/><br/>Rogue Nation finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team tracking down and eradicate The Syndicate, an organisation made up of highly skilled international agents with a mission to destroy the IMF.<br/><br/>With their methods under examination and the IMF dissolved by the American government, Hunt and his team must, as always, go it alone while trying to avoid detection from the CIA as well.<br/><br/>The Mission: Impossible franchise is one that can take pride in its action sequences and in Rogue Nation, it has some of the most exhilarating moments you will see in a cinema this summer. They are all executed to perfection by director Christopher McQuarrie and shot breathtakingly by Robert Elswit,.<br/><br/>When your film opens with a magnificent stunt that sees Hunt hanging from the side of plane during take off, you know you're in for something special. From there, Rogue Nation moves at a blistering pace, packing in a tense underwater infiltration and a pulsating car/motorbike chase through the streets of Casablanca for good measure.<br/><br/>McQuarrie's screenplay is great fun as well; reminding us that, while of course there is a serious issue to be dealt with, there is fun to be had at the same time. Not every spy film has to be 100% serious.<br/><br/>It would be hard to talk about a Mission: Impossible film and not mention the performance of Tom Cruise in the signature role of his career, Ethan Hunt. Cruise has a reputation for giving his all to give the audience a memorable experience at the cinema. For Ghost Protocol he hung from the side of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai but for Rogue Nation he exceeds even his own crazy standards by clinging to the side of a cargo plane during take off.<br/><br/>God knows what he's got planned for the next film.<br/><br/>Cruise is joined by other Mission: Impossible alumni such as Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, Jeremy Renner as William Brandt and Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. Pegg gets more to do in Rogue Nation than any of the previous films which ends up being a good thing. Rhames too gets more to do but it is Renner who finds himself sacrificed a little for this to happen. Renner takes more of a back seat in Rogue Nation compared to Ghost Protocol, swapping field work for a desk role.<br/><br/>Then there is the newcomer in Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust. Much has been made of Ferguson's character being a strong female character in a male dominated genre. Yes, it's great to see but I was more intrigued by the mystery of her character and how it kept me on my toes trying to figure out where the story was going to go next.<br/><br/>Aside from Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Owen Davian in Mission: Impossible III, the series has never really had a good enough villain, holding the films back a little. The villain of Rogue Nation is Solomon Lane, played by Sean Harris. Lane is certainly sinister and makes his mission quite a personal one against Hunt but it doesn't does stop him from being, rather unfortunately, yet another weak villain in the series.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is without a doubt one of the stand-out films that the 2015 summer blockbuster season has had to offer. If they can keep the franchise this fresh after five films then all I can is; please keep on accepting those missions Mr Hunt."

","My big challenge with the Mission Impossibe franchise, is that I can't quite suspend disbelief long enough to truly get into the films. Bourne gets it right in my opinion - though extreme - the reality is there so I get fully immersed in the tension and drama. Bond is also more my cup of tea...although less gritty than the Bourne movies. Mission Impossible is very different. I know it's made up, but it still has the pretence of possibility (despite the name) about it, so it's a tougher watch. The disguises, the escapes, the stunts, the chases, the final sting...all are just too perfect, too choreographed and too unbelievable. My advice - switch off your brain, suspend disbelief and just enjoy his piece of cinematic fluff. Pure popcorn with greet set pieces, impressive visuals and amazing craftsmanship from the stunt team. If you can manage to dumb your brain for a while, you will have great couple of hours fun watching MI:Rogue Nation. Simon Pegg's bigger role is one of the high points."
"gordonhann97","8","3","6","31 July 2015"," My favourite out of the series so far
","For me I have see a lot of action films over the past few years and yes they have entertained me in the action department but that is all it entertains me with ,and this have been the big flaws behind these kind of films in where the action is great but fails to bring a good story, and character development. For me I have enjoyed a lot of the mission impossible films over the past years and this new addition of mission impossible could be one of my favourite ones. Mission impossible four is viewed by most people to be the best film out of this series , but why mission impossible five is a little bit better then four is because of the villain . The biggest complaint with ghost protocol is that it had a weak villain, but for me rouge nation created a great villain in this series that truly went toe to toe with Ethan Hunt . This is what made me love the film because this villain gave Ethan a true motivation for this film and this villain was very dangerous both physically and mentally pushing Ethan to the edge. Combining this great villain, story ,the crazy action stunts , and car chases this is a fantastic film and I would recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of this genre."

Ilsa Faust was everywhere, it rather seemed her movie than Ethan Hunt's. Finally....why would the head of the Syndicate (who apparently can wreck havoc all over the world) is doing all the dirty work himself.

"ynz9","6","4","10","2 August 2015"," Lackluster Direction
","As a huge fan of Tom Cruise, and the entire Mission Impossible franchise, I really wanted to give this movie a better review. I couldn't figure out what was bothering me about it after I saw it, given that it had all the usual elements for a fantastic MI movie. Then it dawned on me that it must be the directing. Then I looked at the director, McQuarrie, and it all made sense. He also directed Jack Reacher, which was almost good, and The Usual Suspects, which was OK.<br/><br/>But time and time again I find that he takes all the elements needed to make a movie sizzle and muddles them together, with characters explaining the action and plot in dialog as it unfolds. It violates the First Commandment of storytelling, which is show, don't tell. I could have enjoyed this movie, I really could. I tried. But McQuarrie just does not have the directing command as say, John Woo, who directed MI2. That's just my honest opinion. I cannot fake enthusiasm. I was truly surprised by the high reviews that Rogue Nation received.<br/><br/>Good date movie. Excellent afternoon killer. But if you are on a budget, wait for video."
"joeravioli","6","4","10","1 August 2015"," Mission Forgettable
","During one scene of the film, in which the female character offers to run away with Tom Cruise to escape their respective predicaments, I realized that the director had all his action movie clichés down pat, but understood them to such an extent that he tried, in a rather pretentious manner, to free them from their status as clichés. The result? Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is a direct cut-and-paste collage of the best elements of its predecessors, mashed together with a senseless plot and lazy attempts at human interaction. It exploits its serial niche of spectacular, death-defying stunts, while avoiding its seemingly constant and inescapable lack of humanity.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, the IMF is disbanded, and our good friend from Ghost Protocol, Agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner), is ordered to call the IMF's field agents in so they can take desk jobs at the CIA. Meanwhile, our hero, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise (who else?)), is busy fighting a one-man war against an elusive organization known as the Syndicate. He decides not to check in because he was personally insulted by a guy with glasses, captured by the Syndicate, and introduced to a good looking woman who helped him escape. He instead decides to hunt down the Syndicate, and is subsequently labelled as a rogue agent by the CIA. As far as concepts go, it ain't bad. But it feels too familiar. The concept of the invincible fugitive running from the law in a self-righteous pursuit of justice has been replicated so many times in so many different ways that the plot finds itself in a desperate cavern of clichéd emptiness. Sadly it attempts to fill in this emptiness with the use of even more clichés, including the femme fatale, the bomb-strapped-to-chest discussion, the impossible heist, the running around from city to city, the ridiculously strong German brute, and endless shots of men getting out of cars. But in its defense, narrative creativity has dissipated from Hollywood's action films, replaced instead by stunts and crazy violence.<br/><br/>The stunts are spectacular. I can't deny that. From the first minutes of the film, in which Tom Cruise holds onto to a plane door as it takes off, to a positively riveting scene where Tom Cruise pulls off an underwater heist, the action is so cool that it alone makes the film worth watching. It is wonderfully choreographed, set to a racing soundtrack, and truly intense. But when the action is turned down to allow the characters to interact, the dialogue is fraught with limp conversation fillers and terrible ""can I trust you?"" discussions in mansions and dilapidated rooms. As a result, the characters remain cocky, boring, and pretty much invincible. Even the usually likable Tom Cruise takes on a pretentious, self-righteous faith in his own amazingness. Just once, I wanted to see Ethan Hunt express the vulnerability that he did in the first scene of Mission Impossible 3. Just once, I wanted to see him emotionally mature. But naw, he's way too busy kicking everyone's butt from Morocco to London to address his own faults. Even his relationship with the femme fatale is underdeveloped and boring, as if he barely recognizes her as more than another wrench (I said wrench) that will allow him to dismantle the Syndicate. How can you sympathize with a one-dimensional character who is so wrapped up in his own pride that he puts his blind followers in the path of danger so he can have the last laugh against a guy he barely knows? Well, the simple answer is that you can't.<br/><br/>Movies are supposed to make you feel something. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation does not. Thus, it is a triumph in the area of action and stunt work, but little more than that."

That's all im gonna tell..<br/><br/>And its a blast<br/><br/>The action is amazingly well directed, like every bit of action piece since the third movie. They are thrilling, creative and exciting. There is a motor chase scene in this movie that I just gotta give it credit for. The plain scene(as seen in the trailer) is immediately in the beginning, so you'll start off with a bang. You can see Tom puts his all in these stunts. <br/><br/>The acting of course is always great. Etha... I mean Tom cruise almost equals Ethan Hunt.. it's the same person. Simon pegg is always a smooth comedic actor who puts a smile on everyone's face. And the new girl: rebecca fergunson is the most badass not-bond-girl I've ever seen. Beautiful, smart and can actually fight instead of: ""guys we can only make her badass by only letting her be a good shot"".

","Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation was much better than I expected. Just when I thought action movies had completely lost the plot I saw this and was entertained throughout. It features some amazing scenes and set pieces, and the action doesn't let up until well into the second half, which I felt wasn't entirely up to the standard set by what preceded it.<br/><br/>Regardless, the movie held my attention throughout its entire run-time. I could actually understand what was going on, which is a rarity in action movies in this day and age. It's like directors know people don't care about plot or characters anymore; they just want stunts and special effects, so why bother explaining them with plot? MI:RN doesn't make this mistake.<br/><br/>I thought Simon Pegg was the standout. The movie needs a human centre in its world of shadowy double agents with impeccable dress sense. He provides it. Sean Harris is, also, a fantastic bad guy.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"pinokiyo","5","3","7","5 August 2015"," NO WAY this is the best one. CRAZY reviews! Same old Same old... even more suspension of disbelief! SILLY! the first 1996 MI is still the best one.
","People writing that this MI is the best is out of their minds or they must be teens from this generation... <br/><br/>They just can't make films like they used to... I guess studios pressure too much to rush things and cram as much ridiculous action and ideas as possible... can't they understand LESS is usually MORE?!? I understand Ethan Hunt is a super agent, but he's not superman! It all started with Ghost Protocol (directed by a guy who makes great animated films like Incredibles) turning the series very cartoony... and Rogue Nation continues that style.<br/><br/>I mean, I can suspend disbelief, even as far as the agents to create realistic masks to disguise as others, but when are the lines drawn??? Too much and it gets TOO CARTOONY and the intensity actually backfires. When it takes you out of realism, one can't help but start to roll their eyes...<br/><br/>The trailer really hypes up the airplane scene, but it's really what you see in the trailer, which is a shame. <br/><br/>I believe the ""underwater scene"", also in the trailer, is supposed to be the ""big mission"" (like the first MI hanging in the office scene where they have to bypass several security.) I was really excited to see what they would come up with or how that part was going to be... However, that was also a letdown for me and it's a scene where you REALLY have to go beyond disbelief... I mean that facility itself is TOTALLY ridiculous; it's totally a movie setup scenario... I know it's called Mission Impossible... but let's not get carried away with Mission Outrageous! I mean, might as well have a mission where Ethan has to land on moon to retrieve something without a spacesuit or a rocket to fly on... Ethan can do it! Give me a break. He has no fear!<br/><br/>Funny how the underwater scene seems like they did that to take advantage of some 3D effects, but Rogue Nation actually isn't shown in 3D. <br/><br/>More long redundant car super close-up shots of bike chases we've seen before... it's getting old...<br/><br/>There's one scene where the car flips over and the CG is so horribly done... couldn't they have flipped a real car?? It was really bad. <br/><br/>If I had to rank the MI franchise, it would be: 1. Mission Impossible (1996) - having the most ""realistic/serious/raw"" feeling and instant classic mission scene (falling down rope/office sweatdrop and ending tunnel scene were exciting)<br/><br/>2. Mission Impossible III (2006) - Had the best villain and bridge scene was also exciting/memorable. For me, this had the best combination of humor without being overly ridiculous and action. Ethan really seemed the most vulnerable in this one, which made it more exciting. This one is VERY underrated because it was a time when Cruise was getting a lot of bad rep jumping on Oprah's couch/scientology <br/><br/>3. Mission Impossible II (2000) - Many disliked the story, but John Woo gave MI a whole new style. Many see these series for the action and the car dancing/bike chases were well done. <br/><br/>4 TIE. MI 4: Ghost Protocol (2011) & MI 5: Rogue Nation (2015) <br/><br/>If you actually enjoyed Ghost Protocol, then I'm sure you'll like this one too. The style is similar. <br/><br/>Personally, I didn't care for Ghost Protocol, so if you're like me and didn't enjoy that one, Rogue Nation is no different. <br/><br/>It's really what you expect... nothing more, nothing less... really nothing special that revolutionizes the series or action films. <br/><br/>Don't believe people who actually say this is the best one... ridiculous!<br/><br/>For me, the first 1996 MI is still the best one overall.<br/><br/>Although there is no slowing down in the movie, there just wasn't that build-up anticipation or really new excitement that's there in the original Mission Impossible film... <br/><br/>If you can accept silly action and enjoy the redundant car chases we've seen a million times already, the ticking time bomb that's also been overused a zillion times, bad guys that can never aim, then this film is for you. <br/><br/>Sorry, but I'm not easily impressed. Forgettable mission. The 1996 Mission Impossible hanging scene will always be a classic."

Also to remember is Tom Cruise actually does all his own stunts and produced this. One thing I would say is the stunts ( while exceptional) were not filmed as good as the previous movies..as an example number 3 with director John Woo ..but the cinematography was very good,taking time to show us where we were by using landmarks.

"MovieAddict2016","9","3","7","2 August 2015"," Stands with ""Mad Max"" as one of the best action films in years.
","Fast and Furious gets attention for being one of the rare series to completely reinvent itself over time (to both critical and financial success), but with Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, it has become clear that it is the latter series that has more firmly reinvented itself and finally found its footing. What started as a typically subversive and visceral Brian De Palma film, disguised as both a star vehicle for Tom Cruise and a high-budget adaptation of a television show, then transformed into a cheesy John Woo vehicle, eventually settled down into a more straightforward action picture with the underrated M:i3. To this point in time, each Mission had been drastically separate from its predecessor, every director leaving his impression on the same general premise: disavowed agents, the IMF going rogue, etc. But the negative effect of this was that the character of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), along with his ever-changing roster of IMF crewmembers, was forced to continually adapt to the drastically altered aesthetics of each installment. So while the films were serviceable and fun, there was never really a sense of character building or continuity beyond Cruise and Ving Rhames appearing on screen together.<br/><br/>That changed with the third film, which placed an emphasis on Hunt's home life, his marriage, and introduced the character of Benji (Simon Pegg), who was initially the M:I version of James Bond's Q, but has since transformed into a major supporting player.<br/><br/>And it was with Ghost Protocol in 2011 that the series truly seemed to find its footing, carrying over the story continuity and characters from M:I 3 while still allowing its director, Brad Bird, to mold the film in his own style.<br/><br/>With this all said, Rogue Nation, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is closer to Ghost Protocol than any of the other films, and by now we feel as though the Ethan Hunt we are seeing on screen has become something of a fully-formed and consistent character, as much as an action film may allow him to be. At the end of the day, this isn't Cruise wildly diverting from his usual on screen persona, but there's a warmness and self-deprecation to Ethan Hunt here that we didn't have in the transition from, say, the first film to the second, where he was just a generic glorified action figure who was way too cool to show any self-awareness or wit.<br/><br/>Despite rumours of troubled production (McQuarrie was reportedly still working out an ending to the film when the studio decided to push it up to a summer release from its original Christmas opening), you wouldn't know it from the look of this picture. This is something it shares in common with George Miller's Mad Max Fury Road, a long-delayed picture whose negative press had many convinced it would be a dud, but which turned out to be one of the more strongly-reviewed action films of the decade.<br/><br/>And here's something else Rogue Nation shares with Miller's film: a strong feminine role, one that almost threatens to steal the picture away from the leading man. Paula Patton did some fine work in Ghost Protocol, but her replacement, Rebecca Ferguson, is a revelation. McQuarrie and Cruise were reportedly in search of a ""Golden Age"" star, someone whose look reflected a bygone era, and they found her. (It almost seems a winking nod that part of the film takes place in Casablanca.) This is a star-making turn, and it's a rare sign of humility for Cruise, 53, to allow a supporting player to potentially upstage him.<br/><br/>Speaking of ensemble casting, even more so than Ghost Protocol, this is a team piece. Jeremy Renner, once touted as a possible successor to Cruise, is largely relegated to sideline scenes with Alec Baldwin, but these work more effectively than I imagined they might, and when he eventually reunites with the rest of the gang, it feels a bit more poignant. And it's strangely satisfying to see Rhames back (apart from a cameo at the end, he was absent altogether from Protocol), his oft-referenced history with Ethan another example of the series' sudden turn towards stressing its continuity.<br/><br/>And if you're just here for the action sequences, well, there are plenty of those, too. Some of them are the best of the series: the motorcycle free-for-all in Casablanca is breathtaking, for example, and if Mad Max had not come out this year, it would be safe to say Rogue Nation had the best chase sequence in recent memory. It makes the CGI-laden Furious films look weak by comparison.<br/><br/>Deftly blending practical stunt work with minimal CGI, McQuarrie's film is closer in tone and spirit to a traditional spy film than any of the other movies. A sequence at the Vienna Opera isbfluid and beautiful to look at and funny (McQuarrie enjoys riffing on Cruise's stature as an action hero) that it could easily rank as one of the better Bond set pieces. And without spoiling anything, the movie sets itself up nicely for a direct sequel, something none of the other movies have ever really bothered to do.<br/><br/>Action films don't get much better than this, especially for a series that is almost 20 years old and has starred the same actor for every installment. This is one of those movies where you're swept up in the momentum from beginning to end, and any weaknesses are easily ignored because of how much fun you're having while you watch it unfold."

","Another exciting action packed movie from this movie franchise. I went with the expectation of this being that this one should be the best yet, but was a little disappointed. It was still a great film, but somehow lacked a few things. I agree with a previous poster that the evil villain character was found to be lacking somewhat. After the movie, the discussion was around things like ""why couldn't they have done this, or that"" perfectly logical thinking from ordinary people thinking up solutions to problems the characters encountered but for some reason not for those from the quick thinking, gadgets everywhere spy world. The fact that these came into the mind whilst watching spoils some of the illusion of the film."

A film that I would recommend."
"MattBirk","7","3","7","1 August 2015"," A Classic Summer Blockbuster!
","I'll get this out of the way early, Tom Cruise is one of the best actors in Hollywood. He is easily the most passionate about the quality of his work and it absolutely shows. And the Mission Impossible franchise is where he is able to perform at his best and craziest. Over the years he has done some out of control stunts, a knife millimeters from his eyeball, free hand rock climbing, scaling Burj Khalifa, and holding his breath for six minutes just to capture real life thrills for the audience. How can you dispute or not appreciate this in today's CGI heavy world? Tom Cruise is great.<br/><br/>Looking at Rogue Nation, the movie features everything you have come to love from the franchise, outlandish action sequences, real stunts, great humor, and over the top hacking abilities. Everything is put together in perfect fashion and carried by a great cast. This time around Simon Pegg gets a lot more screen time which is always a plus because he is flat out hilarious. We also get a bit of background on Ethan Hunt the character which is interesting and helps drive the story. But the standout feature of the movie had to be Rebecca Ferguson, she played her part perfectly and when the story needed her to be a badass, she was more than capable. That of which is surprising because I know quite a few people (including myself) were disappointed seeing Paula Patton not returning to the franchise after Ghost Protocol. But Rebecca was a wonderful surprise, and possibly better than Patton, hopefully she returns for the next installment! Outside of that, this is the type of movie you go into expecting over the top action sequences and elaborate heists and the movie delivers on both fronts. It's a fun ride with a sound story and great characters (honestly I was glad to see Jeremy Renner take a smaller role this time around in order for Simon Pegg to get more screen time).<br/><br/>Rogue Nation might not have the strong thematic undertones and production design of Mad Max: Fury Road, but it does have some of the best action sequences of the year. This is the epitome of the classic action summer blockbuster that the public has come to love. Great acting, real stunts, and plenty of humor makes Rogue Nation one of the best action movies of the year (and possibly the past decade). This might be the only franchise in the world where it seems like the franchise isn't slowing down and each entry is a great stand-alone movie!"

","Let's be clearTom Cruise is a bad to the bone. And the only reason we don't recognize this fact, is because we've fallen for the dumb stuff about his Scientology beliefs. But make no mistake, that's him hanging on the side of a cargo plane. Are you serious?! The physics of the move itself is immortalized. Also keep in mind, through the decades, we've had John Wayne, Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. If you went pound for pound what he's been able to do physically at their age versus Cruise at the same ageI'm not sure how to word this: He takes the crown. And it's not just this one stunt. He gives you this for free. The rest of the movie has him in peril throughout. Because they do this awesome thing, where they switch the terms. He is no longer the hunter, but the hunted. And they saddle him with people we like. But are they good or bad? Are they will the IMF or against them. As fictional as it may seem, these special task force of spies are believable.<br/><br/>They are fun, they are precise, and just having Rebecca Ferguson (who plays Ilsa) added to the mix makes for the next installments interesting. They make no mention of Michelle Monaghan who married Ethan Hunt in previous installments. Will she make a return? Who knows? We do know Ilsa could be an older sister to her, looks wise. Ilsa is a great character. She is beautiful and lethal. The big talk about Michelle Yeoh going head to head in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is pale in comparison to when Ilsa does go hand to hand against a male henchman. She physically looks like she can do it.<br/><br/>What makes this also such a great time isCruise is often dumbfounded by how he's able to survive when odd things happen. It could be a nod to even the cheekiest of Roger Moore's Bond. Straighten your tie after throwing someone off a roof-type stuff. But that's the joy of it. It actually doesn't get tiring. For example a scene where (and I'm not ruining it since it's in the trailer) he just came back from the deadand he and Benji have to go on a high speed chase. It's absolutely ridiculous to have Cruise drive in his condition. They address it. But they use it for great laughs. Reactions to justbizarre moments. Even Renner and Rhames gets in on the fun. Particularly watching Pegg and Cruise flip a BMW end over end in what can end in permanent injury, they banter about the incident like a great Preston Sturges gab fest. This movie is what espionage movies were about. Brisk and expertly made. It moves from location to location and doesn't seem forced. This is by far the best action movie this summer. Why? Because even though the technological gibberish is goofy, THEY make it work. Through self-referential humor. Or just addressing the nonsense of spy school, this is the fun we may not see in the new James Bond. So lap it up while you can."
"CleveMan66","9","3","7","31 July 2015"," ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" keeps the franchise fresh and fun.
","""Ethan Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny."" It's a great line – and it aptly sums up the central character in the ""Mission: Impossible"" films. Spoken by one of Hunt's frenemies in ""Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation"" (PG-13, 2:11), the line makes the point that Hunt is smart, skilled, determined and, yes, lucky enough that anything he determines will, one way or another, come to pass. It's true. And it's a good thing that he's on our side kind of. The ""sides"" are often hard to define in the murky world of international intrigue. It's a world in which Hunt thrives. He and his IMF (Impossible Missions Force) work in the shadows, where only the world's most dangerous people and our government's most knowledgeable people can shine a light. But even then This film features the IMF's most challenging mission yet (some would even say ""impossible"") – fighting government bureaucracy. The story opens with the already famous scene of Hunt (Tom Cruise) absolutely refusing to let a plane full of nerve gas take off without him. His most recent cohorts in this fantastic film franchise, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) use their digital expertise to remotely open the plane's door before it's too late for Ethan. Meanwhile, the fourth Beatle, William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), is clashing with CIA chief Alan Hunley (Adam Baldwin) before a highly secretive congressional committee meeting that is meant to decide the fate of the controversial IMF.<br/><br/>Hunt finds out that the IMF has been dissolved just as he is pursuing what is possibly the IMF's most dangerous opponent to date. ""The Syndicate"" (an organization which first appeared in the 1960s' TV series on which the movies are based) is a clandestine organization of former international spies who are out to wreak havoc and remake the world as they see fit. The problem is that even Hunley dismisses claims that this organization actually exists. He has ordered Hunt brought in, and is leaning on Brandt and Benji to help him, just as Hunt is reaching out to his old IMF buddies for help pursuing the Syndicate. Guess who Benji, Brandt (and Luther) end up helping.<br/><br/>Hunt also has a new helper maybe. When this film's ""big bad"", Syndicate honcho Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), captures Hunt, a mystery woman named Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) helps him escape. But why? Hunt doesn't know and neither do we. Even the most espionage-savvy moviegoer will probably go back and forth throughout the film regarding who Isla is working for and what her true motives are. And while you're trying to figure that out, the organization non grata IMF will be crashing cars, racing motorcycles, kicking ass, taking names and operating in dangerous underwater environments in overseas locales such as Morocco, Vienna and London. As the members of the now defunct IMF go rogue and end up proving their unique importance, the rogue nation known as the Syndicate is also fighting for its existence – and to greatly expand its nefarious worldwide influence.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation"" manages to keep things fresh and fun, even after four films and 19 years. The action is top-drawer (as the British agents in the story might say), from its fight and chase scenes to its seemingly impossible situations and (especially) that opening sequence in which Cruise, without use of a stunt double, actually hangs off the side of an actual plane that is actually taking off. (Wow!) Christopher McQuarrie's script and directing keep things moving, allowing us only a few brief quiet moments and a handful of funny moments to give us a break from the adrenaline pumping through our bodies for most of the film.<br/><br/>The plot and the actors keep us guessing about their characters' motivations and plans. Even the inevitable moment when one agent peels off a mask comes as surprise. I wish the nature and desires of the Syndicate were explained a little better, but its ominous shadow is thrillingly omnipresent and Harris makes one truly menacing villain. This installment of the franchise is every bit as good as the previous one and number six is already in development. In the meantime, ""Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation"" gets an ""A""."

","Mission Impossible Rogue Nation(M:I 5) is directed and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Ferguson, and Ving Rhames along with Alec Baldwin.<br/><br/>M:I 5 revolves around the IFC's deconstruction and the reconstruction of an evil company known as the Syndicate. It also follows Ethan Hunt's (Tom Cruise) unrelenting hunt for the leader of the previously mentioned Syndicate. This leads him and the rest of the IFC (Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames) to reunite once again.<br/><br/>The next movie has the close to impossible task of topping this movie. I thought Ghost Protocol was Good but Good God this was amazing. This is officially my new favorite in the series. Now onto the review.<br/><br/>Firstly, TOM freaking CRUISE. His performance was the most entertaining to date in this movie. He added a certain amount of adrenaline to this movie that no other actor could accomplish. Once again proving he still dominates the genre. Simon Pegg was amazing. As far as side characters(characters who weren't Cruise) go he was my personal favorite. Renner and Rhames are pretty good but Pegg is out of this world. He delivers consistent laughs and proves that comic reliefs can still be enjoyable without taking the seriousness out of the movie. Onto the script and direction. Both were fantastic. The script offers some over all perfect twists and a ton of humorous moments. It also offers one of the best endings put to an action film. The direction made all the action sequences pop and real.<br/><br/>Overall aside from a few minor inconsistencies and a few plot holes, that were ultimately filled up, M:I 5 is an amazing thrill ride. This is one of those rare occasion that I wish I could rate this movie a 9.5/10 but I can't so I'll just settle for a 9/10 or an A. Please just go and watch this movie, fan or not."
"bryank-04844","8","3","7","31 July 2015"," 'Rogue Nation' is the Best 'Mission Impossible' Yet!
","A couple of years later from 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol', we have Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team, consisting of Benji (Simon Pegg), William (Jeremy Renner), and Luther (Ving Rhames) on a mission to acquire a certain dangerous cargo that is about to take off in a military airplane. I'm sure you've seen the trailers by now to know that Tom Cruise did indeed do his own stunts again, including actually hanging off the edge of airplane as it took off high in the sky. This is the opening scene to 'Rogue Nation', the fifth film in the 'Mission Impossible' franchise that ignites the bomb and iconic theme song.<br/><br/>As the case with each film, there is a new director and writer this time out, which is Christopher McQuarrie ('Jack Reacher', 'The Usual Suspects', 'The Way of the Gun', 'Edge of Tomorrow'). McQuarrie is a very talented man, and he brought his unique sense of dark humor and wit to this fifth installment. I might just have to say this is the most fun I've had with a 'Mission Impossible' film, and that's saying a lot, because I really enjoyed the last two. McQuarrie's script is smart and energetic from start to finish, barely leaving you room to breathe, but also adding a good bit of character development for the new characters.<br/><br/>In an early scene we see William (Renner) sitting alongside Director of the CIA William Hunley (Alec Baldwin) in front of a panel of people, as Hunley explains to them his theory that the secretive ""Mission Impossible"" unit is responsible for tons of damage and destruction all over the world, and that Ethan Hunt and his team need to be brought to justice and serve time in prison, but most of all, the unit needs to be shut down. It's a hell of a way to start of this fifth film, as now the US government is now after Ethan as well.<br/><br/>Soon after that, Ethan enters an awesome record store that sells amazing jazz and blues albums, only to enter a ""listening room"" and get his next assignment, only to be gassed and see his secretary shot by a creepy tall man named Solomon Lane (Sean Harris from '71'). Ethan wakes up in a cruddy sewage basement of sorts to be tortured and beaten up by some rough looking me, although a woman named Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) seems to help him out. Once he escapes, he puts two and two together and realizes there is a secret ""syndicate"" that nobody believes is out there. This syndicate, possibly headed up by Solomon Lane is trying to destroy and kill most of Earth's population, and now Ethan and his team must try and stop this from happening, as well as steer clear from the US government, hence the Rogue title.<br/><br/>There is no shortage of action here and even though the film is rated PG-13, it feels like a soft 'R'. The fight choreography is amazing, as every hit, punch, or kick is loud and robust, you really feel like it's happening to you. The chase scenes are equally incredible here and puts you in the center of the highly suspenseful maneuvers on the motorcycles and cars. I was definitely on the edge of my seat. Everyone turns in a solid performance here as usual, but this is Simon Pegg's movie to shine, and delivers the emotional goods here, just like he does with every film he's in.<br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson is a much welcome newcomer as well, and I hope to see her in future installments, and then there is Alec Baldwin, who of course is great in each scene-stealing segment, right up to the very end. 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' comes in at about 130 minutes, but it feels like only 60, due to the quick pace and energetic action pieces. Even a long scene during an opera in Vienna that is filmed perfectly seems to go by super fast. I have no doubt you'll have an excellent time with 'Rogue Nation', I know I sure did.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
"jamesthecat-67828","1","4","11","22 February 2016"," Worst in the franchise
","Baffled by all the positive reviews, as this is dull as ditch water. <br/><br/>The series peaked with Brad Bird's wonderful 'Ghost Protocol', and this latest one is just a rehash of every previous film. You can make a check- list of what to expect and tick them off one by one: Good guy turns out to be bad guy, the IMF have to operate outside the law, they have to wear masks, etc, etc, except done without any of the flair of previous entries and with a rubbish villain.<br/><br/>The only saving grace is Rebecca Ferguson, as she offers a breath of fresh air to the stale atmosphere.Apart from her, there's nothing else to recommend it. It's definitely time that Tom Cruise laid this to rest, but since it's his only consistent cash-cow, I doubt that will happen any time soon.It's flashy and slick, but boring and soulless."

","Not all Mission Impossibles are created equal and this one is definitely at or towards the bottom. <br/><br/>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is in a desperate pursuit of a super villain and his goons known as The Syndicate (I know, how clever). He is aided (for reasons unknown initially) by a woman named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) in his attempts to bring down The Syndicate.<br/><br/>Allow me to digress for a minute. When did it become the preferred fighting style and the go to move for women to elaborately, acrobatically and lithely jump while simultaneously wrapping their legs around an assailants arm, or preferably neck, in order to then either A.) break his neck, B.) strike him in a vulnerable area or C.) use a sharp object to kill him? I've seen plenty of MMA and if this was a viable and effective move as the movies would have me believe then surely ONE of the many mixed martial artists would have employed this coda. I've never seen Rhonda Rousey use the jump- scissor-kick submission move once. Aaah, but with the aid of film editing and jump cuts we see countless men helpless to defend themselves against this awesome finishing move. It is the great equalizer for the 120 pound female and Ms. Faust had three opportunities to use it.<br/><br/>OK, back to my review. Where was I? Oh, yes... Ethan does all this badass stuff, gets help from a superbad chick and you know the rest. <br/><br/>The story was simply stale and after a while you get a little bored with the one-up death defying stunt. Just to show how lame this episode was the CIA director, played by Alec Baldwin, said that he would have to activate the Special Activities Division. As I do with all government organizations I quickly reduced it to its acronym and had to laugh. I think that summed up this entire movie: SAD."
"Leofwine_draca","6","2","4","6 October 2016"," Not bad, but a big step down in quality from the last two
","ROGUE NATION is the latest MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE and by my count the fifth in the series. Sadly I was hoping it would be as good as the previous instalment in the franchise, GHOST PROTOCOL, and it doesn't come anywhere close to that film's quality; too much of it is filled with unrealistic scenes and humour which really starts to grate after a while.<br/><br/>The film has much in common with SPECTRE in that it sees Tom Cruise and his team going after a mysterious organisation set on controlling the world, although the organisation here seems to consist of one guy, master villain Sean Harris, who is incidentally on autopilot throughout. We get the usual template film, featuring massive action chase spectacle sequences, a heist or two, plot twists and betrayals, and lots of sparky dialogue between the lead characters.<br/><br/>Superficially the film is entertaining; a movie with tons of action like this would be hard pressed not to entertain. The motorbike chase in Morocco is a highlight, and the early plane stunt is great fun, especially as it was filmed close to home. But the script is below par and makes odd choices, like making Simon Pegg a secondary lead when he's not been around much previously other than playing the token geek. Cruise goes through the motions with aplomb, but Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames have so little to do that you wonder why they bothered showing up. Worst of all is Rebecca Ferguson as one of those irritatingly perfect action women who comes out on top time and time again; she has one stock expression on her face from beginning to end and really got up my nose. ROGUE NATION comes third in my list of favourite MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films, better than the first two but behind the fourth and third ones."
"Wizard-8","Null","2","4","6 March 2016"," Merely okay, though that might be enough for some viewers
","Though I have seen every ""Mission: Impossible"" movie before watching this one, I have to confess that I thought all the previous entries were watchable but ultimately forgettable. If I were pressed, I could not remember much about any of them. This new entry proves to be more of the same. I will admit that I didn't find it anywhere near an excruciating experience. It looks pretty slick, has some good action sequences, and while it's over two hours in length, I was never bored at any moment. But all the same, I found a lot of the movie to be somewhat predictable; some ""surprise"" twists were no surprise. Also, while the movie is coherent for the most part, there are a few minor plot details (like how Tom Cruise's character spent six months uncovering the bad guys and how he tracked them down) that are never explained. Also, the chief villain gets a lot less screen time than you might think, which makes him less of a threat than the movie thinks he is. Another disappointment is with the climatic sequence - it's surprisingly small scale and generic in feel. In the end, the movie is like a hot drink on a cold day - it does its job for a short time, but you are unlikely to remember the experience for a long time."

","Once again, Ethan Hunt is on the run and forced to conduct a lone mission. This film is oddly paced. We flit from location to location, proving that the mysterious lethal organisation named The Syndicate is well and truly global. Establishing landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben orientate us through this mission. But it doesn't exactly feel much different from one another, but rather like a video game campaign where each leveled mission takes us through another setting. There is a high speed motorcycle chase in Morocco which quickly exits the distinct and dusty architecture of Rabat for a sleek highway that could be anywhere in the world. The final chase scene features yet another scuffle with the goons of our main villain Lane and is utterly drab in the night. For all the heroic stunt manoeuvres on the side of a plane (and no, doing his own stunts does not make a movie better, but it is admirable somewhat), Hunt spends some weird moments boxed into confined and uninteresting environments. After escaping from a torture chamber in what is an utterly incomprehensible action scene featuring a flurry of cuts for each punch or kick thrown, he runs down a hallway and then inexplicably is in some phone booth in the city elsewhere. In the climatic showdown, the hero and villain pair run into some abandoned museum, fall into a vent thing (where it all started right) and viola, there you have the master plan. <br/><br/>Sean Harris is the villain, and not a very good one. Like so many before him, he is good turned evil, and thus his has concocted nefarious intentions in his payback. He has several monologues, none of which are assisted by his raspy voice which ends up rather wimpy (I suppose menacing is what they were going for), and he waxes lyrical on how he must bring about change to the world and metaphorical comparing himself to a surgeon and blah blah blah this is a very bland and shallow character. Not helping is the blocking and coverage which seems bizarre at times; Ilsa and him meet at a cemetery (and the ridiculous abundance of shallow focus all but obscures the background anyway), and some sort of threat is once again issued, and he demonstrates his hold over her, but meanwhile they walk and stop and walk again so casually it might be some romantic stroll in the park. Harris' best moment is his trembling facial tics as he struggles against Hunt reversing the odds on him in the climax, but the countdown timer does not seem particularly necessary. Surely a trigger would offer a lot more control? <br/><br/>It's not surprising, but much of Rogue Nation's plot is dished out via exposition in rooms upon rooms. Renner, Baldwin and Rhames are all criminally underused because of this, and they spend most of the film idle but somehow being in the right place to explain the right thing, somehow having the means to magically further the plot. Newcomer Rebecca Ferguson fortunately does not fall to that same fate, and plays a crucial Bond girl type role in the two best action sequences. The mission to steal the Syndicate ledger from a highly secure facility is classic Mission Impossible, and its entertainment value speaks for itself. As always, they go over the plan and each intricate detail, discussing in voice-over, and this sort of thing is common in this genre, but it's done really well. Partly because they it is treated lighter than usual, with Pegg chiming in with his impeccable comedic delivery (""That doesn't sound impossible!"") and soft nodding to the previous installments of the series with both Benji and Hunt inquiring about alternate methods. The scene itself is gripping. Silence is used effectively here; there is nothing but the swimming strokes and bubbles in the track as Hunt makes his way to over to 108, but we still know that something is about to go wrong, and it's all the more tense when it finally does hit him. The camera drifts away slowly as he loses consciousness, and only after a extended wait, where we are almost actually made to believe our hero is done for, then the soundtrack flares in and Ilsa makes her rescue.<br/><br/>The other sequence, and perhaps the best scene in the movie, is the attempted assassination in the opera in Vienna. Voyeuristic overhead angles shots and effective cutting between the opposing perspectives of the snipers orientates us within the backstage of the opera stage, and we are treated to this tense but slow moving chase between several combatants to the backdrop of Turandot and the blaring operatic tune of Nessun dorma. The sound mixing here is particularly excellent and appropriate; it dips and rises in volume as Hunt plays a game of cat and mouse backstage, and it all but drowns out any noise that the urgent fist fights cause. But this only adds urgency to the perilous battle on top of those platforms; the choreography is desperate but subdued as they are silhouetted in the blue lighting while the crowds below are unaware. <br/><br/>Admittedly, I haven't been diligently following this franchise but it is successful at what it does and Cruise shows remarkable ability even at this age. Ultimately this is one of those movies that you wouldn't hate to discover while flicking through channels. In several cases, Renner's Brandt attempts to be the voice of reason and tries to dispel any notion of heroics or peril, but Hunt waves him away and maps out yet another mission impossible. And isn't that what we want to see anyway?"

","Fast paced, action packed and adrenaline inducing, MI5 ups the ante for the franchise.<br/><br/>The brains behind the Mission: Impossible franchise just keep impressing us, outdoing themselves with Rogue Nation, the fifth, but hopefully not final, installment of the franchise.<br/><br/>Different from previous Mission: Impossible films, Rogue Nation picks up where Ghost Protocol left off: with the IMF going up against their most capable adversary yet, the Syndicate led by Solomon Lane. Much like the first M:I film, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is the subject of investigation and pursuit when his loyalty is called into question. Disavowed, Ethan and his trusted team is tasked with impossible mission of thwarting the Syndicate's intentions of destroying the IMF, all while eluding the CIA.<br/><br/>Since the third Mission Impossible film, each installment just keeps getting better and better! The story is complex, but not muddled, the action is fast paced and heart-pounding, but not completely ridiculous, the characters are compelling, not hokey. We couldn't be more pleased with Christopher McQuarrie's take on M:I.<br/><br/>Typical of a Mission Impossible film, Rogue Nation charters across the globe to such idealistically gorgeous locales as Austria, Morocco, and London. Unlike lesser action films that would hope to be considered a peer to Mission Impossible, the action is top-notched and organically adrenaline inducing. Utilizing the natural soundtrack of a Puccini opera and revving motorbikes, the viewers is brought deeper into the action rather than dragged alongside it with unnecessary musical overtures.<br/><br/>Fans will be pleased to see several friendly faces, though Paula Patton was sincerely missed from the screen, and only a handful of new actors were added to the slate. These characters bring a levity in the film, through the humorous interactions that comes with a friendship through the most extreme circumstances. Rebecca Ferguson, fulfilling the female role in this predominantly male cast film, not only stands on her own but excels in her performance and stunt abilities.<br/><br/>Speaking of stunts, a literal ""Brava!"" must go out to the coordinators, sequence choreographers, and faceless stunt men and women who played their parts in the shadows, and who rarely get an explicit accolade for their accomplishments. Between these individuals and the seamless CGI, Rogue Nation is near unbelievable.<br/><br/>Of course, Mission Impossible wouldn't be Mission Impossible if it didn't surpass the physically plausible – and once again, Ethan Hunt does have some superhero level ability of invisibility. I believe by the end of the film he would've had a fractured spine, several concussions, a cracked skull, road rash on the entirety of his body, maybe internal bleeding, not to mention a medley of broken bones in his arms and legs. But alas, by the end of the film he is pristine with the exception of a few choice cuts placed meticulously on his face.<br/><br/>This ridiculousness is all in good fun and expected, and doesn't interrupt the narrative in the slightest. The best part? The film is chock full of so much entertainment that the trailers used to market the film barely show an ounce of the action.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

","I'm old enough to remember watching Mission: Impossible as a child. Gosh, those were great shows.<br/><br/>But of course the world has changed immeasurably since then. So have the movies. Strangely, a lot of spy movies are all the same now. I have a hard time telling this modern reincarnation of Mission:Impossible apart form the Bourne films, the new Bond films, Safe House and a half dozen other movies you can easily think of.<br/><br/>In these movies the security agency involved (usually the CIA, but not always) has incredible technology allowing them to visually track pretty well anything in the world. They can find any information they need in seconds. They have instant access to data bases you didn't even know existed. They can do anything really. Instantly accessible CCTV, internet and telephone tapping all play a huge role in these movies. There are always flunkies sitting at screens and then an intense older man or hard-nosed woman standing around shouting orders at everyone.<br/><br/>These agencies seem to have endless cash and will not hesitate for a second to do anything. Send a team to Zurich! Deploy the jets to Zambia! Moreover, in these movies the agents often have superhuman intellectual and physical abilities, far beyond that of trained athletes and martial arts experts. They jump from roof to roof, get injured in the knee, smash their heads against doors, and yet press on. They all fight like Bruce Lee nowadays. They can fly helicopters, drive like stunt men, do daredevil tricks with motorcycles. They have superb memories, training in explosives, knowledge on how to disarm nuclear weapons. These people are not only highly trained, super fit, super smart sharpshooters trained in martial arts to an unearthly level, they're also sort of invulnerable. They're superheros really.<br/><br/>And of course there's always a rogue element: it's always the case that someone has become, will become, or is suspected of being, not what he seems. The viewer is invited in virtually every film to try to figure out the twist. You can't trust anyone, can you. It's almost a rule now. Nothing is as it seems.<br/><br/>These films are a combination of the ""Spy"" and ""Superhero"" or ""Martial Arts"" genre, but with ""Science Fiction"" technology thrown in. And the rogue element has some of the ""Mystery"" genre in it. Also, in these American films there are almost always intense shoot outs and chase scenes. Everything happens very fast. Lots of crazy driving, crashes and near death escapes. That makes them ""Action"" films. And of course they're shot in ""Exotic Locations"" So let's rearrange the initials of all these genres to call this the ""MASSFLAMES"" genre. It's really not right that so many of these movies are more or less exactly the same in tone and content.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is that kind of movie. It was competently done. This was a very fast-paced movie, with one action scene after the next. I have to admit though that the shootouts and chases turned me off. It just didn't impress me that much. There wasn't enough of a story or enough character development. Tom Cruise was OK. Sean Harris was good as the creepy villain. The one who really caught my eye here was Rebecca Ferguson. Wow.<br/><br/>There were even a few aspects that just seemed wrong to me. They shook me right out of my suspension of disbelief. No point in going into them here.<br/><br/>I didn't hate the movie. It had a few visceral pleasures. If you're a teenage boy, you'll enjoy this movie. Although you could also just go to another ""massflames"" movie. They're all the same really."

","The first Mission: Impossible movie I ever saw was Ghost Protocol. I left the theater exhilarated, and as I waited for Rogue Nation to make its big-screen debut, I watched the three other films in the series. Now, having seen Rogue Nation, I can easily say that it is one of the series' best films, and almost matches the high bar that Ghost Protocol set a couple years back. What makes the Mission: Impossible series so distinct is that each film has had a different director, making them all feel unique and fresh. Surely, it's a given that some of the directors have been better than others, but Christopher McQuarrie, the director of this fifth entry, manages to craft a slick film that is better than it has any right to be. <br/><br/>Set shortly after Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation continues the ongoing spy escapades of IMF agent Ethan Hunt, as he searches for evidence of a criminal organization known as the Syndicate. Hunt is suddenly caught by the same people he is looking for, but escapes from being killed with the help of Syndicate member Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, replacing Paula Patton as our lead female) and the stage is set for another globe- trotting adventure, as Hunt is cut off from the now defunct IMF and is left on his own. With Rogue Nation, Tom Cruise continues to prove that there isn't an action star in Hollywood quite like him. Even though he's 53 years old, Cruise continues to be do many of his own stunts, with the results being quite spectacular. The airplane stunt featured in many of the film's promotional materials is simply incredible, even if it doesn't quite top the Burj Khalifa setpiece of the previous film. <br/><br/>Apart from Cruise, the rest of the cast is also quite stellar. Ferguson makes for a compelling presence on the screen opposite Cruise and I hope she bucks the trend of each Mission: Impossible film having a different leading lady by appearing in the inevitable Mission: Impossible 6. Simon Pegg continues to steal every scene he's in as computer expert Benji. The unusual pairing of Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames also works to a surprising degree, as the two of them play off each other very well. Alec Baldwin also gets a few moments of greatness in his small role as the director of the CIA. Sean Harris, who plays the film's villain, Solomon Lane, also gives a solid performance. However, his performance is undercut by one of the film's weaknesses - his character simply isn't that developed. Harris does the best with what he's given, but what's given isn't enough. However, he isn't the worst villain in the franchise, for that honor still belongs to Dougray Scott's from Mission: Impossible II. <br/><br/>On the flip side, Christopher McQuarrie does a great job pulling double-duty by having both written and directed the film. His direction is precise and he keeps the tension throughout, especially during the film's action sequences, which always manage to impress. In particular, a motorcycle chase through Morocco is a highlight. Robert Elswit's cinematography takes advantage of the film's spectacular vistas and locations, and McQuarrie's direction always makes the action easy to follow. His script is simple, yet still has enough twists and turns to prevent the film from ever feeling generic. Sure, plot holes are sure to pop up if one looks closely, but while watching, the film makes us forget about all that. McQuarrie also deserves credit for mixing action and humor successfully, and always keeps the atmosphere fun. <br/><br/>In the end, Rogue Nation proves to be one of the better popcorn flicks of this summer. In my opinion, it doesn't quite match Ghost Protocol, but it didn't leave me disappointed in the slightest. Everyone involved, from the cast to the crew, is at the top of their games here. Filled with humor, action, and spectacle, Rogue Nation proves that even though 19 years have passed since the first Mission: Impossible premiered, the series still hasn't lost a step."

","Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation follows a fugitive Ethan Hunt of the dismantled IMF as he attempts with eradicate the Syndicate with the CIA on his tail with orders of shoot to kill. <br/><br/>What's not to love about this movie? The stunts are fantastic. The action whisks us away at top speeds. The intricate plot keeps you guessing up until the very end. The only two drawbacks of this installment is that I would've liked to have seen more of Ethan Hunt's (Tom Cruise) detective work in the beginning and more wide shots on the action scenes instead of medium to close-up shots. Nevertheless, not a scene was wasted in keeping the story moving. The sixth film in the franchise is rumored to be a go; here's hoping it will be just as good as this one."
"Quinoa1984","7","2","4","31 July 2015"," more twists than a pretzel factory, but it's all about the set pieces
","One of the things that writer/director Christopher McQuarrie knows with his first big leap into a franchise such as M:I is this: sometimes you got to take from the best. Case in point is probably my favorite set piece in this movie - and needless to say, the set pieces are what makes it work ultimately, past the plot, which I may or may not get to later - in an opera house in Vienna. Everyone is seated watching this big opera going on, while Ethan Hunt (good ol' Mr. Cruise) is trying to track down an assassin who he saw in London and may try (or will) take out the Chancellor of Austria. There may be more than one assassin (indeed the entrance of this particular woman spy is as elegant as you'd expect, in a dress walking up a staircase, as one might expect in such a movie, but I digress). And there's another issue, which is that the clock is ticking to one point: the crescendo of a note to 'Tempo' (I think that's it, whatever) when a singer hits such a high point that an assassin can somehow shoot the Chancellor from afar and the performance can keep going on without interruption.<br/><br/>Sound at all familiar? Hitchcock did almost the same sequence - a concert with the note as the tipping point for the killer - in The Man Who Knew Too Much (34 and 56), and I'd best my car and my apartment that McQuarrie's studied Hitchcock like a doctor facing final exams. And yet he makes the sequence his own, making suspenseful moments building at every step, not to mention with Simon Pegg's tech-guy Benji on the laptop, as a fight ensues, the targets get aimed up, and then the fall out to try to escape. There may be moments during this and other times in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation where one credits the logic of how things are unfolding; why there aren't more guards at this opera, for example, or better surveillance or better controls over this and that. But McQuarrie also knows, for the worldwide audience for this kind of movie, your logic has to only take it so far while watching it.<br/><br/>There are MANY things that happen in Rogue Nation, and there are so many plot points and twists and turns - allegiances one questions, motives that are difficult to pin-point, and did I mention logic - that it'd be too much to sum it up in an IMDb comment. All you need to know is: Hunt's group, the IMF (not the International Monetary Fund.. I think, anyway) has been compromised and dismantled, and folded into the CIA (which doesn't seem to do much, don't they have operatives, again, questions I ask now leaving the theater). Now there's a ""Syndicate"" that is like the Anti-IMF, dismantling major financial organizations, killing leaders, and so on. Only Hunt can face this 'Syndicate' and its head, Lane, a very sinister-ly performed by Sean Harris, who is another in a long line of villains who have cold blood running through veins and minds like reinforced-titanium traps. Or something.<br/><br/>In other words, tension and suspense for the heroes, and another character here, like Renner in the previous movie (Ghost Protocl), who is hard to trust, played by Rebecca Ferguson. There were so many twists and turns in this story, as I said, that it neared the point of ludicrousness. How much can one take not knowing who to trust or what the British really want or who set up what organization? Well, a lot, as it turns out. Though I reached a point in the third act where I thought, ""Alright, I give up, I don't know where this is going and it's kind of dumb"", I was never really THAT confused, and I have to give credit to McQuarrie and his team for keeping things moving slickly and with a kind of intelligence about the improbability (no, uh, ""Impossible""-ity, and the word of the title is literally used in the movie at one point.<br/><br/>An example of that is the set piece involving a free-swim to change an entire hard-drive, under-water, for Pegg to get information for this and that and the other thing. How does this really work out? Does oxygen really work that way? Didn't I see this kind of mission years ago in a Ninja Turtles Nintendo game, with the same 'Oxygen' bar? But, hey, whatever, it's a ride, and just flippin' go with it. Though this will be a blockbuster that has a fairly indestructible hero, the fun really seems to be, after five movies it's more than clear enough, how he doesn't completely break after certain violent and hazardous scenarios. Hell, the movie starts off with the scene everyone sees in the trailer, with Hunt hanging off the side of a plane mid-air, asking with some impatience for Benji to open the door.<br/><br/>So, all in all, McQuarrie paying a kind of Hitchcock-on-steroids tribute with Rogue Nation, with a top shelf cast as always (Alec Baldwin for one) and as far as mindless Hollywood action tent-poles go with delirious chases and death-defying, nearly cartoonish levels of peril, it's better than most. And hey, at the least, the heroine remembers to run without her heels this time. 7.5/10"

","The latest instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise follows its impeccable trend to improve with time. Even when it didn't seem possible Rogue Nation out wits itself with a devastating amount of action and intelligent writing. The plot takes many twists and turns, its never difficult to follow yet a 2 hr movie feels like a 4 hr movie, not in a bad way either. It manages to pack such a detailed and analytical story into what could to prove the hollywood movie of 2015. Its smart, sophisticated, the action is brutal and plentiful. It has pretty much everything. It does cut out some of the humour but what it replaces it with is superb, the enemy feels threatening, you feel the magnitude and its oh so satisfying. Once more Tom Cruise is the consistent action hero who only becomes more likeable, he's backed up by brilliant on screen team as they pretty much blow us away. A note also to some sublime shots and editing in the most octane action sequences, they make the unbelievable seem believable and almost through the eyes of Ethan Hunt himself."

","The Mission Impossible series has become one of the more popular action franchises of the last two decades, and to think they're going to kill off that cash cow now is laughable. We all know that in the end IMF will more than likely triumph, and most likely Ethan Hunt will emerge miraculously unharmed. Should this knowledge stop you from enjoying the film? Absolutely not. I still enjoy James Bond movies even though you can pretty much predict how things will play out every time. It's not the destination, it's the journey, and the journey through these movies is intense, insane, and altogether enjoyable. The Mission: Impossible movies have been fairly consistent in their quality (save M:I2). They're like James Bond minus the sexist womanizing and adding teamwork!"

"TheDreadedChampion2019","8","0","0","17 March 2019"," ROGUE NATION
","The best thing about this movie is Rebecca Ferguson who plays Illsa Faust. She can hold her own in a scene with Tom Cruise and is incredibly beautiful, graceful, mysterious, and charismatic. Regular Cruise Collaborator Chris McQuarrie steps up to the plate to direct this one. He'd go on to helm the sequel FALLOUT. Before this he had written and produced Valkyrie, written Live Die Repeat and Ghost Protocol, and both written and directed Jack Reacher. He is closest in style to either Brad Bird or Brian De Palma. Bird in the way he continues with the same overall style and template that Bird had introduced, and like De Palma in that he is more of a classic kind of a filmmaker similar in many ways to Hitchcock as De Palma was. The movie kicks off and the fuse is lit with a breathtaking airplane stunt and then doesn't let go for the next 80 to 90 minutes. It slows down and gets a little clunky at the 90 minute point but picks up again for a great conclusion. Also Jeremy Renner's performance was a little...goofy at times and he was slightly under utilized. But overall Its one of the better, possibly even the best Mission: Impossible as a whole. The set pieces and action scenes are all memorable, Rebecca Ferguson is a fantastic addition and maybe the best character in the series, the music by Joe Kraemer is very good, better than Lorne Balfe's in Fallout for sure. Tom Cruise kind of screwed up the awesome haircut tradition of the series (switching from short on the odd numbered films to long in the even) in this one and I'm not a huge fan of his decision to sport a haircut that's basically neither. Kind of on the longer side, but who really cares. I notice this is a Mission I come back to almost more than any of the others. Its got a great style, tone, and its a lot of fun."
"tabuno","7","0","0","13 January 2019"," Almost Became a Parody of Itself
","4 August 2015. The disastrous opening almost verged into a poor, imitation, parody of Mission Impossible with dumbed down comic dialogue and less than interesting action set up that lacked the James Bond punch. The movie then settles somewhat uneasily into a comical version of itself and eventually focuses on the more serious action thriller that the franchise is known for. Nevertheless, Rogue Nation never quite achieves the sophisticated, consistent thrill plot outline that eerie, creepy Sherlock Holmes (2009) was able to create and enrapture and ensnare its audience with. Rogue Nation does hit some high notes in its vicarious chase scenes on motorcycles and uses nice psychological twists of betrayal. Alec Baldwin is severely underused as the CIA head as compared with The Bourne Identity franchise series. The plot seems choppy and the script is blatantly manipulative in is In some ways the television scripts of Leverage is able to be smartly portrayed in one hour episodes that that rival the fun cerebral elements that Rogue Nation attempted but was unable to accomplish."

","Rogue Nation is an endlessly amusing spy-fi flick from America's equivalent to the James Bond franchise. Mission Impossible has always managed to show entertaining international capers that defy real-world logic but not to the detriment of the final product. Tom Cruise reprises his iconic Super-Spy in Ethan Hunt and he's still an all-American master of espionage and saving the world from anarchy: which this guy basically eats for breakfast.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt has to save the world once again, this time from former MI6-agent-turned-terrorist, Solomon Lane. This time Ethan will need the help of a part-time hero and part-time villainess in Ilsa Faust: a spiritual Bond-girl who leaves many of the real and recently seen Bind-girls to shame. This film delivers the seamless action-thriller experience and story that James Bond's Spectre failed to deliver (at least in comparison to that series' masterful predecessor Skyfall), and I reckon it's great that there are two great franchises in the spy-fi field that have basically become equals in the entertainment industry: Mission Impossible and James Bond. Rogue Nation shows that the Mission Impossible series still has many action-packed stories to tell through Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation shows that the franchise still has boat-loads of cinematic fun left to have and it's only going to get bigger and bigger. Thankfully that proved to be the case with this film's sequel: Mission Impossible: Fallout. However, Rogue Nation is perfectly self-contained entertainment in and of itself anyway. Give this one a shot: it's action-adventure ecstasy in its purest form. <br/><br/>Rogue Nation gets a rock-solid 4.5/5 stars."

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie is able to create a film with the best qualities of its predecessors. The high levels of tension and suspense of M:I-1 and the non-stop action of M:I-3 are very well-balanced in Rogue Nation, which makes it another success inside an already fantastic saga. The action continues to be the highlight since Tom Cruise's mission apparently is to try and perform as many death-or-life situations as he can.<br/><br/>The plane sequence is riveting, the underwater set piece is (literally) breathtaking and the chasing scenes, whether on foot or by car or by a motorcycle, are incredibly exciting. McQuarrie directs the hell out of those scenes with an unique camera work, some beautiful cinematography, and seamless editing. The score is once again brilliant and it helps giving me some goosebumps.<br/><br/>The screenplay is captivating and it finally has another decent villain to rival with Philip Seymour Hoffman of the third installment. Sean Harris portrays Solomon Lane and, even though Lane isn't exactly an extremely well-written antagonist, at least he has clear motivations and a lot more screentime than other villains throughout the series. Still, he could have been better explored.<br/><br/>The new additions to the cast are sensational. Rebecca Ferguson brilliantly interprets Ilsa Faust, who has some great development along the runtime. Alec Baldwin (Alan Hunley) is also a great addition to the saga. I love that they decided to use Ving Rhames' character, Luther, more in this movie. He only had a tiny bit at the end of Ghost Protocol, so I am delighted to see him back on screen with his fantastic humor. Simon Pegg (Benji) is also becoming one of my favorite characters and Pegg proves that he can also accomplish some great dramatic scenes besides the frequent comic relief moments.<br/><br/>Finally, Jeremy Renner (William Brandt) continues to be an awesome actor by portraying a possible substitute of Ethan Hunt in the future of the franchise (even if I doubt that Renner would do all the crazy stuff Cruise does). Obviously, Tom Cruise is the standout with all of his jaw-dropping real stunts that most people don't even believe they are actually true. I bet that at least 7 out of 10 people that watched this movie at the time of its release, didn't believe for a single moment that the airplane scene was real ... This is saying a lot about the quality of the stunt team and the unbelievable courage of Cruise. Please, never stop doing this!<br/><br/>My only big issue with the movie is its pacing. Even though it gives more time for the audience to rest between action sequences, it becomes too much espionage exposition and it slightly becomes a bit boring. The tone is well-balanced, but the pacing really does not help at all the overall flow of the film. This aspect plus the not-that-great villain bring the movie a bit down for me but it is still right among the best in the franchise.<br/><br/>All in all, Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation provides the entertainment that the audience expects from it. Tom Cruise proves once again why he is an icon in action movie history with mind-blowing stunts and McQuarrie is able to elevate the levels of tension and suspense in the already fantastic action set pieces. Beautiful-looking and with a perfect score, a captivating story and a brilliant cast, filled with compelling characters. Definitely, one of the best of the saga."

","Just came out of the cinema watching Mission Impossible Fallout. <br/><br/>From beginning to end, enjoyed it, very satisfying and entertaining to watch. I would never think I would say this, but Fallout is my new favorite when it comes to Mission Impossible. It's clever, realistic, cool and a great synergy to the entire series. <br/><br/>I've watched all Mission Impossible movies in my time. In order to get more understanding at what's playing in the story it's good to watch part 5, Rogue Nation if you haven't done already. You'll get to enjoy it a bit more that way, I think.<br/><br/>Let's talk content.<br/><br/>Things I liked about Mission Impossible Fallout, including small references:<br/><br/>Vhing Rames is back as Luther, that feels good. Has been in every Mission Impossible movie part of the team, except for part 4, Ghost Protocol, you only see him at the end of the movie there.<br/><br/>Benjii gets more action, in the beginning and end. It's good to see he's knows his way around gun while still being the clever cool nerd of the team.<br/><br/>Ethan climbs a small surface up on a mountain at the end of the movie. I couldn't help think about the first scene in Mission Impossible 2, where he also does it without climbing gear for the cool opening intro there.<br/><br/>The action overall in Fallout is realistic. I really love how they shot the angles for certain scenes, Ethan on the motor in Paris, it gets you more drawn into it all. <br/><br/>The way Luther explains how Ethan really only cared about two woman in his entire life to Ilsa felt and looked really good, I think it added a good layer to the story. <br/><br/>I've never seen Henry Cavill play a bad guy. He does a surprising good job on that! I've seen him play angry superman in Justice League for a scene there, but that doesn't really count for me. <br/><br/>Julia makes a surprising appearance at the end of the movie and even plays a small part in helping the team. The acting felt natural and good around Julia and Ethan. Ethans look when he sees Julia in the camp is really surprised, that looked real good! Besides that it's kind of nice to see that Ethan has a love interest in Ilsa.<br/><br/>I think I'm going to watch to this for a second time in the cinema, that's how much I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I give Fallout a 9 out of 10."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","9","0","0","29 July 2018"," Raises the bar in terms of stunt-work and palpable action-sequences.
","'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015)' introduces a new level of palpability and is responsible for the whole series' retroactive, but slightly unwarranted, reputation for tangible, essentially 'real' stunt-work, thanks to its many fantastic set-pieces built solely around the slightly insane idea of Tom Cruise being as close to death as possible every moment he's on screen. This is really the reason why the film works so well and is as purely exciting as it is, as it always feels absolutely authentic and manages to keep the audience as engaged as possible with both its action and the characters caught up in it. It's interesting that each film in the series has significantly raised the bar in terms of action, and this is no exception. Thus far, the sequences in this picture are possibly the best in the series: fast, frenetic and fantastically composed. They're all very well conceived, crafted to be as exciting as possible. There's an ever-so-slightly darker tone this time, though things aren't dour and moments of levity are used to great effect. This vibe is bolstered by a smaller but seemingly more personal plot, which sticks closely to the roots of the franchise but does avoid many of its predictabilities. It's certainly an ensemble piece, as much as its direct predecessor. It has possibly the best cast in the entire series, and the most focus on them. All the core players are given several moments to shine, which means that you understand and care about them all. The momentum of the piece is kept thoroughly forward-moving without ever compromising on the character moments that make the narrative so impactful. The movie really is just incredibly entertaining when it gets going. 9/10"
"shakercoola","7","0","0","28 July 2018"," Strictly formulaic but plenty of surprise and thrills
","This fifth installment opens to one of the most thrilling pre-credit sequences of not just the film series but the action genre entire. There is no substitute for live action stunts and Cruise's determination to make the film do what it says on the tin - the impossible - is laudable. 
Simon Pegg is back in a larger supporting role as chatterbox analyst. He provides much of the humour, gluing Cruise's death defying escapes and scrapes together so things don't become too serious. Dressed-to-Kill British agent Rebecca Ferguson provides the athleticism and beauty and steals not only Cruise's gizmos but also some of his scenes. Sean H's villain is suitably quirky and menacing and guides the tension in climactic scenes.
There are a few false notes, namely that an Austran Chancellor seems less important than the British PM. The sequence at a Viennese opera resembles Quantum of Solace's right down to the detail..
All in all, a good action-adventure with thrilling motorcycle sequences and death defying aerial stunts, and on those elements its hard to say which is the better, Rogue Nation or its sequel."

This is the FIFTH film of the saga, and it might be the best one.<br/><br/>I just love, the way they have reinvented the franchise, and turned into a pure episodic, fun, and engaging adventure (aside from the CRAZINESS that is the technical aspect here). I could easily watch a new Mission Impossible movie ever 3 years for the next 20 years. The sad thing is, that Tom Cruise is mortal, so, he probably won't be doing this stuff 20 years from now. But man, what a franchise, and what a movie.<br/><br/>It's amazing how this movie is able to mix the tense ""vibe"" from the first one (something that MI3 and 4 weren't able to do), with the frenect and gorgeous action scenes from its two predecessors.<br/><br/>The movie starts by just knocking out of the park, with an incredible airplane sequence, that is also extremely funny (another hit, that started with Ghost Protocol).<br/><br/>The cast main cast is probably the best assemble on the franchise. Even though Paula Patton is great in MI4, Rebecca Ferguson simply DESTROYS in this movie. She is sexy as hell, but also a f#cking badass character, you can in the same scene fall in love with her, but also be frecking scared. She is just fantastic. Jeremy Renner is a win too, he was great in Ghost Protocol, and I was glad they brought him back. Bring Ving Rhames back was another thing they got it right, the guy has so much chemistry with the whole cast (mainly with Cruise). And, well, do I really need to talk about Simon Pegg and Tom Cruise? Pegg is such a talent actor, he is charismatic, funny, and every other compliment you can think of, he is just amazing.<br/><br/>And Tom Cruise... man, I don't even know what else I can say about him, the guy is a monster, a movie legend. Not only he is a great actor (like, with actual acting skills), but man, his commitment with this franchise is something unique, and is so great to see scenes that are performed by the actor (not an stuntman) and also shot in a real location. The same thing Keanu Reeves or Jack Chan do with their fight scenes, Cruise does here with those big action sequence. It's fantastic. Again, say what you have to say about the guy, but you have to admit that this is frecking awesome.<br/><br/>And, for me what makes this one competes with MI3 for the spot of the best one of the five, is that even the biggest problem that this franchise has had for the last 20 years doesn't show up here. The villain is actually pretty decent. He has enough back story, a great performance by Sean Harris, and you know, is decent overall, not a great villain, but a good one, that doesn't holds the movie back.<br/><br/>The story is engaging, an almost ""classic"" rogue organization story, that you saw before in other movies (a couple of Bond ones, for example), but this is fine. A movie not always need to reinvent the genre (in a storytelling perspective), if are into the characters, it's enough (and hell yeah, this is definitely the case here). The end is really clever though, a finale without a ""huge action outcome"", cause we already had that throught the movie, so is fun to be surprised by it (also, it's another caracteristic that was brought back from the first movie. Really cool).<br/><br/>To conclude, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is a fantastic movie, not only for those casual moviegoers but also for all the hardcore movie fans, that want to analyse it deeply. Definitely a must-see one for any action fans out there."

","Ok, that's not entirely true. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, so all of these movies are better than the first. The last 2 in particular have stepped up the action and comedy quite a bit! A must see, and I'm excited for the new one in the theatre. This one has some particularly tense moments, especially the underwater portion."
"morganstephens512","9","0","0","14 October 2017"," Great action scenes
","I would say this movie probably has the best action scenes in the series. The action is all well done and none of it feels so over the top that you can't be able to comprehend the fact that it is happening. It is a nice combination of fun and silly. The story line has a few good twists here and there and the character of Baldwin was a nice twist and I wonder how he will be in future installments. I also like the fact that the cast from the last movie, aside from the girl, were all in this movie. Which was a nice change instead of a cast that all dies off by the end of the movie or just leaves. And to cap it all off, Luthor continues his streak of being in every movie even if it is just for a quick ten second cameo"
"iquine","7","0","0","26 September 2017"," Cruise cheats death and defies age yet again
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This is your high end, glossy, mega summer action flic. The plot is the bland baked potato to add on the glitzly thrills and action scenes. Thus as the plot fades from memory, when I saw it a couple weeks ago, what remains is that government is trying to close down Ethan and his team as they are too high risk. Of course they prove their worth through many wiz-bang scenes, special effects and some really good chase scenes. Of course Cruise finds his way, once again, onto a crotch rocket. A very fun and thrilling popcorn movie that will help Cruise shovel cash into his bank account."

","""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is the fifth movie of the Mission Impossible franchise and it continues getting better. The movie starts where the fourth movie finished following the hints about Syndicate and how Ethan could reveal it.<br/><br/>I liked the movie and I enjoyed it more than I expected. The fourth movie of this franchise was equally good with this and I believe that they both followed the same pattern. Once more the interpretation of Tom Cruise was very good, another good interpretation in my opinion was Rebecca's Ferguson and Jeremy's Renner.<br/><br/>To sum up I would like to say that ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is really a worth watching movie and I recommended to everyone. This movie kept me in tense and it was very interesting. In addition to this it has to be considered as a successful blockbuster movie."

","Cruise was great as well as the entire cast, except for Alec Baldwin who is a bore and totally unconvincing as a serious actor. He belongs on sketch TV where potheads think he funny. Simon Pegg is funny and does his part with perfection. Rebecca Ferguson is suited well as an intriguing sexy spy, and the stunts are fabulous. As much as I have enjoyed Ving Rhames in past roles, he did not shine this time around. The entire movie was done extraordinarily well, and is Oscar worthy to me."
"Tweekums","8","0","0","19 June 2017"," An impressive addition to the franchise
","This, the fifth instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise, sees Ethan Hunt and the IMF working to bring down an organisation known as 'The Syndicate' and its leader Solomon Lane. This is apparently made up of agents from a variety of countries who have either been disavowed or believed dead it is also so shadowy that many people believe it is a figment of the IMF's imagination. The director of the CIA is one such doubter and he has successfully called to IMF to be shut down leaving Hunt officially unsupported. A lead takes him to Vienna where, with the help of Benji, he attempts to prevent the assassination of the Austrian Chancellor. Here he bumps into Ilsa Faust, a woman who previously helped him escape from The Syndicate. Later he will have to work with her but it isn't obvious whether she is also working to bring down The Syndicate or whether she is working for them to get Hunt to help them with a particular problem.<br/><br/>This is a fine addition to the Mission Impossible films. It gets off to an impressive start with an opening that sees Hunt clinging to the outside of a plane as it takes off that contains stolen nerve gas. Once the main story gets underway it is quickly explained what the latest mission is and that IMF have been officially shut down. The story is relatively simple but there is plenty of tension as we don't know where the loyalties of some key characters really are. Inevitable there lots of exciting moments, as well as the opening we get several impressive chases, a raid on a computer facility that requires Hunt to stay under water without breathing apparatus for a dangerously long time and a fight high above the stage of an opera house while a performance is underway. The pace of action means the viewer doesn't have time to think about how far-fetched it all is if it wasn't far-fetched it wouldn't be Mission Impossible! The cast does an impressive job, Tom Cruise continues to do a great job as Ethan Hunt as he makes the most unlikely things seem believable. He is ably supported by Simon Pegg, who brings some light relief as Benji; Rebecca Ferguson, as the ambiguous Isla and Sean Harris who is suitably menacing as the villainous Lane. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the franchise; it provides two hours of solid action that isn't too violent for younger viewers to watch."
"amusician-85649","7","0","0","11 June 2017"," The best one out of the Mission Impossible series.
","The first movie is okay, the second, third and fourth are boring, Rogue Nation is better than all of them combined, Rogue Nation has more action, more thrills and is altogether more lively.<br/><br/>The film score is catchy, although it does sound like it could also fit in with a comedy movie.<br/><br/>Great acting, great directing, and well-written.<br/><br/>A decent action flick."
"Samiam3","7","0","0","1 June 2017"," Ethan Hunt keeps plugging away
","Though not as visually dazzling as Ghost Patrol, Mission Impossible 5 still passes with flying colours. It does exactly what you expect it to do, which makes it as good to watch as it is forgettable after ward.<br/><br/>There are some sexy action pieces in this entry, complemented by Robert Elswit's crisp photography. A long sequence involves Ethan Hunt and his team have to crack a digitally advanced security system, with lots of digital projection. The cyber-tech in the movie is a little too extraordinary because it leans too close to science fiction. <br/><br/>In terms of the cast, the highlight is Simon Pegg. He bring a good dose of intelligent whimsy to a picture that is a little hard to take seriously. Tom Cruise does what he does best, although probably not doing as many of his own stunts as he used to. The baddies are all one- dimensional, but that isn't unusual in this franchise. Mission Impossible may be coming of age but it's not a dead franchise yet."
"bowmanblue","7","0","0","19 May 2017"," Which number is this in the franchise?
","I've just watched 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.' I notice that for a film in an ongoing franchise, it doesn't actually have a number attached to the title. I'm guessing this is generally because it doesn't matter which one it is. If you've seen any of the previous instalments (excluding the original which requires some sort of post doctorate in nuclear physics to understand the numerous double-crossing plot threads) then you'll know what you're getting. The 'MI' franchise has certainly settled into a formula and, try as I might to hate it for basically doing the same thing over and over again, I have to confess that I thoroughly enjoyed it (after all, if Marvel can do it, why can't Tom?!).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays oh, does it matter? He basically plays Tom Cruise playing a sort of James Bond role where his team of secret agents has to stop (yet another) super villainous organisation from overthrowing Britain. As a Brit, I could probably take offense at us needing saving, but my fellow countryman Simon 'Shaun of the Dead' Pegg is helping him out, so I guess I'll let that one slide. He accomplishes this through numerous high-octane car chases, gun fights and stunts – none of which leaving so much as a scratch on our hero.<br/><br/>Oh, dear – three paragraphs in and I'm already running out of things to say about 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.' I'm guessing that's because there's not much that can be said about it that you haven't already seen written about the others. In all the film franchises of recent times (including the reliably similar Marvel movies) this is just about as identical in structure as those that have come before it. In a nutshell: if you like Tom Cruise then you'll probably like this. If you've liked any of the previous instalments (2-4) then you'll also like this. Of course if you haven't seen any of them and you're just a fan of action movies with a pinch of spy/doublecross involved, again you'll get something out of it. You don't really need to know what's come before. You can join the franchise here or at any point after the first film. Just put your brain in 'neutral' and enjoy the nicely-choreographed action scenes and Tom Cruise fighting wave after wave of useless henchmen. Sheer popcorn fun.<br/><br/>Oh, and I've just checked online. It appears that yet another 'Mission Impossible' film is pencilled in for 2018. Gee, I wonder what that one will be like?! It's fair to say that I'll be watching it either way. The only downside will be that when I come to review it I'll probably have even less original observations to make about it than I did here!"

","I was predisposed to dislike this. Tom Cruise creeps me out. I wouldn't pay money to see one of his movies, but if one shows up on the library shelf I'll give it a whirl.<br/><br/>This rivets from the first scene because the first scene is a terrific stunt, it has humor, and the orchestration of the 50-year-old theme song is brilliant. There is no way that you can't be excited when that music is playing. So whoever did the arrangement and to the violin players A+.<br/><br/>A+ to the director and editor too because it was paced so well that I almost never stopped in the middle of it and thought: this plot is impossible and stupid. The plot was impossible and stupid, and the motorcycle stunt was beyond ludicrous, (and Cruise is creepy), but who cares because it's a fun popcorn movie."
"Prismark10","7","3","8","5 August 2015"," Hunt and the Syndicate
","Its 19 years since the first Mission Impossible movie and Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is no longer fresh faced he once was.<br/><br/>Now in its fifth instalment Rogue Nation is not as portentous as MI:2 and like the Bond franchise Cruise as Producer knows what makes his MI films tick. The downside is we have lost the individual elements that directors like Brian De Palma and John Woo brought in the earlier films.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation sees IMF agent Ethan Hunt going after a shadowy criminal organization known as the Syndicate who in a turnaround catch him and he escapes with the help of a Syndicate member Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson.) The IMF have now been disbanded thanks to the CIA Director played by Alec Baldwin and the rest of the team Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames go on a globe trotting pursuit to try to outsmart the Syndicate and be one step ahead of the CIA.<br/><br/>Like the fourth instalment with its landmark set piece of Cruise climbing the Burj Khalifa this one sees Cruise hanging on a plane. I presume he was aided by being on wires that was later digitally removed rather just hanging on with his hands as the plane took off for his own insurer's sake.<br/><br/>There is a nice opera set piece set in Austria but it did remind me of something similar done by Bond in Quantum of Solace a few years earlier as well as the opera backdrop being an important element for the climax of The Godfather III.<br/><br/>More novel was the set piece in Casablanca as Hunt dives underwater to change a profile key so Pegg can gain access to a digital safe. However writer/director Christopher McQuarrie surely missed a trick by not recycling lines from the film Casablanca. Not even a 'round up the usual suspects' dialogue somewhere!<br/><br/>Pegg again provides the comic relief, Renner and Rhames get to spar with each other as they meet for the first time in this movie. Ferguson is efficient enough as the mischievous spy being used by the Syndicate and MI5. The film also reunites the cast of the BBC comedy Rev with Simon McBurney playing the Intelligence Head and Tom Hollander playing the British Prime Minister.<br/><br/>Sean Harris is chilling enough as the villainous Solomon Lane but the MI films never seem to have had memorable villains apart from the first one which was for all the wrong reasons given how they urinated over a much loved character from the original television series.<br/><br/>This is a solid and enjoyable continuation of a film series admired by critics and the public. However I do think for the sixth film Cruise needs to hire a director who might inject some quirky individuality."

Okay, Connery and Stallone are out, but Damon and Cruise are now in. No more SMERSH but then we have ""The Syndicate."" If there are any consistent themes, they are advanced technology and the superior combat skills of the protagonist. <br/><br/>Well, I suppose there are other iterated shots at a more molecular level -- an armed man is fighting an unarmed man and there is a shot of the weapon skidding across the floor; one combatant slams his forehead against that of the other and disables him, and to hell with Newton; a shoe stomps on the accelerator cut to a tire burning rubber and raising a cloud of dust. This film as at least one example of each cliché. It's just added evidence that the fall of civilization is at hand.<br/><br/>Here's another I'll throw in for the cognocenti among us.

"padiyark","4","2","5","3 February 2016"," I've seen better films out of Bollywood
","If you have seen a Bollywood film, you know most are all flash with very little substance. Unfortunately, I would have taken one of those over this rubbish.<br/><br/>I picked it up on the great reviews I had heard, and watched it in Blu-Ray. When the beginning credits start rolling, when I saw that China TV and Alibaba were financing this, I had a hunch this was going to be bad.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, this is a Tom Cruise love fest, with a rehash of old stories. Once again, IMF is in trouble, but this time from the Feds for funding and incorporation into the CIA. All because one agent (Ethan Hunt) believes in the ""Syndicate"" and there is collateral damage. Hey, this is like the first movie when he gets ""NOC""'ed off and has to prove himself innocent. Action is always with a suit that somehow can weather the worst of conditions (off an airplane, bombing, fights, desert, etc.). The bad guy somehow has the unique insight to be indefeasible until Hunt is able to use some plot that appears to be hatched out of a Shamylan picture. Plot is pretty much a skeleton of the last few MI films, with some ""twists"" (which are pretty lame) in between. The supporting cast is basically there to give either humor (Pegg), crazy technical assistance (Rhames), glam (Ferguson), or just a warm body (Renner). Man, I could have used a few musical numbers with Cruise and Ferguson in some outlandish outfits with backup dancers to spice this movie up!<br/><br/>That being said, the action scenes are kind of cool if you watch them in a vacuum. In context to the plot, they become tiresome; either they drag too long, or they fail in the sense of ""Everyone else is deaf, dumb and blind"". I would rather watch Jackie Chan fight scenes from his worst movies; at least I know he is taking a beating for real, they work in context of the film, and he can make it look good.<br/><br/>While I understand that the MI films are what Tom Cruise can bank on for a check, it gets pretty stale when comparing the MI show of the 60s. The TV show at least had everyone participating in a pivotal role to carry out their mission. It never was about Phelps, Collier, Hand, or Armitage; they all worked together to make the mission work. Tom's MI film are him doing the dirty job so he gets the glory.<br/><br/>Old Tom is getting up there in age, and it really shows in this film. He needs to let some more talented actors (not just one, but 3-4) take the reigns of the franchise and just produce it. Grow up Tom. Even Burt Lancaster knew when to hang up the action movies. <br/><br/>Don't waste your $1.50 rental on this film ($1 on DVD)"
"lucasversantvoort","8","2","5","18 November 2015"," Christopher McQuarrie to the rescue
","The Mission Impossible franchise has been going strong for quite a while now. After the first film in 1996, sequels have been made every five years or so. I have yet to see the first three, but I did see Ghost Protocol, although I can't seem to remember much of what happened. I do remember watching Tom Cruise swinging on the side of a building and wondering what Jeremy Renner was doing in that film. Rogue Nation on the other hand is a different story...<br/><br/>After a rather dull opening action scene, the film begins proper. The central story revolves around a shadowy group known as the Syndicate. Ethan Hunt is determined its existence to the CIA, but he is captured by one of its members, Janik Vinter. He escapes and decides to get his revenge, though he'll have to do it behind the government's back. He slowly teams up with his usual merry band of misfits and together they start figuring out ways to eradicate the Syndicate before they are themselves eradicated. They're aided by one of Janik's accomplices, Ilsa Faust, who gets to play double agent.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Usual Suspects and Edge of Tomorrow-alumnus Christopher McQuarrie, this film benefits from a tighter and better flowing experience. Aside from a rather uninteresting opening, the rest of the film is tightly paced, consistently interesting and entertaining.<br/><br/>One of Rogue Nation's greatest assets is Ilsa Faust. Spy films have often relied on a female agent or a femme fatale. More often than not, these films fall into the trap of relegating her to a supporting (aka useless) role or by turning her into the damsel in distress. Rogue Nation avoids any of these pitfalls by making Ilsa the hero's equal. She saves his life at least twice and doesn't even need rescuing herself. She eventually has a knife fight with this hulking giant and I feared that Ethan would predictably rescue her just as she was about to lose, but no, she takes that guy down with style to spare. Not only is Ilsa written to perfection, she's also played to perfection by Rebecca Ferguson, a natural beauty who also doesn't skimp things in the acting department. And to top it off, she and Ethan ride off into the sunset without actually doing so. She alone rides off, telling Ethan he knows how to find her. The film thus confirms the romance while still allowing her to preserve her independence, but I can easily accept this romance when both characters occupy the same level of badassery and importance to the story. Thank you, McQuarrie, for implying the romance and not succumbing to the 'sex sells' mantra. It's a character you can take seriously. Needless to say, she steals every scene.<br/><br/>All in all, I was incredibly pleased. Ghost Protocol? Please, give me Rogue Nation any day of the week. You're not going to walk away like you feel you've reached enlightenment or anything, but you are going to walk away feeling you've finally seen a really great Mission Impossible film again and isn't that why we're here in the end? I feel like I should give it a 7, but I'll go one step beyond."
"tonybellagio","10","2","5","3 November 2015"," Best movie of the saga!

A never seen in the franchise as or it was very serious spying like the original back in 1996 or it was so spectacular and fast paced that nothing else mattered like in the 2011 outing.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is better than ever and is stunningly paired with Rebecca Ferguson.

"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","2","5","1 October 2015"," Decent popcorn entertainment.
","I'm not usually a fan of the Mission Impossible franchise, but Brad Bird's Ghost Protocol was the exception. With inspired creativity and keen timing, it stands as one of the better blockbusters of the decade. Rogue Nation, directed by Christopher McQuarrie who seems to have a significant partnership with Tom Cruise in his post-Usual Suspects days having directed Jack Reacher and written Edge of Tomorrow and Valkyrie, doesn't quite aim for the same mark. It's far from interested in subverting clichés, instead piling them on as quick as possible to make sure we're not too far ahead of the writers. It's not necessarily predictable, but it's not very surprising either, having the whole narrative basically having the heroes in the bad guy's hands. The set pieces are hit and miss, and it usually goes for easy options to solve problems. Unfortunately, the other films in the franchise aren't memorable enough for me to track an arc for Ethan Hunt, as the film desperately wants us to care about Cruise's relationship with Simon Pegg. At least breakout star Rebecca Ferguson is establishing herself very well. It's decent popcorn fluff, with a couple thrills and a few chuckles, but nothing special. More of an excuse to try out some stunts and flex some muscles.<br/><br/>6/10"

I'm not sure all of it makes sense but I was able to follow most of what was going on this time though I'm sure I'll forget many of it in the days to come. No matter as me and my movie theatre-working friend were riveted enough by the action and much of the dialogue while watching. I certainly was very taken with the great beauty that is Rebecca Ferguson every time she appeared whether in a dress or swimsuit and certainly by her fight scenes! Of the returning cast, I loved both Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames the best. Oh, and Alec Baldwin made a fine superior this time around.

","Somewhere in Belarus, secret, secret agent Ethan (Tom Cruise) and his sidekick Benji (Simon Pegg) are trying to stop a plane from taking off with a dangerous cargo. It's tricky. Our Ethan has to jump on the plane and trust that Benji gets the computer systems to open the door. Whew, that was a close one, as Ethan parachutes away with the weapons cargo. Is it just another day in the life? Yes. But, not long after, Ethan goes into a record store in London, expecting to receive his next mission but, instead, is kidnapped by another secret, nefarious agency, The Syndicate. Meanwhile, Ethan's boss (Jeremy Renner) has failed to convince HIS superior (Alec Baldwin) that this covert arm of the CIA should still be in operations. It's shut down, so there won't be a rescue team for Ethan. However, just as EH is being pummeled by the enemy, a beautiful lady operative, Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) works to free him, at risk to herself, for she has infiltrated the enemy and can't blow her cover. Naturally, Ethan is NOW after the Syndicate. This takes him to the opera in Vienna, the mountains of Morocco, and back to London again. Mr. Hunt will need help from all of his friends, plus Luther (Ving Rhames), Ilsa, and the Prime Minister of England (Tom Hollander) to bring down his enemy. Can he really do it, specially since the head of British Intelligence may be a turncoat? This fine action flick, the fifth in a series, has many wonderful assets. First, the cast is just great, with Cruise slipping into his part in a fine ensemble without any obvious attempts to keep the camera on him. Well done, Mr. Cruise. Pegg, Baldwin, Renner, Hollander, Rhames, Simon McBurney, and all the rest each contribute to the flick's success. Ferguson is quite a find, a newcomer who recalls the beauty and fire of Catherine Zeta-Jones. Then, the settings are stunning, of course, with a wonderful scene backstage at a live production of Turandot, where body blows accompany the superb arias. In addition, there's the motorcycle chase on a coastal highway in Morocco that is out of this world. Naturally, the opening sequence with Cruise hanging on for dear life as he waits for the plane's doors to open is breathtaking. I could go on, but I won't. The story, also, is a clever tale of two Rogue Nations, one for good and one for bad, and includes technology that most can follow. So, what's really not to like? Your mission, and you NEED to accept it, film fans, is to make time for Mission Imp."

","First of all I have to say that I like the Mission Impossible franchise and I was sceptical about this one so my expectations were not that high. I was entertained but it has a lot of, to put it mildly, shortcomings.<br/><br/>The action was decent and fun but I think they gave away too much of it in the trailer(-maybe spoiler- You can see the best of the opening sequence, but its not connected to the plot anyway, which is a shame because I liked it). The plot is not really spectacular and it is predictable to a degree, where its just painful. You always feel like you've seen it before, what you probably have and I always thought: ""Hey, this would have been great, if I had never seen a heist/action or spy film before."" But this is not the case, and you should be able to expect more from it, than just a new version of stuff you've seen a hundred times. It really adds nothing new to the genre or the franchise or movies in general and the action can't make up for it, so it can be really boring(A friend of mine even fell asleep while watching it). I don't want to talk about acting because I watched the German dub and good voice acting can make up for bad acting sometimes. Plus it's not that important in a film like this.<br/><br/>Some may like it. Some may hate it. It's not a movie you need to see more than once and I kind of regret spending money for it. You can wait till you're able to watch it at home."

","I will be honest, I didn't know what to expect when I went to watch this movie with a friend last night.I didn't even bother to watch trailer nor my friend, so I went in blind and was blown away by this movie.<br/><br/>Now before I really start, I will say that I had doubts about this movie being victim of ""re-living old fame"". Just one of those with ""big names"" and little less to offer, oh boy how wrong was I.<br/><br/>This movie is almost everything I wanted it to be.It has nice balance between old classics (James Bond movies... before Daniel Craig Daniel Craig , before they became Bourne ""wanna be"" ) and modernized style.It's filled with action,top notch acting, it just trills with atmosphere of those old spy movies which I watched as a kid from the opening to end.<br/><br/>Also big deal in this movie is humor.It's so well placed and actors really breath life into jokes, you will laugh like crazy.When we are at actors they really shined in this movie,I wish that I had seen more of Ving Rhames, though.<br/><br/>This is something you shouldn't miss if you are into this kind of movies and like Tom Cruise."
"aaronjbong","9","2","5","2 August 2015"," Spectacular and Immensely Fun, ""Mission: Impossible"" Keeps Soaring
","*VERY MINOR SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The fifth installment of the now quintessential action spy franchise has arrived 19 years since the original. Times change, the crew changes, yet our hero is always going to be Ethan Hunt. This time, he's going to face his most seemingly impossible mission yet: take down a mysterious anti- IMF group called the Syndicate, with the help of a few allies and a disavowed British agent who may or may not be on his side. <br/><br/>Let's get on to the points. <br/><br/>Pros (Things that I enjoyed about the film)<br/><br/>1. The film starts with a blast with full-throttle action and doesn't hold up until the end of the movie. It's very fast-paced and an exhilarating adventure. <br/><br/>2. Our main team is made of our favorite agents: the nearly- superhuman Ethan Hunt, the lovable tech-genius Benji Dunn, the kick-ass William Brandt, and the return of original computer hacker Luther Stickell. It's worth to note that there aren't any female IMF agents though. <br/><br/>3. The two mega-action sequences here are able to stand alongside the stand-out scenes from its predecessor: the underwater scene and the airplane scene. <br/><br/>4. Tom Cruise is an action machine and here, he continues to just prove that he's the best at what he does, and despite his increasing age, he's also increasing his credentials as an action movie stars. It also amazes me that even at more than 50, he's still willing to do his own stunts. Incredible. <br/><br/>5. The villain here is the mysterious Syndicate. I found its motives to not be that original but not too preposterous and lazy either. (I'm pointing at you M:I 2. Spreading a disease and curing a disease?)<br/><br/>6. Rebecca Ferguson's character is a welcome addition to this film. Her presence adds another layer of mystery and keeps us guessing on whose side she really is on. <br/><br/>7. The story takes place on many different locations around the globe and including an exotic one (Morocco). This is one of the many things I really like about global espionage films. <br/><br/>8. The humor here is spot-on too. It does not feel forced and for the most part, it works. But more importantly, it does not detract from the direction of the plot and does not become distractions. <br/><br/>9. The climax is very smart and is immensely satisfying. It's lengthy and even without a jaw-dropping moment, it culminates into a very thrilling and pleasing finale. <br/><br/>Cons (It doesn't necessarily bog down the film but I felt that it could have been changed for the better)<br/><br/>1. There are many action sequences but I was disappointed that there was a lack of action scenes led by Jeremy Renner. We've seen him kick-ass in the previous installment, as Hawkeye in the ""Avengers"" films, and even become the leading role in ""The Bourne Legacy"". I really thought I would see him get some solo time, but not here. <br/><br/>2. I felt that the ending was a tad bit too abrupt. I would love to see more of the immediate aftermath for those more involved in the conflict. <br/><br/>3. The situation faced by the heroes is very similar to ""Ghost Protocol"", in the sense that they are disavowed by the authorities and therefore they are wanted people.<br/><br/>4. (Minor spoiler) The whole four-man team only get together halfway into the movie, so there's not a lot of action sequences where they all team up together where each does their own job and depends on the other (i.e. the Burj Khalifa scene and the India scene from ""Ghost Protocol""). In most scenes here (especially the beginning), the main team is separated and off doing their own missions.<br/><br/>5. The conflict here is between Ethan Hunt and the Syndicate. At one point, it becomes personal, but I felt it was not just as personal as the one present in ""M:I 3"" where Ethan's girlfriend is abducted by Philip Seymour Hoffman's character. <br/><br/>6. Alec Baldwin's character is more comic than imposing as his role suggests (can be a good thing, depending on how you look at it?)<br/><br/>Overall, ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is a very solid and very well-done action movie that is on par with the previous installment, which itself is already an incredible thrilling ride. It doesn't necessarily add anything game-changing to the franchise, but it doesn't put anything ""Ghost Protocol"" accomplished to waste. It certainly was very fun and ranks among the best entry in the franchise alongside ""Ghost Protocol"". It identifies what we love about the previous installments to deliver an entry that is immensely pleasing and satisfying. This movie is highly recommended whether you're a fan of the franchise, of action spy films, or of Tom Cruise. <br/><br/>Even after 19 years, the franchise just keeps soaring and if sequels are as good as this, I will certainly be looking out for future installments."
"billygoat1071","8","2","5","1 August 2015"," Impossible Made Believable
","Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation basically just follows the success of the franchise's best installments, by creating a number of excitingly put set pieces that would fit right in to a rather forgettable plot. But the heart has always been the action and its fun characters involved. Therefore, it's a gripping piece of action blockbuster. It hardly transcend anything aside of the stunts of its main star, but no disappointment would come to this experience either. If you're a fan of these movies or action movies in general then this is a perfect piece of action movie entertainment.<br/><br/>It can be assumed that this might be exactly the same as Ghost Protocol. But the huge differences I could count on is this installment may not be so straightforward, however at least has a more intriguing villain. But the plot is what most moviegoers tend to overlook nowadays and in some aspects it can be a good thing, for this case at least. Again, it's all about its inventive action; driven with suspense and daring stunts. And the real villains that will be genuinely acknowledged are physics and getting the heroes' covers blown. That mindset would definitely bring a better experience, because the story eventually leads to a twist that hardly makes sense, but won't even matter anyway, as long as you just follow the journey.<br/><br/>And every action sequence is just downright thrilling and undeniably memorable. It starts with Ethan Hunt hanging on a plane and of course, Tom Cruise did his stunts there. And that is a far more breathtaking to watch than any CGI effect in this movie (especially that fakest looking car crash scene, but it's nothing more than quibble, actually). And thankfully, most of the movie is practical; generally showcasing Cruise's physical skills even in this age. Aside of that immediately spectacular opening; there are still some worth mentioning set pieces like when Ethan is trying to fight off an enemy while dangerously trying to balance on a number stage lights. And a long motorcycle chase, though is ridiculous in context, but quite thrillingly shot enough to make it worth having. Another one takes place underwater is reminiscent to 2013's Gravity. I'm basically not spoiling anything; in fact, even mentioning them isn't quite enough. It needs to be seen.<br/><br/>The acting obviously brings the charm into these globetrotting missions. Tom Cruise gives fortitude at any move this character is given, making the action even more effective. Simon Pegg has often been appeared as the comic relief, but he also establishes an engaging character in his role. Which makes Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames the total comic in their roles. Newcomer Rebecca Ferguson gives edge to her role's coldness.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is no groundbreaker, but it still delivers the same pleasure. Proving that the possibilities of creating a variety of amazing set pieces is just immeasurable, and no one's gonna deny that it's all Tom Cruise's physical performance is what's making these scenes seem so dangerous, yet extremely fun. The story is still not quite remarkable, but it's the achievement from the filmmakers and the actors is what glosses the flaws and made the experience as a whole a tremendous example of a true action blockbuster."
"Arun145","9","2","5","1 August 2015"," 'Rogue Nation' provides another stellar installment in the 'Impossible' franchise
","Tom Cruise and Co are back with a bang in this fifth installment as Ethan Hunt is in pursuit of a anti- government agency known as 'The Syndicate' whilst being chased by the CIA and Alec Baldwin. 'Rogue Nation' delivers a powerful punch by way of its remarkable action set-pieces, from Tom Cruise hanging off a plane to jumping into a whirlpool. Cruise's status as action superstar is now beyond all doubt as he is once again the star of the show, Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner are also great, providing comic relief whilst maintaining a subtle dramatic touch to their roles. The new addition comes in the form of Rebecca Ferguson playing a skilled assassin playing both sides equally leaving the audience questioning her loyalties. Ferguson is a fantastic casting choice as she is able to share the screen with her co-stars and outshine them by some way, the 'Mission' franchise once again supplies a strong female lead which many other franchises are simply neglecting. The film hearkens back to previous mission films with an increased focus on espionage and deceit rather than the more blatant approach we received with 'Ghost Protocol' this is certainly welcome as Christopher McQuarrie, the films writer and director, creates an intricate setting in which viewers are made to think ""who is the bad guy?"". The film becomes problematic when it focuses too much on the story without utilising the characters McQuarrie shows us namely Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell who is criminally underused and instead becomes non-existent in scenes. It is also SLIGHTLY too long with an extra 10-15 mins that could do with cutting. Nevertheless 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is an accomplished piece which has some truly incredible set-pieces that action films today very rarely will compare to and is certainly one of the better films in the franchise."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","5","1 August 2015"," Not quite the best but great fun
","Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has had a remarkable cinematic career which began 34 years ago and, after no less than 38 movies, is as strong as ever. At the very core of his success is the ""Mission: Impossible"": franchise which has now been running for almost two decades. Except for the sequence where he breaks into the CIA's Headquarters, I was not massively impressively by the first film, but the second and third outings were much better and the fourth was terrific. Last time, we had Cruise - who famously does his own stunts - hanging from the Burj Klaifa, the tallest skyscraper in the world, and I guess nothing was going to top that. So ""M:I 5"" is (perhaps inevitably) a bit of a disappointment but still cracking good entertainment.<br/><br/>Cruise still has star quality and still looks good at 52 (when he shot the film) and Simon Pegg as Benji has an important support role. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames, as the other members of the IMF team, do not have much to do. Sean Harris is not a particularly scary villain, while Tom Hollander looks plain silly as the British Prime Minister. The casting revelation of the movie is the half British, half Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson who did her own stunts and is the strongest female character in any ""M:I"" film. Every film in the franchise has had a different director but this time Christopher McQuarrie is responsible for both direction and screenplay.<br/><br/>As usual, the plotting is somewhat chaotic and utterly implausible. The main problem though is that, fifth time round, we seems to have seen so much of it before and indeed there are deliberate allusions to all the previous four movies. So we are back in London (although there seems to be ubiquitous fog which hasn't been the case for 50 years); we have a another list on a memory stick (although nobody seems to use them any more); we have another impossible break-in (which manages to be possible); and there is even an (unexplained) appearance of the rabbit's foot (where were the white doves?). But, heh, it's still so much fun."
"mballardc32","7","2","5","1 August 2015"," Cinematic Joyride
","I really enjoyed this movie. It felt like a legitimate action movie experience. Something that a lot of directors have failed to make these days. Knowing that a large amount of the stunts were done by Tom Cruise certified an authenticity of the genre performance. The mix of some animated sequences and gaming styled scenes were suited very well that it added to the experience of this movie. The music was typical spy music and original soundtracks from Mission Impossible the original. There was also reprises of Nessun Dorma playing under some scenes which always lifted the emotional effect of the chosen scenes. The cinematic work was brilliant for an action movie. It really through the audience into the action. Especially during the chase scenes, the camera work was invigorating. The dramatisation was brilliant with a good mix of comedy and seriousness. Truly hope that they continue with this franchise a little while longer. Overall a great movie with brilliant, all round, cinematic work."
"elsa_fridl","8","2","5","1 August 2015"," A Wild Ride
","Tom Cruise takes you on a wild ride in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. The opening scene sets the pace: He hangs onto a plane as it takes off in order to retrieve its hazardous payload. Cruise, as Ethan Hunt, needs to bring down The Syndicate, a rogue group of international agents with a terrorist agenda: To accomplish his mission, he must find the group's leader and the flash drive that contains secret bank account numbers for the group's operating expenses. As he gives chase, Hunt runs into Ilsa Faust, played by Rebecca Ferguson, a British Agent who keeps you guessing who she's really working for. But Jeremy Renner, as the head of the IMF, got the most laughs from this Washington audience that is so used to hearing ""I can neither confirm nor deny that information, Senator."" With Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin, and Ving Rhames adding to the mix, Cruise shows he's still a force to be reckoned with. I can't wait for his next mission."
"tlphillips-06122","7","2","5","31 July 2015"," Spectacular ""group effort"" that leaves the lead character behind!
","The action was right there but the usual bland focus grouped PC mush story line was beyond pathetic. The most that can be said is that the studio hacks apparently succeeded in offending no ethnic groups or genders! Yeh! The main character's name, Ethan Hunt, is rarely said in this spectacular ""group effort"" where the UK girl spy is every bit the agent he is and in some scenes better. In fact Ethan Hunt has gotten such a PC scrubbing, he is lost in the ""group"" and mostly average as the spies exchange saving each other throughout the movie – both fighting their way out of victim-hood. More noticeable then usual is that the villain's story line makes no sense as a terrorist plan endangering the world ...uh, somehow. During the intense planning sessions, most of the conclusions the spy team reaches are stupid funny. Hollywood can't resist showing their ignorance of national defense by tossing in some ridiculous nonsense about the west running around arbitrarily killing innocent global citizens – more embarrassing then insightful like most of what comes out of that wacky town of the over opinionated and under educated. So like 95 out of 100 movies these days – have fun but leave your brain at home and try not to be too envious of the stupid people in the audience having so much more fun then you are."
"tjgoalie13","9","2","5","31 July 2015"," A Great Spy Action Flick
","Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation Is a funny, action packed, and just in general good spy action flick. The film features terrific action sequences, made all the better by Tom Cruise's devotion to doing his own stunts. In particular the motorcycle chase is my favorite single action sequence of this year. The film takes some liberties, and has a few inventions that don't seem technologically possible, but at the st seems as though Mission Impossible has become the Fast and Furious of spy films, where it may not be the most realistic, but it remains aware, and constantly tries to up itself. As well the film has a few too many clichés, and has a somewhat weak villain, but due to it's engrossing plot, great action, sense of humor, and it's nearly non-stop pacing these flaws are in general forgivable."
"jmoneyjohal","7","2","5","31 July 2015"," Some kickASS fun, mission accomplished!!!
","Could i have just watched the best Mission Impossible today? Well maybe, but one thing is for sure MI4 is a damn fun film. The action is top notch, and will leave you in awe. Especially the water tanker scene, and the car/motorcycle chase scene,don't miss those scenes. And the locations are breathtaking, you will see Morocco,Cuba,London etc like never before .The production values are top notch. But does film have a good story, well lets observe.<br/><br/>Story wise the film is pretty much about a rouge syndicate, doing terror acts across the world. On the other side the IMF has been abolished by the USA government, and the main character Ethan Hunt aka Tom Cruise is now a rouge agent which the CIA want too arrest. Ethan Hunt though has other plans, and tries to elude the CIA. He wants to find out who is running the syndicate, and wants to destroy it. That is pretty much the main plot and to find out if he does, rush to the theatres.<br/><br/>As you could you tell the story is not very novel but its told in a fresh narrative, but when watching a MI film, you don't look for cinematic genius, you look for some kickass fun, and thats what you get. A sleek,espionage spy action adventure.And plus its so fun to watch the cast of IMF back again, the characters, and there chemistry is impeccable.<br/><br/>Acting wise Tom Cruise lives the MI films, his action scenes are simply amazing. Simon Pegg is hilarious, and his chemistry with Cruise is impeccable.Rebecca Ferguson,Jeremy Renner, and Alec Bladwin are all good in there brief roles.<br/><br/>Overall if your looking for some kickass fun and if your a fan of the MI films this film is a must watch.The films narrative is fast and never bores. <br/><br/>3.5/5* or 7/10"
"beheadedchicken1","8","2","5","31 July 2015"," Another entertaining, intense, and satisfying Mission Impossible, however standard it is.
","Fresh out of the theatre I kept saying how cool some of the scenes were, like I did when I was a kid. ""Remember that chase,"" ""remember that part when."" Mission Impossible, and most if not all other action movies live or die on the quality of their set pieces. From the hook, to exotic car chases, to life threatening situations, to the climax. The better action movies tend to have their set pieces nailed down, but with enough interest between those moments to keep you going. The Bourne Trilogy did this particularly well, one of my personal favourites. Even still, an action movie can be praised and even loved without a good story or characters, but on the action alone. <br/><br/>Thankfully, Rogue Nation is not one such movie. It does have a interesting plot, and it does have old characters we love and care for, as well as new ones to be intrigued by. All of it is glued together by writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, the writer of last years Edge of Tomorrow, and Academy Award winning writer of The Usual Suspects. His experience may sound promising, and his job of writing here was successful, but the plot, along with it's twists and turns are standard, and to be expected. I've seen all of these aspects one place or another.<br/><br/>That's not to say that that takes too much away from the movie. When you watch Rogue Nation, you forget about the clichés and the last movie you saw that in, because everyone who made this movie did it better. The impossible feats that Ethan Hunt takes on are nail bitting no matter how much you've assured yourself he's going to succeed. The constant danger he actively puts himself in only gets better when you see Tom Cruise doing damn near everything. You clench in your chair because you think Tom's going to die in real life, and it makes the situation his character in more intense because of it.<br/><br/>Every chase and fist fight is nailed down to a tee, and is utterly satisfying. In this post-Mad Max: Fury Road world, the editing may be annoying still for some, but if you haven't seen Fury Road, or if you can forget about it, it's some of the best pre-Mad Max: Fury Road action you can find around. The direction and sound are top notch, allowing you feel every impact and see it clear enough.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise does a great job at being Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner does a good Jeremy Renner, and Simon Pegg nails yet another action movie-comic relief role. Most notable is the addition as Rebecca Ferguson as Isla Faust. Her character is the fuel to the fire in this movie, and her smart and sexy performance does as good of a job testing our allegiances as does it Ethan Hunt's. Also worth noting is Sean Harris as the big bad. He doesn't have too much to do because his character has no real depth, yet he finally gives the series a villain worth taking down with a menacing role nonetheless. <br/><br/>Ultimately, what made this movie so great was the superb action. Every set-piece is crafted by a team that knows what they're doing, and they do it very well. Watch the movie for that alone, if modern action hasn't been ruined by the catalyst that is Mad Max: Fury Road. However, if you care for the characters (an easy task), then you will find Rogue Nation not only entertaining, but wholly satisfying as well. McQaurrie used a surprising amount of restraint in some story arcs, particularly in the relationship between Hunt and Faust, that makes the experience much more satisfying, as it doesn't blow the whole movie out of the water with unrealistic and gratuitous ""payoffs."" Obviously, a certain suspension of disbelief is required for this series, but that plays within the grounds it has since the very first release. I mean, Impossible is the franchise name.<br/><br/>Anyway, go see this movie. It's a smart action movie made by an experienced team that know how to craft amazing action, while not forgetting about what glues it together. What else could you ask for. (other than Mad Max: Fury Road)"

","What surprises me is that every couple of years a new MI comes out, and the well-weathered Tom Cruise never seems to change. But here he is again, and doing his own stunts it would seem.<br/><br/>The Odor of the IMF was not quite pleasant even after Ghost Protocol. We mainly have the same team from that film with a few slight changes. That is, if the IMF will even exist at the end of this tale. It seems that Hunt's team pulls off their latest mission by luck alone. And then Hunt is tricked and trapped by a weak-chinned terrorist (Sean Harris as ""Solomon Lane"") and tortured and then helped by a shadowy woman (""Ilsa Faust"" Rebecca Fergusen).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the IMF has been disbanded while Brant (Jeremy Renner) and Dunn (Simon Pegg) have been swallowed by the CIA, who are interested in Hunt's movements for the last 6 months. Because dozens of Agents from ""friendly"" agencies around the world are turning up dead or vanished. We don't really know if Brandt and Dunn are covering for Hunt - Until Dunn appears to have won Opera Tickets for a Viennese Opera.<br/><br/>That's how this all starts, in the Opera House. Hunt is there looking for Mr. Weak Chin, but the Chancellor of Austria shows up unexpectedly. And a lot of bad things start to happen.<br/><br/>Actually, Hunt had been following a trail of bad things happening all around the world, and there are always two things in proximity of these events, the Shadow Woman played by Ms Fergusen and Mr Weak-Chin. Who are these people, what do they want, and why is the woman helping Hunt sometimes? This is classic Cold War spy stuff, without the damned Cold War to interfere with what is a well constructed story, well acted by the whole cast. Instead of ""Russia"" we have what is called a ""Rogue Nation"", which makes it a lot more interesting, because you can't place it on a map. And of course, there are all of the little plot twists and reversals like in the other MI films. Except here, it's more like a long episode of the original TV series. With a lot of action, but compared to the first 4 MI offerings not too over the top."

You can see on almost all the faces of the actors a smile that's hidden in a lot of scenes. Good example; when the afro-American man comes out of the chopper and has a dialog.<br/><br/>Since there wasn't enough money for the movie, there came an overload of sponsors that wanted to help very badly. Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, Ray Ben, BMW.. and those are only the names I recognized (I'm in IT). I have never seen a movie where sponsors where so recognizable, like; they weren't even trying to make it subtle. Tom Cruise holding a Nokia Lumia 930 upside down even makes it worse!<br/><br/>Story line seems like a 'they think I'm crazy but eventually I'm not.. friends keep supporting me and we're a crew4ever <3 you all'. Jep. Nothing more. Total bull-crap.<br/><br/>Summary: The actors thought about easy money and so did the director. Nobody in the movie gave anything about trying hard, and that is noticeable. Every scene feels like being at the recording and seeing the actors practice a scene and trying to hold their laugh. Script was crap and felt like a Spongebob episode without the entertainment and bad jokes.<br/><br/>Why do I give this move a 5/10?

","I think the Mission Impossible franchise is the only truly great action franchise still left. I mean, this started in 1996 and literally has only gotten better over two decades. Star and Producer Tom Cruise doing his own insane stunts, amazing action, plots filled with gadgets and espionage and terrorism, explosions, hand to hand combat and the newest entry, Rogue Nation felt more like a James Bond film than ever and I mean that in the most complimentary sense. Cruise's Ethan Hunt is as good as James Bond has ever been and that franchise has been around for decades. They have never rushed out a Mission Impossible film, they seem to take care and timing and make sure they find the right director to tell the story. They maintain continuity and characters returning and Rogue Nation is as balls to the wall as its ever been. It isn't the best in the franchise (that goes to MI:3 in my books) but it is absolutely the action film of 2015. I went in with high expectations and nothing was left unmet. I was floored by the action and story and incredible visuals and stunts. If you've seen one great car chase scene, you've seen them all and yet here comes Mission Impossible with a fresh take that has you clutching the seat with both hands.<br/><br/>I've never stopped liking Tom Cruise. The man is thee vision of Hollywood. He has had a decades spanning career with some amazing films. Look at his acting credits and find a ""bad"" movie, or a movie that didn't do well. Despite her personal life, people seem to keep coming back to see him. He has an undeniable chemistry on screen and he commands your attention. His Ethan Hunt is an unstoppable killing and espionage machine. He is as good as ever in Rogue Nation. He shows intensity and skill but is also the perfect hero to root for. Jeremy Renner also returns from his debut in Ghost Protocol. Initially I have never cared much for Renner and yet he seems to be coming around to having more of a personality on screen. He was much better in this years Age of Ultron and I actually liked him way more than MI:Ghost Protocol in Rogue Nation. His role isn't huge and he doesn't get in the way but he's a decent addition to the cast. Simon Pegg is fantastic returning as Hunt's buddy and partner Benji. They don't overuse his comedy but he fits in so well which you don't expect. Ving Rhames who has at least cameo'd in every Mission Impossible returns in a bigger role. He doesn't exactly stand out in the cast but somehow has a presence you can't help but notice. Sean Harris is our villain this time around and he is decent. But unfortunately only decent. This is a series that has always had really great, bad-ass villains and Harris is good but not amazing. He pales in comparison to say Phillip Seymour Hoffman from MI:3 Still the film is more about the Rogue Nation as a whole so he still makes a solid big bad. Rebecca Ferguson is our Bond girl this time around...oops I mean Mission Impossible girl. Ferguson is good and actually proves herself to be a very good action heroine. This could actually put her in a starring position soon. Her and Cruise have good chemistry and they don't complicate it with romance. Alec Baldwin (who I initially thought would be annoying in the film) pulls off a pretty decent small role as CIA Director.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie is definitely a director that I have my eyes on. He has an old school action style that I absolutely love. He's been a great writer for years and often worked on Tom Cruise projects but in only two films he has really impressed me. The first one was Jack Reacher which I thought was amazing and I'm praying her returns to helm the sequel and now Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. He isn't afraid to tell a story with a lot of depth and expertly wraps intense action around that story. So many directors struggle with that in action films. How can you have breathless action and still tell a great story? Well here it is. Every Mission Impossible film comes up with a new ""insane"" stunt or scene and Rogue Nation is no different. This action series sets itself apart and Rogue Nation was fantastic. 9/10"

","Despite of all the movie franchises which went badly after several sequels, the Mission Impossible franchise still continues to surprise with another entertaining and impressive film. Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation has an interesting plot that keeps the audience in anticipation of what will happen. As most of spy movies there're some plot twists making it more exciting, because when you think you're getting what's going on, comes a scene which cause you think: Well, I didn't see that coming. Meanwhile, the action scenes are fantastic, they're breathtaking, this is largely due to the partnership between Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie, the director. They had already worked together on Jack Reacher, another film with incredible action scenes, and in M.I. their work is even better. The variety of locations of different countries used to film is noteworthy transmitting an idea that the movie doesn't focus in just one place but the plot develops in different areas, it's worldwide. In the technical point of view, the natural divergence gives a distinguished characteristic to each place, especially regarding the luminosity.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation has many good aspects, but it's Tom Cruise being Ethan Hunt who has made this franchise be successful as it is. In this film, he excelled once again in the action scenes because of the danger they were to be performed, but he did it anyway. Showing the level of commitment and courage he has. Each scene is more exciting than the previous one, especially one in which there is a cars and motorcycles's chasing which is simply breathtaking. Ethan Hunt's Crew, William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), is other great component. Their synergy is enjoyable showing the bondage which was created along the films, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are the most responsible for the comical relief and they successfully amuse the audience with their lines."

","I was blown away when I see Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. Although he's 53, he seems like in the early forties. He once again proved that nothing is Impossible for him. He's still as incredible as always. He's a great actor, a legend and and still gives his best as he normally do.<br/><br/>The villain, played by Sean Harris is freaking awesome. He gives chills to those who watch it. Even a slight movement of him will make you in the edge of your seats.<br/><br/>The action is incredible as always. Tom Cruise did this all by himself. That fact makes me don't believe and dizzy since, how could anyone can hang outside a plane, 5000 feet in the air, risking his life for this movie. But after I saw it now I realized that, as Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) said: Hunt (Cruise) is the living form of destiny. (sorry for the non-accurate line, I quite forgot, hehehe).<br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson is a blast. She was unpredictable, fast and incredible as a woman. Jeremy Renner is as good as always. And Simon Pegg is a good joke maker who lighten the movie a bit. The film is spectacular. There's a good action sequences, the great build up and plot twists. The unexpected great music from Joe Kramer. And Christopher McQuarrie's direction is a huge success.<br/><br/>Overall it was an amazing movie, with a lot of guns, fire, chase scenes, and so far the most incredible entry of the franchise since Ghost Protocol in 2011. If you hesitate to watch the movie. Whether because of McQuarrie's direction, bad advertisement and so on. Forget about it. You need to release all your worries and start watching it! It was an incredible movie and trust me, It's still Impossible as always. Overall score: 10/10"
"timcodex","10","2","6","11 August 2015"," MI5 brings in all the good from ghost protocol and more
","Mission impossible rogue nation is a great movie which combines all of the aspects of the previous mission impossible and adds a little more to allow the movie to overtake it's predecessor. <br/><br/>Rogue Nation replicates some of it's big successes from the previous title ""ghost protocol"". Through, for example, the subtle humor which is able to spark some laughter without drawing the audience away from the tension in the scene. The mind-blowing stunts which were carried out during the movie e.g climbing the Dubai tower and lastly the great editing which was done that was able to sustain story and character progression without making the action movie feel draggy and at the same time fulfilling everyone's cup with either action, comedy or fairly engaging dialogue. Rogue Nation does all of this and better.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation does not fail to entertain and can sustain the audience's attention throughout the whole 2 hour movie. It has a good placement of comedic moments, suspense and action to give the movie plenty of variation and so no part of the movie feels like it's been repeated. <br/><br/>Rogue Nation however fails to give the audience a believable relationship between Ethan Hunt and Ilsa as at sometimes the relationship feels forced and this has minor effects as it dislodges a connection with the audience. It makes a scene where it is hard for the audience to connect with and therefore ruins the immersion that the movie tries to achieve but is like I said, only a minor downside.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation also does not have a complex plot twist as is slightly hinted but the trailer but I feel that it does not need one to make the movie entertaining as it has made a perfect formula for making an entertaining movie. <br/><br/>In the end, Rogue Nation is a movie that is enjoyable and worth your time to be seen on the big screen."

","For a 5th movie in a series, I was surprised it was still entertaining to watch. I'm not going to lie, I have not kept up over the years or watched every single movie in this series.<br/><br/>I like the team and cast. I enjoyed the action and the humor. My only bone to pick is how many times the character Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) failed her mission but SOMEHOW the villain that was supposed to be Ethan's intellectual match, let her live. This dude is supposed to be the MOST intelligent, intimidating and scary villain. Sean Harris as Solomon Lane did just fine with the acting, it's just the plot let a pretty face fool him not once but 3 times! Then Faust attacked her fellow villain mates off their motor cycles, increasing their suspicion.<br/><br/>Spoiler* She came back with a highly important data disc that was wiped out and completely deleted. If this were ""real"" she would have been shot on the spot after failing 2 times previously. (1.Helping him escape in the beginning and 2. the opera show) <br/><br/>Lane kept saying she had so much potential as his motive for not shooting her and moving on but her ""potential"" doesn't make up for all her mistakes.<br/><br/>Also if Ethan (Tom Cruise) is supposed to be such a hot-shots spy, why did this chick have to rescue him like 3 times??? The water scene, he dodged getting hit the first time then got hit by the same machine part he previously dodged."

","Sunday, 2 August 2015: Yesterday, 1 August, I went to see the newest installment in the ""Mission Impossible"" movie franchise. I am a fan of the M.I movies as much as I a fan of the ""Fast & Furious"" movies. I have seen them all. However, I still like the M.I television series more even though the TV series did not have all the stunts that the movies have.<br/><br/>This movie and the last ""Fast & Furious"" movies have stunts that look good, but are to unreal to believe that it is possible to walk away without bleeding, broken bones or a scratches. For example, if someone is riding a motorcycle at a very high speed then comes to an abrupt halt to avoid killing a person and is thrown from the bike, gets up and walks away with not bruises, no blood nor broken bones is just Not believable.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is always good and so is Jeremy Renner. Rebecca Ferguson is good in her role, but I still wish that they would have brought back beautiful Biracial actress, Paula Patton and made her a permanent cast member the same as it was done Renner. Over all the movie is really good and I will probably see it again when it comes to the bargin discount theaters or on DVD.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg did Not add anything to ""M.I-Ghost Protocol"" and he does not add anything to this film. Simon is a waste of time in both films. Simon is good in comedies, but is miscast and not really needed in such action films like this one. He is like a 5th wheel on a 4 wheel car."

"alindsay-al","9","2","6","1 August 2015"," A fantastic film that keeps this franchise going strong
","After the great film that was mission impossible 3 and the fantastic film that ghost protocol was there was big pressure on the newest film rogue nation to deliver and boy did it possibly making this the most fun and best film in the franchise. This film sees Ethan hunt and his team on the hunt after an anti IMF called the syndicate while the CIA try to track them down. Now Tom cruise is a man who I have allot of respect for and he once again absolutely delivers in this film. Ethan hunt is a great character and you see him going slightly crazy in this film and it makes him an even more interesting character. And obviously for those that don't know he did all his own stunts in this film and he does a phenomenal job in all the action scenes and deserves credit for it. The rest of the cast also do a great job in this film, first of all there is Rebecca Ferguson who I think is a woman you will be seeing more of after this film. She was a multi layered character and had a really interesting dynamic to her and with the rest of the cast. She was also a great action star and only furiosa and black widow come close to her in 2015. Simon pegg is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood and this film truly shows this. He provides a comedic elect to the film without it going to far and is also a great dramatic actor and he is great as Benji in this film. Jeremy Renner and ving Rhames are back for this film and they are also both great in this film and really add a sense of teamwork but you also see that these people have there own philosophy and motivations. Also alec Baldwin and the villain were good in this film and added allot to this film. The story was okay, it starts off well enough and the team dynamic was really good in this film. The CIA part of the film was more interesting to me then the main plot involving the syndicate. I just wanted to know more about the syndicate and their motivations which would have allowed us to care more. Also I wasn't a huge fan of the ending of the film. The script was fantastic with allot of greatly well placed humour and the drama all really worked as well and really helped this film flow really well. The style is what we all came to see and I must say the action scenes in the film are utterly fantastic. The plane scene in the trailer is just one of the many phenomenal action scenes in this film that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. Also what I liked is that this film adds allot of tension and action and the combination was executed magnificently. Overall this is a fantastic movie that is really worth seeing in the cinema for the whole experience."
"peteygsounds","6","2","6","30 July 2015"," Very good with a few visual let downs.
","This was a great films and very fun to watch and experience. The story was a really great continuance to the flow of the other films and stayed true to all of the themes and traditions.<br/><br/>Musically, the scoring was on point, developing themes for characters and sub-plots that I didn't even know were there until the music hinted at them. Very cleverly done.<br/><br/>However, and I'm really sorry to kill the party a little, but I feel that the CG in this film was much too obvious and just too unnatural at points in this film and, for me, it killed the realism and took me out of my immersed state. This is something that had never been an issue for me in previous MI films, largely I feel because CGI wasn't used as much.<br/><br/>This is particularly true of the sequence where Ethan is submerged underwater, and also when the BMW is reversed through a gate, down some stairs and flips over numerous times. In the latter sequence it was as though the CG team just didn't have much of a grasp of physics, like if a car smashes through a gate at high speed, the velocity of the gates will either mean they are thrown off of their hinges or they will hit their walls and bounce back. What they absolutely will not do is open in a mechanical looking manner, hit their walls and then just stop dead with no rebound.<br/><br/>Yes I know this is a small thing but it is just a tiny example of a bigger problem in films that is, for me at least, making me less able to buy into films. My suspension of disbelief in films like this can only extend to the boundaries of physics.<br/><br/>However, with that rather large portion of complaint given, I'm not going to let that totally ruin an otherwise good film.<br/><br/>7/10."

","Tom Cruise is a perfectionist and we can see it here again! I admire his high level of professionalism and ethical conduct that make him one of the very best artists in the history of filmmaking. It is simply impossible not to praise the best and give this film the top grade. The same goes for the sixth episode: Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018). I will be more than happy to discover the seventh and eight episodes, still directed by Christopher McQuarrie and initially planned for 2021 and 2022, whenever it is really safe for the production to resume activities after the Great Lockdown.<br/><br/>9.8/10"
"Offworld_Colony","8","1","2","12 February 2020"," Rogue Nation is a memorable flick that, on release, offered a measured alternative to the bloat of Spectre.
","It's as funny as Ghost Protocol, but in a more appropriate and less goofy way, it's villain, a chilling Sean Harris is a quiet sadist, cut from the cloth of MI:3's Owen Davian but less crash and brutish and bourgeoisie.
Rogue Nation starts cool and with a cool twist, it's got a little of the original's European spy flavour, it's just a shame that it's very expositiony and the same plot retreads of both Skyfall and Spectre. And like Ghost Protocol doing a retro throwback to the Cold War, Rogue Nation is doing a kind of retro Bondian supervilain plot we've seen before, McQuarrie clearly doing his Bond in case he never got a chance to (although after Fallout they'd probably let him).
Renner is actually good proving he'd be a better dramatic actor if used that way more often, Simon Pegg's Benji is a delight, a fountain of optimism and good acting. And Ilsa Faust is good punch of life to the franchise. Even though she's the right balance of badass and chic, it's a shame Paula Patton had to leave the franchise, I felt like she had more to give in a very different way.
Rogue Nation is a well edited and pretty film; with a crisp, filmic courtroom warmth and feel to the photography. It's kind of interesting as this is the first in the series to start mythologising Ethan Hunt, his reputation and legacy preceding him, his bouncy potentially indestructible nature. Veering into superhero.
The action is unfortunately mostly a little muddy and lacklustre except for a couple fights and a decent chase. McQuarrie as the series' first writer/director has made careful but edgy flick that tonally course corrects a mixed bag franchise with the same quality as the greats even if it's not with as much of a punch as 3.
Impossible Mission: I mean the Water tank is an easy choice, a set piece relatively quiet and alone, stakes simple to realise, easy to shoot and visually interesting with the grounding tension of the heartbeat to it. Except really the most Mission Impossible sequence has to be the opera; Not explicitly planned but definitely well executed. Lots of moving parts all seem to work well, McQuarrie using the timing of the opera itself and telegraphing the plot visually. And with a great solution to the dilemma. It really is a triumph of editing, scoring and sound editing."

","The MIF team once again have to go rogue because the CIA threaten to shut them down. But it's down to Ethan Hunt and his team to bring down the shady terrorist organisation known as the Syndicate who have caused death and destruction in the past. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns for the 5th entry in the series along with actors Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner. Rebecca Ferguson makes her debut in the franchise and she has some great scenes from her well choreographed fight scenes to her mysterious demeanour. Jeremy Renner is underused here but he is nevertheless great in the film. Simon Pegg gets some good scenes, his story arc is one of best as he gets put in some sticky situations. He's been a true asset to the team in recent years and it shows a more dramatic side to him. Not to say he doesn't have some funny scenes because he does but they are more subtle and well suited to his character. Simon Pegg needs to be in more serious roles in the future because he's sort of type cast as a comedy actor. Sean Harris is the cold hearted villain pulling the strings. He doesn't get much screen time however he's the best villain since Phillip Seymour Hoffman.<br/><br/>Directed by Christopher McQuarrie who does an impressive job taking the franchise to more serious levels. It's a film adults will enjoy more so than the kids. It's more darker than the previous film, a lot smarter with no annoying comedic characters, has a lot less CGI and just feels like a genuine Mission Impossible film. The franchise has been going for 20 years and they have somehow managed to make each film progressively better. It's on the same level as the underrated Mission Impossible III which was a very grounded film with realistic characters and great acting but at the same time keeps the elements what made the 1996 original so great. <br/><br/>Much like the very first film it's focused on a compelling story and has some gripping scenes. The only problem is it runs at a slow pace sometimes because the plot isn't always engaging. Even though there are plenty of action scenes to feast on they are very minimal. It's biggest action scene is used in the opening where Tom Cruise clings onto a plane taking off (which of course he actually performed this stunt himself). The cinematography is a bit dark but there are so many memorable shots.<br/><br/>There are a lot of dramatic scenes throughout from an opera assassination attempt to an underwater vault heist. It has an exciting chase sequence throughout the streets of Morocco but it does a fine job mixing the action, drama and suspense which is a refreshing approach to the genre. Nowadays film studios take the easy way out with their action/comedy plots which lack drama. 
With Rogue Nation it's very clear that they put the plot before the action. It's intriguing and full of interesting unpredictable characters. The ending is so well done, it's clever with a lot of surprises and doesn't just throw in the standard action packed ending we usually see in these films."
"seashell36","5","1","2","1 August 2018"," Not as good as MI Ghost Protocol

"Jim-Eadon","5","1","2","28 July 2018"," Midly entertaining but also irritating.
","The best thing about the movie were the European locations. The movie is almost non-stop action and yet there was very little suspense. No doubt the direction was poor, but also the characters are invulnerable, there is never any doubt they will prevail.
Pegg was the comic relief but he always seems a bit forced to me. Like the bloke who played the Hobbit.
I never could buy the scientologist weirdo Cruise as an action guy, he's a pint pot mid-life crisis pretty boy. I was wondering how much this movie would be improved without him, he just seems to be on an ego trip.
Then there is the typical hollywood mythological woman who can kill assassins at will just by wrapping her legs around their necks. Yeah right. You might knock a gun out their hands, but they will have another gun, and you would be dead. And even if a knife fight - no chance.
Plus the plot holes and discontinuities are everywhere. The plans these guys have rely on million-to-one coincidences to work! The things these guys do really are impossible.
And of course, you're dealing with a world where there is zero security, the heroes can access and wonder around anywhere with impunity.
All this means that you're just watching set-pieces that you've seen before, only done better.
I was not expecting better, I just watch daft movies from time to time to see what modern block-buster making looks like.
And the fake positive reviews on this site - oh my!"
"cliftonofun","6","1","2","27 December 2017"," Laughable and unapologetic
","Was this film laughable? Oh, yes. But while every recent comic book and spy movie desperately wants to be dark/serious (Hi, DC comics!) or meta (Hello, Deadpool!), the MI movies are a rare franchise: they are unapologetic. They are silly and ridiculous and excessive. No apologies. While Bond gets gritty, MI gets - well - fun. And suddenly we all remember that predictably comic thrill rides are worth the price of admission. Eventually, the Tom Cruise run will become the Jeremy Renner run. But the franchise will live. It just needs to remember that masks and twists are not a bad formula."

","I'm not usually the type that gets all too excited about action/adventure romp, but for the past, oh, 20 years of my life I've always been excited for the next James Bond movie to come out. My one indulgence in the genre. In recent years, however, that franchise has gone a bit stale, allowing the Mission Impossible franchise, including this ""Rogue Nation"" installment, to take the crown of best action movie.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Rogue Nation"" sees the IMF being shut down by the CIA Director (Alec Baldwin) right as they are on the verge of taking down the shadowy Syndicate, a network of crime baddies run by the mysterious Lane (Sean Harris). Now more off the books than ever before, the IMF team of Hunt (Tom Cruise), Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Luther (Ving Rhames) must track down Lane before they are out of time and resources. Lending a helping hand (or is it?) is British double-agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who seems to be playing all sides at once.<br/><br/>Obviously, any ""Mission Impossible"" movie (especially those still under the helm of JJ Abrams' Bad Robot productions) is going to be judged on how riveting and pulse-pounding the action scenes are. ""Rogue Nation"" doesn't fail in that category one bit! From the opening scene of the film, which sees Tom Cruise perform one of the craziest stunts I've ever seen in a movie, the action scenes will blow you to the back of your chair. They are slick, have a great backing soundtrack, but also don't go on forever and ever. It never feels like the film is just a few extended action scenes cobbled together. Each action montage has a purpose.<br/><br/>Along those lines, ""Rogue Nation"" manages to good from ""okay action romp"" to ""really entertaining flick"" due to the fact that it's able to weave an actual story into the proceedings. Not only that, but it's a story that will legitimately have you intrigued and guessing as to how everything will turn out. This is where the franchise really separates itself from the recent Bond efforts. Those films haven't had a great story since ""Casino Royale"", and before that it was ""Goldeneye"". That's two in about 20 years. Every since Bad Robot took the helm of the MI series, the three films have gotten progressively better.<br/><br/>One final quick note about the MI/Bond comparison: These movies are far better at using female protagonists as well. Whereas the concept of ""Bond Girls"" is now at odds with the culture at large (unlike the franchise's heyday in the 60s and 70s), the MI films are able to utilize a sexy female lead who, at the same time, isn't just eye candy waiting to be bedded by the hero.<br/><br/>So, despite the fact that Bond movies might still have more name recognition and gravitas behind them, the MI flicks have slowly crept up and taken their place as kind of the action/adventure romp. ""Rogue Nation"" is slick, smart, funny, a spectacle to watch, and even has a story that will keep you engaged. Hey, isn't that what the Bond franchise used to be able to do?"

","'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is the 5th installment of the spy/thriller franchise. The tone is set a bit darker than the previous as I.M.F agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes in search of the shadowy 'Syndicate' terrorist organization while his own agency is on the brink of dissolving.<br/><br/>1. Although this sequel doesn't deliver on the spectacle of the previous film, it still succeeds on so many levels. Most of the main cast returns with the exception of newcomers Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. Tom Cruise is still the show-stopper as Ethan Hunt while we follow him throughout the film in his search for the 'Syndicate'. Once again, Cruise performs most of his own stunts which are spectacular in the final film. The underwater and motorcycle chase sequences stand out the most and truly are exciting when you see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>2. British actor Sean Harris plays the antagonist this time around, who's supposed to be the complete opposite of Ethan Hunt. Although he's not a memorable character to say the least, Harris still has more screen- time for development than the villain of the last film. Simon Pegg (Benji) has a much bigger part than he has in the franchise so far, and it's safe to say that it wouldn't be the same without him. Of course, the locations play a big part in this franchise as well as they travel to Austria, Morocco and London, with the latter being the main setting.<br/><br/>3. The action will always be over the top, but it comes with the title. If one can give the 'Fast & Furious' films a pass, then this will entertain you to no end, cause the action (no matter how impossible it seems) is still thrilling and plausible operating in it's own realm. This is still Cruise's movie to carry, and he does it well while proving that neither age, appearance nor Scientology is gonna keep him down.<br/><br/>'Rogue Nation' is a summer blockbuster - plain and simple.

Unlike the other action films, this one really pulled off stunts that are life-threatening and it paid off. The organization that are targeting the IMF and plotting to dissolve it are really intelligent with their masterminds and etc. I don't have much to say about this film since there's nothing for me to say but it's the one film of the summer that you might want to see, if you're interested in action and drama.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible 5, the film that provides action but not an improvement."

"Screen_Blitz","8","1","2","16 December 2015"," Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is a blast!
","Director Christopher McQuarrie continues with the critically acclaimed spy action franchise with Tom Cruise reprises his role as the IMF agent Ethan Hunt, with bigger action, higher stakes, and more fun. With the new director taking the chair every entry, this film series has allowed viewers to experience a new direction in each outing and a constant change of style, for better or worse; but never without the sheer charisma of Tom Cruise in the lead role. In this fifth installment set after the events of 'Ghost Protocol' when the IMF is shut down by the Senate committee by the request of CIA agent Hunley (played by Alec Baldwin) for the collateral damage resulted from their previous missions, while battling William Brandt (played by Jeremy Renner) in court over the unwanted decision. With the only help of agent Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) and a mysterious femme fatale Ilsa Faust (played by Rebecca Ferguson) who appears to be hiding a dark secret, Hunt must go rouge on a globe-trotting adventure to track down Soloman Lane (played by Sean Harris), the leader of a deadly criminal organization known as the 'Syndicate' responsible for an alarming epidemic of terrorist attacks all across the globe.<br/><br/>Similarly to the previous films in the franchise, this film prizes audiences with spectacular action sequences, and eye-popping stunts performed by Tom Cruise himself who much like Jackie Chan, seems to smell fear when it comes to engaging in death-defying stunts. In the previous movie 'Ghost Protocol', Cruise shocked audiences everywhere as they watched him performone of the most jaw-dropping stunts which involved him climbing 2000 ft high on the side of the Burj Khalifa -- the world's tallest building In this movie, Cruise continues his dare-devil persona by takes things up a notch. This all begins in the opening scene when Cruise performs a wild stunt where he is suspended a few thousand feet above the ground while hanging on the side of the airplane with no support but a harness to hold him, and the background shown in the shot ascending from the ground uses no CGI. With the exception of a few securing straps, what viewer's eyes are capturing in this moment is what is really happening, and shows how Tom Cruise is capable of doing his own stunts no matter how increasingly dangerous it can get. Shockingly enough, the opening scene however, is not even the most fascinating moment to come around. Following this sequence comes a smart and engaging plot of Cruise's character Ethan Hunt on a globe-trotting mission to pursue a James Bond-like villain, and the plot unfolds in a pulse-pounding two-hour stretch brimming with dazzling action sequences done with nifty camera work by Robert Elswit, including a reckless, death-defying car chase, and hype-kinetic motorcycle chase to fuel the excitement of film goers.<br/><br/>What is a Mission Impossible flick without a gripping story? Christopher McQuarrie arousing screenplay comes in. The plot kicks off in an shocking sequence featuring the kidnapping of our lead character Ethan Hunt, and the introduction of the villain played by Sean Harris who's performance fits well with the charismatic antagonist. From there on, the plot moves at a generally solid pace with suspense and twists lurking around nearly every corner, and a fistful of energy on lock. Along the way, the film introduces some hot new characters, one of which is Ilsa Faust who is played by Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson, who makes a stylish portrayal as a fascinating, but highly questionable character who may or may not the good girl Ethan Hunt is hoping to join forces with. Then there is Simon Pegg reprising his role as Benjy in this third film of the franchise. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames also reprise their roles as William Brandt and Luther Stickell, though are given rather limited to do other than to serve as key figures in the film's minor subplots. Lastly, there is Tom Cruise who returns as Ethan Hunt, and is more likable and ravaging with energy than ever. The actor remains well-suited as the action star he's been for almost the past two decades. Though he's understandably not everyone's cup of tea, his endurance in his roles as Ethan Hunt over the years are certainly admirable.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a decent continuation to the franchise, and a pleasing treat for action fans everywhere. Tom Cruise is amazing, the action is top-notch, and the plot works well. This movie is simply a blast."

If it's doable, the blood pumping's finessed. As for the impossibility, improbability or outright likelihood of a rogue mission's success... Christopher McQuarrie went tongue in cheek with this one.

"KineticSeoul","8","1","2","31 July 2015"," The 5th installment that is worth the full price
","Although it's the fifth installment, it was freaking awesome. Only few franchises can keep installment fresh and entertaining. And this one does the job well. Tom Cruise constantly proves that he is one of the talented actors in this business who put all he got into his roles. The plot and action is combined very well in this. Not as much as ""Ghost Protocol"", but it's still well blended. All the characters were integrated in a way where they all have a time to shine without them just being there for the sake of being there. The new female lead was fantastic in this, she brought about that almost perfect combination of feminine, sexy and badassery. When it comes to the direction of the plot, it's actually quite innovative, I can even say clever. Even the villain stands out in this. The villain is masterful, tactful and resourceful. He is probably the most matched villain against Ethan Hunt so far. Although the villain in Mission Impossible 3, was more detestable and downright sadistic. Thanks to Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting. But the actor playing the villain did a fine job brining out this emotionless and meticulous mastermind behind the operation. It does have very few moments where it seemed to drag a bit, but the blend of cleverness and humor, makes it okay. Plus most of the parts are pivotal to the story as a whole in this. Even the chase scene is topnotch and it's very exciting and exhilarating to sit through. Overall this is a movie that mixes the espionage and action. Overall this is a spectacular 5th installment in a great franchise that shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

Now I must point out the fact that the Stars listed for this movie are a bit off as if it weren't for Rebecca Ferguson, Jeremy Renner,Simon Pegg, and Sean Harris; this film would be as bad as the others.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible films have sort of continued to go down hill, I mean they were down hill long before resurrecting them with Tom Cruise; but come on, Tom Cruise isn't the top gun anymore. The top billing cast in this Mission Impossible were Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Jeremy Renner, and Sean Harris; without these guys the film wouldve flopped.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation has an actual story-line more than the others, the script was so much more together than rushed to give Mr Cruise all the lines, and the action is nonstop.

","Mission: Impossible is one of the few franchises where it doesn't get worse every movie. It either stays about the same or gets better, depending on the movie. That being said, this is easily one of the best in the series. Knowing that Tom Cruise does his own stunts makes this movie so much cooler. There's scenes in here that are quite impressive. I won't say what they are though, because, spoilers. This reminded me of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The entire movie kept me engaged. There were hardly any boring scenes. It's exciting, and had done great twists. My only complaint is I found one scene quite predictable.

In this installment the entire world is after Ethan as he tries to save it.<br/><br/>While I rated this film 5 stars, on the Mission Impossible franchise scale, I consider this to be the least entertaining of the series, like Hobbit as compared to Lord of the Rings. It is more entertaining than what is out there, but not as entertaining as when compared to itself. The action wasn't as adrenaline filled as previous films. Ethan escapes mundane death maybe seven-eight times in this film and on a paltry three continents. While I love Ving Rhames in ""B"" films one has to ask where was Morgan Freeman?<br/><br/>Another criticism I have, as previous films, was the limited use of the adrenaline pumping Mission Impossible theme song. Instead they would take a rift and incorporate into some sort of spy/Bond music. It was as if they were letting me taste it, and then they rip it out of my mouth.<br/><br/>Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Rebecca Ferguson naked back. Killings and explosions, nothing graphic.

"TheLittleSongbird","9","1","3","22 June 2017"," One must see mission
","Found the first three films ones that had a lot to like (namely the action, the visuals, good casting on the whole and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's superb villain in the third) but also their faults (plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third).<br/><br/>'Ghost Protocool' to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original, and actually better than it, mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted. The latest instalment 'Rogue Nation' is on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there is a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure is somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' has enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Rogue Nation' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool', perhaps the most audacious of all five films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound.<br/><br/>With the exception of a few choppy combat scenes, big emphasis on the few, the action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling.<br/><br/>'Rogue Nation's' script is sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go. There is an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go) worthy of Alfred Hitchcock, a big claim and to some hyperbolic but it felt that way to me and it is grand praise indeed.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows a knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris is an intimidatingly menacing villain, one of the best written villains of the series, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames, though charismatic, is underused.<br/><br/>Overall, a sheer delight and one mission that is a must see. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"bobbysing","6","1","3","2 August 2016"," Not an epic, but does deliver the expected excellence from the fifth presentation of the series in parts.
","On a Friday with more than 3 new releases, I luckily watched the film in its dubbed Hindi version and was surprised to see the theater occupancy more than 3 times from that of the new Hindi film released on the same day. But what gave me a much bigger (pleasant) shock was the fact that it was a single screen theater DELITE, situated close to Darya Ganj area of Delhi far away from the multiplex culture. And still there were whistles, shouts and claps as soon as Tom Cruise came on screen with an electrifying action sequence in the first 5 minutes of the film only fulfilling the huge expectations. No doubt, a clear indication of the general public becoming much more aware and interested in watching quality cinema instead of any usual stuff offered by the Hindi films.<br/><br/>As a fifth presentation in the series with no linkages as such with the previous parts, MI5-ROUGE NATION makes a brilliant start and then follows an uneven pace before the forced intermission (as per Indian norms) with only a few exciting (but not mind-blowing) sequences coming at gaps. However the film delivers some worth experiencing action and chase sequences in its second half, especially the bike chase bringing you on to the edge of your seats through an excellent execution. No doubt director Christopher McQuarrie successfully maintains the basic essence of the 'brand name' throughout its two hours of duration. Yet the film doesn't give you any of those nail-biting moments where you don't really know what is going to happen next in terms of any suspense or mystery involved. In short, it's the fast paced script- developments in the second hour that largely save the film making a decent impression despite being too convenient and not so innovative in the heist sequences.<br/><br/>As the lead, Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, the IMG (Impossible Missions Force) agent superbly deserving applause and it's his film all the way right from the first scene to the last. Sean Harris makes an impact with a flat face head of 'The Syndicate' and so does Rebecca Ferguson who simply looks great in her fiery sequences. Simon Pegg keeps providing the lighter moments that work and Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renner, Alec Baldwin are just fine in their valuable supporting acts. The background score and cinematography certainly contributes a lot in its key sequences. Plus the witty one-liners and characterization has been worked upon well too.<br/><br/>In all, MI5 - Rogue Nation is not an epic but still manages to provide that expected thrilling experience in parts. So you can surely watch it once as one of the better sequels of the series, especially for the motorbike chase, Rebecca and Tom Cruise in particular."
"brando647","8","1","3","23 July 2016"," MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE Series Refuses to Lose Momentum with ROGUE NATION
","I am truly impressed that we're now five movies deep into the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE franchise and it's still going strong. It's even more impressive that, with the exception of the shallow MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II, this series has never disappointed me. The only other franchise that comes to mind that managed this sort of sustained quality after five films would be the 007 series. As much as I love James Bond, I've got to admit that Tom Cruise and his Impossible Mission Force are giving them a run for their money. Despite being the fifth movie of the series, ROGUE NATION demonstrates that they've got no intention of slowing down with the introduction of a new, far-reaching enemy that will no doubt give strife to the organization for years to come. Since the events of GHOST PROTOCOL, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has been hunting for evidence of the existence of a shadow organization known as the Syndicate. Right as he receives confirmation of its existence, he receives word that the CIA has grown tired of IMF's antics and the global destruction it leaves in its wake and they've officially shut it down. Unwilling to abandon his pursuit of the Syndicate, Hunt goes rogue and recruits help from his few remaining IMF friends who've been absorbed into the CIA: Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames), and Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Closing in on the head of the Syndicate, Hunt must team with a dangerous double agent (Rebecca Ferguson) he's not sure can be trusted.<br/><br/>One of the coolest elements of this M:I films is how each movie so far has had a different director at the helm, bringing their individual styles to the series while remaining true to what audiences love (gadgets, insane stunts, the perfect blend of action and comic relief, etc.). After Brad Bird's GHOST PROTOCOL (still my favorite of the franchise), Cruise brought in writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, whom he'd recently teamed with on the equally awesome EDGE OF TOMORROW. Bird and McQuarrie seem to have similar styles, so GHOST PROTOCOL and ROGUE NATION are closest stylistically in the series and I'm not complaining. The movie also continues with a recurring theme in modern espionage movies where government oversight and accountability have made classic spy work obsolete so the hero has to go off on his own. It shares this in common with the Daniel Craig era 007 films. Admittedly, I'm getting a little tired of the trope (at least KINGSMEN avoided it) but the movies are fun enough that I'm still forgiving of it. It would be nice, though, if the next M:I film would function as a straight up IMF mission sanctioned and supported by the organization where Hunt can have access to all of its resources. It would be the perfect time since the movie (sharing some more in common with 007, specifically SPECTRE) introduces an arch-nemesis for the IMF in the form of the Syndicate, or the ""anti-IMF"" as Benji calls it. It opens a lot of possibilities.<br/><br/>ROGUE NATION successfully delivers on everything you could possibly want from an M:I movie. The action is, as usual, turned up to 11. That famous stunt of Tom Cruise hanging from the side of a cargo jet that was all over the promotional materials happens in the film's cold open, leaving you to wonder how they could possibly top that in the remaining two hours. Tom Cruise is just as crazy as ever, performing his own stunts and absolutely owning the character. Cruise has had a prolific career at this point but I really feel Ethan Hunt is his defining character. He loves these movies and it comes through in the final product. The consistently funny Simon Pegg has a larger role than in any of the previous M:I adventures with Benji finally getting some real time in the field as Hunt's partner in crime and the film's comedic relief. Luther and Brandt are relegated to comparatively minor roles for the first half of the film this time, and the team is instead filled out with Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust. Faust is disarmingly beautiful and every bit as lethal as Hunt; the question is where her loyalties lie. She saves Hunt's skin a few times but she's also in deep with the Syndicate and its leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Lane has a lot in common with Philip Seymour Hoffman's villain from MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III; they're both soft- spoken sociopaths (Lane never speaks above as raspy whisper) with an army of assassins at their disposal. Lane is a criminal mastermind and Harris plays him as unnervingly creepy and always a moment away from eliminating anyone he deems expendable.<br/><br/>Fans of the M:I series are in for a treat. ROGUE NATION continues the high level of blockbuster excitement we've come to expect from Cruise and his team. While it wasn't as consistently engaging as the superior GHOST PROTOCOL, it's right up there with the original film in terms of entertainment. I wouldn't mind returning to some of the more subtle espionage of that first film, I'm not going to complain as long as the M:I series keeps kicking all manner of butt."
"dfa120374","7","1","3","17 July 2016"," Not The Best In The Series But A Very Good Addition
","Rogue Nation is the latest enjoyable addition to the M:I series although for me this one didn't really thrill me as much as the 3rd or 4th films. Don't get me wrong - this film is big on action, has plenty of excitement, and has amazing visuals, but there was just something lacking here that the other films (apart from M:I-2) had. Whether it's because originality is starting to lack, that a lot of the action is starting to get a bit repetitive, or that it's starting to become a bit predictable, or maybe a mix of all three, I don't know, but I DO know that parts of this M:I film fell a bit flat at times.<br/><br/>With all that being said, however, Rogue Nation is still worth viewing and there's more than enough throughout the film to keep you watching, whether it's the usual comedy relief that comes from Benji or the high-risk situations Hunt always gets himself into. I may have found it starting to get repetitive as I said earlier, but it is still enjoyable.<br/><br/>One other thing I noticed with this film (and the M:I films in general) is that the plot's are becoming more complex as the series goes on. This isn't a Fast & Furious kind of film where you can switch it on about half way through and pick up instantly what's happening. This is a film where you definitely have to pay attention to what's going on because it's pretty easy to get lost if you don't. Maybe that's why some people are saying that sections of the film ""didn't make sense"". I've also seen some say that nothing about the film was over-the-top. I have to disagree because from the first film to this latest one, there are plenty of moments which are over-the-top (the motorcycle stunts in M:I-2, Cruise clinging to the outside of an Airbus in Rogue Nation just to name two), but this IS Mission: Impossible after all. The whole series is based on making the impossible possible.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation isn't the best in the series but it's a very decent addition. It will be interesting to see what M:I-6 brings us."

The whole film is a total roller-coaster ride from start to finish with no real slumps and all I kept thinking was: why isn't Bond this good? The action jumps from one great location to another and each one is used to good effect and I never felt that they traveled to a locale for improbable reasons. There is a definite lack of tech in this movie and I felt that was for the good. Tom Cruise is back to form and if he - as per usual - doing a lot of his own stunts then I hope his insurance company wasn't watching.There are quite a few stand out scenes from the movie but for me the car chase in the middle is one of the best shot chase scenes in ages with only minimal CGI. <br/><br/>There are few gripes with the film - the cast is good and it was good to see Simon Pegg shedding his comic sidekick role and becoming more an integral part of the team. <br/><br/>Overall: a huge amount of fun and a proper action film like we haven't had in a while."

","I'm not a big fan of Mission Impossible or Bond franchise, but a lot of positive reviews calling it the best entry in the series drew my attention. So the other night I've decided to give it a try, by coincidence right after watching another spy blockbuster of this year, Spy. And have to say I don't see the difference between the two: the script, the humor, mindless dialogs, big-budget action scenes, constant running and overall intellectual level. Except that Spy is a parody. Now really, how did they manage to act *in this* with serious faces?<br/><br/>I know it's too much to ask for believable fighting scenes, or authentic emotions, or at least a bit of irony. I'm simply asking for a little respect to the audience. Sadly the industry follows the other path, the path of Transformers, Fast and Furious, Twilight and 50 Shades of Gray. Way to go."
"Tehmeh","8","1","3","6 December 2015"," McQuarrie and Cruise are a great pair.
","If I got it right, this was the fourth time when writer/director McQuarrie and Tom Cruise worked together on a film. While not all of them are great, none of them has been a disappointment. This one doesn't disappoint either.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie is probably my favorite Hollywood-type screenwriter. He's got a knack for telling a story very efficiently and surprising the audience without getting pretentious or using forced unnatural twists. To put it simply: he can convey a ton of information and forward several plotpoints in one minute without exhausting the viewer, while making all of it genuinely interesting and adding just enough unexpected humor. I was worried about McQuarrie's capabilities as a director though, as well as the fact that this series has seen too many sequels already. Those worries were put to rest. I still think McQuarrie is more of a writer, but it's certain he can handle directing as well. He knows the beats, has plenty of experience and for him the story comes first.<br/><br/>While this series has seen so many twists, ""Rogue Nation"" somehow manages to stay fresh. Cruise and McQuarrie are always reliable, but it certainly helps if they're not alone. Turns out that they aren't. I didn't like Simon Pegg that much in the previous movie, but I guess he grew on me, since he felt pretty natural this time. Jeremy Renner is always a very likable presence, and even Alec Baldwin managed to entertain me in a role I've seen him play so many times before. That said, Rebecca Ferguson is very entertaining as the female spy counterpart for Cruise and certainly stands out. She's not just a pretty doll for us to look at - even though she is pretty - but she fits the movie like a glove. Special mentions to Sean Harris and Simon McBurney, both were excellent casting decisions.<br/><br/>So the cast works, as well as the script and directing. How about everything else? The movie is shot well. Many locations and sets (not only the grand ones) are interesting, well framed and lit. Cameras are used in an interesting manner, and the color choices were mostly pleasing to my eye. As far as the action goes, there are plenty of jump cuts as well as some hand-held cameras, but they knew what they were doing. All of it complements the movie instead of being a bunch of forced stylistic choices. This movie wasn't an assault on my senses (like the Bourne sequels were), and I could follow the action quite well. The action scenes are well designed and often wonderfully layered. <br/><br/>I didn't love the music though. I know there isn't much room to differentiate from the classic score, so it did the only thing what it could do for me - not make me bored or annoyed. There was some use of opera I liked, and the pacing/editing of music was handled carefully.<br/><br/>This isn't a perfect movie in every other way either. To keep up with the pace, many of deeper breathing moments for the audience and certain story clarifications are sacrificed. Not that I need to lose myself emotionally in a movie like this, nor do I need to have an explanation for every gadget or transition I see, but these things are sacrificed nonetheless. We don't get a thrilling masterpiece, we get an entertaining ride instead. It's a compromise I can live with, and most likely the only way these movies can work right now.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is a pro. It's hard to think of something to say that hasn't been said a thousand times already. He's committed, he's entertaining and he makes any movie better for being in it. Such is the case with ""Rogue Nation"" as well. I just hope he remembers that he doesn't have to out-do himself with every movie on the stunt department, because he also has the ability to make the more quiet scenes work. Oh, and the blu-ray version has a good Cruise/McQuarrie commentary track. I always love it when the star and the director talk about their movie together with such enthusiasm.<br/><br/>To summarize: ""Rogue Nation"" is not a classic, but it is a fun, smart ride where everyone involved seems to give their very best. It's fast-paced, well-acted, well-written, well-shot and does what many summer action movies can't; it manages to be interesting even when people aren't running, punching and exploding - which in turn makes running, punching and exploding that much more fun."
"Halloween4","7","1","3","13 November 2015"," No Better, No Worse.
","To be honest I think that the M.I series of movies has been quite an interesting phenomenon when you look at movies and their sequels, as it is nearly always the rule of thumb that movie sequels start to get worse as they progress, or at least start to get worse at some point along the line.<br/><br/>However, in the case of the M.I series of movies (and i'm only speaking in my opinion), I have found this to be quite the opposite, as I myself didn't really enjoy the first movie in the series as I found it all a bit to slow and talky, and I found the second movie in the series to be only slightly better on the action front having been directed by Jon woo.<br/><br/>However, as the M.I series of movies progressed they got stronger & stronger until I became a big fan, so with this latest instalment, I had high hopes of it being even better then the last, as i'd now become to expect, but alas this wasn't to be. I'm not saying that the movie is any worse then the last, but it wasn't any better either.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong the action & amazing stunts that we have become to expect were all there, but with each movie I think that the audience has become to expect them to be even better and bigger, but this movie just didn't give us this as the stunts were just on a par with the last movie (in my opinion), and it didn't help this movie that the biggest stunt in the movie was (this time), before the opening credits, so there were no bigger stunts to look forward to .<br/><br/>So to sum it up, if your a fan-boy (or girl), of the M.I series of movies, then I can highly recommend this movie. However, if your looking for a bigger and better action scenes and stunts then the last movie sequel, then you might be highly disappointed."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","4 November 2015"," Another Strong Entry In The Mission: Impossible Series!
","Out of all the franchises that are circulating in Hollywood at present, Mission: Impossible series is possibly the only one that refuses to conform to the norm and continues to defy the weariness that sets in once a few sequels of any franchise are out in the market. While the first two chapters were inherently weak, the third instalment provided the necessary boost to this series and that momentum carried on to the fourth one, which in my opinion is the most balanced entry in this saga, thus far.<br/><br/>And now, we have a new one. Using the rogue agent formula of Mission: Impossible as the basis of its plot, lifting a key action segment from Mission: Impossible II & enhancing it to deliver a smashing sequence, incorporating the relentless energy of Mission: Impossible III, and aiming for the near-perfect balance of Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation is a tour-de-force of blockbuster filmmaking that's refreshing, riveting & entertaining from start to finish and is impressive enough to rank amongst the finest films of the year, so far.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation finds IMF agent Ethan Hunt looking for intel to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a counter organisation to the IMF that has managed to stay invisible while carrying out its sinister duties. But when the CIA chief convinces the Senate to disband IMF & declares Hunt a fugitive who's to be apprehended on sight, Hunt decides to continue with his current investigation and secretly enlists the help of his former team & comes across a mysterious woman, who happens to have an agenda of her own.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the movie opens with an instantly captivating sequence, following which the main plot is set up relatively quick & the relevant characters are smartly introduced. McQuarrie expertly paces the whole narrative from the start and his screenplay is brilliantly penned down too for the story presents a tightly packed structure & nicely blends a sufficient dose of well-timed humour into its action-adventure premise. The kinetic direction & focused script does help but what improves its look n feel is its superbly executed technical aspects.<br/><br/>Production design team does a stellar job in putting up the rich, refined set pieces that add a sumptuous feel to its peripheral surroundings & exotic locations. The fluid movements & clever placements of its camera, in addition to its radiant colour palette & effectual lighting, give its images a vibrant look that makes it come alive in splendid detail. Editing is tight & rarely allows the film to switch to a lower gear during its 131 minutes runtime. Furthermore, the entire experience is elevated by Joe Kraemer's explosive soundtrack which maintains a close proximity with the franchise's main theme at all times.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Tom Cruise leads from the front in another turn as the famous IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and even though his performance is just as nuanced as before, his devotion to his most popular role is absolute. Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renner & Simon Pegg return in their respective roles of Luther, Brandt & Benji and it's good to see that Pegg isn't in it just for the sake of providing the comic relief. The new additions include Sean Harris, Alec Baldwin & Rebecca Ferguson, amongst which Ferguson completely steals the show, delivers the strongest performance of the ensemble & her chemistry with Cruise just clicks.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, building on the strength of its predecessors while also keeping a close eye on their shortcomings, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation packs in enough surprise, thrills & breakneck action to satisfy its audience, features some outstanding stunt work that makes its action all the more memorable, and emanates ample freshness throughout its runtime to succeed as a quality action extravaganza that's thoroughly satisfying. Definitely a worthy addition to the Mission: Impossible series, a fascinating example of blockbuster filmmaking, and a downright magnificent cinematic ride that's worth your time & money, Rogue Nation comes highly recommended."

","Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation - High On Content But Low On Adrenaline. Film Review By Kalmanac What happens when Frankenstein creates his monster and monster turns against him! This is the bottom line of newly released sequel of highly popular espionage thriller ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"". William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) in-charge of Impossible Mission Force (IMF), a fictional wing of United States' intelligence community, faces wrath of congressional committee on accusations laid by CIA head Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), when he describes repercussions of IMF's belligerent actions committed by IMF's wild horse Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). While agent Hunt is trying to expose ""Syndicate"" about which even CIA has no knowledge, Committee disbands IMF and orders transfer of IMF team to CIA under Alan Hunley. With no IMF's command and control on his back, Ethan Hunt ventures into a self assigned mission along with his witty tech- expert aide Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to prove the existence of the ""Syndicate"" which as per agent Hunt behind every major bad incident in the world. Expected storyline of Mission Impossible franchise always makes director's job as convenient as possible. With no eccentric derailing from expectations, Christopher McQuarrie directs latest installment of Mission Impossible. This is McQuarrie's second outing with Tom Cruise after ""Jack Reacher"". He slightly falters when he tries to invoke Brian De Palma-feeling with ""Rogue Nation"" but Simon Pegg's humor and few slick sequences save the day for this franchise. As a director he does ""OK"" job but he does not offer Never-Tasted-Before-Ingredient with ""Rogue Nation"". When you have been acclaimed critically and same time carrying a slogan of international superstar, maintaining consistency and grip on your fans' consciousness for longer period of time become an impossible mission itself. Tom Cruise has been confronting same dilemma lately. Though ""MI: Rogue Nation"" enjoys top position on US Box office at the moment but his firm commitment to new religion of ""Scientology"" and list of average films with meager box office results have made Cruise's persona pretty ignorable. In a time where Hollywood blockbusters are making billions of dollars around the world, no one is missing Tom Cruise except his die-hard fans. Due to his ever- readiness to perform his own stunts wins audience applaud but overall ""Rogue Nation"" could not able to generate frenzy desired by an average fan this franchise. ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" is a film which has been positioned in the market to put brand of Tom Cruise on billboards again and seems successful in achieving its target conveniently. On the whole, latest sequel of Mission Impossible series is bearable action flick of the summer which is high on content but low on adrenaline."
"ferguson-6","8","1","3","16 August 2015"," Ilsa in Casablanca II
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's been almost 20 years since the beginning of the MI movie franchise, and in that time, Tom Cruise has aged at least 3 months. Perhaps the prank is on us and Mr Cruise actually filmed his scenes for all 5 Mission: Impossible movies in 1995. Of course that didn't happen, yet somehow each entry of the series manages to get bigger and louder and wilder, so that we may continually marvel at the fountain of youth and physical prowess of the actor seemingly born to play Ethan Hunt.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher) becomes the fifth different director to helm a film in the franchise, and he kicks things off with the stunning pre-credit action sequence you have probably already heard about  Cruise tackles an Airbus A400M (aka a huge cargo plane). It's a short, but incredibly impressive stunt sequence that sets the stage for a movie filled with action, fighting, stunts, comedy, and intrigue – all with minimal CGI.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin appears as the head of the CIA and the guy trying to permanently shut down the IMF (Impossible Mission Force), while Jeremy Renner does his best to prevent this from happening – without officially confirming or denying any specific action of Ethan Hunt's team. When Baldwin wins, Cruise goes rogue in an attempt to track down Soloman Lane (played by Sean Harris), the sinister leader of the terrorist group known as The Syndicate (mentioned briefly at the end of the last MI movie).<br/><br/>As spectacular as Cruise is, the real flavor of the movie comes courtesy of Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa – a spy, double spy, or something else. Ilsa is smart and exceedingly well trained, and the perfect partner/adversary for Hunt  depending on the moment. Admittedly, this viewer knew nothing of Ms. Ferguson prior to the film, as her best known work as come on TV's ""The White Queen"". While I couldn't help but chuckle as Ilsa made her way through Casablanca, it seemed apropos since fellow Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman made cinematic history there some 73 years prior.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg returns and as a bigger role this time alongside Cruise. Pegg plays gadget-dude Benji Dunn, and as you would expect adds a welcome dose of comical dialogue along the way. Joining Cruise as the only actors to appear in all five MI movies is Ving Rhames as Luther. He is given little to do this time, and it's pretty clear Mr. Rhames has not adhered to the same workout program as Mr Cruise over the years. Alec Baldwin seems to be parodying Alec Baldwin these days, and he has become a real on screen distraction – seriously in need of a change-of-pace role. Sean Harris uses his voice to generate an unusual coldness to his role as villain, and Simon McBurney and Tom Hollander deliver the expected steady turns.<br/><br/>With a nod to Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, there is a wonderful sequence at the Venice Austria Opera House  in the background to Puccini's Turandot. In addition to the Opera and the opening aviation-based fun, we also have an exhilarating motorcycle chase, some new and tricky high-tech gadgetry, an unusual car chase through the hairpin turns of Morocco, the patented MI ""mask"" trick, and plenty of fight scenes involving Cruise and Ferguson.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise, you will undoubtedly find this to be a welcome and fun addition. And since Cruise has already signed on for another, the most impossible mission may be in determining whether he gets any older prior to its release."

","Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation stars Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renner and Alec Baldwin; a spy action film directed by Christopher McQuairre and it's the fifth film in the Mission Impossible Franchise. One of the best movie franchises out there which is getting stronger and stronger without failing to impress the viewers.<br/><br/>This film is about Ethan Hunt and his team trying to prove the existence of the Syndicate, an unknown terrorist organization which is behind many disasters around the world, and is also trying to bring down the IMF(Impossible Mission Force). The action sequences are amazing in this movie, the plane sequence which you see in the trailers, a beautiful underwater sequence, a really good bike chase scene; if you haven't seen Christopher McQuairre's previous film 'Jack Reacher', it has this beautiful car chase sequence which reminds us of those classic chase scenes from movies like Bullitt or Ronin; pure adrenaline filled car chase scene, with no background music, none of those interrupting cheesy dialog in between, all you can hear is the engine grunt, those amazing exhaust sounds, police sirens and just tires screeching; that's exactly what we audience wanted a car chase in a movie to be and he delivered it in Jack Reacher. Now he does the same thing in MI5 but this time with bikes and it works so well. I don't think I have ever saw such an amazing bike chase scene in a movie.<br/><br/>As far the actors goes, Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, he still has it, in fact he kills it, he still has that young personality in him, and he does a far better job than most of the young actors out there; doing most of his stunt work by himself; especially in that plane sequence, that's just amazing, he has amazing driving skills, he shows dedication to what he does and we have to respect that, he deserves every single praise he gets for this.<br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson, she, OMG she is amazing, she was the highlight of the whole movie, bold and wickedness in one single body, or package; whatever you want to call it; I liked her way more than Maggie Q from MI3, or even Paula Patton from Ghost Protocol for that matter; She was like a mother of Ethan Hunt, she protects him like three time in the entire movie, when she is on screen it doesn't feel like you're watching a Mission Impossible movie, it feels more serious, it feels more like a dark James Bond movie; she would be a perfect bond girl.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell is in this movie and he has much more screen time than in the last film; thank you so much for that. In Ghost Protocol they just gave him like a two minute screen time, that was just so unfair, a very bad move; I am sure many MI fans were disappointed at that.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg as Benji, such a talented actor, even though Ving Rhames is in this movie; the chemistry between Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg was far more superior than in the last film; they looked after each other all the time, they were like brothers; he brings so much to this movie, his performance, his great timely sense of humour, works like a charm.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, even though he is a great actor he doesn't have much to do in this movie like in the last film, he doesn't have much of a field work in this movie; all he does is trying to track down Tom Cruise where ever he goes, alongside Alec Baldwin who is a Chief Director of CIA. They have just put him there so that people won't be disappointed for not adding him.<br/><br/>As far as the villain goes, he is fine, he is good actually, he is the one who is running the Syndicate. I'm not gonna say who it is because they don't really show who it is in the trailer, so I'm gonna leave that part out, but when he first appears on screen I had chills because, he looked so perfect, like what a perfect villain should look. He had the same MI3 villain Philip Seymour Hoffman I- am-going-to-destroy-your-life look, but the problem is he doesn't really speak when he first appears, but when he does after a while, and the ultimate baddie impression just vanishes just like that. He looks really good as a villain; take Benedict Cumberbatch from the movie Star Trek Into Darkness with black large overcoat and stuff, give him a pair of black half framed glasses, there it is, that's exactly what he looked like; but it just isn't there when he speaks; I mean he is a great actor, he is really powerful and does a great job at messing up with Ethan's head and destroying his team and all but, I'm not convinced being him as a proper MI villain. Best villain in this franchise so far has been Dougray Scott from MI2 and Philip Seymour Hoffman from MI3, they both tried to destroy what Ethan Hunt loved and it worked. So yea, that's why I consider them as the best villains of the franchise.<br/><br/>So in the end Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation is an amazing film and is worth watching, its action sequences might not be as enjoyable or thrilling as in its prequel Ghost Protocol but, man the plot is good enough to keep you entertained on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. So I am gonna give Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation an 8 out of 10. <br/><br/>THANK YOU"

"abouhelier-r","9","1","3","13 August 2015"," Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
","Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organisation as highly as they are, committed to destroying the IMF. <br/><br/>Over the past 19 years Mission: Impossible movies have become synonymous with its star's fearless stunts. This new entry takes the best of all the ""good"" Mission: Impossible, blend them together as the formula of ingredients is familiar and time tested. This might actually be the best fifth instalment in a franchise, its only real competition is Fast Five - no The Empire Strikes Back doesn't count despite the fact that it is Star Wars: Episode V. Those films have remained Tom Cruise safe harbour, his teflon franchise. Ethan Hunt will always be embraced as a returning hero. You can shoot him, stab him, drown him, blow him up or pair him with the baddest of all; but you will never stop Ethan Hunt, because he is played by Tom Cruise. Make no mistake, even at 53, Tom Cruise is still Hollywood's hungriest leading man. In the previous chapter, 2011's Ghost Protocol, Cruise wowed audience by hanging from the side of the world's tallest skyscraper. Now in the latest sequel director's understood perfectly Cruise's signature and he wastes no time serving it up, opening the film with the guy himself sprinting and leaping onto the wing of a Russian cargo plane speeding down a runway. <br/><br/>Cruise is - obviously - the definitive modern movie star. A charismatic force that can make the bad watchable and the average ultimately quite fun. Plus, he's very far from being a candidate for The Expendables series any time soon. Rebecca Ferguson is also great in this movie, she is the right balance between femininity and bad-assery. The light hearted tone of this movie is mostly due to and expanded role for the comic-relief maestro: Simon Pegg. This man is hilarious, he's a quite actor who - I believe - doesn't get much credit for his work. If you watch Shaun of the Dead, he has this comic aspect as well as a very good dramatic one. The villain is also good. He has motivation and you can really feel where he's coming from; still not an incredible villain but he's functional. <br/><br/>Shockingly, the theme music is - after an initial blast - sabotaged. In fact, Rogue Nation might not be the tightest, or even, the most logically coherent Mission: Impossible movie but there should be more movies like this one: relentlessly thrilling. It recalls the first film a lot, coming back to that more tense, suspense oriented espionage; with a sharp script that springs a little surprise or two. It does more than just connect the dots between action set-pieces. The writers perfectly balanced the espionage devices with gadgets while having thrilling action sequences. The action is indeed amazing. That is the very heart of why you like action movies. This franchise is the few remaining series (along with 007) where globe trotting action is still appreciated. <br/><br/>Action scenes are extremely well handed by Christopher McQuarrie, characters are still very accessible, enjoyable and seeing them coming together again is very important as we can see that a lot happened to this team before. The film's most exciting sequence - a tussle between Hunt and three assassin sent to murder the Austrian Chancellor at the Vienna State Opera - is a beautifully managed action sequence. Unconventional and quite brave for a mainstream franchise picture. Yet, the motorcycle chase is one of the best I've seen for a long time in a movie. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is not so much about the outcome as it is the breathlessly thrilling journey Tom Cruise takes us on to get there."
"charliep14","7","1","3","13 August 2015"," More Spy Movie than Action Movie this time around
","Despite what the trailer sells, this movie is less action oriented than the two previous installments. Now, the few action scenes are absolutely fantastic and continue the over the top signature that Tom cruise and the Mission Impossible franchise have established but there are a lot more 'spy scenes' this time around: Rebecca Ferguson plays a very ambiguous / mysterious character, there is some political intrigue. Overall, though I understand the disappointment of some action lovers the story is not bad or simplistic. It's of course not an philosophical study of human nature but it's actually well done and well told. My only gripe with the movie is the lack of the obligatory Mission Impossible tropes: where is the scene where Tom falls from high above to a few millimeters from the ground? Where is the scene where he runs for miles and miles? Over than that, a good summer movie - not quite to the level of Ghost Protocol but enjoyable nonetheless."
"driesenbrandon-81948","8","1","3","9 August 2015"," What I thought of it
","General thought:It's worth the watch. I was told it was a good movie. But many movies are going from bad to worse after the second movie. But this movie held up to my expectations after the first few minutes I was enticed to keep watching and it was time well spent. I would suggest watching this movie as the plot keeps together mostly and actors keep well in the movie. Also there is not to much stalling in the movie so most of it sticks together towards the end. Although I must say there are parts in the movie where some things are really exaggerated and make the protagonist to invincible. It is what you expect from an mission impossible movie, action, gadgets and a great complicated story line."
"davidgee","7","1","3","7 August 2015"," Ethan Hunt - not just buff but buffed!
","ROGUE NATION delivers more of what we expect from an Impossible Mission: super-stunts, chases (cars and motorbikes - again), shoot-outs, close-combat fights and (less than usual) rubber-face impersonations. Like 007, Ethan Hunt has been 'rebooted' for the age of Jason Bourne and Frank Martin, cranking up what was always the most fast-paced of the major action-hero franchises.<br/><br/>The plot isn't exactly new. The IMF team are in disgrace after one of their operations is ruined by the intervention of a terror outfit called The Syndicate (think SPECTRE). A mystery woman (Rebecca Ferguson) appears to working both in and against the Syndicate, whose leader (Sean Harris) looks more like a mega-creepy serial killer (Francis Dolarhyde?) than a Goldfinger or a Blofeld. Ethan gets captured, gets free, gets captured again: it's plotting by numbers - except that the movie's forward momentum somehow carries you past the sense of familiarity.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames's role seems to have been scaled down. Simon Pegg's, on the other hand, has been beefed up. But, of course, it's little Tommy Cruise (there's one brief scene highlighting his lack of height, a good gag) who carries the movie: he's not only buff but somehow buffed - with a kind of 'glow' to him, which may just be his sheer 'star-power' shining out of the screen.<br/><br/>The locations - Vienna, London, Morocco - aren't ground-breaking, although the botched assassination during a performance of 'Turandot' at the Vienna State Opera is splendidly choreographed. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has polished a re-run of a well-tried formula and made it look (almost) reinvented. Two hours of crowd-pleasing high-voltage hokum."
"georgewilliamnoble","8","1","3","3 August 2015"," The Cruze Is The The Real Action Man Movie Star
","At 131 minutes the movie does not always command the attention for it's length, stopping for breath is one thing but to deliver long text laden speech's to propel and explain the plot is quiet another. The over complicated plot apart it must be said that the action and suspense sequences are right up there with the very best of the series to date. The stand out is off coarse the scene from the trailer with the Cruze tied onto the ribs of a Airbus 400M that captures action from the ground to 5000 feet without a stunt double, you have to be impressed by what the little fellow will take on. The diving scenes where the Cruze holds his breath like forever with several close up's shows little sign of any faking only smart editing. What i did really like about this movie was the absolute lack of computer assisted effect's,the motor bike chase was brilliantly handled as was the car chase now i don't believe for a moment that the Cruze does all his own stunt's but he certainly does put the word action into the term action star.So how does the cast do, well i'm never impressed by Alec Baldwin regardless of how many shouting roles he get's and he get's a load's so i will move on. Sean Harris unknown to me i don't watch television does a terrific turn as a most loathsome villain both creepy and snake like. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames do what they can in shallow roles,Simon Mcburney is very well cast. Simon Pegg carries whole chunk's of the movie as the side kick, being left to do whole segments that require a comic diversion which he does with some aplomb. Rebecca Ferguson is very impressive as both the female eye candy and as a foil for Tom Cruze.she is also completely convincing in her many action scenes that adorn the film. And so to the Cruze himself the pint size buzz bomb of a movie star in the way stars of Hollywood's golden era were when a man really was a man, think John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Errol Flynn, Clark Gable and Cary Grant rolled into one, its the eyes that have it, he just loves the camera in fact he east's it up and i will hand it to him he sell's this picture long and true, MI5 call it what you will it is a tasty action ""extraverganzer"" but Tom Cruzes movie all the way!"
"MovieHoliks","8","1","3","3 August 2015"," Possibly Best In The Franchise So Far...
","Just caught this awesome fifth installment in the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise at the local multi-plex over the weekend, and this seriously rivals the last one- ""Ghost Protocal""- as the best in the series so far. I saw a user comment that pointed out that this is possibly the only franchise where each film is better than the last- and I think they may have a point!<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns as IMF super-agent, Ethan Hunt, this time battling a group of rogue international agents bent on taking over the world. We see Cruise and his group of IMF buddies- Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames- travel over sea, air, land, etc..- in some of the best action scenes ever filmed. That scene that's been so publicized with Cruise hanging off the edge of the aircraft flying into the sky just scrapes the surface! <br/><br/>Alec Baldwin joins the cast this time around playing a government official attempting to take down the IMF -and agent Hunt!- trying to just melt the group into the regular old CIA. But really what makes this movie is an actress named Rebecca Ferguson!- all I gotta say is WOW! With her on-screen charisma and moves, she is quite possibly the best action heroine I've ever seen in any movie!- and this is coming from a guy who generally doesn't like women in action roles! She gives Hunt a run for the money, and really, if the two of them had to battle it out, I think she could take him..?? LOL BIG THUMBS UP for her and this movie- this is what summer big budget movies are all about!"
"david-m-b95","9","1","3","3 August 2015"," A quintessential modern action film
","Here I was thinking that Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation wouldn't be able to capture the dizzying heights (both figuratively and literally) of it's predecessor, the 2011 Brad Bird directed Ghost Protocol, itself an excellent piece of cinema...<br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong...<br/><br/>From the get go this film grabs you by the scruff of the neck and refuses to let go. The action seamlessly flows from one set piece to another, packaged together with some wonderful moments of character chemistry and gripping story, which combine to make Rogue Nation perhaps the most explosive movie of the year and one of the finest action movies of the decade.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise slips effortlessly back into the role he has made so iconic by now. You know what you're gonna get from Cruise as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, but this movie sees him up the ante once again with regards to the physical acting whilst also adding layer upon layer to Hunt, turning him into one of the most intriguing action heroes in cinema.<br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson, a new addition to the cast, kicks a large amount of ass in the movie, there really is no better way to put it. Her character arc sees her undergo an interesting and complex story, one that she accomplishes more than capably whilst also holding her own alongside Cruise. Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames all return and once again reprise their roles as Hunt's team. However, one can't help but feel that they are all (save perhaps Pegg) robbed of screen time by Ferguson and prestige by Cruise. Don't get me wrong, the actors are all great but the characters are a little hard done by as the script allows little time for the film's antics outside of whatever mission Cruise is on. Alec Baldwin is a solid if unspectacular addition to the cast; he brings a certain air of gravitas and legitimacy to the film but his character really doesn't have much to do. I won't say too much about the rest of the new additions to the cast as I really don't want to spoil what is a fantastic story.<br/><br/>The film is essentially a 2 hour cat and mouse chase with both sides trying to catch the tail of the other whilst just falling short. The IMF is put under extreme pressure as the repercussions of their past comes back to bite them and the Government begins to lose faith. In this uncertain time a new threat, known only as 'The Syndicate', emerges to strike whilst the IMF is weakest and it is up to Hunt and his team to stop them.<br/><br/>Director Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher, The Way of the Gun) adds a certain grittiness to the action as well as upping the scale in grandiose, yet believable fashion. The movie really is on a spectacular scale whilst managing to avoid becoming a bloated mess of CGI explosions, numerous chase and fights scenes pack a real punch and the stunts are simply jaw dropping. The editing is phenomenal, the camera work stunning and the way the usage of sound differs from scene to scene and setting to setting is incredibly well done, you really have to see it to truly appreciate it - I really don't want to spoil what is truly a masterful technique!<br/><br/>The film's run time tends to drag a little and the pacing takes a few wobbles near the end of the movie, but a phenomenal first two acts make up for what is, admittedly, a slightly weaker third act in comparison. However the way in which the story ties up is excellent and the drama of the piece is most evident here, proving that Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is not just a big brainless piece of fun. <br/><br/>This film is a real chess game; it's intricate and methodical whilst still maintaining what a chess game should be - a game, an entertainment product<br/><br/>It's an intelligent and enjoyable action spy thriller and you really don't want to miss it."
"r-kerr0992","8","1","3","3 August 2015"," Solid Installment to the Evermore Strengthening Franchise
","OVERVIEW You would think that the fifth movie of a franchise would not maintain the quality of screen writing, acting and action that made it predecessors so good. Prime example is 'Terminator Genisys'. Admittedly I haven't seen that movie, but apparently to a lot of reviewers the story logic collapses in on itself, the acting is bad and the dialogue even worse. Both franchises take a similar look to their lifespan, you had two solid movies (MI: II more action orientated) and a less than admirable third movie. Then they both try to re-invent themselves , Terminator you could say failed (at least in a non-box office perspective), and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol in my opinion surpassing the previous films. The fourth Mission Impossible was a really tight, well written movie.<br/><br/>Not much changes this time round. You have a new enemy emerging called the Syndicate, which has been troubling Ethan Hunt for over a year with tracking them, being questioned whether they exist or not. All the while, the IMF is being determined in a court of law whether it is fit to still operate with it's un-orthodox way of getting results. Once the IMF is shutdown, Ethan refuses to back down as he, with the help of Benji and a mysterious British Intelligence agent, attempt to foil the unknown plans of the evil organisation. Nice setup, and the movie carries it along nicely.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCES As per expected Tom Cruise puts in a solid performance as Ethan Hunt, however his real ambition for stunt work throughout the movie really is the stand out, which I will mention later. The supporting cast also are very good, however there were three standouts for me. Simon Pegg was great throughout the entire film, he is almost now the comedic yin to Cruise's intense yang. I think the writers for, example, Star Trek and MI recognise his on screen presence and write him a lot more dialogue and get him involved more in the filming process. With Star Trek Into Darkness he had considerably more screen time than the first movie, and the same goes for this movie.<br/><br/>The other two mentions are for the surprising cast choices of Simon McBurney as the head of British Intelligence, Atlee, and Sean Harris as the founder of the evil Syndicate, Solomon Lane. Both actors mostly take up television roles so it's nice to see them get some exposure. Harris did a great job acting alongside Tom Cruise as the antagonist, and McBurney was very good as the somewhat questionable organisation head.<br/><br/>NOTEWORTHY MOMENTS I think it goes without saying that the set pieces in this movie were by far the standout moments. You have of course the ridiculous opening scene where Tom Cruise runs across the wing of a moving plane, and also hanging on the outside of a plane, most likely hundreds of feet in the air. Crazy stunts. There was also the tension riding café scene with Benji and Isla Faust and the final plan to try and outsmart Solomon Lane. However there were two that stick in my mind.<br/><br/>Firstly the behind the set Opera scene at Vienna, where Ethan with the help of Benji is trying to track down an assailant that he believes is in the Opera House, but it forms into something completely different. The slow build of confusion and tension as Ethan tries to piece together the significance of the Chancellor of Vienna being at the Opera House the same time as his target. It really is a great scene from start to finish and shaped my opinion from the get go. The later scene is the motorbike chase. High Octane, fast moving and just a joy to watch.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT A shorter review this time but this is a solid installment to the evermore strengthening franchise. There were some cheesy lines here and there, but the performances held the film high, the plot and action set pieces made this an enjoyable movie.The new formula they are using for these films is working, and so long as they stick to it and continue to be creative with the source material, there will no doubt be another two or three solid follow-ups in the wood works, and I wouldn't have a problem seeing them."

","""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" (2015 release; 131 min.) is the fifth movie in the MI franchise, starring once again Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. As the movie opens, we are in Minsk, Belarus, where a large military cargo plane is about to take off with a payload of bombs. The plane must be stopped at all cost. When seemingly the plane is about to leave, pout of nowhere comes Hunt, who jumps onto the plane and holds on for dear life. He succeeds. All this is even before the opening credits roll! The eventual story is about stopping the Syndicate, a rogue league of terrorists who will stop at nothing, and the parallel struggle of the Impossible Missions Force (""IMF"") to retain independence from the CIA. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: first, this latest installment of the Mission Impossible franchise is written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, no stranger to Tom Cruise (they made ""Jack Reacher"" together a couple of years ago). Second, this movie truly represents the ""ol' school"" of action flicks at its very best (the only other franchise still to equally do so is of course the Bond franchise). From the get-go, we are thrown into the action, which basically is non-stop and relentless, rendering the specific plot points almost meaningless, other than there being the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys. Third, I love the international scenery of the movie: London, Paris, Vienna, Havana, Casablanca, etc., they are all featured prominently, and then some. The 15 min. sequence at the Vienna Opera (while Puccini's Tarandot is playing) is nothing short of brilliant, even Hitchcock-esque in its approach and build-up. Last but not least, there are some great performances in the movie, in particular Sean Harris as baddie Solomon Lane, but even more so fairly newcomer Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa, another undercover spy who may or may not be ""bad"". Surely we will see much more of her after this role. But in the end, this is Cruise's movie all the way. Now approaching his mid-fifties, Cruise looks about 10-15 years younger, and almost freakishly so. That said, no-one dominates the action genre like Cruise does. Seeing Cruise hanging on the side of the plane is just one (but probably the best) of the many ""can you believe this?"" moments in the movie.<br/><br/>""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" opened this weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED and the audience absolutely ate it up, giving a spontaneous applause when the end titles started rolling. Based on the excellent word-of-mouth, I can see this movie having some serious legs at the box office. If you love action movies, you cannot do better than this. ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"andyevel6","8","1","3","2 August 2015"," Lots of action. Loved Rebecca Ferguson
","Dynamic action all the way through. Still liked M.I, #1 best of the 5 features in the series. But this one may be second best. Rebecca Ferguson did her own stunts in the film. Wow! Here's a beautiful actress with a realistic future as a star in films. Loved her here, loved her in White Queen. Here, though, her hair was brown and I kept thinking, she reminded me of someone else. I discovered who when I saw a scene from Captain from Castile on the internet.This actress has an uncanny resemblance to actress JEAN PETERS. Think of Jean in Niagara (opposite Marilyn Monroe -two gorgeous females in the midst of true suspense and the grandeur of the falls as background). Peters had a perfect nose, though; however, when Ferguson faces the camera in close ups and in certain angles you'd think it was Peters on the screen. (Peters is also the actress who married billionaire Howard Hughes). I liked the entire cast and really enjoyed the action packed film. Tom Cruise is a fine actor and should keep on doing blockbuster films. He may not get an Academy Award for them, but he's sure getting rich and the audience loves to see him in action-adventure films."
"rgkarim","9","1","3","1 August 2015"," Number 5 keeping it alive
","It's the weekend and time once again to undertake a mission. That mission is to go to the local movie theater and review yet another film to be released upon the mass media. If you haven't guessed from my lengthy introduction, our film today is Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, the fifth movie in the ever-popular spy series. Hi I'm Robbie K and it's my job to give you the information and help you decide if you should pay a visit to the theater to catch the movie. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to read my review.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible is a series that has had its ups and downs, varying in the plot, delivery, and overall presentation of the movie. Yet there is usually one consistency in the series, an adventure filled with suspense and action to bring the excitement to the former television series. Well guess what, MI5 has all of that and fortunately presents it in a well- balanced manner. Director Christopher McQuarrie has led his team to develop a fantastic spy movie that holds all the elements one is looking for in a spy film without going too far down the dark side. Let's start with the plot. <br/><br/>MI5's plot starts out with gusto; an exciting opening that reintroduces our team before dropping Ethan (Tom Cruise) and company into their next mission. From there the plot only gets more suspenseful from there, becoming a conglomeration of manhunt, espionage, and uncovering the truth amidst the complicated organization known as the Syndicate. Now it is still the typical plot that we've seen in previous installments, but MI5 keeps the story exciting by the numerous twists thrown into the mix. The tale keeps you guessing at what is going to happen, surprising you with some unexpected angles you might not see coming. But the story isn't just about the mission; it throws some other plot elements into the mix particularly around Ethan and the newcomer Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) who take the center stage of this adventure. All these tales are well integrated into the main story, adding depth to what could be a one-dimension plot and anchoring you back to the team. By connecting with the team, I felt part of the squad trying to take down the ruthless, cunning, skilled terror that is the Syndicate. <br/><br/>The plot is greatly supported by the action, giving you some variety and keeping the plot moving. MI5 does have technical details, governmental jargon, and planning moments to help set things up, but the action helps bring the heat of the moment to life. The chase scenes in particular are the most exciting, rip roaring fun with over the top stunts lighting up the screen with explosive sound effects. The hand-to-hand combat even throws a few impressive moments, with Cruise in particular showing some dexterity and strength in his stunts. Unfortunately gunplay is a little lacking in this film, very simplistic and often short lived thanks to the near perfect accuracy of our team. Perhaps my favorite component of the action is the cleverness behind it, where the flashy moves are traded for a more strategic approach to which you expect of elite spies. Unfortunately for me, the ending scene was a little anticlimactic; the epic buildup kind of fizzled out with the rather boring, and somewhat drawn out chase in the end. <br/><br/>In addition to all of this, MI5's true strength is the team of actors that bring the story to life. Cruise, despite all the weird crap he has done, still does well with his role as Ethan. All his personality quirks have bestowed him the ability to bring a wide array of qualities to his character that you look for in a protagonist. His character is smart and somewhat sociopathic, yet can be crazy, overemotional, and funny, which leads to an entertaining character. Ferguson doesn't have quite the emotional spectrum, but the femme fatale edge she brings and mysterious disposition help keep suspense into the movie and offset some of the crazier moments. Simon Pegg as the ever-lovable Benji reprises his role, a character that is sort of a comical version of Q that relieves the tension with his klutziness and well- timed lines. Much of the comedy in fact is due to excellent timing and a clever script. Jeremy Renner and Pegg really had me laughing with their execution of very simple lines, just casually reacting to the heat of the moment like friends do. As for the villain, Sean Harris was an excellent choice, an actor who captures the true evil mastermind without overacting like many due. You get the creeps from his quiet disposition, his cold calculating tactics mirrored in his steely gaze and soft manner of speaking. The cast was super fantastic and I wish I could go into more detail, but let's wrap this up. <br/><br/>Mission Impossible 5 is a great installment into the series, and may be my favorite of them all. While not the most action packed, this tale keeps moving and integrates a lot of great components into the tale. It is definitely not the most original tale, but they have kept it fresh, interesting, and funny throughout the movie and crafted a great spy tale. There are a few things that could have been cleaned up or let out, but overall it is a well-done movie. I encourage everyone to go see this movie into the theater, especially those looking for a good Thriller this summer. Just suspend reality a little and you will be able to accept some of the limitations of this tale. <br/><br/>My scores are: Action/Adventure/Thriller: 8.5-9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0"
"thesar-2","8","1","3","1 August 2015"," Catch Him If You Can
","Well, it was inevitable. Prior to this fifth installment, this was the only franchise in history that progressively got better with each film, until now. Not to say this wasn't great and on par with the quality, comedy, action, espionage, thrills, great stunts and all the other usual attributes of the series. It definitely was a fun ride.<br/><br/>But, exactly like the 7th Fast & Furious movie earlier this year, this one seemed to tone down the looseness and fun the previous two chapters made me fall in love with. It was a ton more serious and while that made these two sequels (F&F7 and MI5) more mature and respected, it just wasn't 100% the enjoyment I had with the preceding adventures.<br/><br/>Who cares, though? I left the theatre happy, pumped up and wanting to see this not just once more, but a multiple of times. I began my rating of Ghost Protocol with 9/10 stars, but after last night's 10th (give or take) viewing, it got bumped to 10/10 stars. I could see the same here after a few more takes. <br/><br/>Sooo pleased they're already planning a sixth outing way sooner than the years these take to make. Until then, this one is a great addition to the series and a must-see for fans plus just about any action/spy film lover."
"ryanwu","8","1","3","1 August 2015"," Your mission if you choose to accept it......
","My mission if I choose to accept, go into a cinema, watch a summer blockbuster and come out entertained. I accept it. Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, just like the others were packed with action scenes, romantic comedies, and always a rogue agent. To be honest here I actually expected a better movie as I had such high expectations. All through the movie has my mind been grasping at the facts the movie throws at you, it just excites me to see this franchise coming to a epic ""finale"" like movie. It has always been for me that a spy movie should not be perfect, and this one is not. A flawed character is what the movie needed, a plot that follows was delivered, and at the end I came out as entertained as ever. Mission Accomplished."

","The crowning jewel of the movie was the female heroine Ilsa. She has a Swedish father and grew up in Sweden. Her mother is English and moved to Sweden when she was 25. I also personally found it interesting when the people in the ""torture chamber"" spoke in a foreign language that sounded Norse, and that included Ilsa. She had a good British accent, as well. I know from experience that Nordic people often are big and stocky and tall and fair. I think it is the people from the Netherlands that are probably thinner-appearing. I've also learned from experience that Nordic people possess a certain air about them which can be described as ""calm, cool, and collected."" They seem at one with the land, which is cool and easy.<br/><br/>The reason I went in and watched this time was because the 1st time I ran into it was walking to a movie theater using a printed map from in my college dorm room in 2006 for MI:III, which was big at the time. I heard the loud theme music leaving the theater as the last crowd left the little theater. It sounded like an organ from where I was and very cool. I went in to watch but am not used to things like choosing to see Star Wars and knowing about Pirates of the Caribbean, which I heard was good and became obsessed about. So, I left the theater soon after it started and headed ""home.""<br/><br/>Another reason this title may deserve a 7 is because the acting was so smooth and really made a positive statement and seemed rather productive. The actors all seemed to have intelligent vibes. They are older than me, so it makes me wonder about it.<br/><br/>I read the synopsis in advance and checked out some of the actors because I knew I would be at a loss for what was going on. It helped a lot, but I was able to focus and know some of what was going on in the movie, anyway, tho still not a lot.<br/><br/>I think other than that there is a female this should be ""Tom Cruise's movie."" I probably did not catch all that a lot of people did, but he was definitely very nice, friendly, considerate, hopeful, generous even, etc.<br/><br/>I think the motley group of guys in this is very well together and extremely positive, intelligent, and alert. They were cute, as well.<br/><br/>To be honest, you'd see this movie for a big hit not necessarily in your own realm of interest, which can be a hinted issue in the fact there is an opera in it to interest other groups. You know, it's like putting a Halloween pumpkin in a comic strip. I didn't really need to see it, but I like to see whatever's out. I learned most from the Swedish lady and enjoyed how well together the men were."
"condillon","Null","1","3","31 July 2015"," This franchise just keeps getting better and better!
","Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation follows the return of Ethan Hunt who as of now has to deal with the IMF now disbanded, a new threat called the Syndicate, soon emerges. Faced with what may be the most impossible mission yet, Ethan gathers his team and joins forces with a British agent who may or may not be a member of this deadly rogue nation.<br/><br/>Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher) has taken on this fifth installment of Mission: Impossible by proving that there's plenty of life left in this franchise. Tom Cruise is still on top at his A game with his usual death defying stunts and being just so enjoyable to see on screen, he's still always seizing to amaze me with every wit he has.<br/><br/>New to the franchise, Rebecca Ferguson played such a poised, sensual and sang froid woman who can guarantee to whack a punch with all the skills she has to offer and she does play a enigma throughout the film. Simon Pegg returns as Benji, who's such a delight when it came to the comic relief, Jeremy Renner & Ving Rhames return as well as the tight-lipped teammates. <br/><br/>Bringing to Hunt a blend of steeliness and vulnerability, Cruise is still succeeding at giving everything he's got to this role by going out of the his way to keep us entertained. The action is simply explosive and in your face, like when it came to the enthralling set pieces, everything looked great when it came to hanging off a plane to a motorcycle chase, there's a lot to take in from these visionary and awe inspiring moments when our main star is doing these nail bitting stunts himself.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation does delivers more of same but gee, it just feels so good to be in the thrill of the moment. There was plenty more of espionage to go around in film from the high tech gadgets to the combat of each tense action sequence. Even if MIRN might be on par with its previous film, it's still a solid, mildly subversive entry into the series with its self-aware sense of humor and brand of action that feels fresher and more freewheeling than anything that we'll get this summer. I just get goosebumps every time I hear that iconic theme song, it's just so catchy!"
"Philipe14","8","1","3","31 July 2015"," Good clean fun, but I miss Cinnamon Carter
","I didn't like the way they turned Mr. Phelps into a traitor in the first flick, but since then, they've been pretty consistent with what IMF is supposed to be all about. Using American taxpayer dollars, go out and fix the world. Along the way, you might have to kill people, but it's all in a day's work. In this episode, IMF is shut down by the congressional black-operations funding subcommittee because the CIA thinks they're messing up all the time. Turns out a terrorist network is running interference on IMF and making them look like the bad guys. Ethan Hunt meets a pretty girl double agent, so we're wondering just who she's really working for. The original TV show didn't need guest stars to do the female agent roles, so I wish they'd bring back the Cinnamon Carter character from the TV series as a regular part of the team."
"evancringean","8","1","3","29 July 2015"," Cruise and McQuarrie make a good team. *no spoilers*
","Let me start with Jack Reacher, that film was good but didn't live up to the book. However McQuarrie made Cruise work in the role by adding a new flavour to his own kinda take on the 'Reacher' books, this is what he has done again with this film. He made this Mission Impossible feel different. It was not only a new kind of take on the previous films, it also felt just as isolated as Ghost Protocol, which in my opinion is a smart move with these films - much like what the Bond films do. It returns to the original things you loved about the original films, but extracts all the cheesy campy 'Cruise-liners' and actually gives the character more of Ethan Hunt an emotional state with more realistic intentions and motives. Almost like someone you can relate to, or wish to be. Cruise once again plays the character more extremely and heightens his predeceasing film by far. This film drags at times within story wise, but the expert on screen chemistry between Pegg and Cruise keeps you distracted, as well as the amazing action and car chase scenes. Overall I would go watch this in cinema to experience the full scale of how big and noisy the action is, and it would be worth pre-ordering on Blu-Ray DVD too."
"rannynm","Null","1","3","29 July 2015"," An Absolute Blast! Mind Blowing Stunts and Gadgets!
","A roller coaster of non-stop excitement! Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) faces a new threat called the Syndicate, a network dedicated to establish a new world order via terrorist attacks. Ethan has another problem - his agency, IMF, is shut down. Now, his team consists of rogue agents with the most impossible mission yet.<br/><br/>I'm just going to be frank, this is my first Mission Impossible film and Rogue Nation makes me want to see more. As a movie lover, I get excited when I'm introduced to new film franchises and boy was this an introduction. Having no history with the franchise, it did not damage my extreme enjoyment. <br/><br/>The film itself is an absolute blast. When the credits rolled, I felt as if I'd just come off an amusement park ride. This film has incredible car chases, mind blowing stunts and gadgets that even James Bond would beg for. Every scene is better than the last.<br/><br/>Action is not the only thing that fuels this movie. It also has tremendous actors. Some of the feats pulled in this film are absurd and stretch your belief system. Performers like Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg successfully help you buy into these impossible situations. Even the characters they play are aware of the insanity but they treat it like an everyday occurrence because it's their job. Like magicians, there is a charm and elegance from the performer, so you don't catch the strings and mirrors. <br/><br/>Even if you haven't seen other Mission Impossible films, I bet you recognize the iconic music. Many films and TV Shows have satirized it and who can blame them? The theme is grand! Many composers have added their own touch to it like Danny Elfman and even Hans Zimmer. This film's track is composed by Joe Kraemer and is one of the best versions, if not the best. The music starts out with two notes and then grows. As the music got louder, my pulse rose until the title came up and the Mission Impossible theme burst through the speakers. The music really gets you into the mood. <br/><br/>My favorite character is Benji (Simon Pegg). I love the characters that have the gadgets and technology to help our hero. Benji is not only a loyal friend to Ethan, but their history makes the interactions between them funnier and sincere. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Cruise is under water switching the security codes. When you hear about actors doing their own stunts, one man comes to mind - Tom Cruise. Cruise is known for his authenticity with stunts. (That's really him hanging on to the outside of the plane - with safety precautions of course) You'd think he's at his limit. Well, according to the director (Christopher McQuarrie), in this scene Cruise held his breath for six minutes. I looked it up! Even McQuarrie thought it was, ""too real."" While you're watching the scene, you're holding your breath as well. <br/><br/>The moral of the story is, ""Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer."" Ethan has teamed up with Lisa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), an agent who may or may not be part of the Syndicate. Ethan is unsure if he can trust her, but he knows if he stays with her, the closer he is to stopping the Syndicate.<br/><br/>I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to ages 10 through 18. There is, of course, violence and language but nothing you wouldn't expect in a PG-13 film. Your mission is to see Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. It is in theaters July 31.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org."

But this movie is lacking in both of them, because the ""bad"" guy looks like an office clerk with a funny accent. And without a really menacing bad guy, there is NO sense of danger or excitement, which in effect causes this movie to be rather tedious and bland, the last thing I wish for in an action movie!<br/><br/>The bad news doesnt stop here, because there is way too much talk going on. Just talk talk talk. 30 minutes of boring dialogue scenes could have easily been deleted. I mean this is suppose to be an action movie and the many talking scenes arent even suspenseful or funny. Just tedious and bland.<br/><br/>Aint there any good? Well the few stunts / chase scenes are good and (reasonably) exciting. The fighting scenes are without real menace though.

""Mission impossible: Rogue Nation"" is directed by Christopher Mcquarrie, the writer for movie ""Edge Of Tomorrow"" and others. Rogue Nation is one of the most fun films in the franchise, and is loaded with tons of stunts and action, mostly done by Tom Cruise himself. This blockbuster is sure to sweep you off your feet towards the end.<br/><br/>After the damage the IMF inflicted on the Kremlin in Russia, Alan Hunley(Alec Baldwin) is determined to finally shutdown the IMF so they can work for the CIA. Along the way, Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise), finds out that there is a British syndicate which contains many highly skilled assassins determined to destroy the IMF. The rest of the plot shows how they try to dissolve the Syndicate and it's leader. <br/><br/>This movie is sheer fun. The movie starts off with a great kick and shows off little doses of Simon Pegg humor and Tom Cruise's energy at fifty-three. The screenplay is very smoothly paced even if you would feel that the movie is bit too long. At the end of this movie, you would definitely feel that this movie was at least ten minutes too long. Nevertheless, ""Rogue Nation"" is pretty sweet. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg steal the show with there amazing jokes, stunts, and fire- action. Wait, what about the cool motorcycle chase? The soundtrack is our familiar time bomb mission theme, but it still works out really well. The action is non-stop, and it would keep you on the edge of your seat even though the problem with most of all the movies from 2015 was the horrendous characterization.<br/><br/>In this movie, they take a lot of time to develop more and more of the IMF life, and also the lives of the characters. Due to this, your care for the story, the action, and the characters really is worth it. Coming to the performances, Rebecca Ferguson is the best thing that ever happened to Mission Impossible because of her style, action, and her neck-breaking flips and stunts. She is the most bad-ass agent ever seen in MI. Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg do a fine job in their role, even though there were some shaky moments where they could'vs reacted better. Honestly, I when it comes to emotion and anger, Tom Cruise is never the guy. Also, it's very hard to believe that Tom Cruise is the smartest person in the movie, due to his reactions in real-life situations. <br/><br/>Even though there are too many characters and too many subplots, Chris Mcquarie has perfectly managed building all of them at the same time. This movie is very high on style, but kind of lacks on new substances. While watching this movie, you would feel that people have been there and done this, but ultimately the pure fun in action is what you should watch it for. Watching Tom do his two-hundred ft jump is pretty nerve-wrecking for some fans including me. That's really where the characterization kicks in. While he does his jump, all the true fans would really be scared for his life. <br/><br/>This movie is the most fun I had watching in a long time and I hope that Tom Cruise does it again. This movie is amazing fun and you should definitely catch it. Watching Tom Cruise do his nerve-wrecking stunts in theaters? I'm in for it again."

Of course, there are lots of references to many other and more famous movies, including James Bond ones, but I like that the attitude/mood is non- serious, not ""bulked out"", even in respectable places like Vienna Opera... And inclusion of new and international actors, e.g. Jens Hultén, and places, e.g. Morocco, Austria, provides the movie with broader background, bringing the viewers away from narrow despondency. <br/><br/>And - last but not least - all the cast is great again, even smaller parts are played with non-random performers.

But strangely and awkwardly, in a good way.<br/><br/>Except a few glitches, Major Tom does everything an action flick needs with unparalleled equivocal: underwater, hanging on planes, driving cars and motorcycles at great speeds, jumping on polls and fighting skills of a ninja are all Tom's. As much I would like to say something unworthy about the small main actor, he really really does the job perfectly. Doing his own stunts and not just any stunts, you get the feeling that this is a man who can really be a real agent and maybe somewhere in the world they exist. One time, a scary secret service guy whom I met only once, told me that what you see in the movies is only half of what they can accomplish.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise pulled a Mission Impossible in his real life too. Just watch the pictures.<br/><br/>Everybody else is in the movie for support. The bad guy, Sean Harris is convincing up to the very end. A brilliant mastermind who gets easily trapped by Tom Cruise like in a good 'Merican movie. I don't know where Rebecca Ferguson was until now, but she is an appearance. The way she is sculpted and her abilities are definitely not questionable. <br/><br/>Simon Pegg. Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner are supporting cast and that's all. Nothing more. The director, in my opinion, had the easiest job: ""Hey, Tom! Grab on that plane! (jump in the water/ride that motorbike/drive that car/jump on one leg holding your crotch and your nose while with the other hand kick some guy's ass Goooood.and Cuut!! Hey everybody, that's a wrap!!!""<br/><br/>Soundtrack is of Mission Impossible. I liked the fact that they make him steal a list, just like in M.I. part.1. and that's all with the likes.<br/><br/>I'm moving to Vienna. Apparently hijacking a new BMW is as easy as 1,2,3. (Benji appears out of nowhere with one) Good one BMW. Going down the stairs with a BMW and rolling a few times it doesn't do anything bad to you. Perhaps it gives you a massage along the way. Holding you breath for 3 and half minutes while swimming it's never looked so easy. Falling from a motorbike without any protection, does nothing to you. Yeap. In Moto GP they're all pussies for wearing safety gear, right Tom? and I could go on, but I'll stop. Mission Impossible is a decent action movie geared up with the latest tech and cool action scenes. It will entertain you and your family. Kudos to Mr. Cruise for his stunts and making a loved character as real as possible. <br/><br/>Scientology-Smushientology. they're all jealous, High Priest!!!(or whatever they are calling you and Travolta there)<br/><br/>Speaking of which Born on the Fourth of July starring Tom Cruise was an Oscar nominated movie with lots of awards.

","The movie I saw is perfect for the people who really like tom cruise or action and I think this was the best of mission impossible series .. the others was too bad .. I never finished them because of their ugliness .. But I decided to see this movie to see if he is as good as the people say or not .. the people always give you over feelings about any movie .. So, Yes .. To me the movie is not too good .. It was not bad .. the action scenes was good and made by professionals with no use to any CGI and that what made me happy and the chase scenes was also too good I could say .. the story was not good at all and made many many times before but the story was not important the important is the events in the movie and I can say It was not bad at all .. So If you are from the people who are always looking for entertainment .. This movie will make your day .. On the other hands .. If you are from the critical audience .. Tip .. Don't see this movie and see any movie else .. see the shaw shank or godfather .. :)"

","I was neves a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise. The only other installment in the series I had seen was Ghost Protocol and I would probably just describe it as ""meh"". So when my friends and I decided to go see Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, I was expecting that same meh quality, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The film follows Ethan Hunt, who is forced to track down the Syndicate, a network of highly skilled operatives who are dedicated to establishing a new world order. He and his team must also face the CIA, after the IMF is disbanded. The biggest problem I had with the movie was the use of exposition. Many of the scenes were just people talking to each other, and over-explaining the plot. This is something that frequently occurs in action movies, and is the biggest issue with the genre. What I enjoyed about films like Mad Max: Fury Road is that it knew it was an action movie, and didn't have a large amount of boring talking scenes, just action. I enjoyed the characters, even though they were very clichéd. My favorite character in the film was Simon Pegg's I thought he was the most unique, and was much easier to relate to than Ethan Hunt. I am glad he got more screen time in this film than in Ghost Protocol.<br/><br/>The thing that this film by far does the best is action. Everyone has now heard of Tom Cruise hanging on to a plane, but there were also many other fun action sequences I was glad they didn't spoil in the trailer. My favorite scene in the movie was the opera scene. I loved how we were discovering what was happening while it was happening. They realized the audience was smart enough that they didn't have to explain to us what was going on, something many action movies do. I also enjoyed the underwater sequence, even though it was very cheesy and over-the-top. I also tried and miserably failed to hold my breath along with Tom Cruise. The car/motorcycle chases were also fun.<br/><br/>I would not go to this film if you are expecting anything more than a good time. If you liked any of the other Mission:Impossible films, you will like this one. I thought it was done well, or at least could have been done a lot worse.<br/><br/>(This review was originally written on Movie Forums August 2nd 2015)"

"ringfire211","10","1","4","2 September 2015"," I didn't think they could top M:I - GHOST PROTOCOL.....
","Wow! What an exciting thrill ride this film was! I really did not expect this to top M:I - GHOST PROTOCOL, but I think it may have just done that. I'll need to see it again once it comes out on Blu-Ray to make a final verdict. But even if it hasn't surpassed GHOST PROTOCOL it's definitely as good as that film.<br/><br/>It's funny how this series started out a bit shaky (it was always a box office success but not always with the critics or even with me) but is now a very solid film franchise. The series really does seem to be getting better and better with each film. After M:I-3 (which seemed like J.J. Abrams was filming an episode of ALIAS for the big screen) I thought it was time to put this series to bed. But with Brad Bird's amazing revelation that was GHOST PROTOCOL and now with Christopher McQuarrie's (who he??) wildly inventive ROGUE NATION, this is a series that is really winning me over and I can't wait to see the next one (and I was never a fan of the film series - I was a fan of the TV series). If they keep up this quality they will be giving the Bond flicks a run for their money (I'm a huge Bond fan, you see).<br/><br/>I think making Simon Pegg an integral part of the team (which they did in GHOST PROTOCOL) was a stroke of genius - he and Cruise have fantastic chemistry! It was nice to see Ving Rhames back as Luther (after a cameo in GHOST PROTOCOL) and this beautiful newcomer Rebecca Ferguson is someone to keep an eye on (which surely isn't difficult to do). Sean Harris (someone who is new to me as well) plays the villain in a very understated yet creepy manner - I really liked him. I'll admit that the plot gets a bit confusing - too many twists and turns - but it somehow maintains a high level of suspense and you can't help but really be absorbed by it all. Just an all-around great spy thriller! Much has been said about the plane stunt but what really knocked my socks off was the motorcycle chase!! Wow!! It was one of the most insanely exciting things I've ever seen on the big screen! FAST & FURIOUS - eat your heart out! You'll just have to see it for yourselves to see what I mean.<br/><br/>I also cannot fail to mention an early (pre-SPECTRE) sighting of Blenheim Palace in this film - it's the scene of the charity auction where our guys confront the Prime Minister. I recognized it right away! I had seen it previously in 1999's ENTRAPMENT as the place where Connery and Zeta-Jones steal the mask. I look forward to seeing it again this fall in SPECTRE. It's the birthplace of Winston Churchill, you know? <br/><br/>Another scene that really stood out was the opera sequence in Vienna. There were shades of QUANTUM OF SOLACE but it was done so much better here in this film - everything from the atmosphere to the suspense to the inventive fights was first rate! By all means drop everything and get your pre-SPECTRE dosage of espionage action right now! You won't be disappointed! I sure wasn't."

","I've written and sold screenplays, love movies and am very easy to please. I quite enjoyed the new MI film. I can also suspend my disbelief with the best of them. But please  I love a good chase scene but they are just too unrealistic. I have owned two of the BMW S1000RR motorcycles featured in the film and there is no way any car is going to keep up with a modern sport bike for even a moment. Come on screenwriters, come up with something new. Make me and Steve McQueen believers again.<br/><br/>The film worked well, was well paced and Elsa stole the show. Last quip, at the end, they need our hero alive, and then start shooting at him?

","I've never really been a HUGE MI fan, yet saying that; I am a fan of Simon Pegg, and Jeremy Renner. Going into this movie I was expecting an alright movie that had great action, and a solid cast around it. However, I was pleasantly surprised to thoroughly enjoy this movie. The plot is well, like every other MI movie, impossible... or so it seems. Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) returns for yet another impossible mission. The IMF is under attack, and the members are being targeted... This movie is an exhilarating ride from start to finish, and it constantly keeps you entertained. Ghost Protocol was a fantastic film, but this to me; blew it out of the water. Renner, Pegg, Baldwin, Cruise, and Rebecca Ferguson round out an ""all star"" cast. All in all, this movie was worth my time, and I enjoyed the movie throughout. RATING: Well, as seen above; I would give this movie a 7.5, purely because I have never been a HUGE Mission Impossible fan, yet I did love this movie from a neutral viewpoint. AGE: I would say 12+, basically like every other MI movie in the series, and VERDICT: Good, fun movie, I recommend it to all!"
"georgecoffeynewyorker","9","1","4","21 August 2015"," Excellent Action flick.
","Well this film, was actually quite good. I had seen the previous Mission Impossible films and found them to be quite confusing plot wise and the technical aspects of it. However with this particular franchise, I found it quite easy to understand. The action was top notch, no question. I enjoyed it immensely especially with Plane scene at the beginning. Me with a fear of flying, I actually felt I was actually on the plane. So real it was. hahaah. My fav scene thou was with the Prime Minister(Hollander) and Atley(McBurney) when Atley's face was 3D Printed ontop Ethan Hunt's(Cruise) face. I thought that was class. When Prime Minster claims that Brandt's(Renner) hand is ""So warm"". We all got a great laugh. Brandt looks over at Atley/Hunt and hunter shows the face as much as to say deal with it. I thought it was class.<br/><br/>So now onto the plot. The plot as I says above quite simple. Ethan Hunt(Cruise) stumbles upon a group known as the Syndicate who has been described as: ""An Anti-IMF"",who's job is to take down the IMF and all that goes with it. It all starts off as I said above the plane scene. You'd wanna have a head for heights, no question. Anyways, Ethan gets onto the plane with the help of Ethan's buddy Benji(Pegg). Then afterwards a LOVELY score. It really was like a TV Series type as I actually learned of this lately. Hunley(Baldwin) wants to disband IMF competly and appears in a US Senate Committee. Classic line from Brandt is ""I can neither confirm nor deny any details without the permission of the Secretary"".He continuously states this when asked by the Committee. So a series of events occur. The Vienna Opera scene was a classic scene too. The Chancellor of Vienna is assassinated. I don't get the connection to it. They did explain the Istanbul and all the majors terrorist attacks. But that's about all I understood.<br/><br/>2D - Sound spectacular. Pls note there are no extra scenes BEFORE the credits or AFTER"

There's nothing new to it. And of course there's a lot of stroking Toms ego by making his character have almost,superhuman ability's. These movies has started more and more to revolve around Tom being this larger than life, super hero agent. And less and less about a TEAM of good agents,performing almost impossible tasks. The whole thing that tom is doing his own stunt though,I don't believe for a second.<br/><br/>The really sad part for me, was that by the 95 min mark I had figured out most of the plot. There were some interesting twist, and turns along the way. But mostly it was predictable<br/><br/>The dialogue leaves much to be desired,,and is very stilted and flat, at times. which I feel is much of Toms fault,cause his character is always the one who sees the big picture.

"Tanay_LKO","8","1","4","13 August 2015"," Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation - ""Once Again into the Frey...""
","The Mission Impossible film-series has got an interesting self-benchmarking style of delivering similar-like, partially predictable but highly engrossing, edge-of-seat action- thrillers.<br/><br/>The trend continues with the fifth installment of ""Rogue Nation"" – a virtually-existing terrorist congregation of mysteriously disappeared or disavowed secret-agents from all-over (called the ""Syndicate"") to bring down the powers of the free-world by executing highly- organized and well-timed acts of terror. At the same time, the ""Impossible Mission Force (IMF)"" is dissolved on grounds of indiscipline and unruliness by the CIA, unknown to the fact that the Syndicate is carefully conspiring to the organization all along. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team (Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson) strive to get matters under control in their most challenging assignment till day, and seem unstoppable and undefeatable in their endeavour; but so are the enemies. It does become scary and really 'impossible' this time. <br/><br/>The MI franchise have a comparatively distinguished take on espionage when compared with the James Bond franchise – a lot less sensuality-oriented and through-and-through spying format; though, it is also a lot lighter than the Jason Bourne franchise with a toned down rustic element, and at par action-sequences. Editing has always been a prime element with a fast-paced thriller and so is Sound Mixing. Fortunately, they're spot-on delivered by – Eddie Hamilton (""Kingsman: The Secret Service"", ""X-Men: First Class"") and Chris Munro (Academy Award winner for ""Gravity""), respectively. Cinematography (Robert Elswit; Academy Award winner for ""There Will Be Blood"") was diverse in shot-selections combining opulence and a rhythmic pace, and have made it fairly-bigger than the previous installment of MI. <br/><br/>Direction and Co-Screen writing by Christopher McQuarrie (Academy Award winner for screen- writing ""The Usual Suspects"") are mostly theme- based and carry a bit of a comical touch on intervals, making it a little more enjoyable amongst all the action and stunts, which were greatly enhanced by the Special-Effects (Jason McCameron; ""Gladiator"", ""Inception""). A few depicted stunts were already talk-of-the-town since pre-release, especially the opening sequence where Hunt is seen clinging to the door of an Airbus Atlas – been shot without any use of CGI (a faint reminder of his Burj Khalifa feat from ""Ghost Protocol"", though with VFx). The film is abundant with such gasping thrill-sequences and perhaps, seems to be a little too much to handle by mid-way; though, an action-aficionado won't complain and rather, have appetite for more.<br/><br/>""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" is indeed an appreciable attempt to deliver fresh-adrenalin into an era old film series, and Tom Cruise's portrayal as one of ""history's most recognized screen-spies"" is inspiring even for the fifth time. Watch it to feel that well-known, yet dormant thrill of an action flick (especially of a ""MI"")."

","The original 'Mission: Impossible' is a reasonably entertaining, if slightly dated, action flick, but the rest of the franchise has never done much for me, including the much ballyhooed 'Ghost Protocol'. But great critical buzz and strong recommendations from friends made me finally give in. I'm glad I did. Though it has a few minor problems, none are fatal, and, with irony duly noted, this fifth installment defies the odds to deliver its best and most entertaining installment yet.<br/><br/>Oh, and a note to Hollywood producers. Put Rebecca Ferguson in everything. Now."
"njb311","5","1","4","12 August 2015"," Character ""development"" isn't always a good thing
","I can see what they were trying to do. Ethan Hunt has always been the contradiction of a lone maverick with a team around him, and Benji, Simon Pegg's character, was definitely pushed to the front of the team this time. And therein lies the problem.<br/><br/>Much that Pegg can carry off his trademark ""a bit useless but with some funny lines and wins in the end by trying to overcome being useless"" in the many comedies he's acted out (Hot Fuzz being a notable deviation and possibly his best movie as a result), the problem is that seeing how all the highly trained operatives on all sides get routinely killed it is simply not credible that Benji would still be alive to take part in the story. And you certainly wouldn't want him on your team. His incompetence turns up in the first minute of the film and continues throughout, and really ruins what could otherwise have been a decent plot. This is, after all, the Mission Impossible franchise, not Johnny English.<br/><br/>Not to point the finger at Pegg of course, it takes a writer and director to think it was a good idea, he merely executed it and did so with ease, given it wasn't much of a departure from previous roles.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the rest of the cast was on good form. Cruise was Cruise (in a good way). Jeremy Renner and Rebecca Ferguson played impressively well, both having elements of deception to carry off which kept you wondering whose side they were really on. Ving Rhames felt a bit wooden, but then wasn't given much to do. However, Sean Harris was an excellent villain. And the casting of Tom Hollander as Prime Minister was amusing to fans of The Thick Of It or In The Loop.<br/><br/>Sure, there were gaffes too. Having BMW product placement meant that the characters were very conspicuous everywhere they went, which is hardly spy behaviour. And when Lane shoots inside a small sealed enclosure the glass magically absorbs the bullets instead of them ricocheting back and hitting him. And so on. But they're details.<br/><br/>This was going to be a 7-8* movie, and maybe for many it will be. But from the opening scene I had to watch with gritted teeth, so in the end it was only a 5 for me."

","Five movies in and the M:I franchise still cannot come up with an original plot. All of them are about rogue agents, as well as several Bond movies, and all of those dreary Bourne efforts. Rogue Nation is no exception here.<br/><br/>When the IMF is amalgamated into the regular CIA this leaves Ethan Hunt a wanted man without a country or any clue how to catch the latest bad guy. He meets his British sort-of counterpart when double-crossed in London and spends the rest of the movie catching up with her.<br/><br/>The female in question is Rebecca Ferguson who spends the entire movie doing ""duck face"" as it is apparently the only expression her face is capable of. You'll lose count of how many times she jumps up on people in order to subdue them. She and Cruise have ZERO chemistry as they work with and against each other while the plot doubles back on itself one too many times.<br/><br/>The main bad guy is an irritating bore, also incapable of any expression. He might as well be played by that creepy old man who lives down the road from you. It was genuinely uncomfortable whenever he was on screen. Not only that but the movie feels the need to have a secondary bad guy who looks virtually identical to him. Really bad casting there!<br/><br/>As with the other movies in the series the plot is just GARBAGE and you'll quickly lose track of it and just enjoy the action scenes for the mindless spectacle. The atmosphere is quite good however.<br/><br/>Five movies and five different directors and this franchise still cannot establish itself with a decent standalone plot. Ving Rhames and Tom Cruise have been the only consistent players from the start despite there being several marketable cast members to bring back and make the continuity between movies stronger (Maggie Q, Anthony Hopkins, Lawrence Fishburne, Thandie Newton). It feels like they have the formula backwards, the plot is always the same while the majority of the cast is always different. <br/><br/>I didn't mind M:I 5, but for me this franchise needs to take bigger and bolder steps and stop being about former/current agents gone bad. They also need to ditch Rebecca Ferguson who had less charisma than Jai Courtney on sedatives."
"alexgarcia732805","10","1","4","10 August 2015"," Is the hype worth it?--Smarter than average for this genre. An enjoyable and well made film.
","I had almost accepted the fact that it was too much to ask for a smart, funny, and action-packed movie these days. (I've been a bit disappointed with some recent blockbusters this year, which I enjoyed but know could've been better.) But I was thoroughly happy to be proved wrong when I saw Mission: Impossible--Rogue Nation. <br/><br/>**Tom Cruise gives his 100% as IMF agent Ethan Hunt--fully embracing the role and doing all the stunts. **Benji (Simon Pegg) is funny (didn't expect him to be playing CoD at work). He's juxtaposed well with the slightly cynical and weary Hunt, as he's more naive and not battle-hardened. **Rebecca Ferguson is convincing in her role--she's not frail or weak, she's athletic and actually sort of muscular. She's not overly sexualized, made a love interest, or a victim. <br/><br/>**We get an interesting character in Alec Baldwin's Alan Hunley, director of the CIA--who doesn't trust the IMF. Director Hunley has gravitas, and he has screen presence. You wonder whether or not he's helping the Syndicate. **The villain's motivation could've been better, and I can't even remember his name. **William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Luther (Ving Rhames) both needed more screen time. They were basically reduced to supporting characters. (If you ask me, that's unfair because Luther has been with the series since the beginning.)<br/><br/>The movie kicks off with a big stunt (apparently done by Cruise himself). Once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Chasing after a MacGuffin and the Syndicate leads Cruise from one location to another, with various members of his team showing up to assist along the way, and enemies on his trail. <br/><br/>If you want to be judgmental, nothing in 'Mission Impossible 5' is over-the-top or mindblowing (in terms of the script and action sequences), but the movie is better than most other films in both of those departments. The script and action scenes are smart, relying more on suspense than eye-candy. Director Christopher McQuarrie succeeds where most have struggled, in terms of balancing a decent script, action, comedy, and characters. The cinematography and editing is well done (as showcased in the Vienna opera scene). <br/><br/>I definitely wouldn't say that 'Rogue Nation' was too predictable or a bore. I really enjoyed myself when I watched the movie. Action, suspense, sharp dialogue (when I say 'sharp', I mean sharper than Ant-Man or Taken 3), and humor make the film a treat. The cast helps give the film a contagious and exhilarating energy. I honestly was surprised by some of the film's twists. (But it should be noted that I'm new to the franchise.) <br/><br/>I think ""Rogue Nation"" deserves a 10, and not because it's perfect. The villain wasn't as memorable or menacing as he could've been, some characters needed more screen time, and the film was a bit fast- paced in some parts. Nevertheless, it's the closest a 2015 action film has been to a 10 (at least for me). Director Christopher McQuarrie manages to make old tropes feel fun again, and balance a lot of components to make a great, enjoyable film. <br/><br/>I have reviewed 44 movies (on Metacritic and IMDb), some recent ones, including: Fantastic Four (2015), Ant-Man, Minions (Despicable Me spin-off), Avengers: Age of Ultron, Fast and Furious 7, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3, and more. I also review TV shows."

Admittedly, I'm a little disappointed that the main cast is such a sausage fest, but at least they worked off of each other well. A lot of scenarios got resolved in manners far too implausible to be credible (and anyone bringing up the title as a counter-argument will be punched) and the extent to which coincidence played into the success of their plans got a little tiring. But hey, it's Mission Impossible, so it's got enough action, intrigue, and rubber masks to keep me entertained.

","A mission which didn't seem as impossible as the earlier one which Ethan Hunt chose to accept. It is decent spy thriller which didn't have all the action which is usually found in the previous Mission: Impossible Films.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt hangs off an airplane to secure something the bad guys are trying to steal, that's how the Film started and this breath-taking stunt was too short to create any adrenaline and from there the story progresses moderately for a Mission: Impossible Film. Ethan Hunt and his acquaintances who would later join him eradicate a rouge Anti IMF agency so that IMF will be reinstated of its earlier status since it has been dissolved into the CIA as the result of their unorthodox ways to protect the nation. The Film in many ways is similar to Ghost Protocol: Start with a stunt, introduce the story, do another stunt for some file extraction and follow it up with a chase which ends up terribly for Ethan Hunt. Though with all these similarities it lacks in action and the adrenaline factor which Ghost Protocol had to offer.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie, a writer turned director's attempt at this critically and commercially rising film series is not one to be left unnoticed for it offers the class which the earlier Films in the series did not manage to deliver and this class swiftly covers up for its lack of action. The Film is Christopher's third attempt at directing and his second with Tom Cruise ( the first being Jack Reacher which I would strongly recommend if you are looking for a good crime thriller) this may not be his best film but his stylistic James Bond-like approach to this action-packed series gives the Film a fresh and new feel.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise hangs off an airplane and I think that's reason enough to watch his amply classy spy Thriller."

","Tom Cruise and newcomer Rebecca Ferguson bring their A-Game to this movie, their action sequences are explosive, enthralling and heart- pounding. This movie is well worth a watch but, and I'm afraid there is a but, it has, whether knowingly or not, adversely tweaked with the DNA from its previous instalment. They seem to have lost the gentle but hugely satisfying feeling brought about when a team of highly capable individuals work as a cohesive unit to accomplish their seemingly impossible task with a whole lot of charisma and style. And that's what is missing that would have brought a new level of suspense, reminding us why we love watching the IMF in action and which made Ghost Protocol such a success; think back to the Dubai hotel scene, India party server scene, even the opening prison break sequence, all of which was done with finesse, adding just the right amount of comedy and trademark Mission Impossible charm. As it is the huge talent of Jeremy Renner is relegated to a glorified bureaucrat who doesn't really contribute to or influence anything, Ving Rhames is there only to keep some sense of continuity in the IMF universe but thankfully Simon Pegg does add his usual unique blend of comedy / drama. <br/><br/>The only other let down was the way Christopher McQuarrie chose to use the now overly familiar face-masks to access a very high-profile target, the scene left a bit of distaste and felt like a cheap way to cheat their way through the story; now in its fifth movie most intelligence agencies would be aware of the existence of these masks and that there would surely by now be some sort of countermeasure in place to mitigate their threat. <br/><br/>Imagine bringing that old-school team charisma from the TV series and which Ghost Protocol had picked up, dial-down the Tom-Cruise show, combine that with Rogue Nation's expertly stitched together action sequences and that would be one fine sequel to look forward to; see I'm salivating already. You won't be let down by Rogue Nation, but it pains me to say it could so easily have been spectacular."

","Honestly action movie these days is so hard to find an actual good one especially the one that already exist , i'm talking about movie like A Good Day To Die Hard that totally garbage.<br/><br/>yet somehow someway Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation manage to maintain it's fun and unique action scene with Tom Cruise still being bad-ass with addition of new cool characters .<br/><br/>The script is okay it's not that great pretty linear and predictable but it's still fun movie even though main bad guy is kind a terrible , this is a movie that you should watch not only action movie fan but all of the movie fan."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","7","1","4","7 August 2015"," Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
","I don't know if it just me being over critical but lately, it seems to take a lot for me to be amazed at the cinema. Not saying the recent films I've seen are bad, far from it, but what is apparent, I'm not leaving the screen in awe. <br/><br/>Mission:Impossible - Rogue Nation is, unfortunately one of those films that fails to exceed those expectations left behind from the trailers and Ghost Protocol. All the ingredients of a typical M:I film are there, the elaborate plot and schemes with the usual gadgets and fast action however it just didn't feel well mixed. Action unbalance or too fast paced, I might be being greedy but I think the action scenes from M:I2 were more orchestrated, that being thanks to John Woo. <br/><br/>It was getting serious in parts and then back to Pegg for comic relief, then back to ""world is in terrible danger."" It tries to be too smart actually making the film surprisingly predictable, and even when the twists present themselves it's all been seen before. I think that's my main issue with the film, I felt it lack innovation that Ghost Protocol displayed. I think the fight scenes are better in GP than this one. <br/><br/>Sean Harris seems to ooze that evilness, and some might recognise him from Harry Brown and Creep. But his super villain just seems to be a cheap copy. He doesn't have that, ""oh no!, super bad ass"" presence and for someone who is suppose to be the head of the highly secretive syndicate that's suppose to be a myth, he gets about a lot. And every super villain has a sidekick or bodyguard but his one, again lacks the presence of a major bad ass. <br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson is a fine addition to the franchise and would like to see more of her *cough* on screen. But what happened to Renner and Rhames? There seemed to be more focus on Pegg in this one. No shame in that, but the only action we see Renner get, is a bit of running, and Rhames? Well, running isn't his strong point as the film demonstrates. <br/><br/>I know this seems quite negative but it was entertaining, the action was good and the bikes being a highlight. Worth a trip to the cinema, especially if you're a fan of the series but don't go in with high expectations."
"texshelters","5","1","4","7 August 2015"," MIRN is a tedious but passable action film if you don't need plot consistency
","Mission Impossible: Action packed swiss cheese.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation (MIRN) is action packed, mildly entertaining and pointless. The title is misleading. There is no ""Rogue Nation""; it's mainly one villain who is not badass enough to be a threat. Sure, he has henchmen, but nothing like Odd Job or Jaws. And the villain in no way matches the psychopathological heights of Silva (Javier Bardem) in Bond's Skyfall or the series of homicidal CIA section chiefs and handlers in the Bourne films. <br/><br/>The script is focused on action and not character. And certainly the writing is not too concerned with plot holes and inconsistencies. There is the requisite number of gadgets in the film, but when the gadgets would minimize the danger, somehow, there are none available. This is the risk in being gadget happy; they become a crutch and a substitute for character's abilities and the audience wonder why you just don't have a gadget for all situations. One thing the Bond films have done recently is minimized the gadgets and they always told you in the beginning of the films what they had on hand so you weren't left wondering later whey Bond didn't just pull one out on call. <br/><br/>Cruise passes as an action hero but not as an actor. He brings the film down, and the script doesn't help. The airplane action scene in the trailer seen countless times is interesting, but it doesn't compare to climbing the outside of the building in Dubai in the previous MI film. Seeing it in the trailer over and over drained the scene of its surprise and it became passé. ""Oh, this scene again ho hum.""<br/><br/>The plot is full of holes and makes little sense. Yes, it's action, but it's still a film and should hold together as a coherent piece. Mission Impossible is based on a TV show, and thus has little direction. Bond and Bourne films are based on books, thus giving them more depth. <br/><br/>The film create a flimsy world where we constantly see the man behind the curtain, and it isn't attached to the real world. There is no semblance that Hunt is connected to the real world at all, or that his actions will save anyone but himself. Most of us want our heroes to be rebels who fight for something bigger than themselves. Hunt has no sense of irony here, no awareness that he is part of the machine he rages against. <br/><br/>The camera is too stagnant during the action scenes as if close ups or pans would destroy the shots. Certainly, there was a trend of hyper-editing in action films for awhile. However, editing is a way to make films intimate, get us closer to the characters, help us see the action from their point of view. The choices of camera angles and editing were mundane and uninteresting. <br/><br/>The acting was pedestrian and the writers and director underused Renner, the best actor in the film. Pegg was adequate, and this isn't his best genre. Ferguson plays an MI6 agent who is not just a pretty face like so many other female cops and agents who appear they couldn't beat up a six-year-old, let alone a villain. She pulls of the physicality and acquits herself well, better than Cruise. <br/><br/>Sean Harris plays the 'dangerous' Solomon Lane, super villain. He doesn't pull it off, whether because he is miscast or because of the writing. The villainous plot elements were poorly scripted and tedious, and few actors could have come out of MIRN winning any awards. <br/><br/>Rating: Matinée<br/><br/>There is just enough action in MIRN to pull off a passable film. There are also a few surprises and an ending that allows one to forgive some of the predictability and tedium of the film. But it's not great. Peace, Tex Shelters"
"karritiku","6","1","4","7 August 2015"," Disappointment!!!!
","This movie was touted to be the best of the franchise. It came nowhere close to the original in terms of suspense. Cruise continues to do death defying stunts which is the major attraction. But Jeremy Renner not involved in a single action sequence adds to the disappointment. The movie has many slow moments which is new to the franchise. The less we talk about the climax, the better. Definitely MI:2 is better than this awful sequel which is getting praised. Being a cruise fan, I hope that the next sequel be as good as Ghost Protocol. The movie was predictable with no twists and the female lead's character could have been a tad bit simpler."

The twists & turns are interesting, while the action is the highpoint of the enterprise. McQuarrie's Direction is stylish. Robert Elswit's Cinematography captures the stunning locales, beautifully. Eddie Hamilton's Editing is razor-sharp. Joe Kraemer's Score is first-class. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt & he delivers a strong central performance. At 53, the Superstar still appears unstoppable! Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg & Ving Rhames reprise their parts & they are perfect, yet again! Rebecca Ferguson is tough & hot. Alec Baldwin is first-rate.

"supatube","7","1","4","6 August 2015"," Outrageous action mixed with thrilling tension as the spy threat goes global.
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back in that impossible mission yet again and they've upped the thrill with a pace to match modern standards. As the IMF dissolves a Syndicate emerges as a threat to the agents themselves. So Ethan goes (sort of) undercover-rogue-agent to catch the real rogue agents. <br/><br/>Honestly, something about this setup lost me to the point where I had no idea who the bad guy was and what the mission was really about. I cannot compare this film to the first film, as that film has to be one of the finest spy films to ever have been made. This is an action packed, entertaining thrill ride. It does not have the intensity of the first film and relied heavily on blowing our minds with effects and the possibilities of pulling them off in real life. Hanging onto a plane during take off really sets the tone for the ridiculous nature of all the action sequences to come. But hey, that's action. Perhaps the biggest growth in the series is the action. The first film packed more espionage and mystery to create these memorably tense moments, which is now replaced with fast paced and non-stop action. MI fans will love it. Action fans too. But for the espionage fans, this may very well become silly very quickly maybe.<br/><br/>This is Universal's thing though, big budgets, big actors, big sets for big rewards. The focus is not on the art but the entertainment and just like most of their 2015 releases it will prove to be a box office smash even if it will never last the test of time. As much as film is art, there should be an appreciation for the intensity of fast paced entertainment.<br/><br/>I admire Christopher McQaurrie's writing as he has a great way of twisting a story never give anything away yet at the same time making the plot unfold naturally. His direction is not always as on point as his writing is. The beginning was not clear enough but as the story unfolds the mystery drags one in but does explode with a finale bordering on cheese pie. Perhaps it's the humour, hilarious at points yet tension busting at others.<br/><br/>What it all boils down to is a fine evening of thrilling entertainment without much to really boggle the mind."

","Ethan is running through a hall way and the evil men can't hit Ethan 27 feet away using automatic rifles. Just like Skyfall (2012) ""they know how we operate"" their identities aren't a secret, and villain doesn't kill the main character. This movie rips off The Dark Knight Rises, Skyfall, Bourne Ultimatum, Bourne Supremacy, Quantum of Solace, and The Dark Knight. Ethan find the villain/s in Germany in an Opera like James Bond does in Quantum of Solace. LoL when the car blows up the suitcase is inside the car not under it and the car jumps up like a dog so funny. A woman stands in Ethan's way when he's going fast on a motor cycle and he tries to avoid hitting her and ends up in a crash. LoL the woman in Casino Royale was tied up in the middle of road. Ethan is unharmed be the car flipping over and over and then still isn't injured when he crashed on a motor cycle crash in which he should have died 3 times. I wrote the sentence about him not being injured before I saw if he actually was injured and I was correct, which proves how predictable this movie is."
"jcallows","7","1","4","4 August 2015"," disavowed again?
","Wash, rinse, repeat. I thought finally this time they'll come up with a story that's a bit more original than the previous four but it didn't happen. If you've seen the first four, you've already seen this one. You can literally just skip to the chase, or rather, the actions scenes, and you've pretty much seen all that's different in this movie from the others. <br/><br/>To be sure, the action scenes were great, but outside of that, the movie was slow and dull. This film nearly matches the second as the worst of the series. Interestingly, it was the second that had the most original plot and yet it was the worst of the series. Perhaps that's why they didn't want to come up with anything original anymore. <br/><br/>Part five started out promising with a credits intro that was reminiscent of the first and the original TV series and an exciting action sequence to boot but it eventually delved into the very familiar. Keeping a few familiar elements from the first film and TV series makes sense, but do you have to recycle the entire plot? Another NOC list, another betrayal, the IMF is disavowed yet again, etc. <br/><br/>The IMF, like the Avengers, is actually causing more problems than they solve. It seems we'd be better off if they didn't exist and I don't think that's the kind of message the filmmakers are trying to send. Perhaps in the next film the writers could come up with a problem that wasn't caused by the IMF themselves. At least it would be more original.<br/><br/>Recycled plot aside, this film just seemed slow and uninteresting, despite some spectacular stunts. There was little chemistry among the IMF members and no reason why any of them would care about Ethan at all. And Jeremy Renner, and the other returning actors, were generally unnecessary. It could've been, and probably should've been, other actors playing Ethan's teammates. Because when you see key familiar faces returning, you expect them to do more this time. You expect their characters to grow. But that didn't happen. It was still the Tom Cruise show.<br/><br/>I'm curious what they'll do with the number six. Perhaps the sixth time will be the charm."

The new added nemesis, and a counter organization added new twists which made the Hunt character look vulnerable. Deception, adaptation, and manipulation were the counter themes which made the Hunt character and his crew shine and created a story with plot twists making the viewer wanting more.

Has all the bits from the 'should you choose this mission', 3D mask to infiltrating the uninfiltratable building (gosh that's a major tongue twister), a high speed chase, a hot assassin lady to double crossing agents. I quite like that they stuck with an orchestra and did not random pick popular songs as background music.

"aharmas","10","1","4","2 August 2015"," Entertaining, Very Smart, and Thrilling
","One of the problems with the earliest Mission Impossible movies was that they appear to be too smart for their own good, and even when we liked the gimmicks and the car chases, we felt like we left out of the party. It was like they were just too good to let us in. When we watch thrillers, part of the excitement is that we sometimes know a crucial piece of information that the hero doesn't know, and we wish we could be there to help him out. ""Mission Impossible"" pushes the set up even further when we are part of the thrills, riding along, enjoying every turn, guessing like the heroes, wondering who or what is real? Where is the next double crossing coming from? It's so good that we welcome the most overused trick in the series when it finally shows up because the ride has been amazing so far, and in order to make this entry work, we need to recharge Ethan's batteries, and we have to give him a suitable new partner who is as challenging as enticing, and why not put everyone in jeopardy with a villain who is not afraid to dispose of anyone whether they are being useful or not, if the situation requires.<br/><br/>Once again, our favorite group of spies or agents are out loose and without much of the support they need, exposed to the enemy and classified as unwanted by their own boss. Things become even more convoluted when a group known as The Syndicate makes an appearance, and the question is whether this association is a real or a rumor. There is however, no time to waste because if the group is real, the consequences will be enormous.<br/><br/>In comes a lethal new female agent whose loyalties are not clear at the beginning, as she as alluring as cobra with the complication that she also is able to cast quite a spell on Ethan and the audience. We want to see more of her regardless of who she's working with, and the part demands an actress who is beautiful, attractive, capable of doing some complicated physical work, and who can project intelligence to the point that we know she is at the top of her game in addition giving her character enough mystery to make us wonder what her game really is.<br/><br/>So we follow both friend and foe, and our mystery lady throughout the world, with some incredible action pieces in London, Morocco, Vienna, and more. We never really know how things will turn out, but we get the full package, as Ethan has to endure some precarious turns inside a water tank, one very deathly motorcycle race, and a rather devious challenge in the last scenes of the film. To keep things even more interesting, there's an element of fun, and we see the different agents wink at us, or just give us a quick glance to suggest things could go just about every possible way, except the one we usually are dealt in this type of films.<br/><br/>As I said before, no one will be disappointed by any of the action, and the actors are certainly in fine shape here, but the glue that holds everything together is the very clever script that keeps the action flowing non-stop, and adds much intelligence to a film that is about intelligence because in order to survive in this universe, you need to have courage and brains, and the ability to use your talents both with some careful planning, and being able to see the immediate and the whole picture. <br/><br/>The film definitely pumps much needed energy back into a franchise that could have ended with the last film. It raises the expectations of the audience which makes the next challenge something to look forward to. Whatever happens, here is the formula, so study it, admire it, and most certainly, enjoy it."
"filmfan1991","Null","1","4","1 August 2015"," The best M:I film yet
","Out of all the films that have come out this summer ""Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation"" has been the most hyped up film and early reviews by professional critics have said that this is a great film and the best to come out since the franchise's resurgence. Being a fan since I saw the first film when I was younger, it's easy to be skeptical that the film is really over-hyped and not as great as they make it out to be. Fortunately, I went into the film opening day with high expectations and got exactly what I wanted and more. I can safely say that ""M:I Rogue Nation"" is the best installment out of the entire ""M:I"" series to date and even better than ""Ghost Protocol""!<br/><br/>Watching this film from the get go you know that this will be an intense and fun ride when the film opens up with one of the most hyped up images this summer of Tom Cruise hanging for dear life outside of an airplane. Watching that scene is heart pounding and intense especially knowing that once again Cruise performed that impossible stunt himself. (No pun intended) The guy can do no wrong when it comes to performing his own stunt work. But that is only the tip of what's to come as there are many other action sequences that employ excellent stunt work that live up to the franchise name of ""Impossible""; each of which are high octane action. <br/><br/>In this film Ethan Hunt is tracking down the mysterious Syndicate and its leader Solomon Lane played by Sean Harris. Meanwhile, the CIA is questioning Ethan's sanity and his motives and whether or not the IMF should be permanently disavowed. Throughout the film, Ethan is working with Ilsa Faust played brilliantly by Rebecca Ferguson who we don't know if she is on Ethan's side or not and has ulterior motives. Most of the cast from the previous film reprise their roles along with Ving Rhames as Luther from the first three films. Simon Pegg is back and he has a much bigger role this time and his comic timing is great as always. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames share some great scenes together to bridge the gap between the old vs the new.<br/><br/>What even makes this film better than ""Ghost Protocol"" is the villain Solomon Lane. In ""Ghost Protocol"", we had Cobalt who had very little screen time or depth and was a very generic villain. But in ""Rogue Nation"", we have Solomon Lane who is very menacing, intimidating, has dimension to his character and is performed excellently by Harris. (A hero is not as good without a good villain.)<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie's direction in this film combines suspenseful spy thriller with high octane on-the-edge-of-your-seat action scenes.<br/><br/>I had a fun time with this film and is not only the best ""M:I"" film yet but one of the best films of 2015. 10/10 See it!"

","Much of ""Mission: Impossible- Rogue Nation"" feels familiar – not so familiar as to seem stale, but naggingly familiar. One could probably splice together a reasonable approximation of most of the film from the four prior films in the franchise, with a few scenes borrowed from ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Kill Bill II,"" the latest of the three adaptations of ""Casino Royale,"" ""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Skyfall."" <br/><br/>The four prior films offered some really fresh material, such as the rock climbing sequence, the Porsche/Audi collision in M:I2 and destroying much of the Kremlin. The rear projection virtual reality gambit inside the Kremlin was innovative, as was scaling the Burj Khalifa. The centerpiece scene in this movie involves Ethan Hunt hanging on for dear life to a cargo plane as it takes off, but Schwarzenegger and Stallone have done it before in ""Eraser"" and ""Rambo,"" and did it much better. For that matter, the concept is not much different than the bullet train sequence in the first MI film. Although, to be fair, Ethan Hunt voluntarily leaps into dangerous situations, whereas Kruger and Rambo found themselves unexpectedly hanging onto airplanes in flight. <br/><br/>Much of the plot resembles an amalgam of ""Ghost Protocol"" and ""Skyfall."" Alec Baldwin seems to be reprising his role from ""Mercury Rising,"" then morphs into Ralph Fiennes's Gareth Mallory character from ""Skyfall"" Rebecca Ferguson seems like a dark-haired Kara (Ronda Rousey) from ""Furious 7."" Once again, they must steal data from an extraordinarily secure computer system using only athletic prowess. <br/><br/>Some of the plotting seems a bit lazy and contrived. There is a flash drive that requires multiple levels of authorization to access its data, but the data can be altered with a cell phone without even plugging the drive into a computer or other power source. Somebody must dive without aqualungs to evade a metal detector, so must hold their breath for three minutes, but nobody considers the possibility of taking a couple of balloons filled with oxygen. A politician refuses to authorize a program, but nevertheless provides essential passwords. <br/><br/>There are so many BMW automobiles and motorcycles that the movie feels like a BMW commercial at points. There's a point where product placements become intrusive and distracting. The winks to ""Casablanca"" are also a bit obvious. <br/><br/>This installment doesn't feel quite as glamorous. They travel to exotic locations, but much of the time is spent in dingy rooms and back alleys. <br/><br/>This is not to say MIRN is not enjoyable. It has a reasonably intelligent plot and more action than five average films. But prior films in the franchise always seemed to raise the bar. This installment feels as if they've dropped the bar a notch or two and are playing it safe. It's good, but not as good as the earlier films in the franchise."
"LloydBayer","7","1","5","27 August 2015"," Nothing is ever impossible in a Mission Impossible film.
","Industry pundits are gob smacked and they have every reason to be. What started as an over the top action spectacle has turned into a refined espionage thriller, albeit still a tall tale, but close on the heels of recent Bond films. Now in its fifth installment, and 20 years later, the Mission Impossible franchise has finally found its niche by almost entirely abandoning the cheese.<br/><br/>In some ways, Rogue Nation could also have the edge over Daniel's Craig's Bond flicks when considering the latter's tradition for forced romance and prototype gadgetry. None of that here, and thankfully, no time inflating fillers either. That said, there isn't much of a story either and John Le Carre fans will eat through the plot before you can say ""I spy"". Instead, Rogue Nation offers the best thrills in the series where the ride has prominence over the destination. For now, all you need to know is that the IMF has found its diabolical equal in The Syndicate, a shadow organization responsible for orchestrating devastating geo-political terror attacks around the world. But just when Ethan Hunt discovers their leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), CIA director Hunley (Alec Baldwin) disbands the IMF, citing unorthodox engagement tactics. Working from the shadows, and double crossed by double agents, Hunt does what he does best – a series of impossible missions that leaves us breathless.<br/><br/>Reprising his role as Hunt, it would only be half-truth to say that Rogue Nation is all Tom Cruise. But with Cruise actually performing his own stunts, it's fair to say that the success of this film emanates from his unmatched delivery as an aging action hero. Unless Cruise is nourished from a secret fountain of youth, doing all that he does at the age of 53 is in itself an incredible feat and worth the price of admittance. The other half emanates from insane white-knuckle action paused only by Hitchcockian moments of suspense. Flanking adrenaline packed car and bike chases are two nail biting scenes – one takes place above the stage of a Viennese opera and the second in an underwater vault which appears to be shot in one take. Both scenes are insanely pulse pounding and precisely why this installment is the best in the series.<br/><br/>That casting takes a backseat could be a dent in the overall making of this film. Although Simon Pegg is back for comic relief and he delivers, Jeremy Renner's inclusion serves no purpose at any point during the plot. Additionally, Harris as the villain is more annoying than threatening, and visibly weak in comparison to Philip Seymour-Hofmann's mesmerising delivery in Mission Impossible III.

","Really good action movie, shot in beautiful locations, with a funny sidekick (Simon Pegg), one really nasty son of a b___ as a villain (Sean Harris) and a stunning, gorgeous female agent (Rebecca Ferguson). In short, it had all the ingredients for a great film, and that's what it is. I got my money's worth and more besides. Much better film than the silly Man from Uncle. I'm amazed how Cruise can still perform such physically demanding roles at his age, he must be super fit. Alec Baldwin is also very effective as the CIA boss; the part seems tailor made for him. The car and motorbike chases are exciting and very well handled. Of course it's all far fetched nonsense, but this is escapism. Go and watch it."

","Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation has gotta be the best Mission Impossible movie ever. Maybe next to Ghost Protocol. I mean it was super awesome and amazing!

The only downside is that the story is a little bit confusing but it is understandable. Overall it's still an awesome movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is amazing!

","I haven't seen any of the other MI episodes, so I went into this cold. Some friends chose this movie. I was very surprised. I know that the technical aspects of these films is phenomenal and there are going to be gratuitous chase scenes and weapons firing non- stop. Also, since it is Mission Impossible, an impossible situation arises and not only must they fight the bad guy(s), they are considered the bad guys. Alec Baldwin weights in with his power hungry smugness and makes a great foil for Cruise and the gang. Obviously, a good deal of the film is about trust and dependence on your colleagues, and at times we are thrown enough red herrings to feed a Norwegian convention. Once can't, of course, get too critical, because there are so many events that depend on the most incredible fortune to come together. That motorcycle chase is marvelous, but so dangerous that the entire house could have crumbled in a second. Anyway, I look forward to retracing the ""canon."""

","The Mission: Impossible films have been going since the 1990s, with mostly positive results, and this fifth instalment in the series certainly looked like it could be another enjoyable experience, directed by Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher). Basically IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is convinced he can prove the existence of international criminal organisation the Syndicate, but before he gets his next orders he gets captured by them, but with the help of disavowed MI6 agent and Syndicate operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) he escapes torture by Syndicate member Janik ""Bone Doctor"" Vinter (Jens Hultén). Meanwhile CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), with IMF agent William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) before a Senate oversight committee, succeeds in having the IMF disbanded and absorbed into the CIA, meaning Ethan is cut off and is to be captured, but he is still following his only lead, a blond man in glasses, later identified as Solomon Lane (Creep's Sean Harris). Six months pass, Ethan is still on the run, he enlists the help of former colleague Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to help find the Syndicate, the plan is to search for Lane at opera Turandot in Vienna, there Ethan spots two shooters, one being Isla, to stop both succeeding in an assassination of the Austrian Chancellor in the royal box, Ethan shoots and causes a flesh wound, but despite this the Chancellor is killed by a bomb. Brandt recruits former agent Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) to find Ethan and stop Hunley's team killing him, together they track Ethan, Benji and Isla to Morocco, where the three are infiltrating a secure underwater server beneath a power station, there is a complex security system that they need to crack in order to take out a ledger containing the names of all Syndicate agents, seemingly impossible. After successfully retrieving the drive Isla and a chase ensues in vehicles and on motorcycles, involving Ethan, his team, Syndicate members and Isla, but it is revealed Benji has already made a copy of all the data they require. Isla returns to London attempting to pass the file to her handler Atlee (Simon McBurney), he compels her to return to the Syndicate to complete her mission, she returns to Lane, but Atlee wiped the drive, in fact it contained an encrypted British-government ""red box"", there is now only person with the biometrics to unlock it, the British Prime Minister (Tom Hollander). The former IMF agents confront Isla, but she is abducted by Lane's men, he wants a decrypted copy of the drive, despite objection by the others, Ethan knows Lane will always have a plan to acquire the files, he is sure the only way to stop Lane is confronting him, Ethan agrees to the ultimatum. Brandt contacts Hunley to reveal their location, at a charity event they try to stop Ethan getting to the Prime Minister, the leader is taken to a secure room with Atlee, under scrutiny the Prime Minister confirms the existence of the Syndicate, as a classified project to perform missions without oversight, he said he had ordered the project to be cancelled before leaving the planning stages, as he considered it too extreme, following this confirmation, Ethan reveals himself, being disguised as Atlee. The real Atlee arrives, drugged he admits covering up the existence of the Syndicate, since Lane hijacked it the project and it went rogue (the Rogue Nation of the title), then the Prime Minister's DNA is used to unlock the file, Stickell confirms it is billions of dollars in currency. Ethan meets Isla in a public place, Benji is joining them with an explosive device strapped to his chest, Lane through Benji tells that he will kill Ethan's friend and many others unless he exchanges the file, but it has been destroyed, and Ethan has memorised the data to access the many accounts, he will give him all the codes if Benji and Isla are released. Benji is let go and escapes back to Stickell and Brandt, while Ethan and Isla are chased by Vinter and his men in the streets of London, in a knife fight Isla kills Vinter, while Ethan lures Lane to chase him into a tunnel system, in moments revealed a bulletproof cell where he is gassed and he is taken into custody. In the end Hunley and Brandt return to the oversight committee, the IMF is secured to be reinstated, Hunley makes claims that the efforts to have it disbanded were part of the undercover mission to help Ethan expose the Syndicate, the committee are sceptical, but this is approved, and Hunley refers to Brandt as a ""secretary"". Also starring Jingchu Zhang as Lauren and America Olivo as Turandot. Cruise proves himself as the action man once again, getting involved in many of his own stunts, best of all being when he hangs on the outside of a flying plane, Ferguson is likable as the two-sided agent, Pegg adds the needed comic relief to the right scenes, Harris makes a great menacing villain, and the supporting cast including Baldwin and Renner gets their moments too. The story is relatively easy to follow, there are very gripping scenes, especially the seemingly impossible mission in the process, there are exciting chase sequences and well executed special effects and stunts, it is a great enjoyable action spy thriller. Very good!"

","Dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb Dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb Der-der-der----Der-der-der----Der-der-der-Tur-ner <br/><br/>No way is this latest installment dumb . Is there even any doubt? All the usual M:I narrative elements are here, but they are remixed and served up with renewed vigor. Yes, I choose to accept this mission.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation doesn't pretend to be what it set out to be - a solid espionage entertainer and nothing more. It doesn't re-invent the wheel, not that it wants to. Going into the cinema I know exactly what I will see - lots of chasing, driving, fighting, shooting, gadget-ing, disguising, double-crossing, triple-crossing, death-defying stunts and that indispensable ""let's go to the fortress and get that thing"" scene. We get them all here in the 5th entry helmed by Christopher McQuarrie. Kudos to McQuarrie for changing it up so well that it never feels like an old dish.<br/><br/>IMHO there are a few reasons why this is still a winner. First off is definitely Tom Cruise's winsome charisma. At 53 he still doesn't want to act his age. He runs shirtless at one point and insists on doing his own stunts. That's really him hanging outside an airplane at 1500 feet. I read he did that 8 times! Give him da money!! This new entry also continues the recent tone. Gone is that over-emphasis on realism and over-reliance on relevance, in comes a little over the top goofiness. I must confess I laughed out loud the most in Rogue Nation. The camaraderie and chemistry between all the veteran cast is outstanding. It feels like every character here is born to do one thing superbly well and they all have great lines to shine. Also outstanding is a superb supporting turn by a visually arresting Rebecca Ferguson, who more than holds her own in the physical scenes.<br/><br/>The action scenes are amazingly shot and totally thrust me into the action. I abhor motorcycle stunts but I changed my mind about that after seeing how they were so viscerally shot here. There are some magnificently choreographed sequences here and I enjoyed the assassination at the Vienna Opera scene. The action draws counterpoint from the ongoing opera and there are so many captivating elements in play, including Ferguson in a stunning yellow gown... Oh-la-la <br/><br/>Perhaps the only weak spot for me is the villain who didn't get a lot of screen time to cement his villainy. It certainly didn't help matters with the IMF team talking long expositions of him in the third person. Everything else works marvelously well.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation may be the fifth outing but the franchise continues to feel pumped and alive. I love how every entry is directed by a different filmmaker who has his own take. All the M:I films are a great way to illustrate how do you up the ante with the same narrative ingredients stirred up in a different way. Apparently there are many ways to serve up the same dish. Bring on part 6 please (before Tom Cruise's joints start to ache). Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is one of the best action movies I have seen this year."

","Rogue Nation sees Tom Cruise return, once again, as master spy extraordinaire Ethan Hunt. This time he's hunting the Syndicate, an international terrorist organization set on tearing down the modern society and building something new upon its ashes. Unfortunately, not even some of his allies believe that this organization even exists.<br/><br/>The film continues to build upon the good things set up in its predecessors. It always feels like the stakes are just a bit higher, the cost of failure even harder to pay. But it's a slow enough ramp-up that we're nowhere close it being ludicrous yet. Suffice to say, I heavily enjoy Cruise in his role. I also really like Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner as his colleagues, and it was nice to see Ving Rhames return in a more substantial role.<br/><br/>As for the new actors, there are two worth mentioning. Sean Harris as Solomon Lane and Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust. Harris's Lane is a tough contender for the best villain in the franchise, while Ferguson's Ilsa is just about the best thing in general in the franchise. Tough, no-nonsense spy, who's one of the few people that seem to be able to keep up with Hunt without much difficulty. It's fascinating seeing them work off one another. Luckily she returns in Fallout, because it would have been a real shame to lose her.<br/><br/>That being said, I do miss the locations and the exotic tone of Ghost Protocol. Every single scene and each location in that film was iconic, which is unfortunately not something this film can say. It's still very good, but not masterful. Granted, the opera house scene is superb, but after that they get a lot duller. The action still works and the characters are amazing, it's simply that the locations aren't as memorable.<br/><br/>Still, I'd say this easily qualifies as the second best film in the franchise. It's no Ghost Protocol, but then again, few things are."

","It is unbelievable how the time flies and now I am watching the fifth part of Mission Impossible. This is one of those franchises that tries and succeeds in improving the experiences in every movie. With it being said I am taking a bit of a pause still remembering the opening sequence that topped everything that we have seen before.<br/><br/>After the mind-blowing scene, the pace allows us to wrap our head around the plot and understand a new rogue threat that is standing on the way of peaceful existence. Love the old-school game of setting up the agents and playing hide and seek with authorities. Through this sneaky game we get to see that IMF has its nets set up almost everywhere that gives an impression of omnipotence of the agency.<br/><br/>I undoubtedly adore the decisions of Christopher McQuarrie who so generously presented us with a ton of beautiful shots that charm and boost the piquancy of the scenes. The chase after the villain glues together like a beautiful paper model that is very fragile and has to be treated very carefully. This multi-act story keeps jumping from one place to another bringing one of the most intense scenes of Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>The movie is just packed with action: if everything was put back to back than a vertigo would be a guaranteed outcome. However, the creators did their best to provide safe but exiting ride for you. With the old characters involved the feeling of nostalgia exults but then we get a few new faces as Rebecca Ferguson that stuns with both beauty and skill set; Sean Harris in his turn delivers cold and prudent approach to a masterplan while using his unforgettable voice.<br/><br/>Not denying and certainly confirming my feelings, I will say that to my mind this part stays on the top of IMF adventures and shows other spy-action movies how it should be done. Definitely after such an impression I will wait for the next fantastic thing that Tom Cruise will think of and lets wish him luck in this phenomenal feat of bringing unbelievable realism to a viewer."

"stephenabell","8","0","1","30 January 2018"," An ActionFest Flick - Shame The Story Wasn't As Good As The Stunts...
","This is an all-out actionfest. Right from the opening you've got Cruise (Ethan Hunt) holding onto the side of an aeroplane as it takes off - Bloody Nutter! This in most films would be the top stunt; this, of course, is MI so it's just your opening salvo of insaneness.<br/><br/>It's the story which kinda lets it down. These have now become secondary to the stunts, which I have to say are superb - and not too much CGI (except for the tech stuff, that is). Here you have a secret organisation called The Syndicate (nope they don't rig the lottery). But as ""syndicate"" describes a group working towards an aim, then the name is wrong as it turns out to be one man controlling his own mercenary army. I think there would have been great scope had it actually been a syndicate with many heads like the hydra.<br/><br/>There are a couple of holes in the story though they are minor... except for the ending... just how did the bad guy NOT think the scenario would turn out this way. Bit of a let down as he'd been ahead of Hunt and his team all through the film. In fact, the way Lane (Sean Harris) manipulates people is pretty awesome and is a good plot builder and twist creator. It's this element that keeps the story interesting. But in the end, Hunt has to overcome... it's just a shame that the ending wasn't as twist orientated as the rest of the story.<br/><br/>I cannot fault the direction or the pace of the film, as McQuarrie, gives the audience an atmospheric and excitement filled rollercoaster ride of a movie. He is great at filming the fight scenes and chases as well as the drama set-up acting scenes. For example the car and bike chase between Hunt and Ilsa Faust (Ferguson). When Hunt's car crashes he slows down the action to build tension... and then to build to a comical end to that scene, before revving up the torque to near maximum for the rest of the chase.<br/><br/>In fact, it's Rebecca Ferguson (Faust) that adds Kudos to the cast. She gives a fantastic performance as a strong-minded and deadly woman who happens to be beautiful and sexy to boot. She even has an air of secrecy and mystery to her. You are never too sure about her or her motives. This in some way is told by the story but a lot of it comes from Ferguson's portrayal of Faust. This is one actress to watch. She and her character really made this film for me. It's nice to have a new strong character as we've gotten used to the others. And to be honest when I see Cruise, Penn, Rhames, Renner and Baldwin I actually see them and not their characters as throughout the years they've become partially stereotyped. Which is a shame as it's this that lets the film down slightly. At least in MI III, the writers tried to give Ethan Hunt a deeper character, one with issues and problems - shame they didn't progress down that line.<br/><br/>I would happily recommend this to all lovers of Mission Impossible and action films alike. There's not much you have to do as a viewer except sit back and enjoy... hopefully you'll make it to the edge of your seat a couple of times."

","There are big action sequences here, each lasting around ten minutes more or less, and they are all high-octane thrill-rides that never let up and make this such an entertaining film.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise proves once again that he's a blockbuster star like no other, giving his all in the action here, whether it's attaching himself to a plane, jumping in a chasm of water or riding a superbike through the desert (in what was, in my opinion, the greatest, most exhilarating car chase ever).<br/><br/>On that note, actually, the incredible bike chase is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the great action, but credit has to go to director Christopher McQuarrie for excellently turning this into a good-looking and intense action thriller, using great camera work (avoiding shaky cam) to make it so brilliantly entertaining.<br/><br/>Away from the stunts, this film has still got a very good plot to it. There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish.<br/><br/>There are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be properly engrossed in the current story.<br/><br/>Finally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes that this is set in all over the world. <br/><br/>From the mesmerising desert of Morocco to the foggy alleys of London, this is a global journey that goes even further than the previous films, and comes out with a stunning result, the best of the series in my opinion!"

The characters in this movie are okay, and Rebecca Ferguson delivers plenty of excitement and anticipation as Ilsa Faust, the mysterious new femme fatale whose motivations are never clear to the audience. The movie's main antagonist, however, is horrible and underdeveloped, and his motivations are never exactly clear. Why does he want to destroy the IMF? Is it because of the money?

","The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is that the overall emotional concept is a bit scattered. It's such a big team that the central character's personal stakes are not all that riveting. It's sort of a romantic tease for things to possibly come for Ethan though, so the fun factor overrides any lack of emotional angst.<br/><br/>The theme is very interesting & very clear, though words are seldom used to convey it: loyalty can be fickle.<br/><br/>Such a theme lends to great twists & turns. EVERY single character (except one minor bad guy) flipflops at least once in their loyalties (or seems to). It's a very complex roller-coaster that provides a really fun, knucklebiting ride as betrayals are followed by victories which are then undone by more betrayals, etc. <br/><br/>After several viewing it never gets boring.<br/><br/>This is how an action film should be. Well done. Definitely my favorite in an ever improving series, which is rare. The biggest dud in the series is the first film, which in its time was a wonderful breakthrough & still very watchable despite a very slower pacing.<br/><br/>The trademark alternative realities given in flashforwards & flashbacks continue to stand out as a fun element that keeps the mind engaged.<br/><br/>Not sure how they'll top this one without getting formulaic."
"xenazues","9","0","1","16 January 2017"," Its about time actions went back to being action films
","I could write a ten page report on this movie so keeping under a 1,000 words is super difficult for me. Thank you for getting back to what action movies are suppose to be. Car chase, fine women, violence, guns, and moves that make you go ""wow that was original"". This film set its own expectations for fight scenes. And it took Tom Cruise to do it. This man has been acting for well over 30 years. And still brings it in films.<br/><br/>As I've said in other movie reviews I updated my blu ray collection and picked the 5 set of movies in a box set. I had to watch this one first. I've seen all the other ones except mission impossible one. And I was a huge fan of mission impossible two. I know some people might view this never have seen any mission impossibles wondering if this good. Don't ask your friends, just watch the movie. You also have to like action movies. If you like what everybody else likes and non original ideas based around comics you already have heard about or simply cartoons that you knew were coming out, this movie is not for you.<br/><br/>If you are thinking you are going to see top gun or risky business (which by the way are my favorite, i own both on blu ray as well) then this isn't for you. Tom Cruise is a great actor and his sarcasm is easily a throw back to the james bond days. All characters in this movie were great actors.<br/><br/>What more can I say about alec bladwin. Hes authority character he has done is so underrated in the filming industry its really sad. He played an authority character in The Departed and that was a 5 star movie. He just has a knack for drama and acting. Which he was the only person who added drama to this movie. And it was needed for making the plot come together. You can't really teach that. That was all alec baldwin. <br/><br/>As original as some things were, they were not original on the idea. Seriously this is your typical spy movie, james bond and jason bourne have made a killing on that. Have a target you are looking for, bring back all the people who help the spy out as the same characters you know and love, throw in a woman you can't tell at first if she is working with the enemy but turns out to double cross the bad guy. And yes I have seen the whole working for the other good guys think plenty of times too. Its nothing new.<br/><br/>The car scenes as well were nothing new. You can tell BMW was part of this film, every car made you wish you had it. And yes some of the engine sounds were made up by a voice over of some kind. But if you have the 5.1 surround that comes with the disc you wont complain. And unlike those first bond movies, I can hear bullets whizzing by at 5.1 surround sound. I'm not expert of bullets whizzing around so Ill just except that as a good quality sound.<br/><br/>And unlike other action movies. They lose you in the movie. Right to where you get to climax you just fall off. Like a date that just isn't going well anymore. You just want to get dropped off and go home or drop the person off and go home. <br/><br/>To many of these female characters don't play the part. I don't know if its the director telling them stick to their script or what. But they sound so stiff and simply predictable. This woman did not. She sounds sexy, gorgeous and she knows how to handle herself. Exactly how I expect a female agent to act. I think katie holmes was in the 3rd one. I almost passed out from boredom of her character. <br/><br/>I was going to list everything I liked about this movie in this review cause their were a lot but one of my favorite things was that it was set in a foreign place. Not sure how a lot of movies got away from that. It just has a certain feel to it. I enjoy the spy's who have a damn visa or create themselves one even if they are rogue. How the heck are you going to convince me you are trained killer or simply a covert specialist when you can't even get across your own border?<br/><br/>And the end of the day this was a great movie. There was some things to take away from the movie. The bad guy didn't bring the film down. But I could have put john travolta in their and got much better results with a lot better lines. The girl was was definitely great. The part where she is in her bikini bottom was wonderful. Reminded you of the old bond movies where you were waiting for that character to show up like that. Its a must watch movie and honestly probably the best action movie I've seen in a while."

And watching them do their thang, all confident and sh*t, is a big part of the viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>""M:I"" is all about action and big setpieces, starting strong with the airplane-infiltration and never letting us down later either. Quality job all around. As usual, action relies heavily on orchestrated movement, so, don't expect much realism.<br/><br/>I would say that ""Rogue Nation"" doesn't try to be as massive action movie as two of the previous ones, or most of the ""Fast and Furious"", or 007 with Daniel Craig. But the result works well, everything is in its right place and there's always enough entertainment.<br/><br/>The plot and the characters are really thin, to make room for the big set-pieces.

"jtindahouse","7","0","1","28 November 2016"," This is where Cruise belongs
","Tom Cruise currently has two movie series of which he is the star. There's the 'Mission: Impossible' series and there's the 'Jack Reacher' series. In the 'Jack Reacher' series he's about the only thing holding the whole show back. He's completely unsuited to the role and has destroyed a terrific character created by Lee Child in the books. However, in 'Mission: Impossible' it's quite the opposite. He's perfect for the lead role of 'Ethan Hunt' and plays him excellently. The suave, cocky, arrogant and intelligent character he's perfect for. The tough, large, physical, blunt and hulking one, not so much.<br/><br/>'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is another fine addition to the series. Much like the 'James Bond' series, I find you have to keep your brain switched on the entire movie, otherwise you're likely to become completely lost to the plot and just what exactly they're trying to achieve in each scene. I did find this one was well explained throughout and therefore easier just to sit back and enjoy the action, which is a major plus. I liked the villain enough (nothing to stand-out, but he did the trick) and the support cast did their thing around Cruise adequately. Ultimately though, it was his show and did what he usually does in this series and carried things. There's still plenty of life left in this series I feel."

Whether its the over-the-top stunts, perfectly shot action sequences, or intriguing story lines, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation delivers another amazing action movie for 2016 Major props go to director/screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. McQuarrie was able to compose an extremely compelling story, which isn't customary to the Mission Impossible franchise. Interesting characters coupled with a number of plot twists and some tense dialogue help keep the movie fresh from start to finish. If the amazing story wasn't enough to keep viewers attached, then some awesome action sequences should suffice. In what seems to be a trend in 2016, McQuarrie uses practical stunts that lead to some of the most visually-striking action sequences every constructed. Then of course there is Tom Cruise who once again shows us why his is the undisputed King Of Action.

Tom Cruise is amazing, just like the rest of the cast. The plot is okay, there are some good twists, there's good humour and really- really good action sequences. It is not a perfect movie (for example, there's a pretty bad cgi car flip, and when I saw that I was like: I hope the rest of the film will not be like that; and thankfully it wasn't), it will not transform your world (at the end of the day it's an action movie), but it was exactly what you want to see when you sit down for a blockbuster action flick: pure excitement and fun!"

Tom Cruise also retraces Jimmy Stewart's footsteps to Morocco from TOO MUCH (though since kidnapped children would raise the suspense stakes far too high for today's squeamish movie audiences, only Cruise's comic relief sidekick gets snatched here). Anyone expecting a big musical hit to emerge from MISSION 24, such as Doris Day singing her young son to Freedom with ""Que, Sera, Sera,"" will be sorely disappointed.

","Maybe it wasn't impossible, but in 2011 it seemed highly likely that the aging Tom Cruise and the ""Mission: Impossible"" series could keep going after three films spanning 10 years (and all earning merely ""decent"" marks). Then ""Ghost Protocol"" hit theaters and made doubters bite their tongues. That being the case, ""Rogue Nation"" keeps those teeth firmly clamped down.<br/><br/>Despite losing the ""Ghost Protocol"" screenwriters as well as director Brad Bird, ""Rogue Nation"" doesn't slip under the watch of Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") who directed Cruise in 2012's franchise-starting action thriller ""Jack Reacher"" and wrote his 2014 star vehicle ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Needless to say, their marriage is working.<br/><br/>McQuarrie's screenplay elevates the thriller and espionage elements of the franchise. The weakest aspect of ""Ghost Protocol"" was its plot, but ""Rogue Nation"" keeps the mystery tight and its terrorism-focused conflict is less outrageous than some past ""M:I"" evil schemes. <br/><br/>In the fifth installment, the IMF finds itself disbanded by an angry CIA honcho (Alec Baldwin) just as Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has uncovered the existence of the Syndicate, a global network of disavowed, missing and presumed dead secret service agents conducting widespread terrorism. Resourceless and with the CIA breathing down their necks, Hunt must secretly coordinate with Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) to find the man behind the Syndicate and stop them.<br/><br/>Along the way, Hunt comes across a former British Intelligence agent in deep cover with the Syndicate named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who is in every way his equal yet whose allegiances make their relationship complicated. Ferguson explodes into Hollywood in this role as a young but mature-looking field agent with acrobatic takedown moves like Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow from the Marvel film universe. Ferguson really shares the spotlight with Cruise instead of playing his arm candy.<br/><br/>Whereas ""Ghost Protocol"" was more about suspense and innovative action (the Burj Khalifa sequence is still among the best of the decade), but ""Rogue Nation"" takes a more visceral approach. Aside from the ""James Bond""-like opening sequence that sees Cruise holding on to an airplane door as it takes off, the stunt work isn't larger- than-life so much as tight, gritty and explosive. Actually, ""Rogue Nation"" shares a lot of DNA with the modern ""Bond"" films in terms of action and globe-trotting. Robert Elswit's cinematography in this film and ""Ghost Protocol"" have really helped the franchise up the visual ante in a way that has dramatically increased its esteem. There are still lots of formulaic tendencies and things that keep the franchise light, but it's more fun than it's ever been.<br/><br/>So after 10 years of languishing, the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise has earned its way into the echelon of the best active action film franchises, and it better hurry before its 53-year-old action star decides to ""take it easy for awhile.""<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I loved MI Rogue Nation. This franchise keeps delivering what the audience wants - Tom Cruise, an unbeatable bad guy, beautiful smart tough women, controversy, car/plane/bike chases, and an impossible mission. <br/><br/>The usual cast of supporting characters are back to support Ethan Hunt who is somewhere in the world doing something to save us. The plane chase scene at the start is like the fuse lit at the beginning of all MI movies. You know then that you are in for action. <br/><br/>The bad guy is this mysterious Syndicate leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). He is the cool bad guy who never seems to get riled, is always one step or more ahead, and has every detail planned with vicious cold- heartedness - the picture of the modern day terrorist. The beautiful spy is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). She was pretty good, making you wonder throughout which side she really belongs to. Then there is the intrigue about the whole Syndicate - who is the leader? why are they doing these things? The story works really well I think.<br/><br/>Can the MI team come back even though they are now (again?) unsanctioned? How can they stop a gang of ex-agents, bad guys, and all around terrible folks? How can they catch up to a guy who is always one step ahead? It's an impossible mission.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise delivers another great performance, but you can only wonder how many more of these he has in him - at 53, he's getting a bit old for the physicality these roles require. But hey, what with the Expendables, and the Taken series, and Kevin Costner rejuvenating himself as a spy, you never know. <br/><br/>If you like action movies, go see MI-Rogue Nation. Enjoy."

What I love about this movie is that, even though it's complicated, it makes sense. The way it unfolds is excellent, and you can follow it.<br/><br/>This action movie does not make the mistakes of others. It has no pointless scenes, it does not have impossible tech, does not take itself too seriously and is not sexist as fu(&.<br/><br/>I really really really enjoyed that the woman who helped Ethan out was not treated like a physical object and simply 'the love interest'. You know simply a toy for our hero to play with....no. She was an actual human being! Amazing! Sure she is attractive but so is the rest of the cast. I really liked how she was treated equally, very refreshing considering how sexist most movies tend to be.<br/><br/>The movie keeps you guessing, NOT confused. There is a BIG difference there. So if you wanna see top of the line special effects and have a whole lot of fun this is the film for you! I highly recommend it! They keep the film current with some nods to the past films.

","Review: I really enjoyed this movie! It's full of drama right from the get go and the action scenes are really impressive. I also liked the fact that they all pulled together for this mission and that it wasn't just Tom Cruise being a one man army. Anyway, after there many successful missions, which saved many life's, the IMF are under investigation because of there underarm tactics and the money that they have cost the US government, so Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) shuts down the elite squad which means that they have to tackle crime without there backing. When the IMF come under attack by the syndicate, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) gathers his team to take down the ruthless Lane (Sean Harris) who has killed many innocent people, without remorse. After being saved by IIsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who is working for Lane, he digs into her past, only to find out that she is also an agent, working undercover and they soon join forces to stop Lane from getting an priceless disk which contains information about the syndicate. Whilst battling against Lane's henchmen, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), help Ethan to protect the disk and to stop Lane from killing more innocent people, while William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) tackles the political side of there operation. After saving many life's and finally taking down Lane and the syndicate, the US government decide to carry on backing the IMF, now that Alan Hunley has seen, first hand, what they are capable of. This fast paced movie has a very detailed storyline with some amazing stunts, especially the outrageous stunt on the plane at the beginning and it was good to see everyone finally pull there weight in the organisation. Alec Baldwin will definitely make a great addition to the team, which means that we might actually see more of Jeremy Renner in the field alongside Tom Cruise. Anyway, like many of the other Mission Impossible movies, Cruise really does give this movie his all and the many twists in the storyline made this a joy to watch. All of the different members of the IMF, bring something unique to the team and the chemistry between each member is felt on screen, especially between Pegg & Cruise. Basically, I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to see another movie from this franchise. Great Watch!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Tom Cruise is still doing these death defying stunts at 53 years old and with Top Gun 2 in development alongside Jack Reacher 2 and Mission Impossible 6, he really isn't showing any signs of slowing down. As he produced Rogue Nation, alongside J.J. Abrams, he had a lot of input when it came to the action scenes and the storyline, so he really did put a lot of effort into bringing something original to audiences. I wasn't a big fan of Jack Reacher, Oblivion, Knight & Day and Rock of Ages but I did enjoy Edge Of Tomorrow and the funny Tropic Thunder, were he played a role which is completely out of his comfort zone but it earned him an Golden Globe nomination. For 2015, Rogue Nation came in 11th place in box office earning, which isn't bad because a lot of big movies came out this year. It really is what it says on the tin so if your into your action films with a ""goodie vs. baddie"" concept, then you will definitely enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $682.3million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/thrillers starring Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, Sean Harris and Simon McBurney. 8/10"

"bob the moo","Null","0","1","26 December 2015"," The movement sells it and makes it an enjoyable blockbuster
","There is a plot here, involving a secret organization trying to bring down IMF and encourage disruption around the world; probably at a high level it makes a lot of sense but outside of a two-line plot summary on IMDb, it is unlikely you watch a two-hour movie and don't get into the plot a bit more than this. Doing so does mean that things start to wobble quite badly, and the narrative does start to expose itself as essentially being lots of cool words spoken quickly and with lots of spy jargon. Leaps in logic, convenient writing, and generally a lack of anything beyond the superficial are all very much the order of play here.<br/><br/>I won't pretend this is not an issue – because it is; but at the same time the film is a summer blockbuster action movie, and to a point you do have to come into that arena knowing what you are accepting as the norm. So the first question really is: does the film succeed on its home turf. In this way the answer is 'yes' because M:I-RN has strong movement whether it being in the many set- pieces it delivers, or in the dialogue sequences which frame them/ This movement is sustained surprisingly well for a film running to this length, and the action sequences are done with the right tone of silliness and spectacle so you can enjoy them and feel less inclined to pick holes in them (which is easy to do).<br/><br/>The cast seem to get this too, so they are starry, do the action stuff well, and generally don't worry about much more than whatever moment they are in. Cruise continues to defy logic with his career – and he has a lot of presence throughout this film, often carrying it by sheer will of personality. Ferguson is a good support for him, while Pegg is not too annoying, Renner is solid, Rhames is like an old pair of comfy slippers, and Baldwin adds a sense of class. Harris is an enjoyable but perhaps underused villain.<br/><br/>In the end it is an enjoyable film with plenty of action and movement which plays to the strengths of the cast and budget. The weak plot and sense of superficiality of course prevent it being more than a bit of fun, but if it is fine to be this and do it well, then I was fine to enjoy it doing it."

That first one I seem to recall wasn't that good. But the second one, in the year 2000 and featuring ""Chimera"" was much better. And they continued to get better with each succeeding one in 2006 and 2011.<br/><br/>In this installment the IMF seems to have been disbanded, but there is a rogue British agent who has his sights set on havoc around the world and that includes killing leaders of various countries. Tom Cruise is of course back as Ethan Hunt and he has to lead his team to find this man and capture him.<br/><br/>One of his team is Jeremy Renner as William Brandt and in a very nice casting choice British actor Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn. There has to be a pretty girl and that part is played by Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust. Plus another good casting choice is Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell.<br/><br/>The rogue is played by British actor Sean Harris as Solomon Lane. The action takes us to places such as London and Seville. We have car chases and motorcycle chases. We have airplanes and fancy weapons. We even have an opera in Vienna. <br/><br/>This is a worthy Mission: Impossible movie, at just over 2 hours it is constantly entertaining. I saw it on BluRay at home with a surround system including a powered subwoofer and the picture and sound are very impressive."
"AmyJenson1995","7","0","2","24 November 2015"," Tom Cruise still got it
","I didn't have the chance to see Rogue Nation to the theater so when it was available on YouTube I jumped on the occasion.<br/><br/>I have to say that MI5 is still as entertaining as the previous movies. It is still focused on the fun and action rather than the story. There are still a lot of explosions, a lot of spectacular crashes and the handsome Tom Cruise is still looking for more extreme stunts.<br/><br/>I would say there are some inconsistencies especially seeing Tom Cruise and his team without a scratch not even a torn shirt while they literally go through a lot of trouble. The biggest example is that car chase which ends up in a spectacular crash with the car rolling over between the trunk and the hood endlessly and when it finally stops, you see Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg saying to Jeremy Renner and Vingh Rhimes 'hey guys how are you going?'. While Renner and Rhimes are joking around with Pegg while getting him out of the wreck, Tom, apparently not shaken, take the bike of one of the bad guys and continue the chase! I agree it is fun and cool but really not realistic. In the real world, you would be dead or at least in a wheelchair. Here there is not even a scratch! Real supermen solid like a rock. They would be in a crashing plane, you would see them walking around carrying several victims on their back. With no scratches on them of course.<br/><br/>So That's why I find it less interesting than Spectre. It is enjoyable to see but it is far from being as deep as the current 007 saga at least concerning the plot. But I liked it anyway. I certainly had a good time watching Rogue Nation."

"siderite","7","0","2","13 October 2015"," Winning in some parts, losing in others
","The Mission Impossible franchise was originally a sort of high action serial heist movie. Every film an impossible task was set and they beat it. The strengths of the film were in the technical details, the planning to overcome all odds and the acrobatics of Ethan Hunt. This got old pretty quick and they had to come up with novel ideas, like a worked script and compelling villains.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation introduces a compelling villain and shows great work on the script level indeed, so for me this was a win. However, it loses almost everything on the technical and planning stages, making it all seem (as it actually is on the studio) routine. The only problems they have in Rogue Nation are their opponents, and by that I mean the one true villain. The rest, cannon fodder, look as impotent as children compared to all mighty Hunt.<br/><br/>While better than I expected, it lost a lot of what made a film a Mission Impossible movie. The villain, the girl, the storyline, they all seem stolen from a James Bond movie. Yes, all MI films do, but this one a lot more than any others.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if I wanted American James Bond clones, I would have gone with Jason Bourne. What am I talking about? I am going to watch Jason Bourne, too!"

","In the intro scene, Hunt is after some weapons on a plane so he gets on the departing plane which leads to the scene featured on the movie poster. It looks pretty cool.<br/><br/>Next, Hunt goes into a record store, does the usual spy talk and gets a record from the store girl. He goes into a booth and the record offers him a mission, but it doesn't come from the higher ups, but from the evil Syndicate which comes clean and admits it exists. As he tries to leave, a guy shoots the girl and Hunt is gassed. When he wakes up he's bound and about to be chemically tortured by some pretty girl. Then some other bad guys arrive ready to physically torture him. So the girl suddenly fights them and frees Hunt.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Renner is in DC being grilled by a Senate committee. They decide to dissolve the IMF and move its duties to the CIA whose boss Hunley is salivating at the chance. Benji has a desk job at the CIA and one day gets free tickets to the opera in Vienna. There he's contacted by a Hunt gone off the grid and rogue. At the opera they find themselves in the middle of an assassination attempt against some Austrian official. There are 3 shooters, one of them is pretty girl. Hunt saves the day but pretty girl has to turn herself in to the bad guys but leaves Hunt and Benji with some info.<br/><br/>They meet up with her again in Morocco. Bad guy wants some data stashed in an impenetrable facility. The only way in is for Benji to go in pretending to be an employee but first Hunt has to upload his profile onto their computer, which is underwater. The mission is a success but pretty girl escapes once again, this time with the drive for the bad guy. Hunt and co. have a copy of the info buy only the English prime minister can decrypt it. So now they have to grab him, and eventually the bad guy who's got plenty of cards up his sleeve.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation has much humbler aspirations than its predecessors and that's a good thing. After the great but over-the-top Ghost Protocol there was nowhere else to go but to shrink things a bit. It's still a long movie. The globe-trotting has been reduced too, or at least we don't get too see much of the places featured. There's the mandatory car chase scene that turns into a very cool motorcycle chase scene that could have been cooler had it been longer and shown more from the on-board cameras. Absent thankfully is the usual long foot-chase scene that Cruise seems to like so much. Harris does a great job as the despicable villain, but it's the lovely Ferguson who steals the show. No matter how long she was on screen I couldn't get enough of her. One gets the impression that Rogue Nation lacks something, perhaps the usual climactic wild action scene, but otherwise this movie is pretty good. What it is missing is some of the great teamwork that was so enjoyable in Ghost Protocol. The Patton-character or someone like it is missing. Ferguson would have made a great sidekick instead she goes back an forth between being an ally and an enemy. Overall this is another strong entry into the series."
"Maleplatypus","8","0","5","8 October 2015"," At last, a good MI
","The last movie was a disaster in any possible aspect. This one is quite the opposite. More down to earth, fun, good casting, very good direction, right pace, good sense of measure ... everything except some too obvious (a poke in the eye) sponsors. Tom Cruise gets better with every next movie he makes so one can temporary overlook his Scientology bull. I still do not understand why he had to do The Ghost Protocol, a meaningless childish showoff, or maybe that was the plan to make this movie so good. Think of it as an American James Bond (or the American answer to it), although Bond (with Mr. Craig is still much better). However, I recommend it. Just for fun, if not anything else. Good stuff this time."
"YoungCriticMovies","8","0","4","2 October 2015"," Mission Impossible: Keep Building Up a Franchise While Adding An Artistic Tone
","It's hard to make a good spy movie nowadays. It feels as though everything has practically been done already. With a franchise like Mission Impossible, which tries to top itself with every successive film, the audience's expectation bar is set even higher. However, what defines a regular moviemaker from an artist is that an artist always strives to go beyond. In that sense Christopher McQuarrie might have taken the first step to be considered an ""auteuristic"" director; of course we can't really define a director based on only one film, but his most recent outing: Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation certainly projects high hopes for his future.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation tries to raise the stakes like no other M.I. film has done before. That's why the film starts with the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) being not only hunted down by a terrorist nation known as 'The Syndicate,"" but also being shut-down by its own government after the many protests of the handling of missions from the CIA chief Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). The IMF's top agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes rogue after IMF is shutdown because of the CIA's unwillingness to believe the existence of ""The Syndicate."" Ethan Hunt must go solo with the help of a few of disavowed IMF members including Benji (Simon Pegg), Brandt (Jeremy Renner), and Luther (Ving Rhames) to show the world the threat they keep denying. <br/><br/>But people go to M.I. movies in order to see extreme missions that are well. impossible. The last outing had Ethan Hunt climb the tallest tower in the world. To top that (pun intended) there are two stunning scenes in Rogue Nation; one near the beginning of the film has Hunt clinging to a plane's wing as it takes off (a stunt that Tom Cruise pulled off on his own); and the other has Hunt hold his breath under water for three whole minutes to change a memory stick in an enormous cooling cylinder with an incredibly strong current. So this film does its job and tops the other great M.I. stunts seen in M.I. 3 and M.I. Ghost Protocol. But that's not what surprised me.<br/><br/>What really surprised me was the incredible balance that director McQuarrie was able to achieve. He held off the action sequences long enough so that they didn't burn out quickly, something that other action films pour in excess and make us lose interest and admiration in the stunts and choreography. The comedy also was toned down a bit from the last film. Simon Pegg's comic relief is more accurate due to less quantity and more quality. I certainly was fearing that the franchise and their comedic take might have taken a wrong turn and move towards the cheesy Fast and Furious style, but McQuarrie was able to stabilize that. The director also was able to make the film smart. What I mean by that is that the decisions taken by the agents aren't the predictable sort you get in your typical movies; the characters actually looked as though they were highly trained and their quick thinking and innovation catch the audience off-guard and it certainly surprises us and reminds us of why we enjoy spy movies in the first place. Finally there was a round of hommages that McQuarrie features throughout his film. Ranging from a thrilling opera sequence similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, to a play with names and character arcs paying tribute to Casablanca in very subtle ways.<br/><br/>As for acting Tom Cruise more than holds his own. His intense performance shows us that he is truly an eternal movie star who still has it in him to keep up with us. Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner are both solid as well, but the real revelation here was Rebecca Ferguson. Rebecca Ferguson plays Ilsa Faust whose allegiance the characters and audience are always doubting (is she a double agent? Triple agent?) It's hard to act your character acting under pressure, and Ferguson makes it look so easy! Not only that, but she manages to keep you guessing where her loyalties truly lie until McQuarrie finally deems it opportune to let you know. Such an actor is any director's dream. I also enjoyed how she wasn't at all used as a romantic interest at any point; she was equally as important and significant as Ethan or Benji's characters, something that is sadly not common with female roles.<br/><br/>So in the end not only are there various auteur brush-strokes throughout this movie, but you also see McQuarrie raise a franchise's already high level and we enjoy a set of incredibly great performances. Indeed it is an extremely enjoyable film. It's just a bit sad (or not) that you stop believing that any impossible missions exist."

","Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is the fifth instalment in the long running Mission: Impossible franchise and just when you thought they couldn't get any better Tom Cruise returns to prove that he is still one of the best action stars and that this franchise is still one of best in the action genre. But he couldn't do it alone, with the aid of an incredibly strong and entertaining supporting cast, very likable characters and an entertaining plot, this is definitely a must see in the spy thriller genre. When it comes to high octane action set pieces, no-one does it better than Mission Impossible. The absolutely extreme stunts and high speed chases return in full force and take the franchise to new 'heights' and 'depths' (literally) and with Ethan Hunt at the helm, the IMF have a new covert operation on their hands. The stunts and action set pieces in this film are awesome to watch you have your fair share of fast paced shootouts and chases and also your more low-key dangerous stunts, all of which were gripping, intense and had you on the edge of your seat. The fact that realism is mostly out of the question when dealing with these stunts really helps to up the stakes and gives the writers and director more creative freedom to wow us in as many ways as possible. <br/><br/>The team from Ghost Protocol has returned in this film and i think it was a great thing to keep Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Ving Rhames together in this film because their chemistry comes through so well in the film and you really get behind these guys. Their characters are always funny when they need to be and badass when required making for some fun, humorous moments that keep the mood very light amidst all of the intense action scenes. The villain of the film i thought was very strong also, 'they' weren't a moustache twirling evil mastermind, they actually had some interesting and mysterious qualities that kept me more engaged in the film. The performances were all incredible and convincing, even from newcomer Rebecca Ferguson as Isla Faust who adds a lot to the film in terms of stunts and especially in terms of plot. Speaking of the plot, i thought it definitely was a very well thought out plot with a lot of pieces and hints throughout that all come together in the finale. <br/><br/>It seems to have been very intricately planned out and isn't just one of your throwaway stop the bad guy plots. There are a few organisations and characters that you have to keep track of in order to completely follow where the story is going. And i have to admit, the strength and focus on having this very well thought out story caught me off guard a few times especially towards the beginning and later on towards the end. I went in half expecting to see some mindless action and fun with some form of easy to follow story that tied the whole film together, but i realised fairly early on that it was going to need some concentration. Once i managed to understand what was going on and who exactly the multiple parties going at each other were it all began to make sense and was pretty interesting and entertaining. I am not saying you can't go into this film and watch it just for the fun and action but just be warned that during the story centred scenes and the resolution at the end you will be very lost and maybe even bored. <br/><br/>But it's tough to knock this down too much for anything story related as it accomplishes everything a Mission: Impossible film sets out to do; great action and stunts, characters you know and love and a plot to tie it all together. If you are a fan of the franchise, no doubt you have already seen it, but in case you had any doubts, this is definitely a good, fun time at the theatres. - 8/10<br/><br/>P.S, I have to say i am incredibly impressed with the action spy thriller genre this year, we have had 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E', now this and 'Spectre' later in the year, all very different and all very great (Spectre excluded)."

","Believe it or not, until now I have never seen a Mission Impossible film. While I love action films, the premise just never appealed to me, but when I heard Christopher McQuarrie would be Directing this latest one, I had to see it. McQuarrie, the brains behind Persons Unknown, always tells imaginative stories, that while aren't that believable, are still extremely entertaining. In the fifth installment of Mission Impossible, the franchise is anything but stale as it is every bit as fast paced and extreme as I thought. I was expecting the action and for Tom Cruise to play his usually arrogant self, but what I wasn't expect was just how intense and in depth the story was. There is also the villain to consider, who was so much better than I hoped he'd be. I had always thought of Mission Impossible as sort of a mix between Get Smart and James Bond, and was presently surprised to learn that I was way off base. Rogue Nation is actually a very clever story, that isn't is as comical or as over the top with espionage as I thought it would be. In fact, the only thing that really was what I expected was Tom Cruise. While he's not my favorite actor, he's not a bad one either, I just never liked the fact that every character he plays is just so full of themselves. No matter the situation, Ethan Hunt was always so sure he had all the answers and knew exactly what to do, and even when he was wrong it didn't deter him from getting right back into it. Rogue Nation taught me a lesson I never seem to get, in that you really can't judge a book by it's cover. Certain stories may appear to be one thing, but you can never know for sure unless you sit down and watch them."

","I did not see any other blockbuster this summer, but I have the feeling that having seen the latest in the 'Mission:Impossible' series may have been sufficient for having seen the best. I confess that good action movies are one of my guilty pleasures, but I am quite picky on this respect. Besides the mandatory portion of attractive women and spectacular landscapes, the ratio between action scenes and story telling must not be too unbalanced on any side, car chases and fight and gun shooting scenes must be well filmed and fun to follow, the pace should be alert but still allow me to understand who shoots whom, and there must be action movies logic in what happens on screen, which of course has not too much to do with the real life logic. 'M:I 5' comes close to perfection on all these respects.<br/><br/>Whoever followed the previous films know already that the writers of the scripts will not avoid doing a few things: make sure that Tom Cruise (alias Ethan Hunt) is on screen 99% of the time, that he will sooner or later fall in for one of the female characters in the story (Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson is on duty this time) with no good chances for a happy and long married life to follow, that enough countries and landscapes will be traveled during the movie than in a full season of a National Geographic series, and that some of these landscapes will be badly altered after our heroes visit them. This installment also continues the intrigue in the previous one, as the secret services department to which Ethan Hunt belongs is threatened by the more conventional services, which obliges the hero to go rogue and become the most chased person on the planet, followed by both the good guys and bad guys organizations.<br/><br/>When all these happen on screen my first thoughts were to remember that this is almost the same script that was written for the latest James Bond series (with the changes of M, remember?). Actually under the hands of director and script writer Christopher McQuarrie the latest 'Mission: ...' looks more and more like a James Bond film, even better than one on some respects. Just listen to the variations of the music theme for example. The two series address now the same space in the movies spectators preferences and the borders are being effaced. It's good that the releases seem to be coordinated to avoid bringing to screen the new films in the two series during the same summer seasons. If the quality stays at this level I will not complain. This summer's 'Bond/Mission' was well written, alertly directed, Tom Cruise who gets near his mid-50s is in an acting and physical shape of an early 30-er, and even the stiff-as-usual acting of Alec Baldwin could not spoil too much, maybe because his role was of a stiff CIA boss. The bad guys were also quite schematic, and Cruise will need a more ferocious adversary in the next one. Yet – highly recommended to all fans of action movies – get your popcorn, sit back, relax and enjoy!"
"keithlovesmovies","8","0","3","23 September 2015"," Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation Review
","The IMF (Impossible Missions Force) is now disbanded and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is left on his own while a new threat emerges, the Syndicate. The Syndicate is a network of highly skilled former government operatives with a goal of establishing a new world order by an escalating series of terrorist attacks. Facing what may be his most impossible mission, Ethan gathers his team William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and also joins forces with a disowned British agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who may be part of this organization.<br/><br/>Everybody knows the Mission Impossible theme. I haven't heard it too much lately so when I heard it at the beginning, I started getting chills. The film starts with action and does not let up. What added to the excitement was the lack of CGI used during the action sequences, from various stunts to fight sequences to various vehicle chases gave them a more authentic feel. The story was very much on par here bringing humour, excitement, thrills, and suspense. Tom Cruise really brings in this installment as he entertains and is able to handle all that is asked of him here. The supporting cast does not disappoint either even though I did not see them as much as I would like. My favorite of those was Simon Pegg's Benji as the lovable, fish-out-of-water, computer nerd providing great one-liners as he is often not able to handle and/or not ready for what he is about to do next. I was not impressed by the villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). I did not find him very menacing as the story built him up into being a lot worse than what we actually got to see. Gadget fans will not be disappointed as you will have it all despite the fact that they probably would never exist. Other than the acting, the best part of the film happens to be the cinematography as all the locales we got to see were depicted in such a beautiful way that really gave you the impression that you were really there and the variety of shots and camera angles were able to catch all the action. Rebecca Ferguson's Faust holds her own as sort of a female version of Ethan Hunt who manages to keep up and does not feel out of place amongst the returning cast. Some may not be a fan of the ending as it feels a little rushed and a little abrupt when compared to the rest of the film but I was fine with it because it fit with the story. Overall, this is a perfect Summer movie as it has everything a Summer movie viewer would want: action, explosions, suspense, plot-twists, etc. What works is that it does all of those incredibly well. I have not seen all of the Mission Impossible films but I don't think that would stop anyone from enjoying this.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com"
"Finfrosk86","7","0","3","15 September 2015"," Overall pretty good, but had a couple of minor problems.
","I was actually slightly, although just slightly, disappointed with this one. Probably because of the hype, mostly. I liked the last one, Ghost Protocol, much better. Lemme break it down f'yall!<br/><br/>My first problem, bad fighting choreography. Not that it is that much fighting, but the fighting that is, is a little too shaky and you don't see clearly enough what is actually happening. I hate that. It totally ruins fighting. I tried to see on the cast and crew-list who the fighting choreographer was, but couldn't find any, for shame director, for shame! If you have fighting in a movie, you need a choreographer. <br/><br/>My next minor problem was that I thought some of the more exciting scenes, were a little clumsily directed. Maybe it's just me, but I felt i lacked that last.. uhm, whatever, to make it really exciting. A little anti-climatic.<br/><br/>With that said, there is some awesome action in this movie, no doubt! The actors are all likable. Production value is sky high. Sound design was excellent. All effects were great. Big props to that crazy old Tom Cruise, for doing his own stunts. Maybe I'll crank my score up a star if I see it again and like it better, we'll see.<br/><br/>I would also like to see a little more extreme action, I like that kind of thing. You know, the hero landing a bike on a car in mid air, while shooting two guns at 10 bad-guys, then jumping off onto a boat as the car explodes. The action in Rogue Nation is more ""down to earth"". Still pretty extreme, but could be more extreme. <br/><br/>Funny thing, saw it at the theater in Oslo, with my girlfriend. The people next to us, who we though were undercover cops at first, turned out to be ""agents"" because the Crown Prince of Norway just happened to be at the theater, same times as us! Hah! And there is even a ""I'm the king of Norway""joke in the movie. Sitting next to a real undercover agent, while seeing a movie about agents. Now that's meta!"

It's one of the funniest non-comedies out there, and coupled with some breath taking action and good acting, it just made me wish that the disappointing original was this good.

","I was not disappointed!!! ""Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation"" just came out and I had been ""patiently"" waiting for it. After seeing the fourth of the series I couldn't wait for the next one to come out. The thing about this movie that makes it so unique is the stunts and how Tom Cruise is an actual stunt man and does the stunts in these movies. Which is insane!! This movie was a movie like no other. The movie was a lot like ""Jurassic World"" to go back to my recent journal entry, because ""Mission: Impossible"" was also very enjoyable, but it was more unique and was more well rounded. This movie was a movie that can only be described as pulse pounding. I feel like a critic saying that it left me on the edge of the seat gripping the armrests throughout the movie, but as cliché as it sounds it did. That's what the movie was trying to do and it succeeded. This movie like ""Jurassic World"" has a very good replay value as I can't wait for it to come out on DVD even if I just rent it. That movie is something that I can be in the mood for instead of walking away thinking the movie was good, but I wouldn't want to watch again. Movies are something that I can watch and really enjoy, and this movie is something that I really had fun with and I was enjoying every minute of this movie. The reason why this movie was even better than expected was because I like the storyline even though it is cliché, because many movies try to do the same thing, but not too many movies do it the right way. The thing that made this movie unique and better was that it was done correctly. I'm not trying to contradict myself because I said the same thing about ""Jurassic World"", but ""Mission: Impossible"" was a better movie in the fact that I had more fun and enjoyed the story more."

This movie kept a tense starting from the first scene, although easing it thanks to Benji's usual jokes.<br/><br/>Great action scenes, great acting, but also a clever story. I must say that I want to see other films directed by this guy.<br/><br/>The reason most of ratings are low is that most of the viewers wanted more action scenes such as chases or incredible-sounding stunts. Don't listen at those reviewers, or their rating, that's not at all what this movie is. I can guarantee that unless you won't get bored"
"PWNYCNY","7","0","3","8 September 2015"," Shallow story, yet entertaining.
","The story is shallow, the characters as two dimensional as a piece of paper, the use of special effects way overdone, yet the movie is good. This is the case because of the presence of Tom Cruise. Working with a script that devoid of even the pretense of intellectuality, he manages to keep this movie watchable. Cruise's performance is uncanny. Although no longer a young man, his personal in the movie is entirely youthful. His delivery of one-liners matches is superb, proving that he is one of the best comic actors in cinema today. And that fits perfectly with this movie because what the movie is slapstick comedy mixed in with some action-adventure stuff to produce a cacophony of action in which the plot becomes irrelevant. The movie is pure action. As a venue for special effects and incredible stunts, this movie delivers, with interest. As for the story itself, that's an entirely different matter."

","The best was obviously the first, and this one comes really close because of the existence of Ilsa Faust, the Femme Fatale. Really, Ethan Hunt could use a female accomplice that can fight her own.<br/><br/>The action is as crazy as Tom Cruise could go for, putting my butt at the edge of the seat most of the time, and humor provided by Benji was just enough to neutralize the adrenaline-driven ride.<br/><br/>The music for this particular episode was excellent, as it incorporates most of the original soundtrack from the TV show, including the ""Mission accomplished"" soundtrack and others which titles i know not of. But, you will definitely recognize the melody when you hear it mixed into the various soundtracks in the movie.<br/><br/>Ilsa Faust even has her own theme song based on Turandot, and made her the classic female character, reminding me of Ingrid Bergman.<br/><br/>The only thing I wasn't happy about: the disavowed IMF. Again? Can't the IMF have a better leader and get normal jobs like the CIA or the MI6? I hope the next MI franchise doesn't put IMF as disavowed organization again.<br/><br/>If you're looking for thrilling action, this movie is the one to go to this year."
"danielefanin-17409","7","0","4","7 September 2015"," Mission Impossible V :Rogue Nation – The Last and the Best (so far)
","Has anybody ventured, in some cinema school or university, to write a comparative paper on Hunt and Bond? Waiting for an improbable, or rather ""impossible"", clash between the two super special agents, spiced with a guest appearance of Jason Bourne, we can be happy with the fifth installment of the Mission Impossible saga, Rogue Nation, that so far seems also the best. It might be, as some smart critics pointed out, that choosing every time a different director, besides lengthening the films' incubation (on average 46 months versus the 30 months needed to see again 007), injects new life into the character into whom Cruise has invested a large stake of his recent actor's and producer's efforts. Surely, the first blockbuster, following the Jack Reacher's 2012 debut with Tom Cruise as well, of director Christopher McQuarrie, unforgettable best screenplay Oscar for the clever The Usual Suspects, has contributed to the crafting of some characters as well as to the ""mirror"" structure of the story, laid out from the very beginning in the London record shop scene, which breaks, with good innovation, the linear expectations of the audience and sets the pace for the various double games recurrent in the movie and instrumental in keeping the audience glued to Ethan and his team on their actions to stop the criminal actions of a mysterious Syndicate, a Machiavellian and sophisticated organization that the US and UK agencies let slip out of their hands. The genre's peculiarities remain, well necessary for the public feel at home and balance the novelties of the special effects, and for sure Rogue Nation is even too close to some of its predecessors as well as 007's, but, enhancing the bonds between the main hero and his team, it is able to define its own trademark by leaving enough breathing space to the other IMF members. Each time Benji (Simon Plegg, simply great) or Luther (Rhames steals every scene he is in) are on screen the movie takes off and also Renner (star also of two Bourne films), in the role surely most difficult to define, improves his impact on the story's dynamics. And then there is Ilsa, well played by Rebecca Ferguson, whose role becomes more and more central in the film's development, maybe booking, as already done by Renner in Ghost Protocol, a return ticket for the next episode. Some banalities, like few of Baldwin's lines, and narrative shortcuts, like the Syndicate plans and IMF activities, are unavoidable in this kind of movies but the excellent pace, already there in the previous films, is here coupled with a better development of the peculiarities of both Ethan Hunt and the other members of IMF and, particularly, with a sound enhancement of their mutual actions and reactions as a team, the real difference between Mission Impossible's hero, deeply rooted within IMF and very sensitive to the value of friendship, and his colleague sipping Vodka Martini, definitely much more a loner. Waiting, in a few years, for the sixth episode, Rogue Nation deserves the best marks of the series so far and offers a predicable but enjoyable entertainment that can satisfy both the action movies' lovers as well as those who enter the theaters with many more prejudices for this kind of movies."
"tgrock","8","0","3","6 September 2015"," Mission Impossible Continues Series' Trend to Choose Action Over Plot
","Mission Impossible 1, in my opinion, had the plot and the action to go with it. Mission Impossible 2 may have had an okay plot, but the action was over-the-top stylized and was just a bad film. Mission Impossible 3 didn't have much of a plot, but its action and villain made up for it and was the best in the series.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 4 started the series on the path that puts action over plot as if there was no effort to actually make a plot. It had the series' best set piece, but the action was REALLY unrealistic. The worst was when Tom Cruise jumps off of a skyscraper into a lower part of it only to hit his face on the window above. This would kill him.<br/><br/>In Mission Impossible 5, we find more incidents of Tom Cruise being immortal. He hits his head on metal as he gets flown into a plane by wind. He survives a ridiculous car crash where the car flips over while falling down 3 stories too at full speed. He survives crashing a motorcycle into the ground.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation to include a villain who was as intimidating as Phillip Seymour Hoffman. However, the actor and the events in the film make him feel more tacky than anything.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 4 and 5's action style is the same Live Free or Die Hard while Mission Impossible 1 and 3's style were more in line with Die Hard 1 and 2. Pretty much everyone agrees Die Hard 1, 2, and 3 are far superior to 4 and 5. I would think people would think the same about the Mission Impossible series. <br/><br/>Right now, Tom Cruise's new Mission Impossible films are not actual movies. They are just excuses to have well-thought action scenes that border on disbelief. They are typical summer blockbuster fluff."
"~AleXa~","8","0","3","6 September 2015"," Mission: Realism (with a flat affect)
","Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) Reviewed July 31st, 2015 after 1st viewing (IMAX) Paramount Studios - Directed by: Christopher McQuarrie<br/><br/>Mission: Realism (with a flat affect)<br/><br/>From the beginning, I was impressed by the pace and flow of the film. The director (Christopher McQuarrie) took the ballsy move to develop the angst, making the action sequences all the sweeter. The decision to promote the film using primarily the airbus sequence, which is the pivotal opening sequence with the desired (and successful) effect of gaining the audience's interest, was a smart one. This enabled us to sit back and enjoy the rest of the film without anticipating certain scenes. I also loved that the title sequence remained in true MI form, not pandering to the current stylistic and contemporary designs. The combined use of practical effects and Tom's commitment to his craft by doing as many of the stunts as possible lend a realistic quality to an otherwise outlandish film.<br/><br/>This time around, Ethan (Tom Cruise) must work to prove the existence of The Syndicate after the Senate shuts down the IMF, with Benji (Simon Pegg) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) left to help surreptitiously. I enjoyed the reintroduction of Luther (Ving Rhames) and newcomer Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, who managed to quite successfully portray a new archetype than previously seen in a MI film—more independent and honest, which allowed for us to see her as more of a real, complex individual as opposed to yet another seductive female stereotype. <br/><br/>The plot flowed well enough, slowing down just enough to allow the tension to build without leaving us with too much down time to contemplate the plethora of possibilities for who the real villain might be. There are just enough twists to keep you distracted while they implement their own slight of hand, always keeping you guessing. Renner as Brandt was enjoyable to watch, opting for a less-is-more approach that felt organic in its own right. I appreciated that there was not an overabundance of action for the sake of action, and instead the filmmakers opted to slowly build the suspense, effectively making us work for it—a very bold tactic that you do not see much in action films these days. To me, it spoke of their confidence in the material and allowed me to appreciate it all the more.<br/><br/>It did get a bit predictable toward the end, however the improvised plan was original enough, entailing a degree of entrapment I hadn't previously seen done before. One of my favorite moments toward the end was that for once, Ethan's relationship with his female counterpart was grounded in mutual interest and respect, not lust and sexual attraction. The writers have gone with the times and finally represented a strong female lead that doesn't have to be inserted merely as eye candy, and I greatly appreciate the mature treatment. As much as I am a fan of the MI series, that has been one of my biggest irritations in the previous films, so kudos to the writers and Tom!<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A worthy successor to Ghost Protocol, the action sequences and original script successfully breathed new life into the film, however the decision to be more realistic left the film feeling flatter than its predecessor.<br/><br/>8.0 out of 10.0<br/><br/>IMAX NOTE: There is a unique opening countdown sequence I've never seen IMAX do before. It was a great way to get us excited before the opening sequence even began (despite the fact that it was not filmed in IMAX, it showed quite well)."
"thecinematicaddicts","8","0","3","6 September 2015"," Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation
","Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, is the fifth installment in the franchise and hasn't lost any of its previous thrills. This addition to the Mission Impossible franchise was directed by Christopher McQuarrie and stars returning actors Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames as well as newcomer Rebecca Ferguson. This is without a doubt the best fifth movie in a franchise ever, (Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back was the third movie in that franchise despite being episode five).<br/><br/>When the CIA shuts down the Impossible Mission Force (aka the IMF) Ethan Hunt (Cruise) goes rogue to reveal the Syndicate: an evil criminal organization acting as an Anti-IMF. Along his way he works with fan-favorite Benji Dunn (Pegg) and a mysterious woman Ilsa Faust. Together they must fight against the Syndicate, while trying to avoid the CIA operatives hunting them.<br/><br/>This movie perfectly balances suspenseful thrills and breakneck action. The story keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from the beginning till the credits roll. There was a lot of doubt surrounding this movie, especially considering Tom Cruise is growing older and plans on continuing to make action flicks. Cruise proves everyone wrong as he resumed his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt. He was as energetic as ever continuing his trend of doing almost all his own stunts. In this film we got to see a very different side of Ethan: A much more reserved and secretive man. This development was hinted at in the previous film Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and it adds a nice connection for audiences.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg returns for his role as the hilarious computer genius Benji Dunn. As always Benji's character is clever and thoroughly fun to watch. He creates a nice relatable character for the audience to associate with. In a movie full of highly trained spies and assassins, Benji is a normal guy who is amazing with technology. He randomly blurts out things throughout the movie that the audience is thinking. Where this very human character made a nice connection for the audience, there were moments scattered throughout the film that would have been enhanced if Benji had done something to effect them. Mostly, Benji served as comedic relief and occasionally seemed like a damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Speaking of damsels: Rebecca Ferguson was outstanding in this movie. She played the female equivalent of Ethan Hunt: Ilsa Faust. She succeeded in being the most mysterious and interesting part of this film, in a movie about a mysterious criminal organization. Not to say the story was uninteresting, but Ilsa really captivated the audience from her very first appearance. The audience was always engaged and excited whenever she was on screen. This is because not only the character, but also the great dynamic energy between Cruise and Ferguson.<br/><br/>The action in this movie was very impressive and thrilling. With the trailer showing as much as it did, there was a general sense of worry that the audience had already seen all the best sequences. Thankfully, the very prominent plane sequence from the trailer didn't have a real impact on the story or movie as a whole. Nevertheless the scene was still very intense and fun. This movie also has the best motorcycle chase scene possibly to ever be on screen (others include Terminator 2: Judgement day and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). It was filmed in a breakneck exhilarating way to keep the audience on the edge of their seats and breathless. In general the fight sequences were filmed in a wide shot, so that you could see and understand what was happening. That being said, there were a few fight scenes when the film reverted to a series quick cuts making it hard to grasp what was happening, but these were limited. Filmmakers usually rely on this method for action scenes, because actors don't do their own stunts and the cuts hide the fact that a stunt double is in the actor's place. Because Tom Cruise insists on doing his own stunts, these ""quick cut"" action sequences are minimized and audiences reap the benefits of more intriguing action scenes.<br/><br/>The most obvious missing element from Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, is a threatening villain. This is true for all of the previous Mission Impossible movies, the closest the franchise has come is Philip Seymour Hoffman's villain in Mission Impossible III. The villain in the fifth movie succeeded in being hatable and down right infuriating, but he wasn't ever intimidating: The lead henchmen were more threatening than him. The lack of a frightening main villain was easy to miss, because the real villains were the Syndicate as a whole.<br/><br/>This film was exhilarating and very enjoyable for returning fans of the series or newcomers that haven't seen any of the previous films. All the characters masterfully work together to create a fun spy thriller full of breathless action and a compelling story. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation gets a 8.0/10 stars."

","After watching all the movies in the MI series, I still believe that none of the sequels came as close as Part I. Part I had a solid plot which kept the audience guessing till the end.<br/><br/>MI 5 comes nearly close. Writers of MI 5 do a commendable job of writing a solid plot where our hero Ethan Hunt is tested to his limits and fails for most of the movie. Also, they introduce a fabulous women character that we rarely see in movies these days. <br/><br/>The story is known to all by the time I write the review. With IMF disbanded and CIA hunting down Hunt, he needs to stop a rouge organization called the Syndicate from doing further damage and proving his and IMF's innocence.<br/><br/>But what takes the movie to another level is the character of Ilsa Faust played brilliantly by Rebecca Ferguson. She is more to the eye than you expect and she will keep you guessing till the end. Ferguson is remarkable and is deadly in the action sequences. Frankly, she beats the Johansson's Black Widow hands down. She will be the 1st reason to watch this movie as she beats Cruise hands down.<br/><br/>Cruise looks old and does some jaw gasping action sequences. My favorite is extracting a file from an under water vault. However, after each action sequence , we can see that Cruise is tired and the body blow is affecting him.<br/><br/>The rest of cast which includes Renner, Rhames, Pegg and Baldwin do a commendable job.<br/><br/>My suggestion to Cruise is whenever u make MI6, give Ethan Hunt a break and make Ilsa Faust the main character. Also, please see that Ferguson plays Faust. It would be one fantastic MI movie and will keep the series alive."

"Scarecrow-88","9","0","4","30 August 2015"," Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation
","The franchise starring Tom Cruise and a solid cast of characters doesn't let off the accelerator, this time featuring his IMF team ""gone rogue"", with Alec Baldwin as a CIA head using his clout to get the government to ""dissolve"" (dismantle) the team because of their supposed recklessness. That ""their luck has run out"" with Jeremy Renner unable to convince his superiors to reconsider. While out in London, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) meets a new nemesis in the form of an ""anti-IMF"" using terrorism to ""prepare a revolution"", with different points across the globe to ignite chaos through violence. Lane (Sean Harris, pompously insidious) is in charge of this ""The Syndicate"", using a ""former British MI8"" (Rebecca Ferguson, who is sensational) as a means to get close to Hunt, hoping to secure a flash drive containing unlimited monetary funds to support his global terrorist agenda. During the film, it seems Lane is always one step ahead of Hunt, but can our hero turn the tables on this new brilliant enemy?<br/><br/>Stunts and action are as spirited and lively as any of the franchise, including an incredible car-motorcycle chase through the streets of Casablanca/Morroco, including Hunt (who had just been resuscitated back from the dead after nearly drowning!) having to back his vehicle out of an alley enduring its flipping multiple times as Simon Pegg's computer whiz Benji freaks out (rightfully so!) in the passenger seat. There's the incredible underwater safe sequence (made famous in the advertisements with Cruise leaping into the pressurized vortex that leads to it), opening plane sequence where Cruise hangs from a door while it takes off (to free a cargo of nuclear missiles in possession of terrorists), interrogation cell escape fight (where Ferguson shows her stuff), and Vienna Opera backstage (and above stage!) assassination attempt on the Chancelor of Austria where Hunt must try and thwart multiple Syndicate members from shooting him. <br/><br/>The plot is twisty and slippery, with the hero and villain having to play the usual cat and mouse games, with lives on the line. Benji is eventually kidnapped and used as a pawn by Lane. Ferguson is the wild card, abandoned by her country as the MI8 head leaves her out to dry when she secures the flash drive from the water vault. Cruise and Ferguson are really good together, show nice chemistry, and have plenty of cool united fight scenes and shootouts together. Not only are the two physically impressive but their flow when battling the bad guys is smoothly performed. Also the complications of what they are both going through, with their respected governments disavowing them, gives them a chance to show their acting chops as well. Also fascinating is seeing how Ferguson teeters between helping Hunt and maintaining an ""alliance"" with Lane. It is a razor's edge poor Ferguson must endure, while Hunt continues to believe in her. Ferguson's knife fight with Lane's chief heavy in a tunnel of London is badass.<br/><br/>It is hard not to look at MI franchise as an alternative to James Bond, but I love knowing I exist in a time when both can thrive. Cruise is as big a movie star as ever. Renner, Rhames, and Pegg meeting up with Cruise as the CIA are breathing down their necks is a cool ""come together"" moment where the IMF decide to tackle a difficult adversary with all they have at their disposal. Full throttle pace and plot that doesn't let up. Superior summer entertainment."

"briandmcaleer","7","0","4","25 August 2015"," The twenty year old franchise that still has some legs
","Bursting onto the screen, with a barrage of action scenes, flashy transitions, hyped up music, shoot outs, car chases, explosions, daring stunts and Tom Cruise dangling from the Air and that's just the opening credits. No, seriously. In one of its few tributes to the original show, the Mission: Impossible films inject a few key shots from the film you're about to watch into its opening credits. It's like a short film with tonnes of action in it. Reminds me of that episode of The Simpson's where Bart wants the latest and coolest game around 'Bonestorm"" Not allowed to have it from his mother, he goes around to his best friend's house to play it, but he's unlikely to share. Bart enters his friend's room to loud noises and flashing lights, where Milhouse sits in front of the TV and excitedly says ""This is great. And all I've done is enter my name – Thrillhouse!"". It's like that; the start of Rogue Nation I mean. <br/><br/>But before the credits roll is a standout action scene I was expecting to see later in the film. The much hyped and talked about footage that went on line late last year of Tom Cruise hanging off the side of a plane as it takes off, made headlines. Yes, he does hang onto the side of a plane as it takes off, and although brief as its purpose is to open the film with a bang, it's expertly filmed. This sets the tone for the latest instalment in the franchise. After this daring stunt, Ethan Hunt is hanging out in London, being informed of his next mission but runs into a spot of bother Meanwhile in the USA, the IMF fights the CIA, while Hunt is MIA in the UK. Okay?It seems the actions of Impossible Mission Force are too questionable to overlook, especially the incident involving the destruction of the Kremlin (a nice throwback to Ghost Protocol). So, they get shut down – again, and Hunt becomes the his own agencies most wanted man - again. But after his run in with a bad guy in London, he's not about to hand himself over. He gets wind of a secret organisation called The Syndicate, who are equal to our hero's agency in every way; but instead of missions to keep the peace and save the world, they are eliminating IMF agents. <br/><br/>Finding support in the beautiful and mysterious Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) Hunt must uncover the truth about The Syndicate, whilst establishing a relationship with this British Belle who is essentially his female opposite; she kick's guys butts, has style to spare and works alone, running around the globe hopping from one dangerous spot to another. Not sure if he can trust her or not, Hunt feels a kinship for this agent none the less, even though it's unclear just whose side she is on. While he plays a few dangerous games with her, Agent William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) does what he can to protect the integrity of the IMF as it goes under the knife to be dismembered by a ruthless CIA Agent (Alec Baldwin). No need to go into any more plot, because you've either seen this film already and know what happens, or you're probably just begging the question, ""Is it any good?"" <br/><br/>This is the fifth film in a franchise that's gone on for almost two decades. In saying that, Cruise is no spring chicken anymore. He's not really old, but for a guy now in his early fifties, he's in super duper shape and once again takes on every stupid stunt on his own, making it all look so easy. But even Hunt has his limits, and comes into some close calls on more than one occasion. Cruise's performance this time around is resemblant of a man who has been doing this for a while, and has grown to care more about the people he works with. There is a strong focus on the relationships between the characters, which keeps us as viewers emotionally invested in what happens to them. Each film, as you would know, had its own visual style and blend of action and Rogue Nation continues that trend. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who previously called the shots on another Tom Cruise vehicle, ""Jack Reacher"", the filmmaker has a brilliant eye for detail and realism when it comes to the movies many, standout action scenes. The opening escapade with Hunt hanging off a plane as it rockets into the air, proudly takes the mantle of this instalments ""The Tom Cruise Dangling from Mid Air Action Scene"" .What follows is a well built and suspenseful scene at the Opera, followed by an extreme underwater swim where Cruise appears to hold his breath for long, continuous shots, then things leap into a tightly filmed car chase and an out of control motorbike chase, where again Cruise does all the stunts and proves once and for all, he is One Crazy Son of a Bitch – but ultimately, the bravest, most daring and hardest working actor in movies today."

Yes, you heard me correct. Even though this is a summer action movie full of spectacular stunts, it also features a plot and a very good one at that. The film starts off with a terrific stunt with Cruise hanging from an airplane and after seeing this you can't help but wonder how the rest of the film is going to top it. It starts off a bit slow after this as we get a subplot dealing with the CIA but the final hour of this movie is one terrific experience after another.<br/><br/>There are several reasons this film works so well but we can start off with the obvious, which are the terrific stunts. Most people have seen portions of the airplane during the television spots and the trailers and this here is certainly eye-opening but there's so much terrific stuff that follows. There's a breath-taking sequence that takes place in the water that will have you holding your breathe. There's a terrific bait-and-switch inside a political powerhouse. There's the fantastic chase on motorcycles through winding streets. There's also a beautifully orchestrated sequence inside an opera house, which certainly seems like a wink to Hitchcock and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes this series stand apart from so many others is the fact that we do get actual stories. Again, I'm not going to ruin all the twists and turns here but you're constantly caught up in it and wondering where the next mystery is going to come from. Then there are the performances with Cruise once again shining in the title role. I still remember watching the first film in the theater and it's hard to believe that all these years later Cruise is still going strong. Jeremy Renner, Alec Baldwin, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are all in fine form and Rebecca Ferguson is terrific in her part.<br/><br/>MISSION: IMPOSSIBE - ROGUE NATION pretty much packs everything into one film and in the end it's certainly one of the best of the summer and proves that the series shows no signs of slowing down."

Number five in the Mission Impossible franchise plays out much more like Bond film . The plot involves espionage with the CIA and the British secret service and the predictable bad guy/woman rogue agents and although it's quite a convoluted plot it never got too difficult to understand. The action is superb especially an amazing bike chase that takes you're breath away. I found this thoroughly enjoyable and a great way to spend a rainy afternoon with the kids. Recommended."

In Rogue Nation; most of the familiar faces return. Newcomer Swedish born dancer Rebecca Ferguson seduces the viewer in every scene she is in; she conveys Intelligence, Elegance and Athleticism. Simon Pegg has the best expressions and provides the sound bite of humor. As usual the IMF has all the best toys to play with, to disarm and to gain secret entry.

In Rogue Nation, IMF is disbanded and a new threat called the Syndicate arises with promises to establish a new world order with the usage of terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>Throughout the story we are blessed with good dialogue, humour between the supporting cast, chemistry remains on point, and best of the actions sequences.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and see the fantastic four. Er... not the one from Fox. But these guys. You are in for a treat."

","""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" is the fifth instalment in the 60s television series turned blockbuster franchise that has been chugging along for almost 20 years, and shows very little sign of losing steam. This time around, the IMF are hot on the tail of the Syndicate, an underground organisation hell-bent on taking down Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his squadron, as well as establishing a global ""rogue nation"", hence the film's subtitle. Pouring salt into the wound is CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), who intends to disband the IMF and absorb it into his own organisation. Can Hunt prove that his team are still capable of saving the world, or will this mission turn out to beimpossible?<br/><br/>I suppose it is worth mentioning how this weighs up to the other films. The first film was okay; it had some impressive moments, and Brian De Palma's direction added much stylistically, but the plot was an absolute clusterfuck, and by the end, I had turned my brain off because I couldn't make anything out. The second filmI'd rather not talk about. It took itself WAY too seriously, and failed to deliver even as a dumb action blockbuster, subjecting us to slow-mo and love scenes, with some story about Ebola thrown in there, I guess. The third film was also passable; it had the most memorable villain of the franchise (I miss ya, Phillip Seymour Hoffman), but lacked the style that the first two had. Ghost Protocol was where things got interesting. It was the first film in the franchise where I was actually invested in the characters and the storyline, and I felt that the gadgets and the actions scenes got a lot more creative.<br/><br/>And now we have this onewhich might be the strongest in the franchise thus far. No kidding. 19 years, and these films are getting better. How do they do it?<br/><br/>The action set pieces here are not only the best ones the series has given us so far, they are also the most exhilarating that I have seen in general for quite some time. There were times where I audibly gasped or winced; I was on edge through much of the running time. Even through many of the quieter scenes, which are mostly exposition and character development, I was invested I cared about these characters, and I wanted to see them pull through.<br/><br/>There is also an enigmatic femme fatale by the name of Ilsa Faust (up and coming Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson) whose motivations are deliberately kept vague for most of the movie. Is she working of the IMF, or is she a pawn in the Syndicate's game? The mystery surrounding her is handled very well, but even then I could kind of guess where she was going. Regardless, she is a fairly interesting character, and does add something to the team's dynamic.<br/><br/>The leader of the Syndicate, ergo the film's antagonist, though not as effective as PSH from the third film, still feels volatile whenever he is on screen, and his cunning and wit feels like it poses a legitimate threat to our protagonists. <br/><br/>If this review feels like it's running on fumes, then it probably is, as I can't really say much about this other than that it was a damned good time at the multiplex. If I had to pick apart something, then it would be the running time, as I felt that maybe the climax went on for a bit too long. But in the grand scheme of things, that's a nitpick, and MI: 5 is definitely a mission you should choose to acceptI know a lot of other people have probably made that pun, but still."

","Well-received fifth installment follows Cruise as he chases down terrorist Harris; while at the same time staying under the radar (but not without the help of loyal Rhames, Pegg and Renner) of CIA agent Baldwin, who is convinced the IMF has done nothing for global security and has instead been criminally endangering and compromising previous missions. At times, the dialogue is just as bad as Woo's second installment; but from the opening scene of Cruise climbing on the outside of a flying Airbus A400M (without the use of special effects or a stunt double, by the way), there's no doubt another impossible mission will accomplish your entertainment. It's nice to see reprising characters getting fleshed out a little more, and the minor references to previous films are indeed fun; but this excellent series runs the risk of slowing down if each installment is becoming less and less self-contained. Hats off to Harris, who breathes life into a textbook greedy madman just by his unique voice.<br/><br/>★★★ (out of four)"

","MI is back with the fifth installment in the movie series and it doesn't disappoint. To be honest I had almost closed the file on this franchise after the release of Mission: Impossible II (2000), a movie which can be simply defined as a disaster. However, the way the MI bandwagon has since bounced back , producing good quality entertainment in each subsequent installment , is truly commendable. <br/><br/>For me the most impressive aspect of the movie is its attempt at reversion to a more suspense laced theme line as opposed to the outright slam dunk actions movies that were released post Mission Impossible(1996) .<br/><br/>Although the movie does not touch the masterful suspense of MI (1996) there is something very similar to its approach . Be it the introduction of plot elements, the screen presence of the characters and even the theme song. <br/><br/>The action scenes are quite impressive . This is no mean achievement given the tight competition in this genre these days. The director manages to retain the reputation by ""that special"" stunt sequence reserved for Cruise's character in each installment. <br/><br/>The dialogue is well written and quite lucid. The screenplay is lively and interactive. <br/><br/>One cannot legitimately be critical of the acting in any action movie. MI-V is no exception. What matters is that the movie contains a substantial number of quips, smart quips one-liners to keep the audience thoroughly entertained till the very end.<br/><br/>A fine addition to the series. A good action movie in its own right. Do watch it ."

I went to see it at the theater with a friend and we didn't regret.<br/><br/>I found in the first part didn't happen anything special. Except at the start of the movie it began hot. Then in the second half the story offered fast pace and non stop action with spectacular car and wheel chases. In addition there were some good spy elements and sequences that I liked a lot. <br/><br/>All the staff made a great job inventing original ideas. Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg who played Benji delivered very respectable performances. Congratulations also to Tom Cruise who did the stunts by himself. I enjoyed it very much and I can recommend to every fan of James Bond, Bourne or Mission Impossible series.<br/><br/>7/10."
"luckycool_gr8","7","0","3","21 August 2015"," Ethan Hunt never lets up!
","Tight script, glamorous action sequences, superb screen play, with no ""yawning or let-me-check-my-messages moments,"" this movie is worth every second spent watching it. What makes this movie more special is the way it brings you on the edge of your seat despite the lack of as much action as an MI movie usually has. Team IMF never disappoints carrying out unimaginable operations successfully, for they've got Hunt, and as described by the CIA director Alan Hunley to the prime minister of The Great Britain, ""Ethan Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny."" Christopher has done a pretty decent job. Having worked on quite a few projects with Cruise already surely would've been an advantage. Rebecca Ferguson as an MI6 agent----blowing punches, jabs and barbs that can sting your face leaving you nowhere to hide----is delightful to watch. Her chemistry with Cruise goes very well, she's the best ever opposite Ethan Hunt. I would like to praise the movie's screenplay again, for a good screenplay acts like icing on a luscious cake. And why wouldn't the screenplay be superb, McQuarrie's screenplay won him an Oscar for The Usual Suspects. Tom Cruise at 53 does his job as an ""skilled-at-pulling-off-the- improbable"" IMF agent like no one else can. Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin, all did their job well. Another good thing to notice in MI movies' action sequences is those little mistakes or goof-ups or call them whatever you want that always tend to keep the team IMF from pulling off the tasks as they planned, and the team still making through it. Hunt failing to unlock the handcuffs but still pushing his way up to the top of the pole and freeing himself or making it through the secure underwater server beneath a power station even after running completely out of oxygen. These are the things that make your movie watching experience extremely thrilling. The bike chase scene post the smashing of the biker gang by a groggy Hunt in the BMW, doesn't let you let out your breath until the end of the chase. Rogue Nation to me is the best MI movie till date."

","The longest running international spy of 18 years is now a fugitive who is sought by the CIA for inevidently saving the world. Ethan Hunt's impossible mission, whether or not he chooses to accept it, will be to survive and of course, save the world from a rogue organization that had its inception within the IMF. With some commendable dedication to not just the stunts and action but also to the production of this franchise, Tom Cruise returns to the role that he is most comfortable with and is most appreciated for. Christopher McQuarrie ('Jack Reacher') takes the reigns of directing this time and brings back the intricacies and guile in Brian De Palma's 'Mission: Impossible'. With some exemplary action sequences, smart protagonists, an intricate plot of deceiving espionage and some desirable futuristic high tech, Ethan Hunt is here on a mission to entertain and as usual, he does it in style.<br/><br/>Hunt and his team have just intercepted a terrorist cell flying out with a stash of nerve gas missiles on an A-400 cargo plane. The seemingly death-defying stunt is what makes Tom Cruise among the most watchable action stars and soon afterward, his suspicion about a discreet terrorism funding organization called the Syndicate becomes real when he is kidnapped by one of their members, the bone doctor. His escape is aided by an undercover operative named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who might have more to reveal about the Syndicate. Meanwhile, owing to their previous interceptions including the recent one at Kremlin that caused massive collateral damage, a committee of Senators agree with CIA director Alan Hunley's (Alec Baldwin) testament to disband the IMF to make it a part of CIA. Hunt is now on a run from the CIA, without his team and with limited resources. There are several mysteries that he needs to uncover including the identity of the man he encountered at one of their hideouts and his link to the Syndicate, Ilsa's true intentions and allegiance, the retrieval of the encrypted drive and its disruptive contents. Each sub-plot gets further entangled in the other, with the rogue Syndicate threatening to unleash terror forces all over. It will take more than just Ethan's will to succeed in this mission that's shrouded in mystery like the London fog in the climax. Impossible, but doable. <br/><br/>The storyline, although convoluted at times, strives to be opaque like in Brian De Palma's version, which is a good thing because the mystery adds an enduring value. Every sub-plot and every character unify to a sensible conclusion with the occasional humor and sarcasm to ease through the twists. Some of the action sequences are frenetic and some just gravity defying. Cruise still chooses to perform most of the stunts by himself and that is quite commendable. Apart from the aircraft hanging scene, the film's highlight is definitely in Morocco. After the gripping sequence in the underwater server station, the action moves to the streets of Casablanca with Hunt and Benji in a thrilling car chase with superbikes in hot pursuit. The sheer adrenaline can be felt throughout the sequence as the BMW roars through every sharp corner and straight. This is followed by a superlative bike chase through the mountains which makes up for all the money's worth by itself. Then, to add to the eeriness of the sub-plots, the climax in London's foggy streets takes us back in time to some Hitchcock style thrills as Ilsa has a knife fight with the bone doctor. The other Hitchcock inspired sequence, the assassination attempt at the Opera in Vienna, is among the film's most adroitly executed ones. <br/><br/>At age 53, Tom Cruise still has the ability to be all over the screen. His commendable efforts go beyond just the stunts that he chooses to carry out on his own. He has immersed himself deep into the role of Ethan Hunt, embodying the charming spy who almost gets himself killed every half hour. Cruise's dedication to this franchise is necessary for both its running as well as his own career. No matter who or what he is off screen, he is a remarkable entertainer as agent Ethan Hunt, whose impossible missions keep us hooked in awe. Simon Pegg as the techie side-kick is geeky yet funny enough for us to care about his survival. Jeremy Renner's Brandt is always in a spot between the CIA and his commitment to Ethan's crew and he balances things pretty well. Alec Baldwin has some cheeky lines and adds the right amount of gravitas to his character as a CIA director. The surprise act of the film however is Rebecca Fergusson as Ilsa Faust. She is vibrant, kicks ass in action sequences and is just an equal match for Ethan without being an unnecessary interest of another kind. <br/><br/>Fingerprint verification on car windows, encrypted flash drives that require the Prime Minister's authentication, high tech gadgets and of course, those crazy masks to change identities, make this a thoroughly exciting espionage film. The plot is thick enough to keep you engaged yet not contrived to just fill in gaps between action sequences. Rogue Nation is what Bond films used to be like. It's a complete entertainer by all means and among the most satisfying action films of the year that also enables Tom Cruise to keep this franchise alive. Light the fuse people..<br/><br/>9.113 on a scale of 1-10."

","So why is the new Mission Impossible subtitled Rogue Nation? The evil Syndicate is not a nation but a covert operation of disenchanted international recruits. The white hat IMF is not a nation but a secret American undercover unit independent of the CIA and every other acronym this side of the SPCA. <br/><br/>Then who's the ""rogue nation""?<br/><br/>Here's a hint: the film's coproducers include an Arabic and a Chinese company. <br/><br/>The rogue nation is America. It continues its longstanding mythology of valuing the outlaw.<br/><br/>American westerns and gangster films typically pretend to honour community values, the restraints that civilization places on its member citizens. But that's only lip service. America's heart is in the outlands, where individuals place themselves above the law in order to get things done that the law won't allow. So even if the IMF is a rogue unit its fictional existence attests to America's willingness to break the law for the communal good. <br/><br/>That also defines America's less violent popular genres. In comedies and musicals the explicit value is the team, the community, but the ultimate respect is for the individual that transcends it. The comedians are valued for breaking conventions — hello brothers Marx — and the musical ultimately vaporizes not the chorus line but the star who rises out of it.<br/><br/>America pretends to rule by law but its secret passion is for the rogue, the rugged individualist who breaks the law — to do good. Civilization can't survive without the outlaw's service, as we see in The Man Shot Liberty Valance. That's who America has its cake of civilization but iced with the outlaw thrill.<br/><br/>That's Shane, the gunslinger who rides into town, saves the town from the evil corporate ranchers, then conveniently rides into the mountains to die — in the very last frame, almost subliminally — so that the town, the good rancher's vulnerable wife and role-model needing Joey, don't have to live with him. Clint Eastwood remade Shane with a grittier realism in Pale Rider — same mystique. The two films stand together like Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience.<br/><br/>In that spirit James Bond is famously licensed to kill. Tom Cruise's Ethan is licensed to kill, disappear, command limitless technology and resources, and do whatever he wants. He's strictly a filmic creation, so he lives through a concert hall scene out of Hitchcock and in Casablanca, etc., engages with a mysterious heroine named Ilsa (out of Casablanca). He's a film hero about film, about his nation's mythology, not about any literal reality. <br/><br/>Ethan's engagement with the villain Lane begins and ends with smoke-filled glass boxes. Ethan is trapped in the first, Lane in the second. The neat symmetry gives a sense of structure to the overall chaos. So do the three most dramatic set pieces, where Ethan clings to a flying plane, survives several breakneck land chases and comes back from an underwater death. To round out the elements, a motorcycle chase ends up with several motorcycles afire. This is epic stuff.<br/><br/>In that sense the film is a celebration of American popular culture. That's why the narrative absorbs classical European culture, setting an extended scene around a Vienna opera production of Turandot. The theme recurs in the later soundtrack. Pop culture, you see, is itself a rogue, daring to stand up against and include — to transcend — the best of its European forbears."
"troyputland","8","0","2","17 August 2015"," Ticks all the right boxes
","Rogue Nation pushes all the right buttons. It's exactly what's wanted from the MI franchise, and never tries to surpass that fulfillment. Tom Cruise is leaner and fitter than he's ever been, running faster than the speed of light and performing impressive stunts that top Ghost Protocol. SPOILER, the infamous plane scene smashes us in the face before the title credits roll. The IMF (Impossible Mission Force) has been disbanded by the CIA, forcing Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) on the run. Rogue Nation's a double cat and mouse game, with the CIA searching for Hunt, and Hunt searching for the secret organisation: the Syndicate. The plot's topsy turvy, simple to follow but almost, just almost, pointless. The Syndicate, led by Sean Harris' Solomon Lane, is hell bent on taking out the IMF, or rather, Ethan Hunt, because the CIA already took care of that. Brushing this aside entirely, RN is a blast. It's villain is under cast, but the rest of the compliment Cruise. Simon Pegg is back for another round of wit as the tech-guy, used on the field even more this time. New girl Rebecca Ferguson kicks ass, given more to do than Renner and Baldwin put together. The fifth film in the franchise ticks all the right boxes; great, fast-paced action, high speed chases, novelty gadgets and nerve- wracking stunts. Evennn the face masks make a comeback. Let's hope that Jack Reacher director Christopher McQuarrie handles the next excursion."

","I started do be interested in the Mission Impossible franchise when Ghost Protocol came out and i loved it. Then they announced they will be making another movie. I didn't know what to think about it. Then they decided to release it on Christmas. Later they decided to move it to July as it would be in a competition with Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Spectre. It came out and i was amazed. The movie had his main stunt which was hard to believe it wasn't a green screen or actually that Tom Cruise made it. It also had comedic moments mostly by Simon Pegg and Tom Cruise, great action, cool gadgets, good villain, interesting story, great acting and directing. It was as good maybe better than its predecessor. What i like about the franchise more recently is that they are adding more and more humour to the movies that it also delivers some laughs despite all the action happening. The settings were great and the twists and turns the movie took made it more and more suspenseful. I heard they will be making a sequel with the same cast so now i know what to think about the next movie, a action packed, all star cast, cool spy movie. Good luck Mission Impossible 6!"

","With the IMF now disbanded and Ethan Hunt out in the cold, a new threat called the Syndicate soon emerges. <br/><br/>The Syndicate is a network of operatives who are dedicated to establishing a new world order via a series of terrorist attacks. <br/><br/>Faced with what may be the most titular mission yet, Ethan gathers his team and joins forces with Ilsa Faust, a disavowed British agent who may or may not be a member of this deadly rogue nation.......<br/><br/>Five films on and almost twenty years since the release of the first film, and it's more of the same from Ethan and his IMF team, which isn't a bad thing. Like they say, if it ain't broke.....<br/><br/>The films have rarely took a step wrong, the second movie was an incoherent mess, but Woo's cut apparently came in at three hours, so it was always going to be a mess. But it had Woo's trademark all over it, it was a Woo movie primarily, as was De Palma's.<br/><br/>Here, Cruise is in control of almost everything, and kudos to the man, whatever you think of his private life, no one can deny that he's a wonderful screen presence, the epitome of a living legend, and the man dedicates himself to role, and Ethan Hunt has done wonders for his status.<br/><br/>So it's more of the same. A shady bad guy who wants world order (and lots of money), the obligatory Cruise stunt and jump from a great height, the extended cameo from a prolific actor playing the head of an agency and questioning IMFs worth, and of course,the wonderful chemistry between the titular group.<br/><br/>So playing it safe works, but it's one of those films you have to see on the big screen, not because of its spectacle, which there is plenty of, it's because the film will have your undivided attention, whereas if you watch this at home, you may become easily distracted, because the filler between set pieces can become slightly mundane in places.<br/><br/>But it's well written, it's wonderfully humorous in places (Tom Hollander as the Prime Minister is a highlight) and the set pieces are gripping, especially Cruise hanging of the plane and an assassination attempt.<br/><br/>But the biggest plus for the film and the lead, is that Cruise can send himself up, and in several scenes he is really self deprecating, and it's a nice touch.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's more of the same, but it's a fun movie."
"carter-47153","9","0","3","19 August 2015"," The Individualism of The Rogie Nation
","Governments. We are dependent on them to point us in the best general direction. We rely on them to help us take care of ourselves and the people in our lives. Whether the government of discussion is democratic, monarchy based or totalitarian based, the governments tend to offer social programs for it's citizens if for nothing else to pacify the population and ensure their sovereignty. So it is with this basic concept that we are given hope that we are cared for and have a place within our community on a local, regional and national level.<br/><br/>Within Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, the main protagonist Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) finds himself ""left out in the cold"" and isolated from his government and his friends (community). Mr. Hunt contrasts well with Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) who has allowed himself to be hurt by his government's actions and has accepted a life of isolation. As the story progresses we learn that the ""Rogue Nation"" does not refer to the antagonist, ""Mr. Lane's"" rival group ""The Syndicate. Rather it refers to the actions committed by our characters' governments.<br/><br/>In this film the governments in question are the British and the United States governments. They operate within secrets and despite policies of transparency display non-accountability behaviors. These governments create their own enemies through their policies and operate without thinking of the individual. While they operate through their agencies as if they were an island upon themselves, Mr. Hunt and the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) operate as a group. They care about each other, help each other out and understand the value of each person. It is because of this relationship difference that these governments are the Rogue Nation.<br/><br/>The film illustrates the point that people are able to surmount any obstacle and work through any problem with a little help from the community and specifically their friends. The film expresses this message very well and even goes as far as to show that there are limitations as to what an individual can do. That an individual can ask for help and that her community will be there to help you when you are at your lowest low. That the lack of faith in one's government is a two way street. If one shows some faith the outlook of institutions around us has the potential to change and work for us."

","A joy of a film that reminds us why we go to the cinema and why we love action movies so much when they are crafted with passion and intelligence. Moreover, this is a brilliant addition to the Mission Impossible series and brings it to a status where I started seeing this as the next James Bond, meaning that after this film I really could see the franchise enduring for years and going on recasting the title role.<br/><br/>Now, I will calm my statement down a little because I do acknowledge that the movie has flaws which I will get into later, but what I want to get across is how energetic and thrilling the experience is. When I said it reminded me why I go to the cinema I really meant that because for so much of the duration of the film I wasn't thinking of anything else but the film and that is something that doesn't happen often, my attention was almost never dropped. Moreover, this film does such a brilliant job of nailing what action is about and how to execute it. Just as ""Spy"" this year wasn't a perfect film nor a masterpiece, yet was a lesson on how to do comedy, in the same way ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" is a lesson on how to do action.<br/><br/>Other than the fact that we are never served shaky cam or fast cutting crap, but we are always looking at the action unveil on screen, never, not even for a second do the filmmakers forget what makes action work fundamentally: brining on the storytelling. The film is divided into big sequences from location to location that are themselves divided into smaller set-pieces that perfectly fit together to make the bigger picture. And in everyone of these set-pieces the action is moving the story forwards in some way, there are always the perfect stakes that fill every scene with genuine tension. We always have a reason to be alarmed if something goes wrong and that is something that is often forgotten, yet is the key to the action movie experience that will have your palms sweating.<br/><br/>Lets not of course forget how brilliantly these scenes are staged. Stunt work from Cruise is as always flawless and the the rest of the crew pulls off amazing stuff. Photography is magnificent and paints the perfect colorful picture for the tone of the film. The actors are all taking this seriously and none of them goof around when they shouldn't, Ferguson is phenomenal but that has been already said by everyone. Finally the characters stick out even more with this entry.<br/><br/>After all this praise I have to stop a second and acknowledge the problems the film has that kept it from being the mouth-on-the-floor flick it could have been. The story is smart but isn't as clear as it should be. Too many times I had to think over what was going on and that isn't because the plot is over complicated but because the movie doesn't give the right beats where to breathe and and messes up altogether the clarity of many points because of that. Another minor consequence of this is that you aren't always sure of what the character motivations are, especially for Ferguson's character. I must say, this isn't as bothering as I make it out to be because the film manages to work around it and does that quite cleverly, yet I am still trying to add up the pieces of everything and they don't all seem to really fit.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, go support this so we can have more of these, it was thrilling and joyful, I had a blast."

As seen in the trailer, Tom Cruise hangs from an aeroplane while it is in flight. This scene was actually performed without any special effects. <br/><br/>A recent trend in action movies has been the use of practical effects over the unrealistic CGI.

The enviable cast does a great job and no actor seems out of place while playing their roles.<br/><br/>The Impossible Missions Force faces a setback early in the movie as the court dismisses it due to the great amount of destruction that has been caused by them. Due to the unwillingness of the CIA to acknowledge the presence of the Syndicate, the primary objective that the team has is to prove their existence and get vindicated.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation is a summer blockbuster that delivers on its lofty expectations.

"blakiepeterson","9","0","1","6 August 2015"," A Terrific Addition to the ""Mission: Impossible"" Franchise
","Action directors are underrated filmmakers. Sure, they're better equipped when it comes to their brawn, not their brain; but to make a shootout, a car chase, a skyward explosion, and/or a fist fight look and sound convincing is much trickier to helm than a particularly savory round of conversational chess. Some are better than others - you cannot (under my watch) blurt out that Michael Bay is as skilled as Joss Whedon - and the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise, which made its debut way back in 1996, has fortunately been blessed with the best throughout its long run.<br/><br/>It's welcomed Hitchcock successor Brian De Palma, Hong Kong action legend John Woo, sci-fi king J.J. Abrams, animation mastermind Brad Bird, and, for 2015's ""Rogue Nation"", Christopher McQuarrie (director of Tom Cruise vehicle ""Jack Reacher"", co-writer of ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow""). And as if the franchise is cursed with the greatest luck of any ongoing series, ""Rogue Nation"" is the finest addition to the blockbusting array. Cheekily dubious, vigorously thrilling, and lip-smackingly jubilant, it's an actioner of the highest quality. <br/><br/>If the missions of the past were already impossible, consider the mission of ""Rogue Nation"" to be the most impossible: right off the bat, the IMF is dissolved, a terrorist organization known as the Syndicate becomes an overnight sensation, and Ethan Hunt (Cruise), along with his loyal groupies (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renner), become wanted fugitives after refusing to comply with the CIA's orders to disband. Normally, Hunt would follow orders, being the good guy that he is - but the destruction of the IMF is one big, messy misunderstanding; it's the result of too many sabotaged missions, at the hands of the previously unknown Syndicate, no less. Knowing full well that the U.S. government isn't fully aware of the situation, Hunt's crew decides to leave all ethics behind, band together with Ilsa Faust (a fantastic Rebecca Ferguson), a British agent who can't seem to be trusted by anyone, and take down the organization once and for all. <br/><br/>I've only described a portion of the plot, mostly because ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is so ingeniously intricate and because the film's much better when you go in completely unaware of what to expect. It's such a successful action movie that I can hardly remember the rant I delivered to a bunch of horrified friends over the current state of the genre a few days back. I suppose that's the magic of the movies: pessimism can be completely flipped on its back so long as the film doing to the persuasion is fresh enough to cajole.<br/><br/>But the ""Mission: Impossible"" series has always maintained a certain kind of enrapturing, no doubt because of the continuous changing of the directors and the consistent unpredictability of its plots, its action sequences. Only remaining the same is the idea of Hunt and associates battling modern-day evils. The rest is all lovable pomp and circumstance, smartly rendered and action-packed (but not too action-packed). Cruise is the only actor who can really head a movie like this (his name and demeanor alone are synonymous with blockbuster sass); the opening, which sees him clinging to the side of a passenger plane as it takes off, would seem ridiculous anywhere else but works here because Cruise is merely there.<br/><br/>I won't go in depth regarding the action sequences (all head-spinningly gripping), and I won't go in depth praising Rebecca Ferguson (who will certainly become a leading Hollywood player in the near future) - that would cause the review to go on for pages, and time should be spent going to the theater instead of sitting in front of a computer. ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is a rare fourth sequel that proves further evidence as to why the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is doing it right: whereas Marvel is breaking us down with their multiple-superhero-movies-a-year-for-more-money! attitude, the sporadic reintroductions to Ethan Hunt and his adventures only get better with age - they're flashy, but not annoyingly so."

","'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The fifth installment in the popular 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE' action franchise; which is a continuation of the classic 60s and 70s TV show (of the same name). Tom Cruise once again reprises the starring role of Ethan Hunt, head of the 'Impossible Missions Force'. In this adventure the team must take on a rogue criminal organization, called the Syndicate. The film was directed by Cruise's buddy, Christopher McQuarrie; who also directed Cruise in 'JACK REACHER', and co-wrote the screenplays for 'EDGE OF TOMORROW' and 'VALKYRIE' (which also starred Cruise). Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames all reprise roles from other chapters; and they're joined, this time around, by Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris and Alec Baldwin. It's an excellent addition to the series. <br/><br/>The movie opens with a spectacular action scene, involving Ethan Hunt (Cruise), and his team, stopping the sale of nerve gas to terrorists. Hunt next attempts to expose the existence of a rogue terrorist organization, called the Syndicate. He's limited in resources though, when the CIA shuts his team down; and orders Hunt captured and brought in. Hunt goes on the run, while continuing to hunt down the Syndicate; with a little help from his friends.<br/><br/>This is an action series that never lets up, or falters; it's as good now as it was when it began, in 1996. One of the keys to it's continuous success, is the fact that they bring in a new director, with a different perspective, for every installment. Brain De Palma's original film is a classic action movie masterpiece; the series went in a completely different direction when Hong Kong action master John Woo took over, in 2000. Ever since, a new (up- and-coming) filmmaker has made the series seem fresh and continuously captivating (J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird and now McQuarrie). People love to compare it to the James Bond franchise, and I think it's even better (it's much more consistent). Cruise continuously proves himself to be one of the best action film stars ever, and he has a lot of great help; from Pegg and the stunningly gorgeous Rebecca Ferguson (as well as the rest). The movie, like it's predecessors, is awesome; I can't wait for 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE VI'!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaTQgKVh7fQ"
"rosebudfr","8","0","2","18 August 2015"," A good ol' action flick, and an honorable spy thriller
","Movie series usually follow one direction only: downhill, as the creative juice more or less quickly runs out of them. The MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise has escaped this curse, with the series actually getting better and better as we move forward. The reason for this? Whereas franchises usually start out great and then lose their way, the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE series actually began hesitatingly and has only gradually found its footing over time, something most problematic films are not given the chance to do. Well, the first installment should perhaps be put in a different category altogether, because it feels sometimes more like a light, calorie-free (and very uneven) Brian De Palma film than a real MIF flick. The series really started feeling like the real thing with J.J. Abrams' 2006 outing, but even that movie was too uneven (horrible last act, criminally underused villain, underwhelming climax, cheesy ending and perhaps too indebted to ALIAS), to qualify as a good MISSION IMPOSSIBLE adventure. But at least the vibe was there, especially during the Rome operation, which really felt like the real thing (i.e. the brilliant, long-winded set-ups from the TV show). It fell to MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL to at last crack the formula and give audiences a great adventure that felt true to the spirit of MI all the way (starting with the nice addition of a TV series-like opening credits, a nice counterpoint to the traditional JAMES BOND credit sequences). Yet, though the Dubai segment was thrilling (not just the skyscraper climbing thing but also the set-up over the two floors of the hotel, something De Palma could have had a great kick out of) the last act (in Mumbai) was again a let-down (nothing more to reveal, only resolution - for half an hour!).<br/><br/>MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION, in spite of its absurd title (what nation?!), again improves on the last volume, with a textured story full of twists and turns, from the very beginning (Ethan getting briefed on his new mission) to the very end. The story is also choke-full of set-ups, manipulations, betrayals, new layers of mystery every 15 mn or so, and cat-and-mouse games between at least 4 parties. No protracted last act that only serves as a let's-catch-the-bad-guy-and-save-the-world kind of resolution, but a segment (in London) that actually enriches the narrative, keeps the story moving and answers nagging questions that underlay the scenario - with a nice final twist. That, to me, is good screen writing. Sure, not everything makes sense (so, why were they after the Austrian PM? What in the world was the sensitive info doing in an underground facility in Morocco again?), but by and large it works. <br/><br/>What ROGUE NATION does is give the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise an identity, setting it apart from the inescapable JAMES BOND series: this is not just about good action sequences (although they are pretty good, with few gravity-defying, over the top CGIed shots), exotic locales and sexy chicks (although, when the girl comes out of the pool you definitely have a BOND vibe), but also international intrigue and backroom dealings. This is what really defines the spy thriller: lies upon falsehoods upon fabrications, deceit and machinations, double and triple agents, shifting loyalties, the real-politik manoeuvrings of cynical governments, the feeling of a chess game being played among world powers. That's the feeling films like THE THIRD MAN (to a degree), THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD or the recent superb TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY conveyed. Not JAMES BOND fantasies or JACK RYAN-esque, Tom Clancy-inspired rubbish, but John Le Carré-fueled tales of deceit and intrigue. Sure, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is still a very far cry from Le Carré (!!), *but* there's a vibe of international intrigue and layered mystery to it that strengthens the film, is all I'm sayin'.<br/><br/>Another nice touch is the fragility of Ethan Hunt (something GHOST PROTOCOL again introduced), who actually needs his team and is no superman. This is still a Tom Cruise vehicle, yes, but the film rightly insists Hunt is first and foremost a good brain before being a good hand, and somebody who actually can get manipulated himself and who would lose - and die - without his fellow agents. I also enjoyed seeing a female character that's actually not a damsel-in-distress waiting to fall in love with our hero, the lack of family-is-what-matters-most dreck that is so pervasive in the summer blockbuster realm (JURASSIC WORLD and ANT MAN, I'm looking at ya), or the absence of super-heroes and fantastical elements for that matter. ROGUE NATION's marketing emphasizes the realness of the stunts and action sequences (much like the new STAR WARS - yet another J.J. Abrams thing, who's producing this - is highlighting its own 'realness'), and with good reason. <br/><br/>Not everything is perfect here, granted, the series still has troubles coming up with a convincing, fleshed-out bad guy and motivation for his misdeeds (see the absurd McGuffin in the third episode), and I could really do without the silly ""Vienna, Austria"" or ""London, England"" thing (""Americans don't know nothing' "" is what I keep hearing), but as far as blockbusters go this is convincing work."
"ethanwei","7","0","2","17 August 2015"," Not as good as the previous
","I'm starting to wonder if it's either recent movies are over-hyped or overall public standards lowered... but this episode of the MI series pales when compared to its predecessors.<br/><br/>I'll keep the spoilers to a minimum. As usual, our hero receives his quest in a message that detonates in 5 seconds, but this time it ends a little different. The antagonist organization was then revealed and the mastermind identified, then that's when the things get weird and the movie becomes less satisfying because the plot and the storyline failed in logic:<br/><br/>1. Frankly, the mastermind and the opposing faction didn't really feel all that intimidating 2. The mission didn't feel all that ""impossible"" when compared to previous movies 3. Lack of intimacy between the hero and the heroine, seriously you don't really even need Tom Cruise for this 4. This episode intends to wrap up a storyline carried from previous episodes, and the ending felt lackluster<br/><br/>This all reminded me too well of 007: Skyfall... I even fell asleep in the movie for 15 minutes! Not sure if there will be a new episode in another two years to fix this but I can tell you right now that it's better off for you to skip the theatres for Rogue Nation and wait for it to be available on TV."

"lesleyharris30","9","0","2","17 August 2015"," An Absolute Delight for all Fans of Action and Spy Thrillers,
","Mission: Impossible- Rogue Nation is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. You would expect a film series to be getting tiring by its fifth installment, but the Mission: Impossible series seems to only be getting better, and I would honestly say this is the best one yet, it's like the Empire Strikes Back of this series, as it is certainly the darkest one to date, much less light hearted moments that the first four, and we see these characters in a position worse than they've ever been previously, it's great that the film makers are doing something different with these movies every time and not just recycling stuff that worked previously. The only thing I felt this movie needed was more character development for Ilsa Faust, I really liked this character and Rebecca Ferguson's performance was very impressive, but I left the movie feeling like we could have learned more about her, she was a blank canvas from the beginning, and we do learn more about her as the film progresses, but I left feeling like I didn't know enough, I hope to see Ferguson return for sequels. The cast is outstanding and these type of films could never work without a good one as they are very character driven, Tom Cruise is still a delight to watch Cruise portray Ethan Hunt even after nearly twenty years, there is no indication that he is getting bored of playing him, and thankfully it dosen't look like he'll be finished anytime soon, Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner get to shine here even more than they did in Ghost Protocol, as well as regular cast member Ving Rhames, and of course there are magnificent performances from newcomers Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin and Sean Harris, this series is great at bringing in new actors in a way that offers something fresh that differentiates itself from previous installments. Action packed and will keep you at the edge of your seat all the way through, I would recommend Mission: Impossible- Rogue Nation to anyone looking for a good action or thriller. <br/><br/>Ethan and his crew must take on the Syndicate, an organisation intent on destroying the IMF. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Cruise Worst Performance: Hermione Corfield"

","By now, the films of Mission Impossible franchise have a rather similar template. Against great odds, the man of the moment, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) delivers, thriving in impossible situations.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is worth a watch. Tom Cruise does it again. Kudos to the man, he sets the limit too high even by his standards. No doubt, his legion of loyal fans, and especially those in India, will forever be impressed. And the performances of Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg add a chilly charm and deserved weight for the film. The former is superb and acts as a perfect match for Ethan Hunt! Oh, Sean Harris as the head of the Syndicate is Cool!<br/><br/>So, I had a very good time watching this flick. Right from the word start, it pumps up the adrenaline and generates a fast paced action, that surely is what we call ""Paisa-Vasool"" in India! Thus the franchise delivers again, and does good in satisfying the unquenching thirst of it's fans.<br/><br/>But, unknowingly and involuntarily, comparisons come to the fore, and it is not the best film of the franchise!"

","Nowt wrong with a good Tom Cruise action romp that doesn't take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>It's a strong enough film to stand up even without the much-hyped jet plane stunt - clearly the filmmakers were confident enough to get that out of the way right at the beginning. Of course the film benefits from the fact Cruise did all his own stunts and driving, but the plot and the performances from the rest of the cast kept my interest in between these impressive set-pieces. <br/><br/>The overall message of the film, of course, seems to be ""USA continues to protect the world even though its allies are turning against her."" *rolls eyes*<br/><br/>So anyway... It's a popcorn flick that doesn't disappoint. Nothing earth-shattering or genre-defining, but - unlike many films of this type - it never feels like it's been lazily made.

"Al_The_Strange","8","0","2","16 August 2015"," Mission Impossible Rogue Nation Review
","In Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, there was a brief mention of a new mission, before Ethan disappears into a cloud of steam. In his fifth adventure, Ethan would go face-to-face with the ""Rogue Nation,"" a Syndicate so threatening that it threatens the world powers and forces Ethan and the team to face their toughest challenge yet.<br/><br/>This mission has its share of incredible peril. Once again, the entire IMF is rendered useless (this time out of political squabbling among the Intelligence Community), forcing the heroes to go off on their own off the grid to find the threat and use their limited resources to stop it. In their struggles, the characters have to infiltrate an impossibly secure facility, which involves Ethan swimming through a water-filled computer core. Given the physical threat and the physical feats involved, this scene is genuinely gripping. There is a pretty cool motorcycle chase in the middle of the movie. There are shootouts and fights. It all amounts to a complex cat-and-mouse chase, in the same vein as Skyfall, but with a bigger emphasis on deception. The push and pull and mindgames may need some suspension of disbelief - it seems as though Ethan can somehow plan for the most incredible of plot twists in advance and always come out with an even more elaborate plan - but it is fun to watch it all play out.<br/><br/>The story has its worthy moments. The premise is naturally thrilling, as the IMF team confronts great stakes once again. Ethan and the others have become a familiar family by now, and they remain endearing characters. What makes them stand out more now will be the themes of trust, especially with everyone questioning William Brandt's loyalty and what Ilsa Faust's motives are. Faust is a lovely new character caught in the middle of a tricky spy game, and her situation elicits decent empathy. Behind it all is a fairly menacing villain, who comes out as Ethan's direct foil; a mastermind terrorist who becomes obsessed with outwitting the IMF and becoming a true rogue nation.<br/><br/>Despite all the twists, the story does suffer a little. For a movie about a ""rogue nation,"" I expected something bigger, like an actual nation of rogues or something. I expected the villains to have a grander level of influence and infrastructure, but they turned out to be a limited number of well-armed and well-funded men out for petty vengeance. The film ultimately doesn't reach the same level of stakes, personal or political, that were represented in MI:III or MI: GP. On top of that, the film seems to drop everything regarding Ethan's wife, obliterating any character arc that had developed. There are a few scenes that seem a little too incredible, especially in how convoluted the mindgames become. The opening sequence is too short for my liking (I actually wish the plane stunt was somewhere in the middle of the movie, so it would give us all something incredible to look forward to). Regardless, this film is a fine spy thriller, but not the all-out MI extravaganza I would have expected.<br/><br/>This film boasts good, but rarely exceptional, photography. Editing tends to be rather fast. Tom Cruise is still apt as Ethan Hunt. Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Ving Rhames are fun to watch. I thought Rebecca Ferguson was perfectly lovely in her role. Sean Harris is a pretty decent villain. Alec Baldwin plays a pretty grumpy dude in his role (and coming from a man who once played Jack Ryan, I find his character a bit too unreasonable and unlikable). Writing is okay. This production uses pretty good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are okay. Stunts are good. Locales are pretty good, but they don't really stand out as much as in other movies. The music score seemed really bombastic, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is far from my favorite of the series. I personally wish the plot wasn't quite as implausible. I wish the nature of the ""rogue nation"" was different. I wish that a bunch of other little things could be altered. Despite my petty complaints, it is entertaining and worth a look.<br/><br/>4/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)"
"fabiolpinheiro1993","9","0","2","16 August 2015"," The best one in the franchise in terms of story, but not the best overall, it has less action than expected.
","Mission Impossible is one of my absolute favourite film franchises, on top of Tom Cruise being my favourite actor, one that dedicates himself like no other, to every one of his films, from incredible performances to insane stunts no one else would dare to do. With every entry in the franchise they manage to surprise me and Ghost Protocol is my favourite of all. So my expectations for this sequel were very high, and...<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the film. But Ghost Protocol remains my favourite. The script is just amazing, the story and plot are the best ones in the franchise, by far, the dialogue is terrific, witty, funny, smart, powerful, and much more, the story is just beyond super smart, there's a twist and turn every 5 minutes, sometimes even less, it's so involving, it grabs your attention from the very first moment and never lets go until the end, which definitely leaves you wanting a lot more films.<br/><br/>The Characters are amazing as usual, Alec Baldwin shines a lot, but Rebecca Ferguson is the one who steals the show, as a character you never really know if its good or bad. The villain its excellent, the biggest match for Ethan until now. Siman Pegg gets to shine brighter than ever, but Jeremy renner and Ving Rhames get sidelined a lot, which is a shame. Tom Cruise perhaps gives the best performance in the franchise since the first. <br/><br/>The action was my only problem with this film, it has an amazing opening thats will stand as one of the most insane stunts ever, but The director no matter how great he is doesn't has the skills for action required, as he wastes the insane stunt by Tom, his camera shots waste a lot of action scenes, that could be even greater. The action is awesome, though, there's insane fight choreographers and cars and bikes scenes are insane. <br/><br/>But ultimately there's not enough action, mainly in the climax, which aside from running and some fighting there's nothing else, its an insane climax in terms of suspense, thriller, twists, but no action, and i think it takes a little of its wonder. I think the director gave so much attention to the story that sidelined the action. <br/><br/>This is by far the best one in the franchise in terms of story and plot, with twists and suspense to spare, but this is because the director doesn't have the skills to make a full action movie, despite having some of the best ever action scenes they are in general wasted and there's not enough of them. This is my only reason not to give a perfect 10 to this film, but ultimately this one will prove to be the favourite to everyone else, to me Ghost protocol remains my favourite and better one yet."
"paul_3-960-896774","8","0","2","16 August 2015"," The best one so far?
","In the last 10 years, I have sit through 4 of the Mission Impossible films and I loved them. Growing up Tom Cruise was The MI guy for me, that's how I knew him before anything else. So when MI:5 was announced I was very excited and I wanted to go back to all of them starting from MI: Ghost Protocol but doing that I realized that these movies were not memorable. I mean, I remembered how they made me feel but I hardly remembered any specifics about the movies. The other crazy thing was that some of them - MI:2 & MI:1 - didn't really hold up, that's when I started to get a bit worried about Rogue Nation.<br/><br/>The storyline did little to subside my worries but I was mostly in, and what a surprise it was. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, is mind-blowing, action packed, and gripping to the end. It managed to make me reevaluating the situation the whole way through. Nothing was exactly as they seemed or as I predicted, no matter how small it was there was always some details that I didn't see coming. I sometime watch movies with a clear ideas of what's coming and that doesn't stop me from enjoying these films - if the execution and the acting is solid - but in this case I only roughly guessed how things would play out. So there was room for surprises and I liked that.<br/><br/>Speaking about surprises, Sean Harris was pretty good in the movie, I'm not saying that I'm shocked, but I was surprised to see him in a role like this and I'm glad he pulled it off. It's almost the same thing with Alec Baldwin, they managed to make his role a little bit more interesting than the stereotypical type these characters usually are. But the biggest surprise is Rebecca Ferguson, I still can't believe that it's the same woman from the mini-series The White Queen. She's fascinating and mysterious in the movie, not that the latest MI films have a bad track record with female leads but this one is probably the best out of all of them. <br/><br/>MI: Rogue nation was a fun, entertaining movie going experience.<br/><br/>@wornoutspines"
"lasttimeisaw","7","0","2","16 August 2015"," a successful fifth entry of a popular movie franchise
","I have watched the fifth vehicle of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series in the local IMAX screen, superb experience! It is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, an Oscar-winning writer for THE USUAL SUSPECTS (1995, 8/10) and previously directed another Cruise's action flick JACK REACHER (2012). The first surprise comes to pass rather immediately when the opening gambit actually is the heavily-marketed stunt of Cruise's Ethan Hunt hanging outside an Airbus A400M during its takeoff, unlike in its predecessor MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL (2011), the tour-de-force of Cruise's awe-inspiring endeavour of conquering the world's tallest building in Dubai, which is deployed in the middle section with much more anticipation. In fact it generates an effective adrenaline rush and kick-starts Hunt and his teams' globe-trotting escapades. <br/><br/>Yes, Ethan goes rogue again, and IMF (Impossible Mission Force), under the operation of William Brandt (Renner), is again being dissolved thanks to the insistence of CIA director Alan Hunley (Baldwin). After being captured by Solomon Lane (Harris), the head of a mysterious criminal syndicate, and a narrow escape with the aid of a British double agent Ilsa Faust (Ferguson), who is undercover for MI6. Ethan is dedicated to prove the syndicate's existence in order to save IMF. He recruits computer expert Benji (Pegg) to stop an assassination in Vienna which Lane is the mastermind behind, which fails epically. Later, they will have to accomplish another trademark MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE in Casablanca where Brandt and Luther (Rhames) also belatedly participate, and then stage a caper with the involvement of Prime Minster of Britain (Holland) and Alan's presence, who is there to timely witness the divulgence of the syndicate's background and finally, Hunt has to save Benji, who has been held as a hostage (an ever-corny last second countdown) by Lane and after a challenging mind game and an ensuing night chase in the London alleys, the movie ends with Hunt pulling off a self-congratulatory tit-for-tat to Lane.<br/><br/>The plot actually doesn't matter that much as long as the set pieces are excellent enough for audience's ever-demanding satisfaction nurtured by a successful franchise, well, one must admit, it is crafted with admiring brilliance with the high point of the opera house shooting chapter, a super clever move is to graft the action sequences on Puccini's TURANDOT, an opera whose central story revolves around solving puzzles with death at the stake, and the culmination in NESSUN DORMA sparks off a terrific frisson of both thrilling and contentment, a series' best endeavour! <br/><br/>Another refreshing element is the addition of a badass female character equal to Hunt, not just an objectified foil, Ferguson's Ilsa Faust is every bit in the centre of the happenings as Ethan, she even saves his life in the pivotal moment, Ferguson's enigmatic charisma and stunning appeal is the showstopper, whereas Ilsa's loyalty becomes the pendulum perpetually hanging in the air, all the more, in the final showdown, her close-range knife combat with the henchman Bone Doctor (Hultén) is more enthralling than Cruise's scheme. Plus, there is no cheesy romance between her and Hunt, unlike Cruise and Emily Blunt in EDGE OF TOMORROW (2014). And Hunt is not James Bond, he is never flirtatious, all his intention is to finish the daunting task and never leave his buddies behind, call it bromance in the team if you want, but you know he will never give up Benji for anything, Cruise is as engaging as ever and not everyone buys his star appeal but we must respect his gallantry and the devotion to surpass himself for higher accomplishments, again and again. <br/><br/>Among the supporting cast, it is a good sign that the film doles out some action duty To Pegg too in the fieldwork, apart from his usual comical function; Renner, on the contrary, doesn't give anything to show his expertise apart from paying lip service to the bureaucracy; and as the villain, Sean Harris exerts to beam with menace in his mumbling utterance, but as his predestined fate and the wayward obstinacy of never willing to kill our hero when he has the chance, he is as good as we can expect from a not so larger-than-life merciless criminal.<br/><br/>As a successful fifth entry of a popular movie franchise has spanned almost two-decades thus far, it is comforting that the picture's success has already green-lit a follow-up, and my only plea is to keep Ferguson in it. Age is just a number for Cruise, and time will prove that he is a much adept action star than Liam Neeson when he edges near the latter's current age, yet one still wonders, will we ever see him back in the spotlight for some meaty work requires more challenging acting chops?"

Tom Cruise is hanging off a plane for crying out loud!!!! Simon Pegg is HILARIOUS and gets a bigger chunk of the action this time too and newcomer Rebecca Ferguson is nothing short of BA. If you're considering seeing this film, just do it! It's a thrill ride and keeps you wondering, what will happen next?"

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>A rogue international organisation known as the Syndicate aim to dismantle the IMF and control the world in secrecy. Ethan (Tom Cruise) and his team must take on the seemingly impossible task to uncover the secret organisation and stop them before their influence grows. MI Rogue Nation, has all the right ingredients for a fun summer blockbuster: thrilling action, memorable villain, humour, intrigue of uncertain allegiances, and Tom Cruise unnecessarily risking his life doing stunts for the awe of the audience. Together these ingredients work so well for majority of the movie, but at one point too much of one of these aspects starts to leave a hint of a bad aftertaste. Nevertheless, as a whole the movie is a satisfying ride to be enjoyed with some buttery popcorn goodness.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I loved the last Mission: Impossible so no-brainer I was really looking forward for Rogue Nation. After the Burj Khalifa scene, it was hard to imagine how they'd recapture that thrill ride. Somehow they have managed to pull it off again.<br/><br/>Say what you will about Tom Cruise in his personal life, but he is a born action-star, and for an action movie that's all that matters. The way he puts himself through these incredible stunts, is what brings so much excitement to the movie. These scenes could've had a faceless stuntman and it would have been acceptable, but the fact that we see Cruise and know that he is really hanging on to that plane, really driving the bike in a high speed chase, brings a sense of realism that can't be duplicated in any other way. That is by far the most impressive part of the movie. The rest of the cast were also integral to the story, nobody felt wasted. The stand-outs however, has to be the newcomers Rebecca Ferguson and Sean Harris. Ferguson plays a British agent, a skilled assassin whose allegiance is not exactly clear. She is not a damsel in distress and could kick everyone's ass just as effectively as Ethan Hunt. Sean Harris is the face behind the Syndicate, a great villain that really challenges Ethan with ease. Villains haven't always been a strong point for MI movies but Harris brought this modern twist to an almost old-school Bond like villain.<br/><br/>As I said I had fun with this movie but I can't ignore the major problem. Switching allegiances and hidden agendas of characters are pretty par for the course in MI movies. So including these scenes is not my complaint, but it's the overuse that's the issue. The first few times it adds uncertainty into the mix, making the film more intriguing. But at one point every character start to switch allegiances or reveal their own secret goals so regularly that it starts to feel very contrived. All these twists just boil down to conveniences that move the plot along. I would've preferred that these twists were natural outcome of the plot rather than a quick fix for plot holes.<br/><br/>In the end, if you are looking for a summer action blockbuster, MI Rogue Nation is definitely a good choice. Some of most gripping set- pieces of the summer are in this movie, especially the car/bike chase in Morocco. In my opinion Ghost Protocol was a better film overall but Rogue Nation is still a worthy addition to the franchise."

","The year 2015 is again all about sequels (Age of Ultron, Furious 7, Jurassic World), every studio is trying to prove who has the most successful franchise not only financially but how well it was received by the audience. Just take a look at Terminator Genysis, it did double its production budget and yet to open in China but it was panned by a lot of critics. Well luckily the Rogue Nation is nothing like that; it is a solid entry to the Mission Impossible franchise. We see the return of Tom Cruise as the titular Ethan Hunt, Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt. <br/><br/>Spoilers ahead<br/><br/>The film started off where the Ghost Protocol left off and Ethan Hunt is wanted for questions as if we haven't seen that before. We were then introduced an organization named the Syndicate, a beta program introduced by the British Government, in simple term an anti-IMF as mentioned by Benji in the trailer.. In a nutshell, the IMF saves the day and gets reinstated with a new Mr. Secretary. Does this sound familiar? This is exactly the plot of Skyfall, where we had rogue MI6 agents vs James Bond and we get a new M. <br/><br/>The action sequences are beautifully shot and I really have to praise Tom Cruise for his stunts especially on the roof of the military aircraft though in my opinion they are not as appealing or as the climbing of the Burg Khalifa in Ghost Protocol. They are trying too hard to top the last entry!<br/><br/>As a direct sequel to the 4th film, there were little to no further character development for the rest of the team. They were just there but didn't contribute much to the overall story and I don't recall any major scene for William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) after they introduced him as a skilled agent out of retirement. I would like to see more of him teaming up with Ethan Hunt in the future.. Just like talks been going on with Renner teaming up with Damon for future Bourne movies..<br/><br/>To conclude the Rogue Nation is definitely a must see movie for the holiday season and the good news is we don't have to wait long for the 6th entry. How many good 5th films are out there honestly? I can only recall Fast Five in recent years.."

","After watching the trailer, I was really into seeing this movie.I have not always been a big fan of Mission Impossible but after seeing Ghost Protocol, I was hooked onto the series and could not wait for this movie.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise once again provides another grand action performance, this movie truly makes him the true definition of an action star.Supporting is Simon Pegg once again with his very witty performance providing very much needed comedy (especially the car flip scene).Alec Baldwin is also a great addition, and provides a great performance supporting the action hero, Ethan Hunt.And goodness,Rebecca Ferguson is very beautiful but is not only used for eye candy, by providing a great performance.<br/><br/>The action was truly amazing and well made, with great useful cinematography (POV Shots were awesome addition).You can tell Tom Cruise really put it all into the role, where the movie would usually need CGI (Airplane Scene) Tom Cruise risks his life to make things look real, and that is true 100% acting.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie provides us again with another witty action blockbuster (Edge of Tomorrow from 2014), with providing awesome action scenes with witty dialogue (a perfect combination).Christopher McQuarrie truly shows how to make a summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>It was exactly what I wanted from a summer blockbuster, but got even more than what I wanted for a Mission Impossible movie (which is a good thing). This was much better than Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron from early this year, because it provides humor in good places, and does not seem forced. If only every blockbuster was this fun."
"Shengalang","8","0","2","14 August 2015"," ~~Tom Cruise doing what he does best~~
","Tom Cruise is the craziest actor in the world. You have to admire that kind of dedication he has for his craft; you know he loves what he does. Doing his own stunts is what is making Mission Impossible differ from other spy movies like James Bond. Seeing a close-up of his facial expressions as the action went on really pulls you into the scene. One thing you can't deny is that this movie is filled an immense amount of action. Fight scenes, assassinations, car chases, gun fights; this movie has it all! If you enjoyed the previous Mission Impossible movies, then you can't go wrong with this one because it brings the game to a whole new level. Whoever decided to make Simon Pegg the main supporting actor is a genius! Every word that came out of his mouth was hilarious.<br/><br/>The reason that I took off a star for this movie was because of the predictability of the story. Like many spy movies, the story-line just seemed so generic. An evil organization tries to cause trouble for the world and its up to the world's best secret agent to try and take them down. On the way he falls in love with a beautiful female assassin and they team up to try and foil the plans of said evil organization (roll eyes).<br/><br/>In conclusion, even though the story line was predictable, it didn't take away from the whole experience of watching the movie. Some of the supporting casts were great even though they seemed to provide more of a comedic relief than actually having an impact on the show, and Tom Cruise performed phenomenal as ever."

","The newest movie in the franchise gives the action that you've been expecting from the creators of this super-packed action, thrilling movie.<br/><br/>I'm gonna peak on what I experienced when I watched this movie and what elements that gave the movie life. First things first; Mission Impossible is all about that crazy Tom Cruise stunts you've seen in the other movies; it's simply brilliant and somewhat funny; but still lifts you off the chair when the sequence comes.<br/><br/>What I like about the series, and this movie, is that you always get what you expected for; in a good a good way. The plot is very simple and follows simple rules of plot-writing; we have a somewhat of a superhero, a ""friend"" that turned villain, cool gadgets, he gets the girls, drives a fancy BMW et.c., that makes a great action-movie; just like what Die Hard franchise did for us but in a more simple way.<br/><br/>The classic elements from the other movies in the franchise is implemented as well in this movie in a brilliant way. I mean, who wouldn't want a face-change, but with a twist, and another twist.<br/><br/>I did not give this movie an eight, because I feel like it tripped on the plot somewhat, it feels like you know what's gonna happen and when it's gonna happen; but don't misjudge me; it's a great movie to watch if you want some laughter and to feel that intense burn when the action hits you right in the face, it's just lovely.<br/><br/>In other words, it's a great comedy-, cinematic- and action-packed movie."
"brendandevere","6","0","1","14 August 2015"," Possibly Good. Not Great.
","Your mission if you choose to except it is to spend 131 minutes in a cinema of your choice watching Tom and his mates save the world. There are insane action scenes, outrageous high speed chases, gunfights, explosions and lethal hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>I have never fully engaged myself into the world of the IMF and their top operative, Ethan Hunt. It's probably because I have never accepted that Tom Cruise could genuinely be a spy and it is this bias that has hindered my appreciation for the Mission Impossible film series. The original film was brilliant but then came the diabolical sequel and my hunger for M.I. never returned. It took me a long time to watch the third instalment which brought the series back to form thanks to an outstanding performance from the recently past Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ghost Protocol continued the momentum perfectly. Are they in the same class as the rebooted 007 films or the superb Jason Bourne Trilogy?<br/><br/>Rogue Nation sees Cruise return as Ethan Hunt but not all is well with the IMF. The head of the CIA (Alec Baldwin) wants the organisation shut down or absorbed by the powerful Central Intelligence Agency, claiming Hunt and his mates have been causing too much collateral damage. Ethan has been on the trail of a rogue outfit calling themselves ""The Syndicate"", but there is no proof that they even exist. With the CIA after him, Ethan Hunt disappears then recruits his team to track down the ""Rogue Nation"".<br/><br/>All the usual suspects are back in Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames but it is Alec Baldwin's cameo appearance that leaves a lasting impression, delivering the best lines and adding a bit of grit to the film that can at times fall into the trap of becoming a movie about Tom and his buddies killing people and conversing in a bit of banter. The performance of Cruise seemed a little bit off as though he was tired of the series but ironically it comes across as a little less annoying.<br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson plays a double agent of sorts who needs to play both sides of the coin to stay alive in the dangerous world of espionage. Her appearance at the opera wearing a stunning yellow gown cannot be ignored and neither can her performance as she brings a great back story to the film that could have quite easily gotten lost for its need to deliver non stop action.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie who directed Cruise in ""Jack Reacher"" delivers a film that is fast paced and entertaining. Rogue Nation has done what it set out to do and that was to give the audience a thoroughly enjoyable package that doesn't require the viewer to think too much. It is a good film without being great and fits into the M.I. pantheon in the middle. Better than M.I.2. but not as good as M.I.3."

","""Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation"" is the best Summer Blockbuster of the year. Very fun, entertaining, tense and has Wit. It's a film of two halves. The 1st half it has all the great action sequences and the 2nd half it's a battle of wits and has all the spy espionage stuff. Tom Cruise proves once again why he is an Icon. By doing his own stunts and always being charismatic and likable. Rebecca Ferguson who played Ilsa deserves major praise. She was a legitimate Bad Ass female. She was able to be tough, mysterious and alluring and still maintained her femininity. She wasn't some skinny actress beating up men twice her size. She actual took quite a beating in some scenes. She was easily the best female character of the whole franchise. The Villain wasn't very complex but he did do some despicable things so you wanted to see him get his Ass whopped. Overall it's everything you want from an Action movie. Run like ""Tom Cruise"" to the Cinema to see it. 8.5/10"

","The Mission Impossible franchise has been getting better and better. I personally liked this one a lot more than I expected. It's no masterpiece but it's the perfect summer action- thriller. The actors all played solid performances. Tom Cruise was back in his role as Ethan Hunt and as always, he did a great job. Simon Pegg having a more comedic role and Jeremy Renner having a more serious than in MI4 fitted well. The actor who plays the main villain also did a great job and I liked it that this villain had a pretty strange side to him. <br/><br/>The plot is not overcomplicated but has some nice twists that I didn't see coming. For example ""spoiler ahead"" when they were talking to the prime minister and it was reveled Hunt was disguised as the guy from the secret service. Also, there weren't really any potholes.<br/><br/>The action was fun and there luckily wasn't a lot of shaky cam. All action scene were intense and done realistic. I liked the paste as well. <br/><br/>Every movie has some flaws though. I didn't like the ending that much, because at the end, the enemy suddenly becomes insane and runs after Cruise, shoots at him even though a minute ago he said to not kill Cruise and than the villain obviously runs in to a easily avoidable trap."

"drawlife","8","0","2","12 August 2015"," The ageless Tom Cruise does it again.
","Tom Cruise continues to prove he is a capable action star for his age. Plus he doesn't even look 53 years old. <br/><br/>The role of Ethan Hunt is belongs to Tom Cruise. Ethan Hunt is America's 007, and there will come a time when the Mission: Impossible franchise will reboot and recast, but not any time soon. Cruise effortlessly slides back into the role and his performance is again spot on. This franchise keeps getting better and better. I wasn't totally huge on the first two, which aren't terrible, but since J.J. Abrams took over in Mission: Impossible III, all the films since then have lived up to my expectations. <br/><br/>This time around Ethan Hunt has to stop and prove that the rouge nation of spies and killers known as the Syndicate who kill to order. Their leader Solomon Lane is played by Sean Harris, and he does a good job oozing creepiness through his calm and intimidating demeanor. However he wasn't as memorable as I had hoped. The small nitpick about the Mission: Impossible films are that the villains don't feel as memorable, not since Philip Seymour Hoffman. Even in Ghost Protocol, Michael Nyqvist wasn't quite as memorable. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is good, Simon Pegg keeps getting more work since his appearance in the third entry. He obviously provides comic relief and has nice banter with Cruise and the others. Jeremy Renner also has a decent returning role, but it's a lot more reduced compared to Ghost Protocol. This time around he does more talking than fighting. He does have one car chase sequence, but he really doesn't have an action sequence which was a tad disappointing to me. It was also nice to see Ving Rhames return after being reduced to a cameo in Ghost Protocol. <br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson an actor I haven't even heard of came out of nowhere and kicked a lot of butt. However, I wasn't completely sold on her role, compared to Paula Patton, she seemed a little one noted for my taste, but her action scenes are top notch. I was pleasantly surprised with Alec Baldwin's character. He didn't end up being the character I thought he'd be. He almost in a way plays the same role Laurence Fishburne plays in the third film. <br/><br/>Aside from some of the minor nitpicks it's a very solid summer film. To see Tom Cruise hold on to an airplane taking off, ride motorcycles, escape from being captured, fighting bad guys, shooting a gun and looking good running, you can't help but to cheer for him and hope that he saves the day. The action sequences dazzle, you'll be on the edge of your seat. I also normally don't like chase sequences but I haven't been this entertained by a chase sequence in a long while. It's very pulse pounding. There's plenty to enjoy in this film. <br/><br/>8.5/10"

"robsta23","8","0","2","12 August 2015"," Okay For a While, Then a Great Third Act
","While the opening of the film featured a very cool stunt involving Tom Cruise actually hanging on the side of an airplane (with a huge strap digitally removed, of course) it was very abrupt and felt like any average action sequence from the series so far, so after that I wasn't very excited and had to wonder what this film had in store for the rest of it.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt faces one of his toughest challenges yet: instead of being called upon for a mission by IMF, his mission briefing at the beginning is actually a challenge by an organization known as the Syndicate, which is basically a ""nation"" of rogue agents who have joined forces, hence the title. While you think this would be a great premise for action and tension it doesn't really pay off until the third act, which I will get to later.<br/><br/>The writers of this film really seemed to not know what they wanted from the leading lady. In the scene which introduces her, we understand she wants to help IMF though she is posing as a member of the Syndicate. She explains to Hunt that for him to continue his effort against the Syndicate she needs the Syndicate to trust her. After this, there are moments where it is clear she is on the side of the IMF team, though the writers through curveballs left and right for us to question her loyalty, which isn't confusing, just really annoying. It is even confusing when people from London come into play with her and they basically screw her over, ridding her of the Macguffin of the film, which they know she needs to earn the Syndicate's trust. Do they just want her dead? Did they plan that so the villain wouldn't get what he needs? So not only is it a question of who she is loyal to, but who really trusts her as well.<br/><br/>The third act of the film is great, as one of the scenes is particularly tense - perhaps the most tense scene from the entire series, and the way the conflict of the film gets resolved is dark, clever, and fitting in that it parallels a scene at the very beginning of the film. I'm trying to avoid spoilers as much as I can, but you'll know what I'm talking about if you see the movie.<br/><br/>Maybe I just have to rewatch this in order to appreciate it as a whole, but the third act of this film is probably one of the best third acts I've seen from an action film period. It is probably in my top 2 of the Mission Impossible series, though that isn't saying it's necessarily great, but pretty good.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"
"rsabnis1","6","0","2","12 August 2015"," Replete with thrills and chills, Mission Impossible 5 makes you crave for more....
","The latest instalment of Mission impossible franchise celebrates Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt) as an action hero more than the story which itself provides a structure to Ethan Hunt's ways of working with fictional organization IMF( Impossible Mission Force). Directed by the screenwriter of 'The Usual Suspects', it is hard to believe that Christopher McQuarrie ever had some brilliant ideas. Honestly as a viewer I was dissatisfied with the screenplay. However the edge-of- the-seat action sequences acted as a savior in disguise.<br/><br/>The story involves a wicked replica of the IMF called 'The Syndicate', a criminal organization trained to bring down the IMF, as they stealthily go on killing leaders in bombings and assassinations to bring about the 'change' in the world. A Senate committee meanwhile dissolves the IMF, availing the efforts of William Brandt and granting the leftover assets to the CIA with Ethan Hunt on their prime target list. Now Hunt is left with only one job that is to prove that The Syndicate falls within the bounds of realism and is not merely the creation of his own. The Syndicate controlled by bespectacled and spooky Solomon Lane who is pursued by Ethan with his old sidekick tech-expert Benji and gorgeous Ilsa Faust to bring The Syndicate to ground.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible: The Rogue Nation provides the viewers with a glitzy appeal taking on a tour to Vienna, Casablanca and London and some promisingly heart-wrenching stunts and fights. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt faces more serious and complicated obstacles to reach his coveted aim. He keeps you startled as he holds to a flying plane and his dear life waiting for Benji to open its door. He jumps in thousands of gallons of pressurized water to change to break into the data facility; he pursues on bike in high speed chase sequences and really keeps you engaged till the very end.<br/><br/>MI 5 was pure adrenaline as McQuarrie succeeded brilliantly in keeping the weak script concealed behind the nail-biting thrills that gratify the action-movie lovers to the extent that they certainly crave for the sixth installment. I personally think it should have connected well to the past ventures apart from the characters. However the film takes care of everything that MI series has boasted of in the past including flashy tech gadgets and stunts. And lastly, the credit to MI5 being an unarguably successful installment goes to Tom Cruise who has defied age and fueled the execution of the screenplay brilliantly. <br/><br/>6 on 10 stars"

","Typically film series that churn out sequel after sequel end up with weak, watered-down remnants of what once was. Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible series, continues to defy this trend. Not only is this a great addition to the Mission: Impossible series; it might be the best one yet.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise delivers yet another exemplary performance displaying what the world's greatest action star has to offer. The film starts off with another one of Cruise's almost-too-crazy-to-watch stunts by running across the top of and eventually riding on the side of an airplane as it takes off. He rides this high throughout the rest of the film during shootouts, car chases, fist-fights, and more. It doesn't take an expert to tell that he put 110% into this role.<br/><br/>While every member of Cruise's supporting cast delivers a solid performance, the one performance worth noting definitely belongs to Rebecca Ferguson. Everyone talks about Cruise performing his own stunts, but did you know that she performed her own as well? She was also equally as tough and intelligent as Cruise throughout the course of the film. Her character even avoided falling into a romantic relationship with Cruise, a common cliché that often ruins female costars in action films. Simon Pegg's role was also expanded from the last two films. His jokes always delivered, and he even contributed a bit in the field!<br/><br/>The villain is nearly as important as the spy or super hero in any given film. Solomon Lane, portrayed by Sean Harris, isn't a revolutionary or unique character, but his believably and coldness make him into a menacing villain. I was particularly fond of the more subtle details that made this character so intimidating, mainly the eye twitching that would develop whenever a particularly difficult situation would present itself or the soft, rage-filled cheek stroke he gave Ferguson in his second most enraged moment.<br/><br/>The scene that stands out the most isn't the over-advertised ""plane ride"" or appropriately under-advertised underwater stunt. Without spoiling too much, Hunt is put up against three well-trained snipers in an opera. The cinematography is top-notch, the action is in perfect synchronization with the music, and the tension only worsens much to our delight. It's easily one of my favorite scenes from the entire series.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a high-octane action thriller that doesn't rely as heavily on spectacle over substance despite what the trailers might advertise. The writing and plot are both sound and unpredictable, the acting is top-notch, and the action is entertaining as always. This film delivers in every facet of the game."

","""I've heard stories about you, but they can't all be true."" It's understandable for someone within the ""Mission: Impossible"" universe to say this, skeptical of the many adventures of Ethan Hunt. In what may be the most consistently exciting franchise ever, he has been thrown onto a moving train, leapt between two skyscrapers, and scaled the tallest building the world, and that's only a few of his escapades. With Rogue Nation, the high-octane stunts-extravaganza is continued with operatic skill and thrill. What should be just another generic spy film is made cheer-worthy through crowd-pleasing action and loads of slick fun. Much of the success rests on Cruise's shoulders. He is easily one of the most committed stars in Hollywood, continuing the wonderful 2015 trend of practical effects, doing many of his own stunts. Our hearts pound because we sense the very real danger these people are in. Though Rogue Nation may not have the single greatest combat scene in the franchise, it gives you the most bang-for-your-buck, rarely letting up long enough to let you catch your breath. When it does slow down, the tension is often cut beautifully by the cast, whose comedic beats between the excitement bring a nice respite. Otherwise, when the movie quiets down, the specifics of the plot and the not-intended-as-comedy dialogue drag a bit. Some mild cutting of superfluous scenes, specifically when focused on the weak villain and when unnecessarily objectifying the one woman, would've helped with the over-length. Mostly, though, the visuals, humor, stunts, and brilliantly iconic music kept me smiling throughout. Your mission, if you choose to accept it: see Rogue Nation."

Some people are complaining about the length of the movie. What do you expect? It's a great plot and at times was confusing as a dinner party. Then again, these films are no longer about the story or the acting, they're about Tom Cruise and his death-defying acts. The story doesn't matter. There were some things about this movie that I noticed:<br/><br/>1. When Tom Cruise was handcuffed to a support beam in the basement. What's the deal with that? It doesn't go all the way to the ceiling. That way Tom Cruise was able to ""hop"" up it and escape.<br/><br/>2. How come Tom Cruise led Lane on a ""chase"" through out the city and even jumped through a window to get into the basement of that office building? You would think that he would have maybe had the front door unlocked of that building.<br/><br/>3. How did Tom Cruise push over the glass cage so easily?<br/><br/>4. Why was the main villain whispering the entire time? When he found out that the girl gave him a blank disc, he put his hand on her head as if he was trying to control his temper.<br/><br/>5. The sight of Ethan Hunt hanging on to the side of taking-off airplane is an unbelievable one to behold - and it's only made more impressive when you remember that Tom Cruise actually performed the real stunt himself!! Also, when the side door opens and he gets BLASTED inside the airplane, how did he not get knocked out? That looked painful.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was great. It had a beginning, middle and an end. Thank you Tom Cruise. You're a legend."

But after seeing the good reception it got, my hopes were up and rightfully so. <br/><br/>Rogue Nation continues off from where Ghost Protocol left, with Ethan Hunt getting a new mission to take down the rogue spy agency called the Syndicate. Tom Cruise is well, Tom Cruise. He was awesome yet again. The one that was surprisingly great was the female lead, Rebecca Ferguson. She acted great, she was sexy, she was lethal and she was a total badass. Best MI girl to date. Her chemistry with Tom Cruise was also great and it is one of those VERY rare times where I ACTUALLY liked the romance/lovey dovey subplot. Movie handled it very well. It wasn't prolonged or anything, it wasn't cheesy or clichéd or typical, it was just right. <br/><br/>The supporting cast was also great. Simon Pegg's character once again showed how to handle comic relief properly in a movie. He was funny, he was awesome and he wasn't just there to make us laugh. I was disappointed that in Ghost Protocol, Ving Rhames only had a small cameo but gladly he returns here properly. I always loved his character and this time it was no different. Jeremy Renner also returns, and gets a less action role, but is still great. The team dynamic, one of the best things about this series, was strong as ever in this part. <br/><br/>This franchise, however, always struggled with its villain and it happened yet again this time. He wasn't bad or anything, but I just felt like the mysterious and a match for Ethan hunt feel they were going for/hoping for didn't work for me. And the his voice definitely didn't help. Philip Seymour Hoffman (R.I.P) in MI3 remains the best villain. <br/><br/>Now, the movie felt like a perfect mixture of two of my favourite Mission Impossible films, first part and Ghost protocol. It had the humor, action and epic feeling of MI4 and the more focus on espionage and mystery of the MI1. The action scenes were awesome. The break-in scenes were tense and gripping. The hand to hand combat had impact and were well handled. And the stunt work was amazing. No MI movie is complete without at least one scene containing cruise in some crazy stunt and this was no exception. He hung on the outside of a plane while it took off, and the dude is in his 50s, I mean WOW. <br/><br/>The humor was well handled here, just like it was in Ghost Protocol. They didn't overuse it or mistimed it. Some of it was just too good. I laughed out loud a time or two. <br/><br/>Overall, this might very well be my favourite MI film so far. One of the best film of this year. A MUST WATCH!! <br/><br/>8.5/10"
"Anurag-Shetty","10","0","2","10 August 2015"," The second best Mission: Impossible film.
","Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation continues with the adventures of suave secret agent, Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) & the rest of the IMF. After saving the world yet again, the IMF consisting of Ethan, William Brandt(Jeremy Renner) & Benji Dunn(Simon Pegg) find out about the Syndicate. The Syndicate is an international rogue organization that is anti-IMF. It is trained to do everything the IMF does, with equal skill & efficiency. The only thing is, the Syndicate is an evil organization & is not here to save the world but, wants to destroy it. In the meantime, the IMF is disintegrated because CIA chief, Alan Hunley believes that Ethan Hunt & his cohorts may have saved the world a number of times but, they are reckless & always leave a trail of destruction behind them. Now, it is up to Ethan, Benji & Brandt to go rogue & save the world from the Syndicate. They also enlist the services of a mysterious ally named Ilsa Faust(Rebecca Ferguson) & Luther Stickell(Ving Rhames). <br/><br/>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a marvelous film! It's the second best movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise. Though this film is superb, I liked Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol(2011) a tad bit better. The action set pieces of the movie are its highlights. Out of the various set pieces, the opening set piece involving the airplane & the underwater set piece are my favorites. Don't worry! The other set pieces are heart stopping too. You might be wondering that despite praising this film to the skies, I'm saying that I like Ghost Protocol better. Well, the difference between the two is very minimal. Ghost Protocol is very different because the other stars of the movie apart from Tom Cruise do the 'impossible' stunts. In Rogue Nation the action is solely focused on Ethan, yet again. Also, the action set pieces in Ghost Protocol are slightly more heart stopping than the set pieces in this movie. In fact, the airplane & the underwater set pieces are the only 2 truly thrilling set pieces in this movie. Still, director Christopher McQuarrie successfully takes the reins from previous director, Brad Bird. A note on the performances. Tom Cruise is flawless as Ethan Hunt. Cruise exudes charisma & swagger as the experienced secret agent. What makes Tom Cruise, perfect for the role of Ethan Hunt is, he does all his own stunts. I wonder how Cruise will be able to top his stunt work in M:I 6! Jeremy Renner is great as William Brandt. Simon Pegg is hilarious as Benji Dunn. Rebecca Ferguson is brilliant as Ilsa Faust. Ving Rhames is impressive as Luther Stickell. Sean Harris is menacing as Solomon Lane. Simon McBurney is good as Atlee. Tom Hollander is superb as the Prime Minister. Jens Hulten is effective as Janik Vinter. Alec Baldwin is awesome as Alan Hunley. Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a must watch. Can't wait for more movies from this faultless franchise."
"zardoz-13","10","0","2","10 August 2015"," Top-Notch Action Yarn
","The latest installment in the ""Mission: Impossible"" film franchise ranks as one of the best. ""Jack Reacher"" director Christopher McQuarrie's ""Mission: Impossible--Rogue Nation"" rivals its superlative predecessor ""Mission: Impossible--Ghost Protocol"" with spine-tingling suspense and spectacularly staged set-pieces. Mind you, things haven't always been so good. The initial ""Mission: Impossible"" movie was arguably exciting enough in its own right, especially when Tom Cruise suspended himself Spider-man style at CIA Headquarters. Nevertheless, the film portrayed one of the most beloved television series characters in such a sacrilegious light that most television ""Mission: Impossible"" fanatics abhorred it. I grew up watching Peter Graves play Jim Phelps from 1967 to 1973 and again briefly from 1988 to 1990 on the weekly, hour-long, CBS-TV program, and the heretical notion that Phelps could turn traitor constituted blasphemy. Little did it matter that the people who produced ""Mission: Impossible"" gave Phelps legitimate grounds for his treachery. Comparably, this would be tantamount to turning either Marshal Dillon of ""Gunsmoke"" into a murderous outlaw or indicting Andy Griffith's Sheriff Andy Taylor for police brutality. <br/><br/>The second entry in the Paramount franchise ""Mission Impossible II"" emerged as a vast improvement over the original. Unfortunately, the stimulating third installment ""Mission Impossible III"" made an error almost as egregious as defaming Jim Phelps. Tom Cruise and director J.J. Abrams gave Ethan Hunt a wife to worry about, and that matrimonial madness provided the motive force in its contrived melodrama. The secret agent with a double life and a wife is the stuff of spoofs, and the marriage plot was predictable. Perhaps if they had substituted Hunt's parents (remember them from the 1996 original?) for his wife, the idea might have been more palatable. As swiftly as the franchise got Ethan hitched, it got him just as quickly unhitched with ambiguous details. ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" kept Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) separated from his wife, and he reverted to single status as he had in ""Mission Impossible II."" Happily, neither Cruise nor his latest collaborators have pulled anything as foolhardy as ""Mission Impossible III"" with ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.""<br/><br/>Like the best James Bond extravaganzas, ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" opens with a cliffhanger gambit. Ethan Hunt scrambles atop the wing of a military cargo plane, an Airbus A400M, as it trundles down the runaway for take-off. He slaloms off the wing down to the fuselage and seizes the door handle. Hunt's cyber genius colleague Benjamin Dunn (Simon Pegg of ""Shaun of the Dead"") struggles to open the door remotely while Hunt clings desperately for dear life as the plane gains altitude. Frantically, Benji opens the wrong door, but eventually opens the right door. Hunt gains access to the cargo hold and spots the pallet of VX-nerve gas missiles. The villains, a band of Chechen separatist fighters, discover Hunt's presence too late, and he deploys the chute on the pallet, so both the missiles and he plunge into the blue. This snappy incident is peripheral to the plot, but it gets this outlandish escapade off on the right foot. Moreover, this tense scene reunites Hunt with not only Benji, but also series regular Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames of ""Pulp Fiction"") and ""Ghost Protocol"" addition William Brandt (Jeremy Renner of ""The Bourne Legacy""). <br/><br/>This time around our heroic quartet wrestles with their worst nightmare: the Syndicate, an enigmatic league of terrorists, alluded to at the end of ""Ghost Protocol,"" that threatens not only to destroy the IMF but also initiate global chaos. Predictably, of course, we know Hunt and company will preserve the status quo. Nevertheless, writer & director Christopher McQuarrie takes everything straight to the brink and then lets it teeter. Earlier ""Mission Impossible"" movies relied on the plot device of 'disavowing' Ethan Hunt so he wound up as the man in the middle between the good guys and the bad guys. ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" raises the stakes considerably by ostracizing the entire IMF Agency, with bureaucratic, stuffed-shirt CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alex Baldwin of ""The Hunt for Red October"") arguing passionately for the IMF's dissolution after the infamous San Francisco incident involving a Russian nuclear missile. Meantime, in London, Hunt stumbles accidentally onto the Syndicate. This shadowy organization consists of thousands of spies who have deserted and are officially listed as dead. Pretty but pugnacious Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson of ""The White Queen""), an undercover British Intelligence agent who follows orders from Syndicate honcho Solomon Kane (Sean Harris of ""Prometheus"") acts as if she is a double agent.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation"" delivers everything that we've come to expect from this intrigue-laden, gadget- encumbered franchise. Our resourceful heroes still wear those latex masks that they peel off at dramatic moments to surprise us. As usual, they are required to break into and out of various buildings bristling with sophisticated security safeguards that sometimes challenge them to the point of death. The debonair 53-year old Cruise performs his own perilous stunts, virtually all of them hair-raising, acrobatic accomplishments. He careens a small car around in a maze of narrow city streets with the villains in hot pursuit and then launches himself astride a motorcycle with daredevil gusto. Director Christopher McQuarrie succeeds at making everything doubly difficult for our protagonists, and they embark on an improbable but death-defying gauntlet of obstacles that would stymie lesser souls. Several scenes benefit from gripping tension because one set of heroes execute tasks that prevent another hero from either being captured or killed. Cruise and co-star Rebecca Ferguson team up in several helter-skelter, close quarters, combat scenes that surely required lots of rehearsal. Ferguson displays dazzling dexterity when she clashes with a henchman twice her size who wields a knife far larger than hers. One of the best sequences has Cruise debating which villain to perforate before either assassinates a foreign dignitary during a live opera performance. The fifth globe-trotting ""Mission Impossible"" foray qualifies as a rapid-fire, white-knuckled, adrenaline-laced, nail-biter with momentum that never slackens and surprises that astonish."

","Sleek and stylish, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE movies have been a rage among those who like to get the adrenaline rush watching some of the mind blowing action scenes featuring the charming Tom Cruise. With the last part of the series, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL failing to live up to expectations, let's see what the latest film MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION has in store.<br/><br/>The film starts off with the invincible Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) being assigned an 'impossible' task of retrieving a package from a well guarded plane, by the Head of IMF (Impossible Mission Force) William Brandt along with his partners in crime Benji (Simon Pegg) and his friend Luther (Ving Rhames). After successfully completing the assignment, Ethan Hunt is later hunted down by a group of highly skilled terrorists who torture him to extract information. However, he manages to make an escape with the help of Ilsa Faust, a member of this terrorist group.<br/><br/>On the other hand, IMF is in trouble and Brandt (Jeremy) tries to save IMF by telling the jury about the terrorist organization The Syndicate. But CIA Head Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) refutes the existence of The Syndicate by claiming it as a 'figment of Hunt's imagination'. Moreover, Alan also sends a team to find Ethan Hunt and orders a weekly polygraph test on Hunt's friend Benji (Simon) to discover the whereabouts of Hunt. But, Ethan Hunt goes underground for over six months and manages to contact Benji and invites him to an Opera performance in Vienna. However, the performance leads to a lot of mayhem resulting in the death of prominent personalities and Hunt is once again saved by the mysterious Ilsa. Hunt is termed as an international fugitive after Vienna fiasco and the only way he can save his life is to prove the existence of 'The Syndicates' and his first step in doing so, is by joining hands with the only clue he has, Ilsa! Director Christopher McQuarrie has managed to retain the essence of Mission Impossible with high octane action sequences. Though the first half of the film moves in a slow pace, considering that the film focuses on establishing characters, the movie picks up speed in the second half with its well choreographed chasing sequences. Like any other film in the franchise, this spy-fi too deals with various plots and sub-plots and Christopher manages to keep you hooked to the seat despite the confusing and jumbled storyline.<br/><br/>What MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION also boasts of is some mind blowing performances. It's a well known fact that this is a Cruise film all the way, however, it is Sean Harris as Soloman Lane and Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa who shine in the film. Sean Harris' poker face, villainous attitude and arrogance as the Head of 'The Syndicate' manages to win him brownie points. On the other hand, Rebecca Ferguson is a delight to watch on screen. It is rare to find a woman playing a strong role in a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE film but Rebecca pulls off the role of Ilsa confidently and her smooth action moves make her every bit a match for Hunt aka Tom Cruise. Simon Pegg as Benji keeps you entertained with his one liners while Ving Rhames as Luther Stickhall and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt are rather convincing. Though Tom Cruise continues to reign as 'Ethan Hunt', MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION, hails the actor as a kind of superhero with many terming him as a 'manifestation of destiny'. Tom Cruise has been carrying the franchise on his shoulder since the first film and his role as Hunt has now acquired a cult status that comes with too many expectations which when unfulfilled, leaves you with a tad bit of disappointment.<br/><br/>However, despite its minute flaws, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION is high on entertainment quotient. For Tom Cruise fans, the film provides ample of 'edge of the seat moments' and is a visual treat for action lovers.<br/><br/>On the whole, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION will not leave the fans disappointed as it is one of the best films from the franchise. If the chase sequences and gun fights are your thing, then this film is definitely worth a watch."
"piyushshandilya44","Null","0","2","10 August 2015"," Another good one in the series but.....
","A few things... Too much Tom Cruise Too less Jeremy Renner/rest of IMF. IMF was just a name, it was more like Ethan Hunt and his bitches. Also, the antagonist was almost not there in the movie. Such movies require an intimidating presence of the main villain but here Solomon Lane was just a name that was apparently ""too evil"" but was hardly there. Although Benji(Simon Pegg) got a bit of screen time and he did justice to it. Plot was similar to previous installments, IMF is disbanded, IMF members are fugitives, some syndicate group tries to terrorize the entire world, face masks and all the same stuff. However, the action was impressive packed with very GOOD car chases and fast paced explosive moments. In all, not a bad movie but not in the league of Bourne series or Daniel Craig's bond movies. One time viewing is recommended. 6.5/10"
"jay-techie2007","8","0","2","10 August 2015"," A movie you would love to keep in your collection!!!
","Incidentally, I came to know about Rogue Nation only a few days before the release and instantly I checked on to book the tickets. I had watched Ghost Protocol in IMAX and the movie did justice to the IMAX screen through stunning visuals, brilliant stunts and amazing background score. I booked IMAX for Rogue Nation, expecting the same, and it did not disappoint me at all. <br/><br/>Story and Screenplay: The plot takes a teeny tiny leaf from the previous movie and elevates it to build a breathtaking, edge of your seat story that keeps you glued to the screen for the entire 131 minutes. The movie has it all that takes to make an amazing thriller - good action, stunning bike and car chase sequences, betrayals and small surprises that keep coming every now and then. The movie doesn't use much of special effects that gives a unique and a very real experience while watching those action and chase sequences. The screenplay does good justice to the story. The dialogs has elements of humor, emotions and drama - all that is required. <br/><br/>Acting: Tom Cruise is brilliant as ever, pulling off some amazing stunts right from the word GO! He does well in constantly improvising over the benchmark, his performances has set in earlier MI movies. It is a very difficult thing to do, looking at what is happening in other franchises like FF, and Tom Cruise shows how it is done. He doesn't make it feel ever that he is 52. The supporting cast of Jeremy Reener, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Sean Harris have played their part beautifully. A special watch out for Rebecca Ferguson who almost steals the show from Tom Cruise in the movie with a very intriguing character sketch. <br/><br/>Direction: Christopher McQuarrie does a commendable job in keeping up the benchmark set by the earlier directors in the MI franchise. His choice of locations, the conceptualizing and execution of stunt sequences (the plane one and the underwater one) is brilliant. But what takes the cake is the way he portrays the character of the female lead that does not take a back seat to Cruise at any point of the movie, which is kind of breaking away the stereotype. <br/><br/>Cinematography: The cinematography is great. Some brilliant camera work has gone into the movie, especially during the plane stunt and the bike chase sequence in Morocco. Full marks to Robert Elswit for that. <br/><br/>The movie loses momentum a bit in the middle but regains it as the climax approaches. Overall, its a good watch and a movie which you would love to keep in your collection."

","I cannot rave about this movie enough. I left the theater wanting more, which we will hopefully get with a later installment :). Tom Cruise is at his best, believable and entertaining - and still looking buff and cute in his 50s! The plot was way more developed than I went into it thinking, with suspense and a lot of character development. I have a new girl crush on Rebecca Ferguson and hope to see a lot more of her in other movies. It was great seeing such a strong female lead in an action movie that had more going on than just her looks. The team is all there as we love them, with lots of comedy intertwined. Unfortunately, Alec Baldwin got stuck with some corny lines but I will let that slide since the movie was so great. <br/><br/>While there are plenty of action scenes for the guys, there is also a lot of substance for all moviegoers. I can't wait until the next and hope to see the cast continue to expand!"

One of those movies want to see again & again get it in HD Blu Ray etc on DVD to see London, Cruise & team in high def glory! As an 80's baby you grow to love & adore the stars we grew up with, no replacements will do , no sequels without the original legends in it, so all these movies with Tom Cruise, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, Indiana Jones, & co. rockk!!<br/><br/>Also kiind of a side note about all these sad cosmetic surgery things going on - it's not like we think nobody ages we're not morons - real life education actually existed when we were growing up - without silicone & botox & junk, we love the actors naturally that's how humans recognise the people they love it's an instinctual thing by facial, voice, movement recognition etc. I really don't care how they look as long as it's them but it's like it must be confusing for babies to recognise their mom or dad's face when they come back from the fakeness Dr and it's gone all none-themselves shaped, don't mess with your natural beauty pleeeeease wrinkles & grey hair are the trophies you get for surviving this tough life, show us how it's done , ageing gracefully is beautiful you can still keep healthy & fit but no fake toxic stuff in your bodies k?

"josiahliljequist","8","0","2","9 August 2015"," Possibly the most action packed Mission Impossible yet.
","Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation is an action filled adventure that is genuinely funny and gripping at the same time. The action sequences are expertly shot(especially the chase scenes) and makes you feel like you're in the movie. And while being possibly the most action packed Mission Impossible yet, it is also the funniest(Benji is hilarious:) From beginning to end, the movie did not feel like it was too long and it kept you guessing until the end. The only criticism I have for the movie is that the ending seemed rushed and the stakes didn't seem as high as in the last Mission Impossible. Nevertheless, Rogue Nation was more fun than Ghost Protocol and is tied with the original(which I am partial to) as my favorite Mission Impossible. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a good time at the movies.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

","Mission Impossible is getting better with every new addition to the franchisee. Rogue Nation comes with an intelligent plot and great action stunts which are also believable at the same time. The under water sequence is really breath taking one. It's total Cruise control and it doesn't matter whether you are a Tom Cruise fan or not, it's a must watch for all action flick lovers. Even at the age of 53, Tom Cruise has performed unbelievable stunts. Jeremy Renner is a great actor, so he deserves a bit more part to play. Simon Pegg has done a great job with his witty lines and by playing more integral role than the last one. Rebecca was sexy and superb. Don't miss it guys !"

","Mission Impossible : Rogue Nation was a high octane action thriller that will keep you on the edge of seat.

The mission takes a complete turn when IMF agent is threatened by Syndicate and next begins the cat-mouse game with edge of seat action stunts never scene before. The film is just awesome. The story is very well told along with superb direction by Christopher McQuarrie ( Jack Reacher). The screenplay was handled efficiently along with a strong script. The action sequences are mind blowing and breath taking especially the bike chase scene. Cinematography is eye- catching capturing the locales of Viena and Morocco. Art direction is mesmerizing. Tom Cruise is just awesome , to be precise. The actor not only performs his own stunts , he is so enduring in his role that you would hardly think of any other actor doing this role. The rest of star cast do justice to their part.<br/><br/>Go for it if you want to energize yourself , enjoy yourself and of course if you are a Tom Cruise movies fan. Excellent : 4/5"

I was expecting at interval that it would not be Ghost protocol....<br/><br/>But after interval the film just made me on edge of my seat as Tom cruise hold his breath for 3 minutes underwater and it was hilarious....<br/><br/>And when the bike chase was going and started I wanted to give it a standing ovation because it was awesome.....<br/><br/>Rebecca Ferguson was good at her place she was not 100% but 85% equivalent to Ethan hunt. And other cast were also good. Direction was good. Story was good with its twists and turns some MI classics scenes like masks and all...overall the film was good.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation made its own place and not under Ghost protocol and I liked it...."

The locations are beautiful as always. The scene in the Vienna Opera house is one of my favorite scenes throughout the entire series (being from Vienna myself, the scene might be a bit more special to me)!<br/><br/>My favorite villain of the franchise remains PSH in MI:3 but Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) is without doubt also one of the better villains of the series!<br/><br/>I do think the movie is maybe 10 or 15 minutes too long. It does have a few pacing issues at times but certainly nothing that stops the movie from being great!<br/><br/>The story has everything you expect from a MI movie... It isn't great but it doesn't have to be! It's a solid story that does what it is supposed to do!<br/><br/>Definitely go and check this one out if you haven't yet!"
"scottshak_111","8","0","2","9 August 2015"," Engaging, thrilling, intricate, charismatic, stellar and bloody brilliant!
","Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation is one helluva gorgeous movie that gallops steadfast into the impossible, into one exhilarating intricate plot without forgetting its roots: nail-biting action and mind- numbing story. It moves at a surprisingly good pace that will constantly put your heart in your mouth and might give you a quick nervous breakdown if you are really fragile.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise looks a little lean. It is unfortunate to see the age misery gradually creeping on him. However, there is no setback in the acting department. Rebecca Ferguson walks in as a surprise with complicated written all over her. Not only is she gorgeous, but also elegant. Action suits her as well. As a disavowed individual bent on gaining recognition and getting a life, she does extremely well wearing the Ilsa skin perfectly. Sean Harris certainly cannot be forgotten as the calm villain with a genius mind constantly at work. Even though Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames get a little bit shadowed they still complete the 'teamwork' quotient pretty well. Simon Pegg is brilliant as ever and reprises himself as Benji.<br/><br/>MI technology continues to amaze us in every franchise. Even though things have not been aggrandized in this installment, you will still notice the tech working wonders for the bad-ass team. What is downright exceptional is its plot. It unfurls beautifully as Syndicate and gives a new name to perversion.<br/><br/>The score is constantly racing just like the movie and keeps you on your toes. Bike scenes are pretty dope and their engine revving is sheer music to the ears. It was quite good to see McQuarrie not elongate those frames and spoil the fun in the plot. Limited action at right places is what makes it perfect.<br/><br/>A highly recommended flick for everybody. Go watch! Go Rogue!"

"nairtejas","7","0","2","9 August 2015"," Crisp, Clean, & Faithful. ♦ 68%
","Rogue Nation is a film with lots of energy and novelty. Hunt's (Cruise) escapades are breathtaking as he and his team begin their seemingly impossible mission to hunt down an international terrorist (Harris). The stunts inch closer and closer to absolute brilliance if one compares it with the film's predecessors. Ghost Protocol was rad, and now I can even take the risk of saying that Rogue Nation is even more.<br/><br/>The film doesn't lose sight and is FAITHFUL to the franchise's theme. It treads into unexplored territory leaving the audience in awe and wonder. The sequences are stunningly shot by Robert Elswit who also gifted us Nightcrawler (2014) few months ago. With CRISP writing at parts, the story is fairly believable. But of course, there are holes which if detected, should be ignored for a good viewing, hoping you are not one of the v-bloggers who take pride in videos like ""10 Mistakes About Rogue Nation In 100 Seconds.""<br/><br/>The antagonist starts smart, but ends up like a rabbit, afraid of its hunters. Plus, there is an air of romance that touches the plot for some time, but thankfully flows away, preventing the whole drama from falling.<br/><br/>Cruise is terrific; the guy can run and boy, with elegance. I am sure we will never get bored of him. Renner sports a grim look throughout as he is more like a bureaucrat in this installment. It was fun watching Ferguson and Pegg. Overall, they are all well-directed.<br/><br/>Films in the Mission: Impossible franchise are erroneously considered and compared with other action films by junkies, giving rise to polarizing reviews citing mindlessness and plot holes. It is only when one accepts M: I films as pure spy-fi is its real magnitude perceived. The fifth installment is thus a better concoction that has high entertainment quotient.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Rogue Nation has car and bike chases, masks, saxorifles, and glass cages. What more can you ask for? Mr. McQuarrie, have a beer, will you?<br/><br/>VERDICT: 7 stars out of 10. Recommended.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

","Tom Cruise and his mission is back...and how! Went to see the latest installment of the MI series 'Rogue Nation' and Tom Cruise shows time and again why he is a global superstar and one of the best ever action stars from Hollywood.<br/><br/>Coming back to the movie, it somewhat starts from where the last MI movie 'Ghost Protocol' ended. After successfully tackling a gas transfer to terrorists from a cargo plane Hunt is sure about the existence of the 'Syndicate' the top crime organization. While he goes to the designated secret area to get the details of his mission he is tricked by the 'syndicate' inside a gas chamber'. He sees the leader through the glass door before he losses consciousness.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the CIA is hellbent to prove the top senate that IMF (of which Ethan Hunt (Cruise), Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther are part of) is a dangerous organization to the interests of USA and calls strongly to dissolve IMF and get the members of the IMF to join CIA, to which the senate agrees. Hunr escapes from the captivity with the help of a lady (not disclosing her full details here). Now Hunt is on the run targeted by both Syndicate as well as CIA. How Hunt gets back with his team, connects the dots to find the Syndicate guy, destroys his plans and prove IMF's worth in front of the senate forms the rest of the film.<br/><br/>As for performance, Tom Cruise steals the show with his charisma and action as Ethan Hunt. He keeps the viewers at the edge of their seat with his action sequences. Right from the start with the 'Hanging outside the plane while it takes off', 'the BMW car chase scene', the 'Bike chase scene' and the 'Underwater chamber scene' Cruise excels in whatever he does in the movie. And at 53 one should admire for the work he has done for this movie. Simon Pegg is brilliant as Benji and his combo scenes with Cruise are really funny which sends the audience bursting into laughter. The rest of the crew also plays their roles pretty well.<br/><br/>Overall its a very entertaining movie with lot of thrills and spills. If you are a fan of MI franchise or Cruise you will definitely like this one."
"thunder1road","10","0","2","8 August 2015"," Rogue Nation is the best MI movie.
","We saw Rogue Nation last night. The 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes is well deserved. The story has the usual chases, gun battles, and fist fights, but it's true strength is the battle of wits between Ethan Hunt and the evil villain. Even better than the good story, the amazing action, and Lalo Schifrin's music is the consummate performance of Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa. She is an Ingrid Bergman with dark hair - maybe that's why her character name is Ilsa. And some of the movie does take place in Casablanca. Believe me, I wouldn't mention Mission Impossible in the same sentence as the immortal Casablanca unless Mission deserves it - and it does. In a summer filled with great action super hero movies - this one stands out."

","Well, I had a blast! I went to see this one on IMAX (my first venture on this kind of screening) and well, I'm astonished. This is certainly the best MI yet and perhaps the best movie of the year so far, alongside Fury Road, at least for me.<br/><br/>But well, let's get down to it. I'm glad Cruise choose McQuarrie to helm this one, because despite some backlash, I liked his directorial debut ""Jack Reacher"" and he really elevated the film to an whole new level with his directing chops.<br/><br/>Then, we have Cruise. He is just great! A Jack of all trades, I mean, he can act, he can do his stunts, he produces, he takes risks. He is simply a showman. And in this one, he steals it all. He does such a great job that I now consider him one of my favourite performers. Simon Pegg is given the comic relief of the movie, although the whole cast surprised because of the comic scenes and their comic timing. I believe that the humour was enhanced by McQuarrie's script but the ensemble cast made a great job nailing this scenes. But after Cruise's performance the standout for me was Rebecca Fergunson. She is incredibly hot and sexy, she has the acting chops and wtf! she is tough. A surprise!<br/><br/>Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner return and Alec Baldwin is introduced to the series as the CIA's director Huntley. Sean Harris is absolutely great as the main antagonist, but, since some rumours credit that the role was first offered to Benedict Cumberbatch, I found myself thinking how he would have handled the part. Despite all that, Sean Harris is, indeed, menacing.<br/><br/>M:I Rogue Nation is, for me, the best in the series, surpassing the last entry on the series and one of the best of the year, undoubtedly.<br/><br/>Watch it!"

"maulin5","9","0","1","8 August 2015"," My Favorite Franchise, Not the best part, but still a worth watch!
","It's the 5th addition of the superhit franchise. Named as Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. Starring Tom Cruise in the lead as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt. In the film, Hunt is on the run from the U.S. government as he tries to prove the existence of the Syndicate, an international criminal consortium. The director of the film is Christopher McQuarrie. He has written screenplay, too. The film starts with the plane scene which we had seen in trailer. Then the film just moves on a same pace. Lack of action in before interval portion. But, the Opera show sequence is good enough to engage the viewers. Post interval, there are lot's of action sequences. Especially, the chasing sequence will surely be highly appreciated by MI fans. Those scenes are very very fast and breathless! Underwater scene is also unique and fans will definitely love it. It's little short before interval and slight lengthy in post interval. I'm not saying this is the best part of the series. But, you can't miss this if you love the previous parts. It's a worthy watch. Background score is tremendous. Each and every beat helps my heart to beat little bit more! Cinematography is very good. All have performed really well. Tom looks aged but still able to give a killer look. So, on the whole, I know you are going to watch this, because you've watched all the previous parts, and eagerly excited for this one. So, don't read more reviews, just go for it, and enjoy the show!"
"caseynicholson","7","0","2","8 August 2015"," A Great Movie, but a Step-Down from ""Ghost Protocol""
","I'll start by saying that I'm a big fan of this series. I just think the Tom Cruise ""Mission Impossible"" films are terrific, the second one being the lone exception.<br/><br/>That said, what we have here in ""Rogue Nation"" is a great action film that follows closely in the footsteps of its predecessors. You've probably heard about the airplane scene at the beginning of the movie and how Cruise actually did that for the film. That scene goes by fairly quickly, so don't blink or you'll miss it. But like the other MI films, this one features a strong action plot and dynamic effects. On those points alone, this film is fun and great to watch.<br/><br/>The drawback is when you compare it to the other films in the series, it's a step-down. Perhaps that's because ""Ghost Protocol"" set such a high bar, but my hesitancy to laud the film has as much to do with the relative lackluster character of the script as anything. The operative word in that phrase is ""relative"", mind you. I'd probably say that this is my fourth favorite MI film, ranking only above the mediocre-at-best MI2. Episodes 1 and 3, along with ""Ghost Protocol"" are better films than this.<br/><br/>But again, that criticism is only valid when comparing it to the other films in the series. This is still a great action flick if you view it on its own merits. I'm giving it 7/10 stars, whereas I gave the other three that I like in the franchise nine stars each (and four stars to MI2). It's a good movie. It just isn't as mind-blowing as those other three."
"BillSims28","9","0","1","8 August 2015"," Five Word Review: Thrilling, Tense, Witty, Perfect Action
","Since a 1960s TV series was made into a Tom Cruise action flick in 1996, five different directors have offered their own unique takes on five different Mission Impossible films. Constantly threatening to become a big franchise, but never really becoming one, we've seen the directors of The Usual Suspects, Face/Off, Star Trek and The Incredibles offer up very different spy films. Now, by Christopher McQuarrie's Rogue Nation, the franchise finally appears to be a solid, consistent franchise.<br/><br/>I loved Ghost Protocol (2011) but having now seen Rogue Nation Brad Bird's MI film pales in comparison. This film picks up where the last ended, with Cruise's Ethan on the Hunt for a mysterious, anti-IMF organisation called the Syndicate whilst Jeremy Renner deals with Alec Baldwin and the fallout from the last film. Simple premise, simple execution, and the beauty of Rogue Nation is that it achieves exactly what it sets out to do, and it achieves it spectacularly. No need for anything over-elaborate, just fantastically staged action, including a standout thrilling and tense Bond-style scene in an opera house. Best use of 'Nessun Dorma' I'll see in a while. Cruise is still a solid lead, who at 54 can still inexplicably cling on to planes as they take off, yet his scenes are often stolen by the literally perfect comic timing of Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner, each of whom make for amazing support. The film really belongs to both Cruise and the mysterious character of Rebecca Ferguson (The White Queen) who easily holds her own against Cruise and is definitely one to watch out for in future. Sean Harris makes a suitably creepy and scarily clever super villain, whilst Tom Hollander playing the British PM (his In the Loop character Simon Foster in all but name) also makes for some hilarious scenes. <br/><br/>There is little not to love about MI: Rogue Nation. The best sequence has to be a thrilling car and motorbike chase through Casablanca, which manages to upstage even the heavily marketed plane stunt, intelligently put at the start to increase expectations of things to come. Disbelief must of course be heavily suspended for the multiple car flips and truly diabolical bad-guy-aim, yet if you go into this film and don't come out having absolutely thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, then you either hate action or espionage. If you've ever liked either of those, though, then see Rogue Nation for some of the best of both ever put to cinema. Easily, almost nonchalantly the best in the series, this incredible year for spy films continues with this, and it will be interesting to see how 007's Spectre holds up against this breath-taking ride of action and suspense. 85/100."

","-- SPOILER WARNING -- <br/><br/>I had actually watched Fantastic Four a few hours prior to watching this movie yesterday, so I was very worried. Even with the high ratings, they can be deceiving to one's tastes. This was the case for me when watching movies like Gravity. But, oh boy, was I wrong! This far exceeded my expectations! Without a doubt, this is Tom at his very best. The first 3 MI movies were pretty average. Then came Ghost Protocol in 2011, which set the bar much higher than the previous 3. And now comes Rogue Nation. From start to finish, I was at the edge of my seat; thrilled with what this movie had shown. <br/><br/>Each and every twist and turn was performed spectacularly. Ethan Hunt is back and ready to show his skills. With IMF supposedly disbanded, Ethan now goes Rogue and is in pursuit of a organization known as Syndicate, which was effectively led by a man known as Solomon Lane. The main woman of the story, Ilsa, portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson, stole the show with her performance and how she was trying to not only carry out Lane's orders, but also go against them at many points, to save Ethan. <br/><br/>As Ethan is now secretly working alongside Benji (Simon Pegg), Hunley (Alec Baldwin) orders Brandt (Jeremy Renner) to capture Ethan and bring him to into custody under the CIA. However, Brandt wants Ethan to accomplish his mission rather than be captured. There are so many twists and turns in this movie, that make the incredible flare we hope to see in MI movies. <br/><br/>The stunts. Oh, man. THE STUNTS. No CGI, no green screen, none of that. Just Tom Cruise doing what he does best. I swear, I was shocked to find that this stunt was real. And he had to do it EIGHT TIMES! WOW. It's just far too impressive.<br/><br/>Lastly, the soundtrack. We all know the iconic MI theme, but here they just absolutely nailed it with the soundtrack! Impressive! More than that, even!<br/><br/>This movie isn't perfect; it has its flaws, but other than that? It's worth the money! If you're a fan of such movies, watch it! You won't be disappointed!<br/><br/>With this movie now watched, I still have yet to watch a few more movies. Most notably: <br/><br/><ul><li>Hit-man: Agent 47 - James Bond: Spectre</li></ul><br/><br/>I'm excited to see how these movies will be played out."

","After preventing a batch of nerve gas transport to Syria, Ethan Hunt gets trapped by the Syndicate, the organization he's been tracking, and a figure reveals himself to Ethan. In captive a female Syndicate agent helps him escape from Janik Vinter. At the same time the IMF gets shut down by CIA Director Hunley. So Ethan goes ghost again for the next six months investigating more about the Syndicate. He gets Benji to help him on a mission in the Vienna opera, convinced that the figure will be there too. Ethan finds the female agent and two other Syndicate agents aiming for the Austrian chancellor, so he clips the chancellor to prevent his killing. Ethan finds the female agent and together they escape the building, only to be chased down by Syndicate agents and the chancellor gets killed by a car bomb. The female agent introduces herself as Ilsa Faust, a deep cover inserted by MI6 into the Syndicate. Ethan has to let her go to lose the pursuers, but he already gets her lipstick, which actually has a hidden USB compartment.<br/><br/>They meet again in the Moroccos where Ilsa explains about Syndicate leader Solomon Lane and a file kept in an offline secure computer facility. Ethan has to swim and hold his breath for three minutes to install a security profile to help Benji copy the file. Ethan passes out right after installing the profile but Ilsa goes in and helps him exit. But Ilsa steals the file from Benji and escapes, so Etha and Benji pursues her, who are also getting chased by Syndicate agents. Eventually she loses them all and brings the file to Atlee, her handler in MI6. Atlee denies her request to get out of cover and instead sends her and the file back to Lane. Lane finds the file has been deleted, but they all know that Ethan already made another copy. Ethan's team finds the file to be a British virtual red box, unlock-able only by the UK prime minister. Lane then kidnaps Benji while the team meets with Ilsa. Ethan then convinces his team to help him, particularly Brandt who gets anxious about the mission.<br/><br/>Brandt phones Hunley to meet him in London, convincing Hunley that the PM's life is in danger. Hunley goes to Atlee, who is in fact the Chief at MI6, and they with Brandt secures the PM in a room and explains things to him. While unlocking the file, the PM reveals that the Syndicate is real, the brain-child of Atlee, which surprises Hunley which all this time disbelieves Hunt about it. Ethan reveals himself behind a mask of Atlee's face and Hunley gets to be the hero when the real Atlee arrives. With the file Ethan faces Lane, who has Benji hostage with a bomb. After an argument Lane releases Benji, but then hunts Ethan and Ilsa. Ilsa ultimately faces and kills Vinter. Ethan eventually manages to trap Lane in a box, a payback to what he did in the movie's start.<br/><br/>The story feels nicely comparable to previous Mission Impossible movies. All the signature elements are still in play; the hidden message compartment, the face mask, and the intrigue and deception among intelligence agents. As a whole, this installment feel somewhat lacking, especially if we compare it to the last in Ghost Protocol. The thing is that despite that the basic premise of having an anti-IMF organization hell bent on destroying the system of the world feels very urgent, yet the movie didn't really keep up with this and lacks in depicting the sense urgency in it.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are developed in an unbalanced fashion. While Ethan Hunt and his team has the starting capital of the character development from the previous movies, The balancing character angles have very poor development or even screen time in that manner. The character Solomon Lane succeeded in inciting curiosity after the cold introduction. Yet he rarely gets seen on the rest of the movie that his character feels quite empty.<br/><br/>The action is quite good in overall. They still look very much a Mission Impossible action scenes with cool looking action scenes. Although again they didn't really help the movie as a whole, especially in creating enough suspense. Many of the action sequences looks repetitive either in previous Mission Impossible movies, such as the bicycle chase sequence, or any other spy movies, such as the rooftop escape sequence that is reminiscent of Bond movies. Still many of them had impossible continuance, like Ethan having no scratch after his bicycle accident.<br/><br/>The acting overall is a good one for me. Tom Cruise acted his parts nicely and this time managed to cut down his grinning which made Ethan look stupid in the previous movies. Simon Pegg did his parts nicely although his character here seems like he's only a sweetener. Rebecca Ferguson is indeed the movie's crown jewel with her charming and convincing performance and her character's high significance. It's too bad that we don't see Jeremy Renner in any action, though.<br/><br/>My final say is a solid 7 out of 10 score for Mission Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015). A recommendation is a definite yes from me. Although this movie can't really top Ghost Protocol, it can still give us nice action sequences."

","Just when the Impossible Mission Force might be making progress towards locating the mysterious Syndicate, the government shuts them down. This leaves Ethan Hunt going rogue, assisted – or possibly obstructed – by the mysterious and beautiful Ilsa Faust.<br/><br/>There is not a great deal in MI5 by way of surprise – the plot is very straightforward, albeit with some uncertainty as to exactly whose side – if any – Ilsa Faust is on – but it is, as usual, full of outrageous action, and hugely improbable security measures to be overcome. The IMF now seems to comprise Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner – any female members are conspicuous by their absence, and poor old Tom Wilkinson got bombed to oblivion in MI4. Pegg continues to be amusing and gives the films a much-needed lighter side. Renner gets a rough deal in here with not much to do (but he does it very well).<br/><br/>The supporting cast does well, with Sean Harris' odious nasal whisperer a loathsome standout.<br/><br/>So there is no huge substance here, but I never looked at my watch during its 130 minutes."
"pyrocitor","9","0","2","6 August 2015"," Manifest Destiny
","The fifth film in a franchise no one would have ever expected to have such trajectory, Rogue Nation actually manages to accomplish the impossible: in the thick of a tension-building chase scene, music pounding, punches crunching, glass shattering, director Christopher McQuarrie holds a moment of silence. Actual silence. And sustains it. It feels like an eternity. It allows the viewer to reflect on how much their ears are ringing, and stretches the tension from engaging to nearly unbearable. And it is beautiful. <br/><br/>This, amazingly, isn't even the most suspenseful moment in the film, which opens with a setpiece involving Tom Cruise actually hanging out of a plane, and gets wilder from there on. But it's perfectly indicative of McQuarrie's confidence waltzing into a franchise and making it his own. For decades, Mission: Impossible has been toying with tone, flirting with 'Bond-but- not-Bond', but without being too vanilla in asserting what it isn't. But, just as the post- millennial Bond has slunk into surly Jason Bourne territory, Ethan Hunt is finally allowed to be fun for fun's sake. And it is phenomenally cathartic. <br/><br/>Fun should not be mistaken for levity, however. McQuarrie brings with him plenty of the burly intensity of his last Cruisefest, Jack Reacher, and sets the tone to 'bludgeon'. And not just in terms of the series' most shockingly intense violence, with clipped, brutally efficient fight scenes punctuated with sound editing like thunderclaps erupting out of nowhere. No shaky-cam or intensified continuity nonsense here. No fuss. No – the real bludgeoning is of the viewer's nerves, racking up setpiece after setpiece of unbelievable tension, all the moreso upon realization of how much death-defying was done entirely practically. You can practically hear McQuarrie shrug, saying, ""It was just easier to actually do it than mess around on some computer,"" but the effect is palpable. From a rafters opera knife fight involving three(!) snipers, synched to the orchestral score dizzyingly enough to make Alfred Hitchcock sweat, to an almost overwhelmingly claustrophobic sequence of Cruise outdoing the 'switch the computer chip' climax of Captain America: The Winter Soldier while free-diving in a revolving, pressurized water tank, to a backwards-car-chase-turned-motorcycle-chase-turned- ANOTHER-motorcycle-chase (in which Cruise is literally inches from disfigurement the entire time), M:I5 is a psychotic roller-coaster of thrills. And it barely seems to try.<br/><br/>It's almost disconcerting, in fact, how nonchalantly airtight the film feels. The pacing, script, and cinematography are slick but unshowy, allowing moments of humour to breathe without feeling like obligatory punch-ups (promoting the infallibly wonderful Simon Pegg to primary scene partner here is a genius move), and shearing the plot down to a razor-fine intensity. Yes, the script is overly prone to worming in trailer sting lines like ""this is never going to work"" or ""this is our last chance"" in virtually every scene, but if ya gotta do it, may as well leave them in the capable hands of Alec Baldwin, Ving Rhames, and Jeremy ""the human frown"" Renner, who, vaguely bored as they might seem, can each sell a scene or punchline alike in their sleep. For such a previously vaguely defined franchise, it's oddly fun and satisfying to see the whole IMF gang cavorting around together, and have it actually feel like 'the boys are back in town'. Even composer Joe Kraemer finds yet another thrilling way of remixing that iconic musical theme that could carry the franchise by itself. It all just seems to fit. <br/><br/>This, if anything, is the film's central theme. In a vintage Baldwinian monologue, Alec Baldwin's CIA sourpuss refers to Hunt as ""the manifestation of destiny"", and it's a curiously resonant statement. Just when the film's central conceit of 'disbarred agent hunting down shadow organization to prevent global conspiracy' starts to feel a little too familiar (your turn at bat, Spectre), McQuarrie takes the sting out with an odd bent of fatalism. Here, the hero/villain dichotomy is taken to a genuinely interesting place: both rely on each other's competency to achieve their own goals, assuming no endeavour the other undertakes could fail. Their plans each systematically work because of course they do, and the perennial piggybacking of schemes is strangely thrilling. Here, Sean Harris is the perfect antagonist, in that he, unlike virtually all fellow moustache-twirlers, feels and acts like a real spy: quiet, polite, sans showboating, with only the tiniest nasal flares connoting volumes of seething villainy. <br/><br/>It's also a rare treat to have a femme fatale figure who is genuinely hard to read or predict, but, in doing so, Rebecca Fergusson snatches the film's most impressively compelling performance, just as breezily likable as astoundingly capable in combat, complete with the most surprisingly tender cinematic hug in years, of all things. Ultimately, however, the franchise is still unapologetically a Tom Cruise vehicle, and he makes it count. Performing more jaw-dropping stunts than he has lines in the film, and wordlessly reacting to histrionic situations with the smallest of bemused head tilts like a 1000 watt Cary Grant, the 53 year old Cruise is still every inch the movie star, and it is just as thrilling as ever to see him in his element. <br/><br/>It's rare to see a sequel, let alone a 'part 5', not only exceed its predecessors but casually cement its tone as a franchise, while casually delivering the most exciting and thrilling romp of the year thus far, but Cruise and McQuarrie have here accomplished the Imposserr, Improbable. The rather appropriate moniker for the now eagerly awaited next installment? MI6. Your move, Mr. Bond. <br/><br/>-9/10"

","By the time the fifth installment of a movie franchise rolls around, that series starts to show its age. Not with Mission: Impossible, it seems, because Rogue Nation is yet another incredibly silly yet undeniably entertaining entry in the 17 year old franchise that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. This time around, Ethan Hunt is now an international fugitive and must take on his most impossible mission (heh) to bring down the rogue organization Syndicate, who are committed to bring down the IMF. The plot twists keep you on your toes the whole time, and it's really what makes Rogue Nation so thrilling. It does succumb to the normal spy movie goofiness, one time in particular early in the movie that made me shake my head at how ridiculous the whole idea was. The double, triple and quadruple crosses get rather confusing as the plot progresses too. There's never a dull moment in Rogue Nation, a suitably fun and over-the-top summer blockbuster, and it proves that Tom Cruise is an unstoppable action star."

Other than that it was an epic movie. I hope they make more. I feel that Tom is still up for the task of making 1-2 more movies for the franchise. The characters are, as always, a pleasure to watch.

","You know, I really like the Mission Impossible franchise, maybe it's because I like Tom Cruise movies, maybe because each film has a different director so they all have a unique feel to them, in any case, they get a thumbs up from me.<br/><br/>So in this one, we join Ethan Hunt for a fifth time and he's on the search for a secret organization called The Syndicate. A simple premise but enjoyable non-the-less, it's fun to see him and his team work things out and what makes it more enjoyable is that all the members of his team are from previous movies so we're comfortable with them and it feels more like a group of friends, which was nice. The story itself I really enjoyed too, the twists, the turns and just a lot of points worked excellently. The action scenes are some of my favourites I've ever seen, there were thrilling ones, tense ones and downright fun spy-themed ones which is what I love. And this is one of the few movies where I felt it just had a really satisfying ending, I mean you get good movies but there are some where it comes to a climax and all things are being resolved in a certain way and it just puts a smile on your face.<br/><br/>Casting was all good too, as I said I like Tom Cruise movies so it's always fun to see him, Jeremy Renner was a great side-guy too and had his own problems which added to the story, he always seems to play a good secondary character but not a successful main guy. It was nice to see Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames back, both being the computer guys, but both serving their purpose. Two new peeps we got for the rogue nation were Rebecca Ferguson who was awesome, not only was she easy on the eye but looked like she knew what she was doing during her action scenes which made for a great character; secondly was Sean Harris as the big baddie and boy was he such a good villain, I loved this guy, he was so creepy and threatening, definitely one of the better antagonists of the franchise.<br/><br/>If someone forced me to pick a problem then I would say that a certain scene that was pushed in all the promotional trailers and pictures was used straight out the gate and had no bearing on the plot which seemed a little odd.<br/><br/>To conclude, personally this is my favourite Mission: Impossible movie so far and look forward to the next one!"

Every other aspect of the film was what I would call total action entertainment. Yes of course it falls into the category of a total suspension of disbelief but isn't that why we go to the cinema to suspend reality. I guess the most important ingredient is the man himself, he clearly works so hard to get it right and in the true Hollywood tradition of Errol Flyn et al he is a star and has made this 'boys own' daring do' genre all his own almost without rival.

Tom Cruise practice all his stunts by himself and that make the movie feel as realistic as it is possible to feel. After a movie you will leave movie theatre so satisfy that you almost can't wait the next movie. It leaves to you same feeling that old Bond movies did, you can't wait to see the next movie to see how they will surprise your expectations. This is what Hollywood's dream factory is as it's best. Shameless entertainment made with big heart to audience regardless critics. Just perfect movie entertainment."

","Way to go, Cruise! He nailed it, again.<br/><br/>I believe Tom Cruise was born to play that role and this movie proves it. The movie is amazing, they work the action incredibly nice; you know how sometimes an action movie has like a down side after the big climax? Well, this movie does not have that. There will be a point of the movie where there is no action and just a bunch of drama and you will feel the need to get out of the movie theater now because you've been there for an hour and a half, but then, suddenly you get action again and you come back to the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the saga, trust me, you won't be disappointed, and if you just wanna watch a movie because you have nothing better to do, you will definitely love it and probably end up watching the rest of the Mission Impossible movies. The acting is pretty good, you know Tom Cruise, he plays himself. Simon Pegg does a great and funny sidekick, every scene of him you will laugh. Rebecca Ferguson has a great character who almost takes the lead out of Ethan Hunt, she will have you wondering the whole movie 'Is she good? Is she bad? Is she human?', I hope she stays in the franchise. The rest of the cast does marvelous, keep up the hard work.<br/><br/>The plot is very good, it won't disappoint you. We don't only get the Sindicate, which is the perfect way to bring back these guys on a Mission, but we get to see a great villain, an anti- Ethan Hunt, somebody that is finally to his level, so you will enjoy that, plus the great action scenes, the amazing car chases, the thrilling missions, the surprising plot twist. It is a great movie for the summer.<br/><br/>So, your mission, if you decide to accept it, and you really should, is go watch it, now.<br/><br/>Seriously, now."

"justinwfirestone","7","0","1","5 August 2015"," Good action, too corny
","As I was leaving the theater, Dr. Fleshly asked me: ""So what exactly was the Rogue Nation, anyway? Seemed like it was just a guy."" Yes, much like Batman and Ant-Man, Rogue Nation is really just a guy. Not that there's anything wrong with that.<br/><br/>What is wrong, though, is the nearly laughable performance of Sean Harris as the villain, who was so great and scary in the Red Riding trilogy. Maybe he didn't realize how ridiculous some of his lines were and forgot that the Mission: Impossible series has mutated from Brian De Palma's dark and serious tone to the upbeat and corny Simon Pegg Laff-A-Lympics. Maybe it's a contradiction that I disliked the downbeat seriousness of Avengers: Age of Ultron, but in turn disliked the upbeat corniness of Rogue Nation.<br/><br/>No matter how much work Tom Cruise gets done, he's starting to look old. As long as he can still do the stunts it will be cool, but I hope they don't nuke the fridge someday and have Ethan Hunt go tracking down a crystal skull that has some spy stuff in it. Actually, it wouldn't matter. The plot is the least important part of the Mission: Impossible movies because everything the IMF has to do is ""impossible.""<br/><br/>What he chases mostly in this movie is Ilsa Faust, who surely made some kind of deal with the devil. We almost get to see her boobies, but we do get to see her in skin-tight motorcycle leathers, so it balances out.<br/><br/>The action sequences are pretty thrilling and more interesting than those from Mad Max: Fury Road. Plus, we get motorcycles going down steps, something that should be worked into every movie. I mean it. And an exploding motorcycle. That is pretty wicked underground cool.<br/><br/>All of the summer blockbuster action movies have at least one thing in common: they are all about 20-30 minutes too long. Just after Rogue Nation's formulaic false conclusion, I wished once again that I had been wearing diapers and had my massage therapist ready.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin is perfect in his role as CIA director and dishes out his lines with a straight face. His soliloquy to the Prime Minister of Britain is one of the strangest and funniest moments of the whole summer.<br/><br/>The biggest weakness of Rogue Nation is that we must suspend our suspense of disbelief because few of the action sequences are suspenseful because there is never any real fear of any of the main heroes getting killed. And the torture expert, Dr. Bone, doesn't even get to hack anyone's bones off, possibly to keep the movie PG- 13.<br/><br/>We learn friends are important, and really good friends are even more important.<br/><br/>Also, Jeremy Renner is in the movie. He might as well have been Hawkeye again."
"abisio","8","0","2","5 August 2015"," Far better than 3 and 4 but not yet there
","Mission Impossible was a beloved TV spy show that played like a scam and deceive tale; full of suspense and unexpected twists. None of the movies played that way; however the first two crafted by the legendary Brian de Palma and John Woo; had such brilliant moments that made you forget the movies were no more than very standard action flic.<br/><br/>It was well known; Cruise (producer and start) had a lot of discrepancies with both directors so he switched to lesser known, more manageable ones; crafting the forgettable MI-III (whose higher points were the addition of Simon Pegg and a decent turn of fresh Oscar winner; Philip Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy; but has the worse script ever created for an action movie absolutely predictable and far from original ) and the ultra spectacular but also forgettable MI-Ghost Protocol (Cruise hanging on the tallest building in Emirates is pretty much the only thing I recall about the movie).<br/><br/>MI-5 Rogue Nation was directed by Christopher McQuarrie; a not very experienced director (he is unable to produce any kind of suspense) but smart enough to compensate with lots of humor and prioritizing secondary characters. McQuarrier fails in the Vienna's Opera chapter. The sequence is well staged but lacks suspense so it's become too long. Luckily Simon Pegg keeps the moment funny. However; after that, the movie becomes more interesting. Rebeca Fergusson is a great surprise and her character gets lots of screen time and she makes the most of it.<br/><br/>Sadly; aside from her and Pegg; other characters has very little to do. Reener is fine in a really small part; Alec Baldwin is completely unused and even worse; the real veteran of the series Ving Rhames has almost nothing to do.<br/><br/>In any case; the after the first third; the movie become more fun and with good action scenes and a few predictable but acceptable twists."
"jadepietro","8","0","1","5 August 2015"," Mission Implausible
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is recommended.<br/><br/>In brief: This mission is improbable, but it's impossible not to be entertained due to the thrilling action and stunts.<br/><br/>GRADE: B <br/><br/>The mission may be impossible, and highly improbable, but it is unmistakably great fun. So start the action. Stage those death-defying stunts. Cue that recognizable theme music. Show those flashy opening credits. Mission Impossible has once again arrived. In its fifth incarnation, Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation, the IMF are now forced to disband and their primary spy, Ethan Hunt is a hunted man, a rogue agent out to save the world and accept that one last mission (should he decide to accept): to expose a group of political terrorists called The Syndicate.<br/><br/>￼Following its successful formula of high octane action and intricate plotting (which makes little logical sense once one thinks about the logistics of the plan), Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, the fifth installment of this film series, takes the movie-going audience to exotic locales (Belarus, Vienna, Morocco, London) with nifty technology and enough excitingly- staged chase scenes for three more movies, let alone one. Yes, none of it makes much sense, especially Agent Hunt's endless financial resources and expensive gadgetry he has accumulated, but the far-fetched story remains very enjoyable nevertheless.<br/><br/>￼Ethan is played by the never-aging Tom Cruise and he plays this action hero figure to perfection. Sure, no one could survive these stunts in real life (hanging outside a moving plane in midair, being underwater for an insufferable amount of time, surviving one motorcycle or car crash without any broken bones, etc.) But this adventure isn't remotely real, It's more James Bond fantasy than actual espionage caper, although it desperately wants us to believe it is the latter. Cruise inhabits this physically exhausting role with great bravado. Keeping up with his pace (and almost stealing the film away from this movie star) is Rebecca Ferguson, a talented actress new to me. Ms Ferguson plays Ilsa Faust, a devilish double agent who can whoop HUnt blow-for-blow. She brings as much believability as humanly possible in an unbelievable role. Simon Pegg supplies the humor adroitly. and makes a great sidekick to the gravely serious Hunt. James Renner, Ving Rhames, and Alec Baldwin are there to provide minor support. The only real flaw is the film's chief villain, Solomon Lane, played by Sean Harris. The actor plays him as a second-rung evildoer, common without any real menace or malicious glee.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie wrote a serviceable screenplay with enough twists to engage us. Yet it is his direction that impresses with much ballyhoo and expertly choreographed non-stop action. The film's highpoint, an assassination set piece at the Vienna Opera that juggles multiple deadly threats and exhilarating fight sequences backstage during a performance of Turandot, owes its inspiration to Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, a sly homage from a talented modern day director that would have pleased the master director of suspense with his nimble touch.<br/><br/>Yes, the glorious stunts are as complex as they are absurd, wanting to top each preceding daredevil feat just to give us our money's worth of thrills. And while the mission itself becomes more outrageous and implausible, Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation accomplishes its real mission: to entertain and thrill us.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

"mcgregorrowland","8","0","1","4 August 2015"," A great addition to the franchise
","Being a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible series I was expecting a lot from this movie, judging by how good the last one was. What I got was exactly what I was expecting and looking for. This movie had good plot twists, acting, and of course: action.<br/><br/>Like I said, this movie had some really good plot twists. After everything was explained, a new twist would pop up and that kept you on the edge of your seat. It added suspense which I like in a movie. (Warning: this is a movie you do not want to get up and go to the bathroom during it because you will miss one little thing and then you will be lost).<br/><br/>The acting was very good. Everyone did great with one exception: Rebecca Ferguson. I thought she was too overacted and I did not like her in the film. And she was not as attractive as the chick in a spy movie should be so that was a huge flaw to me. I would have much rather seen Paula Patton return in her role. Also I would like to give a round of applause to Simon Pegg because he did awesome (as usual).<br/><br/>The action was awesome and it did not disappoint. The water scene, the car and motorcycle chase, and Tom Cruise hanging out of an airplane was awesome and really cool. The action was just as good as Ghost Protocol so if you liked that movie then you will love this one.<br/><br/>One minor flaw of the movie was that it was a little long but that can be overlooked because the movie should entertain enough that it should not matter.<br/><br/>If your a Mission: Impossible fan then you will love this movie. And if you loved Ghost Protocol then you will really love this movie because this was right up there with that film regarding action. This movie is well worth your money and you will love it."
"kieranbattams","9","0","1","4 August 2015"," Solid proof Tom Cruise is one of the best action stars out there...
","What is it with franchises that were once forgotten coming back and getting better with each installment (usually the fifth)? Fast and Furious did it.. now Mission Impossible is doing it. I'm not complaining, but wasn't there a time when they would get worse?<br/><br/>Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation follows on directly from Ghost Protocal and like Avengers: Age of Ultron did, it starts us off with a spectacular action sequence that sets the scope for the rest of the film, also proving to us that Tom Cruise is one of the best.. if not THE best action star working today. I mean seriously, the dude does all of his own stunts, in the last film he climbed up the tallest building in the world, in this one he literally hangs off of the side of a plane that descends 500 feet in the air. This happened for real, the dude's life insurance must be through the roof. So this time Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and the IMF are tracking down a rogue group called 'The Syndicate' which is believed to be a myth. The action is ramped up to an all-time high here. I loved Rebecca Ferguson's character, she was a better character than the actual villain and really excels the plot further and has us guessing. From her first encounter with Hunt you aren't really sure if she is a villain or there to help him. Even by the end this almost remains a mystery. As well as this, Simon Pegg returns as Benji. Loved him in the previosus installment and i love him here. He adds a dose of humour to the film and has some great standout scenes. It really shows us Simon Pegg can take on any role and still be himself, yet make it memorable and great to watch.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames also make a surprisingly good duo and i was entertained seeing them on screen together for all the time they had. I have also never seen Alec Baldwin have so much fun. The film takes a slow turn at certain points, not really a big complaint as these slow turns explain plot details which are obviously important, but when there is action it never disappoints. The scene that takes place in the opera and the underwater scene from the trailer were highlights, the latter putting you right in Hunt's position and throwing suspense right in there. Seriously that scene was INTENSE.<br/><br/>In the end, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is a solid entry to this ever improving franchise, i came here to have fun, and i had a hell of a lot of fun. I love watching Tom Cruise do what he clearly enjoys and he must be doing it right because judging by what other people have seen they do too. Would i recommend this movie? Hell yeah i would. From the opening scene where we hear the familiar theme song the film is a fun ride that doesn't stop and i cannot fault it for that."
"reviewsbycaleb","8","0","2","3 August 2015"," Maybe the best of the series
","Just like the film, I'm going to start off running for this review. Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a really good movie! Think what you will about Tom Cruise off the screen. On the screen he is a pure and exciting action star, and even at the age of 53, man can he run.<br/><br/>This film is a good example of why we go to the movies, to be entertained but not at the expense of dulling our brain. The newest installment of Mission Impossible shows us that Hollywood blockbusters can be more than mindless action flicks that require viewers to turn there brains off to enjoy. Rogue Nation, written and directed by one of my favorites Christopher McQuarrie, is remarkably well written, and even exceeds that accomplishment with its concise delivery. The Mission Impossible series has been slandered for being convoluted, which is very accurate, but McQuarrie takes this franchise to the next level by having elements of complexity in its stories while maintaining clarity.<br/><br/>MI5 starts out to the thrilling scene that has been highly advertised, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) jumping and hanging onto an airplane while it takes off. This sets the tone for a film with many memorable action set pieces the franchise is praised for and sometimes gets lost in. One of the biggest refreshment of this film was the strong story around the set pieces that demanded much of the attention. Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol from 2011 was a let down in the series for me, which I know is contrary to popular opinion but I really liked MI3, and part of that was the investment that was lacking in the story. The impressive set pieces took center stage which made me lose interest in why they were doing these stunts and missions, Rogue Nation had no such problem. The plot of the again disavowed IMF attempting to take down a highly trained and dangerous Syndicate was not only strong, but shockingly enveloping and intriguing for a crowd pleasing Hollywood film. This is almost solely to McQuarrie's ability to get the audience to not only like the characters on screen, but have a deep care and affection for them that makes you care about the story and where it is going.<br/><br/>The highlight of Rogue Nation: Ethan Hunt finding his female equal in Ilsa Faust, played brilliantly by Rebecca Ferguson. In a year of strong female characters (particularly Charlize Theron in Mad Max) Ferguson's Faust takes home gold. Which is saying something because I love Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road. What a wonderfully complex character and performance. This is Ferguson's breakout film, and my goodness did she breakout. The concrete, and the layers on top of the plot are all focused around this character and her intentions. While Ethan Hunt is caught early in the film by The Syndicate, Faust helps him escape and saves his life many times, and you still somehow don't know where her alliances lie. With the writing of McQuarrie and the superb acting of Ferguson, you are transfixed on what is going on in the story because it will tell you what her motives our. Best side character in a series that is filled with great supporting character (Simon Pegg as Benji in particular).<br/><br/>The only thing in this film that didn't work for me was during one of the action set pieces, McQuarrie got a little bit lazy and had Ethan Hunt make a mistake, that frankly his character would never make and hasn't made in the first 4 movies. He did this to provide Ilsa Faust the vehicle to save Hunt, which is an interesting twist in this series, but was poorly executed and set up. Minor set back but would of liked that scene to be more well done and conceived.<br/><br/>The fifth installment of Mission Impossible could very well be the best so far. The action is exhilarating as you would expect, but what a gloriously written character driven story. Ferguson steals the show from Cruise, even though he is excellent as well, with a dynamic portrayal of an even more dynamic character which drives this story. To many times in recent years you see women placed in similar places in movies and it feels forced and ineffective. But with Theron earlier in the year and now Ferguson, writers and directors have shown that they can incorporate and center an action movie around a strong and interesting female character."
"j-madej","10","0","2","4 August 2015"," Chase scene in Morocco being one of the best in cinema history and I include ""Ronin"", ""The French Connection"" as well as ""Bourne Identity""
","People complain about Tom Cruise, saying he is short, scientology obsessed and extremely self- absorbed. His believe system which made him unpopular with mainstream public for a long period of time seems working for him. I personally have different opinion on why he is associated with Scientology Cult and knowing that in the past he wanted to be a Christian Catholic priest his role in church of L. Ron Hubbard might be more of a infiltration agent than anything else. But then again only Tom knows that and his handlers. He is arguably the biggest movie star in the world and with being the best comes the unpleasant part, you need to allow others to project their anxieties on you. This is what entertainers are for. They are here so that we as the audience can love them or hate them depending on the role they play. Everything is cyclical and Hollywood loves to love their stars until they hate them, then they feel guilty that they hate them and they start to love them again. Tom does extraordinary things. In CGI world of filmmaking, he does almost all his stunts insisting in pushing the boundaries more and more every movie he makes. He is also power player being producer on most of his movies which allows him to have a say which actor or director will be hired for his movies. The Mission Impossible franchise has had it's ups and downs. Each part has been directed by different director therefor often stylistically there are clear differences in direction each movie took. From Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird to now Christopher McQuarrie creator of highly successful ""Jack Reacher"" movie which sure will turn to another franchise for Tom. Believe it or not but it is his only 3rd feature film he ever directed previously mostly resuming a role of a writer on movies like ""Edge of Tomorrow"", ""Jack Reacher"" and ""Valkyrie"". As a writer he possesses very good understanding of human inner make up and what motivates characters to make their relationship work on the silver screen. By doing so he creates very believable relationships that push the plot forward. I do not want to jump the gun here but there I will say it, ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" might be the best of all the movies from this franchise and that tells a lot about it. <br/><br/>Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF.<br/><br/>The action is overwhelming with a chase scene in Morocco being one of the best in cinema history and I include ""Ronin"", ""The French Connection"" as well as ""Bourne Identity"". Every movie needs a good antagonist and after ""Deliver Us from Evil"" Sean Harris was a choice that seems perfect for highly mysterious villain Solomon Lane. As a leader of mysterious group Syndicate he creates order out of chaos. It is funny that both movies MI and the new James Bond movie ""Spectre"" are both telling a story of mysterious organization that from behind the curtain rules the world by creating conflicts, terroristic attacks that in the end are taking power over the elite politicians and power players to create the New World Order of the world. This mystical organization in real life is called the ILLUMINATI and started back in 1st of May 1776 in Bavaria by Adam Weishaupt and his associates. Of course the mainstream history and media will tell us that this organization has been dissolved and yet they are responsible for French Revolution as well as spread of Communism as a counter ideology towards a fight with Capitalism. Bottom line this film as well as the new James Bond are bringing some new information about this mysterious organization disguised some real facts with fictional disinformation techniques Hollywood is so good at spreading. To come back to the review ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is truly spectacular piece of entertainment. As I mentioned already the action is breathtaking together with stunning stunt by Tom in the opening of the movie. The performances are great from everyone involved and seems deeper than the previous installments. Bottom line is whatever are your personal feelings about Tom Cruise as a person this should not detract from the fact that he is very charismatic lead and when it comes to ""Mission: Impossible"" movies this franchise is in safe hands. I highly recommend this film to the lovers of fast paced smart action films.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"

","""One day you're going to take it too far."" Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)<br/><br/>So far, after five Mission Impossible film adaptations of the iconic TV program, Tom Cruise has not taken it too far. In fact, Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation is arguably the best of all, given its high humor and non-stop action set pieces that never disappoint. As formulaic as it basically is, it is still high-quality filmmaking. Credit inspired writer-director Christopher McQuarrie for guaranteeing his and the franchise's future.<br/><br/>But, make no mistake about it, Tom Cruise as an unstoppable operative of IMF is the core of the success—he is as muscular and bright, athletic and ironic, as he has ever been. That look in his eye of knowingness and wariness is the perfection of smart and tough, a true cinematic hero. But then his cohorts are not shabby either, notably Simon Pegg as computer nerd Benji, with just the right loyalty and smarts for being in the service of brilliant buddy Ethan. Benji is also a pretty effective man in the field when not behind a desk.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner as second in command, William Brandt, is the appropriate realist to the optimistic Hunt. Above them all, however, is the bright Rebecca Ferguson as multiple agent Ilsa Faust. Given that much of the action takes place in Casablanca, it's not hard to figure the allusion of her first name. As for Faust, well, the allusion will make sense once you see the film. She does remind me of Ingrid Bergman, and I hope the franchise continues her role.<br/><br/>A sequence at the Vienna State Opera House that syncs the music of Turandot to the spy action is as creative and smooth as any I have ever seen in a formulaic thriller. The homage to the Hitchcock The Man Who Knew Too Much is appreciated, just switching from Royal Albert Hall to Vienna.<br/><br/>The stunts are choreographed with Alvin-Ailey precision and grace, and the Robert Elswit's cinematography is sublime. As for first-rate editing by Eddie Hamilton, the film could not fly so high without it. As for lovemaking, there is none, a singular achievement in American cinema.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation is at the top of the summer thriller heap."

","I just came back from watching Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation, is one of the best action films I have ever seen and I was so excited to see my country in a Hollywood movie! But I didn't know that the first display of my country was going to start in a sand city in the middle of the desert, with sheep and goats. It's okay, but the thing is, that I know Morocco, and it is a beautiful country and it would be better if they worked on the script to show Americans how Morocco truly is. One way would be by having the first scene in a beautiful urban part of Morocco and then cut away to the desert bike scene. Also, they named the 3 most beautiful cities in Morocco, such as Casablanca, Marrakech, and Rabat, yet they only showed woven baskets being tumbled over by crazy motorcycle rides and sheep. As a Moroccan living in the USA, I experience many people asking me how it is in Morocco, and they most of them think that is just vast amounts of desert area. This movie had a chance to do better in morocco . love the movie and i also love morocco"

","There is no way in the world that I could ever begin to explain the plot of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and not make it sound like the last ten spy movies that you saw. That's probably because the plot of this movie doesn't really matter anyway, it's beside the point. Believe it or not, that's kind of a compliment. I have come to realize that this is the method that makes this series work. Take a bland spy plot about All-Star International Team of Professional Bad Guys armed the latest technological whozee-whatzit to bring down nations with a bullet and a keystroke, then plug in some highly entertaining well-planned, well thought-out action sequences that hold our attention. It's a formula that seems to work.<br/><br/>Rogue Nation is the fourth sequel in a series that I have come to have a measure of affection for. It is a product that offers a certain seal of approval, especially when it's being produced by Hollywood's current whiz-kid J.J. Abrams. A few years ago, Abrams climbed onboard this flawed, clunky series with the supremely underrated Mission: Impossible III and did something amazing – he made it fun. While James Bond and Jason Bourne steered toward grungy, real-world stuff, The Mission: Impossible pictures swim comfortably in the kinds of fun, inoffensive waters that the Roger Moore-era Bond pictures did.<br/><br/>The plot – let's just get it out of the way – involves Ethan and the IMF team hunting down evidence of the All-Star International Team of Professional Bad Guys who are called The Syndicate (I think my name is better) who want to infiltrate the top governments of the world and bring them down by assassinating their key leaders. Meanwhile the CIA (led by Alec Balwin, playing the stuff-shirt role for all its worth) wants to disband the IMF due to its repeated instances of collateral damage and for its inability to uncover proof of The Syndicate. Got all that? Good. Let's move on.<br/><br/>The Syndicate is pretty indistinguishable from Hydra or S.P.E.C.T.R.E. or The Galactic Empire, only you can't easily spot them and their uniforms aren't as interesting. Their chief assassin is a quiet, creepy little man called Solomon (Sean Harris) whose odd face and silent demeanor gets under your skin. He's really an effective bad guy.<br/><br/>What is special about this series, and this movie in particular is Tom Cruise. While his drama films repeatedly fall flat, he's made himself a really effective action star. As Ethan Hunt, he spends nearly the entire film performing stunts that should reasonable either put him in traction or in a cemetery. In that way he's a little like Indiana Jones. He gets hurt, a lot. When he crashes through a window or gets punched in the ribs by a Russian the size of a gorilla, you feel the crunch. At one point is he captured by Syndicate agents and beaten by a Russian called ""The Bone Doctor."" Later he jumps into a centrifuge full of water with no air tank. Then he gets into a long car/motorcycle chase down the busy streets of Morocco, and gets into an accident that by all laws of physics should have gotten him killed.<br/><br/>But the single best action scene in the movie takes place in The Vienna Opera House where Ethan must deal with two assassins at once, climbing around on the catwalks during a performance and battling a six-foot German killing machine. The scene works because of the way it is orchestrated with the music, and the way that the action is relatively quiet, as if the combatants are being respectful to the performers on stage. Having been inundated with so many bad action movies, I figured that it would end with a body falling on stage but, you know what, it didn't. This is a movie full of nice surprises.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who is most famous for his Oscar Winning (and overrated) screenplay to The Usual Suspects some 20 years ago. Here he shows a sure hand, letting the action scenes move on just a little longer then we might expect. They're so good that we want them to go on. And yeah, the plot is kind of beside the point, it's interesting enough that you care about the people involved, especially Ben Dunn, played wonderfully by Simon Pegg. He has such a substantial role in this movie that it almost becomes a buddy movie. The same goes for Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson as the wonderfully named Ilsa Faust, a Syndicate operative whose loyalties are always in question.<br/><br/>On the whole, this movie is just plain fun. Is it preposterous? Yes. Is it too long? Yes. But you don't mind because the movie gets the job done. It's a step above the usual fare of this type. You remember the action. You remember the characters. But you don't care anything about the plot. As I said, that's a good thing. Focus on the ride, and not the space in between."
"maz4u61","9","0","2","2 August 2015"," Throughly Enjoyable and probably the best MI yet!!!!!
","I was indifferent whether I should give 8 or 9. Thats beside the points. The movie starts very slowly with key characters in focus. And it takes a while before we get the understanding what the protagonists are after. Once everything is clear, it a game of cat and mouse with some very emotional scene involving lead female character and very exciting and innovative action scene involving lead male character. At one point, it was very dramatical and gave the illusion that both lead character ( Hunt and Elsa ) have fallen in love, just like Sherlock Holmes and the Women in Sherlock Holmes TV series. At the half way, I got a hunch that Elsa would die in the movie after fallen in love with Hunt. But that did not happen. Anyway, i found the plot very engaging and the movie in a list of must watch this year."

","I so enjoyed this movie and it is action packed. The plot was great and I was not disappointed. Been a big fan of JJ Abrams since the show Alias so am not surprised on how well this came out. All the staff and crew are to be commended. Can only hope for some Oscar nods. The Oscars never seem to give much attention to high explosive movies like M I but they really should.<br/><br/>It has been several years since I thought enough of a movie to return for a second viewing but I may just do that. What I liked most was the plot keeps moving. It starts with action, taking you through several countries, and ends in a good place...I do not wish to give away the entire plot. You can judge for yourselves. I would like to think in this place called earth if we were in deep trouble the best agents would work together for the betterment of mankind."

","I keep hearing that the Fast and Furious franchise is this epitome of a series in resurgence. Well, the latest Mission: Impossible entry comes quickly on the heels of Furious 7 and squashes that assertion. Instead of simply bloating its cast and pitting muscle-heads against one another, the Mission: Impossible series chooses to ramp up the sheer velocity of its action and the inventiveness of its setpieces. Rogue Nation reunites us with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) who's now searching for a secret terrorist organization named ""The Syndicate"" (accidentally birthed from British intelligence) while his own agency, the IMF, is facing its own problems when the CIA and Senate oversight committee begin questioning its legitimacy. Yes, the convoluted type of plot is back, but that's honestly what keeps this brand of movies refreshing.<br/><br/>Above all, Rogue Nation finds the perfect balance between a spy thriller and a purely volatile action movie. We see plenty of extended sequences where agents from different intelligence agencies share extensive dialogue about government secrets and confidential documents—the colors are worn out and the background is grayish. About ten minutes later, Hunt is suddenly zooming through Moroccan highways on a speed-bike in a wild chase. Sometimes, non-stop action can exhaust me (The Avengers 2 and The Expendables 3 being recent exemplars), but when one creative and memorable action sequence leads into another and then blends with another one, you can't help but excitedly tap your feet along and join the sweet ride. Contrary to the style of most modern action flicks, the destruction is executed so carefully and lucidly here. One segment, in particular, transpires within the beautiful edifice of a Vienna opera house as we see the pieces falling into their respective positions, slowly and tensely piling each detail/obstacle into the fray until everything collides into a delightfully (not exactly literal) explosive result.<br/><br/>For some reason, I still struggle in believing that Tom Cruise actually performs his own stunts, which only seem to continually grow in apparent impossibility. How could he scale up the scary enormity that is the Burj Khalifa or speed-run and jump onto a plane taking off, hanging onto the hatch as the plane rises and rises to frightening heights? What kind of movie star has the balls for such risky ventures? In that case, the action choreography is absolutely spectacular, also managing to masterfully fuse itself with some noteworthy physical comedy. In addition to the sheer energy of these scenes, a terrific cast raises the level of entertainment to an even greater point, especially when you have such hilarious comic relief in Simon Pegg and a new female addition in up-and-coming actress, Rebecca Ferguson. She basically replaces Paula Patton with so much more emotional complexity, heroism, and an incredible skillset that easily rivals Ethan Hunt's with the two oftentimes fighting side-by-side throughout the films' duration. Thankfully, she isn't required to fill that dull romantic interest role; instead, Ilsa has a mysterious part in all this, and a lot of focus is paid to her well-rooted arc and its fair share of twists and turns.<br/><br/>Continue the review at: http://moviemuscle.net/mission-impossible-rogue- nation-review/"
"isheikher","8","0","2","2 August 2015"," MI films offer memorable action and 'Rogue Nation' does too, yet it all feels familiar...
","Ethan Hunt and team take on their most impossible mission yet, tracking down the Syndicate - a highly skilled international rogue organization, committed to destroying the IMF. <br/><br/>The fifth entry in a franchise that began almost twenty years ago, still starring now 53 year old Tom Cruise, the MI films have offered memorable action and 'Rogue Nation' doesn't disappoint, but it feels like we've been here before. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise assembles his usual colleagues Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames to eliminate the threat posed by the Syndicate. With CIA director (Alec Baldwin) determined to shut down the IMF and newcomer Rebecca Ferguson as the agent whose allegiance is a mystery, there's much to keep the audience engaged. Sean Harris as the main villain, however, isn't up to much apart from wearing stylish spectacles and delivering a performance that's not too far off Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending. Well, maybe not THAT bad, but not memorable either.<br/><br/>From the incredible opening plane stunt, a fight scene played out in the Vienna Opera House that outdoes Bond at his own game, to a frantic car/bike chase within the narrow streets of Morocco, these sequences had me holding my breath. Yet funnily enough the one scene that failed to impress as much was the underwater vault mission, with it's CGI heavy visuals and poor execution/realisation, it sticks out like a sore thumb. <br/><br/>'Jack Reacher' director Christopher McQuarrie doesn't bring anything that sets it apart drastically from Brad Bird's Ghost Protocol, with familiar beats like face masks, double agents, a weak villain and uh, 'disavowed'. Yet i still enjoyed myself because thankfully it's not a turn-your-brain off type effort. Tom Cruise's energy and drive push this film. Pacing, tone and humour are all handled well, the performances and dialogue are decent enough. The action direction is excellent, no shaky cam or over editing. If you came for the stunts alone, you won't leave unhappy. Despite all that, there's a feeling that the producers might rest on their laurels after hitting a groove that began with MI4."
"billsonbob","Null","0","2","1 August 2015"," Should be renamed Mission:Highly Difficult
","So the most ""impossible"" moment of this movie happens in the first scene. Then every mission from that point forward is a steady decline in difficulty, excitement and interest. Culminating in That's the payoff? <br/><br/>Missing from this movie is the hallmark of the Mission: Impossible franchise: over the top, ridiculous action that leaves you laughing and shaking your head. Where is the helicopter flying into a tunnel to chase a train, only to fall an inch short of sliding Ethan's Neck? Where is climbing the side of the tallest building in the world, with only a single functional suction glove? <br/><br/>Notably missing from this--especially in in comparison to Ghost Protocol--is the sense of urgency, rhythm, pacing, and a regular dose of humor. <br/><br/>Instead of missions, we get lengthy conversation and exposition between characters, most of it joyless. Yes, a couple of chuckles, but nothing to make us truly care about the characters. Three great comedic-action actors, all of them wasted in general. <br/><br/>Decent movie, but easily the second worst in the franchise. Only M:I2 saves Rogue Nation from that fate."

","While anyone new to the ""Mission Impossible"" formula can enjoy the clever plot developments, any fan of the TV show which begat this movie franchise will be able to foresee the complications and ""twists,"" ""Rogue Nation"" takes. But, to paraphrase the saying, ""Getting there is ALL the fun..."" ""MI 4: Rogue Nation,"" is a paragon of the ""Summer Movie:"" Well-crafted, exciting, clever, exciting, fun, exciting, entertaining, exciting, technically perfect, exciting, clever, exciting, and humorous in precisely ways and to magnitudes that will make audiences laugh (in their judgment,) appropriately. And exciting. All this while attracting large numbers and big number-ticket-sales without demanding ""Oscar"" attention. ""MI 4: Rogue Nation,"" is worthy of the price of the ticket. The movie is state-of-the-art in every facet. In today's age of ""Home Theater"" my standard for purchasing a ticket to view a movie in a theater is: Does this film suggest it is best experienced on a big-screen and/or with state-of-the-technical audio? ""MI 4"" meets that standard. While those who wait for the DVD version of the movie won't be disappointed, they won't know what they missed. <br/><br/>And, not to violate the ""spoiler"" standards of IMDb, I would point out that anyone attending a theatrical viewing of ""MI 4"" recognize the value of a common practice among writers, which is to give their characters names appropriate to their...character's motives. Think ""Ariadne"" in ""Inception."""
"Special-K88","Null","0","2","1 August 2015"," worthwhile but tries to do a bit too much
","Crucial times lie ahead for the IMF as their superiors question whether the agency is in fact an asset or a nuisance, and pressure is applied from bureaucratic CIA operatives who believe the agency should be disbanded and absorbed. This puts veteran IMF agent Ethan Hunt in a precarious position as he attempts a complex assignment to try and eradicate the Syndicate, an elusive international crime consortium whose capabilities allow them to operate sort of like an 'anti-IMF.' With time running short, Hunt recruits the few loyal members of the IMF to try and complete the task, with lots of unexpected surprises along the way. The cast makes the most of the material but there are so many twists, turns, double-crosses, and cover-ups—which are intended to be slick and suspenseful—but instead just end up dragging out the plot and making it a lot more convoluted than it needs to be. Some key action set pieces, stunt work, gadgetry, and visual effects do make it worth the price of admission, but it never has quite the impact that its immediate predecessor does. **½"
"stevendbeard","8","0","1","31 July 2015"," Fantastic Stunts & Good Story
","I saw ""Mission:Impossible-Rogue Nation"", starring Tom Cruise-Jack Reacher, Rock of Ages; Rebecca Ferguson-Hercules_2014, A One Way Trip to Antibes; Sean Harris-Deliver Us From Evil, Prometheus and Alec Baldwin-Rock of Ages, The Departed.<br/><br/>This is the 5th installment in the MI franchise and it is a goody. The opening sequence has Tom jumping on top of an airplane that is rolling down the runway, about to take off-Oh yeah, it is filled with deadly nerve gas. He hangs on the side of the plane as it ascends and it is really Tom doing it, with no special effects or stuntmen. The amazing thing of the whole stunt is that Tom is 53 years old and looks like a 35 year old doing it. FYI: For the ladies out there, there are several scenes in the movie where Tom performs shirtless. As far as plot lines go, there is an organization- hinted at in the final moments of Ghost Protocol called The Syndicate-that is after the complete destruction of Tom and the whole IMF team. I guess you could call them a Rogue Nation. This Syndicate is run by Sean, who works from the shadows and Rebecca works for him-you can think of her as the opposite side of the coin to Tom. Alec plays the head of the C.I.A. and he wants to shut down the IMF too, but for different reasons-he doesn't like it that they break so many rules and get things done that the C.I.A. can't accomplish.....or maybe, do you think he is just the tiniest bit jealous? Who knows. So while Tom and his IMF team are trying to save the world, they are also on the run from all sides; good guys and bad. Besides the opening plane stunt, there are plenty of car and or motorcycle chases, underwater stunts and plain old physical fisticuffs to keep you on the edge of your seat. There is nothing after the end credits but if you see it in IMAX-like I did-the opening IMAX countdown that is usually done before the movie starts, has a Mission:Impossible style countdown that is intertwined with it. I saw Tom on a talk show and he said that he is already working on the next one in the series, numero 6. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the action, violence and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. Fantastic stunts, good story, I guess you could say that I enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
