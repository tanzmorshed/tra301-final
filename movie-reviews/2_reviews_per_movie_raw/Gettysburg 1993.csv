","This is one of my favorite movies, and the comments of fans on this site notwithstanding, I think it was underrated. From the first time I saw it, it exemplified a personal theory that women (until very recently) rarely see men at their very finest, and that is unfortunately often (obviously not always)in battle. The courage, commitment and humanity that this movie portrays, on both sides of the conflict, moves me to tears every time, and the humanity is key. I don't know enough about the battle to point out any glaring historical inaccuracies, but the acting was exemplary across the board, with Jeff Daniels outstanding. The battle at Little Round Top is one of the finest movie scenes I've witnessed. I particularly like the expressions of respect and awe on the faces of Chamberlin's men when he tells them to ""fix bayonets"". What's striking is that there was no ""good"" choice; there was a clear and compelling objective in a much bigger picture, and this schoolteacher rose to the challenge, and his men went with him. This movie conveys a lot-through the long philosophical discourses and the action-about how people behave when they are inextricably joined with other people, for a cause that they don't fully understand, charged with a responsibility that no individual should bear, and with the desire mainly to return to the way things were before. It conveys a lot about true leadership and sacrifice. It conveys that individual choices and motivations always impact others, sometimes on huge scales. Guys, I don't know if you can convince your wives/girlfriends to cuddle up with this film, but I would make the attempt; there are obviously very ugly things that people did to each other in this and any conflict, but if I ever got a sense of the nobility of men and their push in this world, it was from this film."
"vaughan.birbeck","Null","20","20","5 March 2002"," An amazing battle picture
","A film that runs longer than 'Lawrence of Arabia' and only covers three days of action sounds a long haul but it is not. As someone who is both British and interested rather than an expert on the Civil War I found 'Gettysburg' very satisfying. The prologue makes the objectives of the two armies clear and the 'updates' in the form of dialogue between the commanders mean the viewer doesn't lose sight of the course of events. The battle scenes capture the ""terrible beauty"" of combat, conveying terror, claustrophobia and violence without being too horrific.<br/><br/>More important, the film makes the most of the remarkably rich characters who took part. My only hope is that Col. Chamberlain was as intelligent, humane and courageous in life as Jeff Daniels's performance. This is just one example, and there are many men one would like to know more about as a result of seeing this.<br/><br/>The one question I was left with came from Martin Sheen's portrayal of Lee. I know Lee had been unwell before the battle but Martin Sheen seems strangely remote from events, with a glazed look in his eye and high-pitched 'other worldly' voice. Is this fair and accurate? At least Lee has the moral courage to say ""It's all my fault"" when he sees the result of Pickett's Charge. I don't remember Douglas Haig saying that after the first day on the Somme in 1916."

","Utterly superb dramatization of the turning point battle of the Civil War. A clash so enormous in scale that whoever won, was destined to win the war. Brilliantly directed and screenwritten with top notch moving performances by all. Almost makes you understand why so many people are into those reenactment things. <br/><br/>I think to fully appreciate the more intelligent war films, you almost have to know the battle in detail going in. The movie uses dialogue to try and explain whats happening, but its extremely hard to conceptualize without the aid of graphics. I'm not saying you won't enjoy this film without a firm grasp of the battle details, only that you will enjoy it much more if you are able to do a little reading beforehand. Either way, see it. I am truly amazed by the depth of feeling all these guys were able to put into this project. Daniels and Berenger, in particular, give Oscar caliber performances. A total home run."
"SnugglySoft","10","17","17","9 October 2002"," My favorite movie of all time!
","This is undoubtedly my favorite movie of all time.  Martin Sheen and Jeff Daniels give, in my opinion, the greatest performances of their careers. The music and cinematography is also excellent.<br/><br/>I have heard of complaints that this movie is too long. But to fully understand the story, it takes this much footage to make the movie complete.<br/><br/>
I think that Ronald F. Maxwell did an excellent job in taking ""The Killer Angels"" (the book that the movie is based on) and turning it into a movie. The trilogy of novels surrounding this story i.e. ""Gods and Generals"", ""The Killer Angels"", and ""The Full Measure"" are excellent reads for any war or history buff and I would strongly recommend them.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are also very realistic.  This movie was a dream for every civil war reenactor alive.  Thousands came from across the country to be in this movie.  They were not paid with money, but paid with the chance to reenact their passion for history on the same fields where their ancestors spilled there blood over 100 years ago.  That is a feat in itself.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is a 10.  It makes me cry every time I watch it. The acting, cinematography, and music, make history come to life. Go and see it! Can't wait till ""Gods and Generals"" comes out!"
"shermatz","Null","94","108","23 November 2004"," Gettysburg: All Time Top 10
","I've been reading all the other comments pro & con with great interest, and I just have to add my voice to the ""pro"" side for this ambitious and stirring epic. Gettysburg is indeed one of my ""all time top 10"" movies. I was especially curious to see it on initial theatrical release because of the casting of Martin Sheen as Lee; were I to cast a civil war movie, the name Martin Sheen would NEVER have entered my mind as an appropriate performer for this make-or-break role. To my astonishment, Sheen was MAGNIFICENT in his portrayal of Lee; in appearance, demeanor, and aura of command, Sheen COMPLETELY sold me. A stunning performance from an unexpected casting choice. I agree that ""Gods & Generals"" would have benefited from Sheen's re-casting, though Duvall did his best with the more limited part he was given.<br/><br/>Yeah, I agree that the script tended to a lot of bloviation and speechifying by the principals. I do think we need to make allowance for the fact that in this pre-technological 19th century era portrayed, people DID communicate in ways that seem artificial and awkward by our standards. This was a time when oratory, whether in churches, politics, or general discourse, was valued both as communication and entertainment. So even if the dialogue got a bit overblown, I was more than willing to cut the production some slack. <br/><br/>The beards were a problem for me also, especially poor Tom Berenger's. Still, he (like ALL the lead actors) transcended the limitations and delivered what resonated for me as a credible interpretation of the time and situation. <br/><br/>MANY details of the movie can be nit-picked, and of course, those determined to hate ""Gettysburg"" can always find a reason, rational or not. I was BLOWN AWAY by the quality and passion of this movie from my first theatrical viewing and it was one of the very first DVD's I purchased. After multiple viewings (all 4 hours) I'm still impressed and grateful that Ted Turner had the desire and ambition to tackle such a BIG project that would be sniped at from all corners for eternity. My goodwill extends to the much weaker (but still defensible) ""Gods and Generals""; if they go ahead and produce ""The Last Full Measure,"" I promise I'll be first in line at the movie theater AND pre-order the DVD! <br/><br/>10 out of 10!"
"cariart","Null","60","69","14 March 2004"," Long, but Powerful Epic, Filmed on Location...
","GETTYSBURG, based on Michael Shaara's bestseller, ""The Killer Angels"", is a truly remarkable film, in it's clear, if long, presentation of the Civil War's bloodiest, best-known, yet least understood battle, in it's 'humanizing' of the almost legendary characters of the period, and, most amazingly, for being filmed at the actual locations where the actions took place, in Gettysburg, itself. From Little Round Top to Seminary Ridge, you see the events where they actually occurred, 140 years ago. It is a singular achievement, and Ted Turner deserves credit for making it happen.<br/><br/>Two characters dominate the film; Jeff Daniels, in one of his finest performances, is a likable, totally believable Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the Maine ex-schoolteacher who would win the Congressional Medal of Honor; and Tom Berenger, sporting a huge, bushy beard, is a sympathetic 'voice of reason' as Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, successor to ""Stonewall"" Jackson as Robert E. Lee's field commander. Chamberlain and Longstreet provide the film it's focus, as honorable men attempting to fulfill their duty, while the carnage builds around each of them. <br/><br/>Other memorable performances include Sam Elliott, in a brief but memorable cameo as Brig. Gen. John Buford, the battle-hardened cavalry commander who initiates the battle after guessing the Confederates' objectives at Gettysburg; Richard Jordan, in one of his last appearances before his untimely death, as Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead, facing his best friend in battle; Kevin Conway, as Chamberlain's gruff but likable Irish First Sergeant, Sgt. 'Buster' Kilrain; C. Thomas Howell as Lt. Thomas D. Chamberlain, Joshua's brother, who creates a sense of familial concern for Daniels; and Stephen Lang (who would go on to play Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson in GODS AND GENERALS), as an ever-confident, ebullient Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett.<br/><br/>In the pivotal role of Robert E. Lee, Martin Sheen is less effective, lacking Lee's well-documented charisma, and substituting constant world-weary gazes for characterization. Robert Duvall, who assumed the role in GODS AND GENERALS, would be far more credible as Lee.<br/><br/>The sheer numbers of the battle are staggering; over 150,000 combatants, with 53,000 dead, more in a single three-day engagement than were lost during the entire war in Vietnam. The armies of actors, extras, and recreators could not nearly match those numbers, yet the film effectively conveys the immensity of the conflict. The tactical errors (Lee's decision, on the third day of battle, to order Pickett's suicidal charge into the Union guns; Meade's decision, drawing the fury of President Lincoln, to allow the Southern survivors to return home without further slaughter, while a humane gesture, probably lengthening the war) are presented within the context of of the overall conflict, providing the viewer with justification for their decisions.<br/><br/>Director Ronald F. Maxwell presents a complex, fascinating tapestry in GETTYSBURG, and it is not a film you will soon forget!"
"twhiteson","8","12","12","20 October 2002"," Gettysburg and Re-enactors
","I just want to respond to the criticism of this movie's use of Civil War reenactors as extras. Yes, the average reenactor is a heck of lot older and fatter than was the average Civil War soldier. Reenactors are great at dressing as Civil War soldiers, but most of them don't LOOK anything like Civil War soldiers, who were very young men reduced to sinew and bone from physical exertion and poor diet. Also, reenactors are not professional actors or stunt men which is very evident in this movie. (In some scenes you can actually see some of them staring into the camera while everyone else is looking off in another direction. Also, their embarrassing attempts to recreate hand-to-hand combat during the finale of Pickett's Charge are just pathetic to watch. Not to mention the melodramatic ""deaths"" and the guys grinning like Cheshire Cats while they're supposed to be acting as in fear of their lives.)<br/><br/>However, there is NO way ""Gettysburg"" could have been made without reenactors. In order to give the movie's battle scenes an ""epic"" look, it needed several thousand extras and this film didn't have anyway near the budget to afford professional extras or travel overseas to rent-out a small European army as Hollywood films used do to. Heck, the production company couldn't even afford a decent make-up department (which is obvious from those awful, fake looking beards) let alone hire hundreds of professional extras, costume them, and train them. Reenactors, despite their faults, made this movie possible by working for free and by bringing their own uniforms, equipment, knowledge of Civil War tactics, and enthusiasm for this project. It was either use the services of reenactors or no movie about the battle of Gettysburg was going to be made.<br/><br/>While ""Gettysburg"" could not have been made without reenactors, I do feel director Ronald Maxwell could have done a better job of filming around some of the more ridiculous looking ones. Instead, he almost seems to revel in showing off the fattest and oldest of the bunch- the first Confederate soldier with a speaking part is a man over 60 yrs old who had to be at least 300lbs! Now how can anyone believe that this man marched 20 miles a day in June heat while carrying a 50lb pack? Supposedly, Maxwell has learned from his mistakes. While he is justifiably proud of ""Gettysburg,"" he was not deaf to the guffaws at all those chubby Rebs and geriatric Yanks. Thus, for the upcoming ""Gods and Generals"" his casting directors were ordered to be much choosier in deciding which reenactors will be in that movie. (In other words, they were ordered to cull out the fatbodies and oldsters.)<br/><br/>Despite being a big fan of this movie, I can recognize the weaknesses of using reenactors as extras in a period war film. However, anyone who applauds the fact that ""Gettysburg"" was ever made must also commend the dedication of those reenactors who made its creation possible."

","Warning:  Somewhat of a spoiler on historical points.<br/><br/>
As a civil war buff, I can tell you that this is the best movie ever made of the civil war, perhaps the best war movie of all time, and possibly one of the best movies of all time.  I find it enjoyable to rewatch frequently.<br/><br/>The movie is surprisingly, historically accurate.  I have read over two hundred books on the civil war and I can tell you with at least a little authority, that the three main characters in the movie deserve their treatment.<br/><br/>The first character is Tom Berenger giving a superb portrayal of Lieutenant General James (Pete) Longstreet, a Confederate corps commander.  For the benefit of those who are not that familiar with civil war history, the monumental battle of Gettysburg occurred just past the halfway point of the war.  Significantly, it occurred after the death of CSA Lieutenant General Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson.  Longstreet graduated to General Lee's most trusted lieutenant.  The movie accurately portrays the tug of wills between Longstreet and Lee.  It is historical fact that Longstreet argued against invasion of the North, agreeing to it only after getting some vague assurance from Lee that the battle would be defensively fought.  It is fact that Longstreet argued for an attack around the Union's left flank (if there was to be an attack at all).  Finally, it is undeniable fact that Longstreet argued with Lee so vehemently against the final failed attack that he later wrote that he thought he had stepped over the military line and would be relieved of command.  I don't see how Berenger could have done a better job and I am still upset that he received no Academy Award recognition.  I would imagine that Americans from the South are a little uncomfortable about Longstreet being right and the supposedly lovable Lee being wrong.  But, history is history.  I should mention that Longstreet is my favorite Confederate Officer.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen does only a fairish job of portraying General Robert E. Lee. He seems to have only one facial expression, that of pain and worry. Perhaps that is understandable considering that Gettysburg was such a Confederate disaster, but I believe it was overdone.  What I do find interesting is that historians are coming more and more to the realization that Lee was not such a great general and perhaps not even a very good one. Looking at this movie unbiasedly, you can't help but get that impression yourself.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels, playing the character of Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, does a job that is every bit as good as Berenger's portrayal of Longstreet. Chamberlain was very much the Union hero as portrayed in this movie, so Northern Americans may especially like this movie.  Chamberlain did in fact win the Congressional Medal of Honor for his performance during the Battle of Gettysburg.  A non-regular military man, a non West Point graduate, Chamberlain went on to great glory even after Gettysburg.  Promoted all the way up to Major (two-star) General, Chamberlain was more than with Grant at the final surrender of Lee at Appomattox Court House, as pointed out by another reviewer.  He was given the singular honor of officially receiving the surrender and parole of Confederate troops three days after Lee's negotiated surrender, and well after Lieutenant General Grant had left for Washington.  He also won recognition for his dramatic salute to the defeated Confederate soldiers that both Union and Confederate people of the time appreciated.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully choreographed with thousands of extras, many, most, or perhaps even all being professional re-enactors. It gave the movie a realism lacking in many other war movies.  The pathos of some of the Officers was palpable and made one sad whether of Union or Confederate sympathy.  The musical score was memorable.  I give it a ten out of ten and I, for one, enjoyed the length of the movie which is admittedly long at just over four hours.<br/><br/>Rent this movie.  You will learn a great deal of American history, and have a good time doing so."
"Hancock_the_Superb","7","42","48","10 July 2002"," Not the best, but a great representation of the epic battle of the Civil War
","All I hear is people griping about how long this film is.  That's not the point.  The point is it represents what is considered by historians to be the most important battle of the American Civil War.<br/><br/>I will admit that the length of the film kinda takes away from it, but it is nonetheless good.<br/><br/> Save a few historical gaffes (eg. Chamberlain and the 20th Maine at Picket's Charge - in reality, they were being held in reserve near the Round Tops with the rest of the V Corps), this film is very realistic, using thousands of professional re-enactors to fight the battle scenes, which adds to it.<br/><br/>Many battles and side notes were left out (eg. Vincent was mortally wounded on Little Round Top; or did they mention this, I don't remember), but that is okay, given the film focuses on Joshua L. Chamberlain and the 20th Maine, who saved the day at Little Round Top on July 2.<br/><br/> Skirmishes at the Herr Tavern, McPherson's Hill, Little Round Top, and Picket's Charge were all the fighting I remember.  But, again, this doesn't really take anything away.<br/><br/> The sweep and grandeur is helped by the superb cinematography (by Kees Van Oostrum) and great acting on the part of Tom Berenger (Longstreet), Martin Sheen (Lee), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain), C. Thomas Howell (Tom Chamberlain), Sam Elliot (Buford), and the rest of the superb cast.  A standout is the late Richard Jordan  as Lewis Armistead, the brigade commander in Picket's division who was killed leading his troops ""over the top"" against Union artillery.<br/><br/> The battle scenes are excellent; Picket's Charge, in real time, is superb, but the furious battle for Little Round Top is one of the most desperate battle scenes ever filmed.  You can feel the fear and tension of the 20th Maine as the 44th Alabama (I believe this is correct) charges up the hill again and again.  When Chamberlain and his men finally sweep their opponents off the hill?<br/><br/> I think that it may have been good to portray the charging Confederates as well, since they had many interesting stories among them (e.g., the commander of the 44th, William Oates, had a brother, John, who had been ill with a fever and refused to stay behind, and was mortally wounded in the carnage), and the heroics of such people as Vincent himself, and Patrick O'Rourke (who led his New York regiment in a counterattack that saved Vincent's right flank and was killed in the charge) are neglected, but I'm not complaining.<br/><br/> Despite the length and a few overdramatic speeches, this is a great movie.<br/><br/> Seven out of ten."

","Wonderful depiction of the events leading to a pivotal battle of the Civil War, the battle of Gettysburg, with a focus on 3 key individuals: Confederate General Robert E.

General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger), and Union  Col Joshua Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels).<br/><br/>Truly classic storytelling beautifully presented. Each key event is intelligently and gently depicted leaving little of the battles, the personalities, and the actions to be misunderstood. I felt much closer to the unfortunate events that were our Civil War than I  ever imagined. I don't consider myself ignorant as a rule, but to tell the truth I never envisioned that the battles were basically fought hand-to-hand, face-to-face, long lines of fighting men falling, almost randomly, on both sides.<br/><br/>This movie, along with John Frankenheimer's ""Andersonville"" jump-started a serious interest for me in these historical docudramas, and the Civil War in particular. Thank you Mr. Frankenheimer, and Mr. Ronald Maxwell (director of ""Gettysburg"")."
"trpdean","Null","45","54","22 February 2003"," Vivid, well worth seeing, faithful to book,heartbreaking ending
","This movie picks up steam as it goes along - leading to its wrenching end, as did the battle.  <br/><br/>The performance of Richard Jordan as Lo Armistead must be singled out for praise - his anguish was very moving. I'd loved the actor in The Friends of Eddie Coyle and what a job he does. (It helps that he's given the best lines in the movie). Martin Sheen as Robt. E. Lee is not the first name that would come to mind - but I think he gave a fine performance - his accent was entrancing. Sam Elliott is perfectly chosen as (and wonderfully played) the western General John Buford. I also think Jeff Daniels was absolutely wonderful - conveying so well the different manner of someone who until a year before, had been a civilian professor, not a colonel. Unfortunately although I'm generally a fan of Tom Berenger, I wasn't particularly moved by any scene he was in - he kind of walks through it.<br/><br/>The movie is written so well - and its pace just fine. There are so many interesting scenes, touching on many different aspects of life and war - from the nature of man and race to the paradox of a general loving his army yet having to sacrifice it. Jordan brought home so well the closeness of the senior officers to those on the other side. <br/><br/>I loved how well they showed the varied purposes for fighting of the different armies, and the occasional reference to a perceived resentment by the Union soldiers over what they saw as Confederate pretensions to higher social class. (""They're so arrogant"", etc.). <br/><br/>The music is first rate - and definitely enhances the drama. The depiction seems quite authentic. <br/><br/>Some niggling criticisms: aside from the map at the start of the movie, there is none. Maps would definitely have helped to undeerstand the overall picture. People commonly refer to directions (from the norht, from the west, etc.) or ""we must flank them to the right"" and it's hard to understand if you haven't read about the battle.<br/><br/>The scene with the runaway slave is too abbreviated from the book - it doesn't have much impact in the movie. <br/><br/>Kevin Conway's dialogue and accent was a bit over the top, and the English military attache was rather clicheed.<br/><br/>For all that General Hancock is referenced, we see very little of him.<br/><br/>We see the diatribe by General Trimble against General Ewell - but without seeing anything of that battle (or Ewell ever), it just hangs there - rather than being part of any continuous story. (In the book, Ewell's and Early's conduct is more discussed - including a wonderful scene by the two with Lee). If they weren't going to discuss that side of the battle, they should have left Trimble's (well-played) trembling anger out of the story - it doesn't belong in this movie.<br/><br/>Gen. Longstreet is the star of the book and movie - yet I never sensed from Berenger the great brooding quality (and he wasn't given any reference to the fact that his thre children had just died) that he has throughout the battle - according to the book. Similarly, Gen. Lee's health (his heart and headaches, etc.) is a constant factor - not shown in the movie.<br/><br/>
Despite the criticisms, this is a wonderfully done movie - from a Pulitzer Prize winning book. It's long - but quite clear, and very deeply moving. I defy anyone to see the last 1/2 hour and not have tears in their eyes. I'd very strongly recommend this."

","Its over four hours long,but doesn't feel it. Any while its not gory you do get a sense of the hell of war.<br/><br/>What can I say that hasn't been said already?<br/><br/>The film works mostly because at its center its the story of Jeff Daniel's Joshua Chamberlain, a well educated man who goes off to do his duty even though he knows he may end up dead. Daniel's gives a performance that should have been noticed by the Oscars but wasn't. Its through Daniel's interaction with all the other characters that we come to understand what the war was about.<br/><br/>Even if the odd facial hair makes you crazy, its a great film. I can't recommend this film enough."

","With a few notable exceptions Schindler's List, Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan and Glory, history based movies usually die quick and quiet in the movie theater (The Messenger, Ride with the Devil, Cobb) History flicks cost a bundle to make with the costumes and the challenge of finding a place to shoot that's nowhere near highways, bridges, and cities, and they don't always appeal to mass audiences.<br/><br/>So it's not that often that really good historical film comes around. As a result, it's good not to be too fussy when one does. Both Gettysburg and the Killer Angels, the book it was based on, were stuffed with historical inaccuracies, the grossest of all being the presence of the 20th Maine regiment anywhere near Pickett's charge (this happens in both the movie and the book).<br/><br/>For all the lengthy soliloquies, historical misses, whitewashed violence, and the fact that only about 30% of the battle of Gettysburg is shown on film, Gettysburg remains as the best effort to capture the sprawling battle of July 1863 on film. Where the movie lacks in realism, it makes up for it's dialogue, and in the scope of the battle scenes, which are on a scale so grand, that the bloodless body count and the inaccurate tactics can be forgiven. The sheer numbers of soldiers taking part in Pickett's charge was breathtaking. Kudos to the reenactors.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen and Tom Beringer were they're usual excellent selves as Lee and Longstreet and for me, their ongoing debate of the strategy of Gettysburg helped make the movie. Other highlights include the disenchantment of Union soldiers at this stage of the Civil War, and the personal trauma Richard Jordan's Lewis Armistead felt at having to fight his friend Winfield Hancock not only in the same war, but in the same sector of the same battle of that war.<br/><br/>Much of Gettysburg has to be viewed with a grain of salt, but until a Stephen Speilberg or other directing genius with a knack for war footage comes along, it's one of the best we have. And it's pretty good."
"grahamsj3","9","7","7","5 September 2000"," Wow!
","What a film! This one grabs you right from the start and keeps you. And it needs to-it's a long film. The film is fairly accurate, historically, and was shot partially on location. The performances of Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee and Tom Berenger as General James Longstreet are nothing to get excited about, especially during one scene where both of them deliver their lines very woodenly. Nearly everyone else in the film is great! The most galvanizing performance is that of Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain. I'd have followed him into hell, which his men did. The battle scenes in this film are truly epic in size and the cinematography is brilliantly executed. When all those dozens of Confederate cannon fire one by one, it made me feel as if those cannonballs were headed for me. The soundtrack is spectacular, particularly if you have DTS 5.1! I gave it a 9 only because I felt that Sheen & Berenger could have done a little better. But it is truly one of the great war films of all time."

","I saw this movie years ago on TNT and I thought very well of it.  I thought it to be a bit long but other than that it was a very good movie with an excellent cast.  <br/><br/>After visiting the actual battlefield in early June (I suggest to you anyone that has a chance to do so, it is a great experience), my interest was renewed.  Sitting on top of the little round top and looking down and around the hill I could envision the 20th Maine.  Looking over the grounds where Pickett's Charge took place I could hear the canon's thunder and the bullets flying by.<br/><br/>This movie captures the essence of the battle and it has to be long in order to do so.  The torment of the Generals was more than apparent throughout the movie.  The emotions run deep and the actors did a very good job of conveying them.  The soundtrack complemented the movie a 100% and gave the right accents at the right moments.  The cinematography was awesome and accurate, since a lot was filmed on location.  The acting is great and the reenactors should also be praised for their participation.<br/><br/>
If you watch this movie and criticize its historical inaccuracies you will miss the point.  It does the best job it can, to give you the feel and overview of the entire battle.  <br/><br/>You will be crying at some point, for all the men lost in vain in the civil war. The most terrible kind of war in which brothers, relatives or friends face each other with the intend to kill each other.  You will also realize the heavy burden of the officers leading their men to a battle where their death is most surely waiting.<br/><br/>Above all, the film will tell us how insane we are as a human race.  We organize ourselves and develop weapons in order to mass destruct each other. Over 50000 men died in three days, how many mothers, wives and families were destroyed as a consequence is something for all of us to think about. One thing is certain, it is a very high price to pay for any cause no matter how `sacred' or `right' this cause may be.<br/><br/>Look at me I am mumbling on with my emotions and thoughts that have emanated from the movie.  Watch the movie, for all its shortcomings; it is still right up there with Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan."

Once I got past the awful beard of Tom Berenger who was playing General Longstreet, I was delighted at his performance which to me was an academy award worthy performance. Ronald Maxwell is my hero for bringing this wonderful story to life and to all the extras that were needed to make this movie a complete success my hat is off to you.

It was interesting how they portrayed Robert E. Lee. They make him look a little stupid in his strategy but also gave him a compassionate look, and you couldn't help but feel sorry for the man. Actually, all the officers on both sides were portrayed fairly as nothing but good and brave men.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels, as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, had the best role and came off looking the best. It may be Daniels' best work ever, too. Martin Sheen was outstanding as Lee. Kudos to Tom Berenger (Lt. Gen. James Longstreet) and Richard Jordan (Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead) for their performances, too.<br/><br/>It's a quality show, filmed on the Gettysburg sites, too. Although there are a few long fight scenes, this is not a bloody film. Language-wise, this probably holds the record for the most usage of the word ""damn"" but that's it, profanity-wise.<br/><br/>I wouldn't let the length of this movie prohibit you from watching it. You can always break it up into segments over a couple of days."

","A very interesting take on the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, which is unfortunately marred by its excessive length (well over four hours), which could easily have been cut by at least an hour if unnecessary marching scenes were cut out. (I timed one point in the movie when a full six minutes went by showing nothing but troops marching. This was absolutely tedious!)<br/><br/>There isn't much ""drama"" involved in this. How can there be? Everyone knows the Battle of Gettysburg, we all know that the North won, and serious students of the Civil War know most of the military manoeuvres that were used, as well as the fates of the major combatants. So, it was up to the director (Ronald F. Maxwell) and the various actors to give us something of a unique spin to hold our attention through the long story. For the most part, they were successful.<br/><br/>I was quite intrigued by Martin Sheen's portrayal of General Robert E. Lee. Lee comes across almost in a mystical way - a man of vision and courage, and yet also very human. The debates between Lee and General James Longstreet (played by Tom Berenger) over strategy were realistic, and the fact that Longstreet was proved for the most part to be right demonstrate the fact that Lee - while a great General - was subject to human failings as well. Sheen portrays a Lee who is coming to terms with his hero status among his troops, but also shows him subtly uncomfortable with it.<br/><br/>Also interesting was the constant hearkening back to the pre-war relationship between Union general Winfield Hancock (Brian Mallon) and Confederate General Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan). Good friends before the war (almost brothers, as both describe the relationship) they now find themselves on opposite sides of this great battle, wanting to see each other because they are friends and yet not wanting to see each other as enemies. Tears well up in both as they speak to fellow officers about the relationship. A believable portrayal of how many Americans must have felt in this conflict which divided friends and families.<br/><br/>Most interesting of all, though, was the portrayal of General Joshua Chamberlain (by Jeff Daniels), the colonel of the 20th Maine Infantry. I was only vaguely familiar with Chamberlain when I first saw this movie, and was motivated by it to become more familiar with a truly fascinating individual. Hardly a classic soldier (he was a university professor of English and Religion back in Maine) Chamberlain displays a solid grasp of tactics, and comes across as the great Northern hero in this account of Gettysburg.<br/><br/>So, there are a lot of good things in this movie. Don't let the length of over four hours put you off. Although there are a few tedious scenes (such as the marching scene I described earlier) it's worth hanging in through them to get a very realistic and largely historically accurate picture of perhaps the greatest battle of the US Civil War.<br/><br/>6/10"
"RussianPantyHog","Null","7","8","10 March 2004"," Has its faults, but overall, worthy & moving
","I know the Civil War is a very 'american' thing, so i hope folks won't mind me poking my British nose onto the board. I got Gettysburg from Blockbuster on 2 video tapes & watched it in 1 go, though I gather it was made for tv in 2 instalments. Utterly watchable and, yes, very moving, especially when you consider it was actually filmed on the very ground where so many brave men fought more than 140 years ago. Just imagine what those soldiers would've made of it? I wonder if they realised their struggle would become part of history? From what I know of the Civil War the battle and command decisions were faithfully re-created with none of the banal sub-plots, ridiculous ""love interests"" and fictionalised scenes so beloved of Hollywood. It was also wonderful to see the massed infantry composed of real human beings without a hint of CGI. Pickett's Charge was incredibly poignant, especially as 'we' know what the outcome will be. I noted there isn't a single actress in the film. Apologies to all ladies out there, but that's the way it really was. ALL the actors gave fine performances; particularly the always great Tom Berenger as General Longstreet. I could feel the strain of 'command' every time he was on screen. I've always felt Robert E Lee was the finest general the USA ever produced. Such a tragic irony he ended up fighting against it. By the way, Lee was originally offered command of the Union army but declined out of loyalty to his beloved Virginia. That's the way many americans felt back then. They saw their nationality as their State. Martin Sheen gave a 1st class performance, though I personally wish the role had gone to a taller and (sorry Martin) more ""distinguised"" actor. Lee was an intellectual and a gentleman. His troops followed him from respect and love, whereas Grant's soldiers were motivated by respect and fear. A subtle difference, but important. There are faults with this film. Firstly I was slightly irritated it keeps alive the myth that the Civil War was fought to free the slaves. A nice idea, but un-true. Slavery was an obscenity, but that wasn't why the war was fought. It was fought to either preserve or end the Union, depending on which side a person was. By the way, Abraham Lincoln & US Grant both came from slave-owning families! Another fault with this film is the almost complete abscence of blood, 'gore' and real suffering. All the hundreds of extras look remarkably fit and healthy. In actual fact both sides (but particularly the Confederacy) suffered appaling squalor, hunger, disease and misery. There were no medics back then, no morphine, no helicopter casevacs, just the slim chance of an ill-trained & probably drunk ""surgeon"" turning up with a dirty saw and a bottle of whisky for anaesthetic. Vast numbers of injured men died from infected wounds, or were simply left where they fell. I wished the film had shown a bit more of the 'down side' to war. And then there were the beards. Oh God. Anyone who's seen the ""women at the stoning"" in Monty Python's Life of Brian will know what I mean. Most high scholl drama prop boxes contain more convincing false beards than the ridiculous items Berenger & Sheen were wearing. Martin Sheen looked like a mall Santa & Tom Berenger's was just surreal. Anyway. The strengths of this film far outweigh its faults. I remember seeing a US Army newsreel shot in the 1930s which filmed the Civil War 75th anniversary reunion. A small number of very elderly veterans, from both sides, gathered in friendship. It's such a shame so many fine men died in this dreadful conflict."

","Gettysburg is the greatest Civil War film ever made and one of the best war movies, period. It has everything that a great movie should include, from excellent acting to riveting action, from beautiful cinematography to a stirring musical score.<br/><br/>The acting in the film, especially by the three main characters Tom Berenger (Lt. Gen. James Longstreet), Martin Sheen (Gen. Robert E. Lee), and Jeff Daniels (Col. Joshua Chamberlain), is some of the best possible. They all express hardcore emotion without being over the top. The supporting cast is no less great in their roles, which really carries the film.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are some of the most stirring ever seen on film and my father still cannot watch the Pickett's Charge segment without tearing up. The accompanying music throughout the movie also lends to what is quite possibly one of the top ten movies of all time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to everyone, history/war buff or not. Trust me, don't be scared by the 4 hour length of the film, you won't even notice and you'll be glued to your seat!"

I admit some scenes were a bit drawn out, but so were the yoda scenes in star wars, but do people hate star wars because there are a few less than exciting scenes in the movie? No!!!!!!! We watch them once to get their jist and then fast-forward them. The casting and acting were great. ""Too many overhead shots on picket's charge""? They were trying to give people an idea of just how many people were involved in this battle, you can say 15, 000 but when you see it, it amazes you that they could all do this in such uniformity. The special effects were descent. I hate movies with so much OBVIOUSLY computer-generated graphics, some is ok, but when half the movie is computers, it takes away from it. The score was EXCELLENT. This is one of my all time favorite movies."
"jpg-8","7","4","4","19 February 2000"," Very good movie, interesting not only for military historians
","Watching ""Gettysburg"", you will know everything about the battle. Where the armies marched, who attacked, where the fighting took place, etc. Facts are very precise. You will also find out how the chain of command works, from the highest general to the men fighting of the front row. Anybody interested in military history has plenty to learn and won't feel the 4 hours of the movie. One of the good points of the screenplay is that it keeps coming on the discussions between general Lee and lieutenant general Longstreet : what those two officers decided is indeed a main point. Those who are not fond of strategy will perhaps appreciate very spectacular combat scenes, like the assault on Little Round Top or the charge of the Pickett division. They may also like the performances of the actors. Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, Sam Elliott, Jeff Daniels... All are very believable Civil War officers. They don't just act, they also managed to have a physical aspect close to the historical characters. In the end, there are only two reproaches to be made to ""Gettysburg"". The first is about the music : sometimes there is too much of it. The second is about the speech of colonel Chamberlain to the mutinous soldiers from Maine. I don't really know how officers cheered troops reluctant to fight. But this speech looks like a clichÃ© when you hear it. Those two drawbacks are very minor, fortunately. The movie is anyway very good : it is not up to anybody to keep interest going for 4 hours."

","The thing that most impressed me was how well the movie followed Michael Shaara's original plot in ""The Killer Angels."" One will note that several scenes are exactly word for word out of the book! The best I've seen when it comes to being based out of a novel, no contest! Literally they used the book as a script.<br/><br/>The characters are extremely well cast! Not only do they look like the characters they portray, but they act like them too. Any person who knows the history of the individual characters would applaud the actors. Daniels stands out in his portrayal of Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain, an Oscar worthy performance. Berenger plays a Longstreet that honors the legend of that amazing soldier. Sheen gives Lee a soul, something the books fail to do. <br/><br/>I love this movie, it just keeps getting better each time I watch it. Pickett's charge brings tears to my eyes every time. This movie is a must see for any Civil War enthusiast.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 out of 10"

","Gettysburg is none other than an epic movie involving the most significant, bloodiest, and courageous battle ever fought on American soil.  As a US History major (and fanatic) the movie is for the most part extremely historically accurate in terms of events in the battle, the portrayal of the generals, and the attitudes of the common soldiers.<br/><br/>The  musical score by Randy Edelman is in my opinion extremely moving and spine-tingling, and I was sad to see that it didnt even win an oscar nomination (especially when you note that it has been re-used and played in other movies and commercials countless times).<br/><br/>Other people who have seen this movies comment that they liked it, but they felt it was too long.  I agree, the movie was obviously very long, but if you enjoy history you will probably not mind.  In addition, reading Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"", with which this movie was based on, helps to build a better understanding with the common viewer about certain events in the movie and characters.  Most notably, why General Lee had to attack and stay on and fight at Gettysburg, why General Garnett ""had to ride"" at Pickett's Charge etc.<br/><br/>Overall, a very moving film and extremely well-done."

"secordman","Null","3","3","24 February 2001"," Flawed but a very worthwhile picture
","It's difficult to attempt to make a historically accurate movie without turning it into a mini-series soap opera.  I commend the producers of this movie for the work they did in re-creating the Battle of Gettysburg.  When I visited the battlefield after seeing this movie I could really visualize things clearly.  Whenever I read a civil war book and read about Lee and Longstreet, I see Sheen and Berenger now.  I initially guffawed at Sheen doing a southern accent, but overall he did a fine job as General Lee. Berenger was excellent as Longstreet, and certainly his reservations about a direct assault on the 3rd day are part of the record, and emphasized in this film.  The main flaw is the emphasis on certain parts of the battle, especially the amount of time spent on Chamberlain(Jeff Daniels).  It was a pivotal stand that he made on Little Round Top without question, but in this movie there is scant mention of Cemetery and Culp's Hill, the Peach Orchard and Devil's Den, and other moments.  I would have loved to see a 10 hour production spread over 4 nights in a mini-series format, but I understand how these things work, so Gettysburg is as good as it gets for now. Pickett's Charge was very well done, it displayed the 19th century grandeur of war, and also its horror.  And yes, some of the people back then liked to make speeches and speak eloquently, that's why the Civil War has so much color.  The speeches can get a bit schmaltzy and overblown, but ride with it, because the movie as a whole is a good one for those who enjoy this type of thing.  No romantic sub-plots either, glory glory hallelujah!"
"louielol","6","6","8","11 October 2011"," Stirring, and disappointing
","I find ""Gettysburg"" to be a moving film, and very interesting to me because of the subject material. However, every time I see it I am distracted by so many misses. At the top of the list is the facial hair on the many of the actors, which look like the products of a high school make-up artist. Martin Sheen, while a fine actor makes for a very poor General Lee; not only would several other actors look more like Lee, Sheen plays the general as some sort of spacey mystic. General Lee, while always the gentleman, was decisive in speech and action. Several of the roles are over-acted to the point of seeming like caricatures; Lee, Buford, Tom Chamberlain, and Armistead come to mind. The movie could not have been made without the reenactors and for the most part they do an outstanding job. There are times though when it is obvious that they lack the professional training to convincingly ""pull a punch"" while attacking the enemy. My heart would give this film eight or nine stars, but my head pulls it down to a six."

","Gettysburg is directed by Ronald F. Maxwell who also writes the screenplay based on Michael Shaara's novel The Killer Angels. It stars Tom Berenger, Jeff Daniels, Martin Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Stephen Lang, Kevin Conway and Sam Elliott. Randy Edelman scores the music and Kees Van Oostrum is the cinematographer. Film focuses on the events leading up to, and including, one of the most significant battles fought in the American Civil War in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 1-3, 1863.<br/><br/>It's estimated that between 46,000 and 53,000 soldiers were killed during the three day bloody battle of Gettysburg, this film production, originally intended as a mini-series, deals mostly in military operations and the heroism of the major players from both sides of the war. As is usual with a film of this type, there's some middling historical inaccuracies, but with such a gargantuan spread of characters and a four day period of the war to cover, it's perhaps a bit churlish to be picky? In the main the film was met with favourable responses by Civil War historians, reenactors and professional critics. Though the odd prominent critical voice could be heard, such as Gene Siskel who famously called the film Southern propaganda!<br/><br/>Ronald F. Maxwell, backed in the passion department by media mogul Ted Turner, has produced a rich and detailed reenactment of the Gettysburg events. It is in short as close to us film viewers are likely to get to the Battle of Gettysburg. The cast of many work real well to bring this piece of history into our lives, with Berenger and an outstanding Jeff Daniels particularly standing out amongst the acting hordes. With the actual fighting sequences, there's a real sense of the horror of war, this in a war that was initially thought would last only month, but ran for over four years. Bravado is high and we get a detailed look at the perseverance and military machinations of the officers in Blue and Gray. For detail and impact, Gettysburg delivers a movie of some substance. An entertaining picture that educates as much as it enthrals. While filming at the actual locations is obviously a major and poignant bonus.<br/><br/>Yet it's irksome to a degree to find that with a film of such substantial length and detail, that few outside of the officers arc's are afforded time and flesh to further enhance the soldiers of Gettysburg's characterisations. The Southern cause is also glossed over to stay safe with the political correctness of modern times. Lets not hide the defence of slavery, which was the most prominent factor under the Confederate flag, with the film doing so much to educate by way of telling its story, to syphon off a critical aspect is naughty and has to be seen as a cop out by the makers. However, Maxwell doesn't take sides and makes big efforts to paint the men of both sides as stoic nobles, sticking their chests out amongst the bombardment of bullets, cannon balls and bayonets, marching on against overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>A dramatic and involving movie experience, and worthy of a place of any list headed as containing great war movies. But a couple flaws stop it from being the classic war film that the efforts of those involved deserved. 8/10"

I got sick of watching people standing ramrod straight, wistfully gazing into the distance as they deliver a long, melodramatic soliloquy.  Gosh, who knew the army was so full of philosophers?<br/><br/>I'd better read up on the battle from another source.  Otherwise, whenever I think of the Battle of Gettysburg, I'll picture a bunch of guys standing around making speeches which are occasionally interrupted by a bit of a brawl.<br/><br/>The problem with this kind of presentation is that you know that the writers are just making stuff up (i.e. putting protracted proclamations into the mouths of people who never uttered them).  As a result, you just don't know how much else was made up or bent to fit.<br/><br/>Also, the movie doesn't have any sense of proportion.  The coverage of the first day focused on a valiant defense by one group, but there's barely a hint that any other men are doing more than composing their next oratory endeavor.<br/><br/>Definitely a film for Americans to watch if they want to remake their history into something even more epic than it already is.  Definitely not a film for anybody trying to learn some history, as I was."
"classicsoncall","8","2","2","10 December 2019"," ""...we are going to have a fight here sure enough in the morning."" - Major General George Meade to Major General Winfield Scott Hancock
","I've always been astonished to witness Revolutionary War and Civil War re-enactors line up in precision formation opposite each other in order to undertake hostilities. It appears to be a sure way to die for those who actually did so in real battle, and it amazes me that virtually all soldiers on both sides would enter into such conflict so bravely.<br/><br/>Told predominantly from the Confederate side of the conflict, the Battle of Gettysberg is an epic recreation of the events that took place over a four day span beginning with the first of July, 1863. One comes away with a deep appreciation for the honor and integrity the leaders on both sides demonstrate in their resolve to achieve victory. Dialogue among the respective generals reveal the inner turmoil they carry into battle knowing that in many cases, they will be facing off against family or friends left behind to fight for the cause they believed in. Notable in that regard was the reverence and friendship felt by Confederate General Lewis A. Armistead (Richard Jordan) for fellow West Pointer, Union Major General Winfield Scott Hancock (Brian Mallon). Stating it best was Lieutenant General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger) speaking to General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen) in a solemn moment - ""Those fellows, those boys in blue, they never quite seem the enemy"".<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine the death and devastation that occurred on that Gettysburg battlefield over a hundred fifty years ago, and this picture most likely just barely scratches the surface. Though fatalities on both sides are plainly evident, the film makers did not engage in bloody spectacle that would have rendered the film into a horror show. Of the principal players, it's Martin Sheen's General Lee who commands some of the movie's most poignant moments. The dressing down and building up of General J.E.B. Stuart (Joseph Fuqua) at the same time demonstrated the leader's compassion and firmness of purpose. Lee's acceptance of blame for the loss at Gettysburg may not have been embraced readily by his soldiers, but called attention to his humble acceptance of failure, and a striking demonstration of his character.<br/><br/>This is a movie that can be appreciated by both Civil War fans and those not as familiar with the conflict that tore the country apart a century and a half ago. Probably the hardest thing to do is keep track of the myriad generals throughout the story, as the beards and uniforms tend to blur identities from scene to scene, though it's easy enough to identify the principal players. And then there's the battlefield itself, aptly described by Major General John F. Reynolds (John Rothman) to Brigadier General John Buford (Sam Elliott) just before the outbreak of hostilities - ""It's lovely ground."""

","The American Civil War was a conflict that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, and nearly broke a nation. And the famous battle of that historical conflict, was the Battle of Gettysburg. It was a real turning point in the war, the last attempt of a fragmenting South, to make an advance on their northern neighbors. The attempt failed, and the South was on a long loosing streak, until their eventual surrender.<br/><br/>And this 4 and a half hour epic, chronicles the events of that battle with perfect presision and historical accuracy. In fact, it needed to be accurate if the people who wanted it to be made.<br/><br/>As back in 1993, the director Ronald F. Maxwell wanted to film his movie at the location the battle was fought, Gettysburg, PA. However, if he wanted to film it at the location. He would have to be as accurate as possible. If he wasn't, he couldn't make the movie on that historical landmark. So, he decided to stay true to the events.<br/><br/>First off, the film doesn't antagonize the South or the North, treating both sides of the war with respect. We see the battle from the perspective of the generals who lead the battle, and stay accurate to the orders they gave, and the issues they went through.<br/><br/>The film's 4 hour run time, in my opinion, was also needed, if they wanted to adapt everything that happened. And in my opinion, the film is never boring, it never felt like it had filler. We see the mistakes that all the Confederates continually made. And what lead to them loosing.<br/><br/>""Gettysburg"" was a film that required historical accuracy. The people behind it had a passion for this battle, and wanted to portray it on screen. And I think this is a good example of how historical accuracy is possible and required in a movie about history.<br/><br/>The costumes are accurate, the film really focuses on the tactics, staying true to exactly what happened. The acting and visuals are also astounding to watch. The film truly recreates the historical Battle of Gettysburg.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Gettysburg"" a film that respects history, and is almost a love letter to the battle. It doesn't feel long, it rarely makes things up, the acting is great, and the visuals all perfectly adapt the story of the battle. ""Gettysburg"" is simply one of the greatest historical movies ever made, and the best Civil War movie ever made."

"TheNabOwnzz","9","2","2","3 January 2019"," A fantastic tribute to honor and courage in the hearts of men
","As still the longest American film production ever made to this day, Gettysburg had a lot to live up to, one of them being to create a fascinating experience for this entire duration, but it has succeeded valiantly in this.<br/><br/>Gettysburg is not your typical war picture full of vivid characterization, twists, or melodrama ( With the exception of a few scenes ). Instead, it chooses to film the strategies of the three day battle, and the battle sequences themselves, in a way that is most historically accurate. While a high amount of detail and fondness to historical accuracy can damage a film's core, ( Seeing as historical accuracy is always an attribute, and not a virtue, in film ) Gettysburg still manages to capture somewhat of a narrative and a general humanitary theme that makes one care about it. Thus, it succeeds not just as a historical piece, but as a seperate piece of art about bravery, honor & courage in the face of adversity, with a valiant sense of patriotism that is so rare to find.<br/><br/>With on-location shooting in Gettysburg, a certain air of authenticity is also given to this picture, and the stunning use of seemingly endless waves of extra's during battle sequences is nothing short of astonishing. These battle sequences themselves are incredibly edited, with a superb overview of the situation the battle is in at a particular point. While there are some close ups of established characters, it generally uses the great action/consequence technique, with people firing their guns, after which in the next cut an opponent hits the ground. This way there is truly an emotional connection to what is happening on screen, instead of if we only got to watch a fixed camera on an invincible protagonist.<br/><br/>Gettysburg also features phenomenal acting, particularly Martin Sheen's depiction of Robert E. Lee, Sam Elliot & Richard Jordan. However, Performances such as Jeff Daniels as Colonel Chamberlain, and Tom Berenger as General Longstreet are also worthy of notice. In the end, there isn't a weak link in the acting performances in the entire picture. The accents are authentic and spot on, the emotional range ( Especially of Richard Jordan ) is superb, and the mannerisms are also fitting. It is not as if we were watching actors, but the real thing.<br/><br/>Randy Edelman's original score is also nothing short of spectacular, perfectly capturing that feeling of courage that the film means to convey. During Pickett's Charge, this gigantic heroic orchestral piece is constantly covering their walk, and while it has been criticized as 'Glorifying violence' for this, one has to remember that this is a story about the courage of the human heart, and the epic musical score enhances this courage during Pickett's Charge, and not because of the fact that it is glorifying this war.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film does a tremendous job of not depicting either side as villains. There are no villains in this story. There is a large amount of respect from either side to one another, despite their differences in vision. The visual scale of the film is also beyond compare, with four hours and thirty minutes of superb visual filmmaking, and as stated before the fantastic use of loads of extra's without the use of CGI. The days when battle sequences were filmed with this sense of authentic scale now seems long behind us.<br/><br/>Now, what truly gives Gettysburg that humanist edge that makes one care about it, despite its technical brilliance in the battle sequences? There are numerous moments of characters expressing their regrets, or their views on the war, and particularly those of General Amistad ( Richard Jordan ) can be seen as heartbreaking. These characters are given human form due to these small little talks around the campfire. Chamberlain's opening speech is also an example of this. Admittedly, it has some restrictions because of the historical accuracy, but there is still a sense of true humanity in these characters, making one care about them.<br/><br/>Gettsyburg features great acting, a fantastic original score, technically and emotionally brilliant battle sequences, and while lying an emphasis on the tactical nature of the battle instead of extended characterization, there is still a large degree of true emotional power in this picture, as one of the greatest examples of a film that combines historical accuracy and raw cinematic power in a splendid fashion."

However, GETTYSBURG conveys very well the disturbing reality that Civil War soldiers were killing relatives, friends, and neighbors in some of those battles and often in hand-to-hand combat.<br/><br/>Don't look for the pace of action or the graphic depiction of battle casualties to rival those seen in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or BAND OF BROTHERS. What the battle scenes in this movie depict is the deadly toll of large scale frontal assaults by both the Union and Confederate forces. It defies all logic to think that hundreds of men (thousands in Pickett's Charge) would march in formation while lethal cannon shells explode in their midst and enemy marksmen fire deadly volleys of musket rounds into the advancing ranks of foot soldiers and cavalry troops. Yet, with the aid of a small robotic helicopter used to film Pickett's Charge and the massive artillery barrage that preceded it, the scale of the battle and the deadly outcome for the attacking Confederate Army are depicted vividly.<br/><br/>The futile but heroic plight of Pickett's men becomes apparent well before the attack even begins. These were some of our forefathers shedding their blood on that hallowed ground, and the film helps to show how costly that War of the States would be on the country's psyche for more than a century after the war ended."

"gallenm1","9","2","2","22 May 2003"," My Favorite Film
","This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a riveting account of the most famous battle of the Civil War, and actually serves as a fairly accurate historical account of the battle. First, it shifts the blame from General Longstreet, where it has been traditionally directed, to General Lee, whom modern scholars such as Alan T. Nolan blame for the loss. The performances, particularly Martin Sheen, as Robert E. Lee, are tremendous. Sheen should have been nominated for an Oscar for recreating this tragic figure. The battle recreations are very convincing, yet bloodless enough so that a parent could show the film to his or her child without any worry. Everyone should see this movie."

","I thought this was a very good piece of historic storytelling. Being an Australian, I compared it very favorably to the movie and historical incident of GALLIPOLI, which I think this is an approximate American equivalent.<br/><br/>I thought the starring roles were handed very decently, and I was surprised that I could follow most of the tactics and locations fairly easily. I thought the Raiders charge was a particular highlight, and the Little Roundtop attacks were very well staged. My only regret is that President Lincoln's famous Address wasn't handled at the end.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this is a very watchable dramatization of an exciting and important historical event."

I had read Killer Angels many years ago and enjoyed the book throughly. I can say the same of the movie. With the exception of the fake beards most everything was great. I was most impressed with the passion in the battle scenes and in the monologues, particularly one delivered by Robert Jordan as Armistead. I own this movie on VHS and watch it several times a year.

","I would like to start by saying this was a fantastic movie and very moving. I especially liked the focus on Chamberlain and the Maine angle!<br/><br/>However, I think that we should understand that movies take some license in what they focus on.  This movie focuses on Longstreet debating the attack with Lee constantly up until it occurs.  There are many confederate accounts that dispute the Longstreet account as after the fact second guessing, and that he showed no hesitance to follow Lee's orders originally.<br/><br/>This of course should take nothing away from this great film."
"caroline-25","8","2","2","29 August 2001"," Long, but worth the time
","Gettysburg is (obviously) about a battle, and that's what it sticks to: historical figures, strategy, the emotion of war. No doomed romances, or even fancy special effects. The story is told from both sides: we get to know the individuals, and we find ourselves liking and disliking characters from both North and South. These factors give the movie a sense of reality and honesty without all the stuff that often gets thrown in just to manufacture a blockbuster. Jeff Daniels and Thomas Howell gave my favourite performances of the movie, and I really liked the relationship between the brothers. Some parts did drag a bit, making me wonder why the four-hour length was really necessary, especially when sitting through a seemingly unending sequence of marching, marching, marching....Overall, an interesting and entertaining movie I would definitely recommend."

","This is a life-changing movie.  To have portrayed before me so graphically people literally risking their lives for a cause was humbling and daunting. When Col. Chamberlain ordered his Maine regiment, out of ammunition, to fix bayonets, stand up, and charge the Alabama Boys, I was awe-struck.  When Gen. Pickett led his division  across that field right into the Federal guns, when he led them to wholesale slaughter, and then had to report to Gen. Lee that his plan had failed so miserably, I was in tears.  Gen. Lee was upset with Pickett's report, and tried to dismiss him, saying, ""Gen. Pickett, see to your division,"" to which Pickett replied, huskily, ""Gen. Lee, I have no division!""  That line will stay with me all my life.  This movie should be required watching for all Americans!"

To the Englishman who suggested that only Americans would like this movie and expressed his disdain for American nationalism, I suggest you watch the following movies:  Braveheart, The Patriot, and In the Name of the Father. I bet you will really enjoy those movies.  While you're at it, you may want to watch Patton, the movie regarding the American General that rescued Europe from Nazi rule.<br/><br/>As for Gettysburg, this movie really brought the battle alive for me.  I especially enjoyed the performances of Stephen Lang as Pickett, Richard Jordan as Armistead, and Kevin Conway as Kilrain.  Stephen Lang's response to Sheen (General Lee) toward the end of Pickett's unsuccessful charge, was wonderfully delivered, such that it brings tears to my eyes whenever I watch that scene."

","I first went to Gettysburg when I was 6 or 7.  Ever since, I have wandered those fields on a regular basis.  I am an amateur military historian, and I give private tours of the battlefield.  I have spent nights there, cold camping, and avoiding Park Service patrols. I have walked, driven, biked, rode horseback, and flew over in a plane, a chopper, and a hot air balloon. I don't believe there's an inch of ground there I haven't been on.  I've spent hours at the Railroad Cut, the Peach Orchard, the Angle, Culp's Hill, The Cemetery, Spangler's Spring, and Barlow's Knoll, not to mention the east Cavalry Fields.  I guess my point is: often, while standing on Little Round Top, beneath the statue of Gen. Warren, I look out over The Wheatfield and Devil's Den, or over to Cemetery Ridge or Seminary Ridge, I wonder - I try to imagine - what it was like.  The movie Gettysburg, with any of it's inaccuracys, gave me the best vision I've ever had.  I wish there had been four more hours."

","I saw Gettysburg the week of its premier and found it deeply moving with a superior camera eye on action and characters developed with deep reverence for their historic role.  Jeff Daniels and Richard Jordan should have won Oscars for their performances.  Maxwell's direction was excellent and music at all times was stirring without sentimentality. Ted Turner and company were not treated with the same respect as their California contemporaries.  I watch it regularly at home on video, especially on hot nights in July and August.  This, like the thought provoking Pulitzer Prize novel, Killer Angels the film is based on, helps us know why the Union had to fight and how lucky we are of the outcome."
"louiss","7","2","2","14 January 1999"," Good film slightly flawed by Turner TV style production
","When I saw Gettysburg the weekend it opened I think around summer of 1983 I was somewhat disappointed but considering the rarity of historical epics "" my favorite film genre "" and the quality or lack of 80's & 90's films it was a refreshing change of pace and a decent film. Gettysburg was also a subject I had been waiting a lifetime to be put on film having been a Civil War buff. I was disappointed even prior to seeing the film with the knowledge Ted Turner was involved with the production. I expected and was correct in my assumptions that it would be similar to many of the TNT made for TV productions in style and pace, have some political correctness and be mild in the area of blood and graphic violence all of which were detrimental to the film. On the first point I thought the direction was lackluster and the battles did not have the intensity of the much more moving and exciting Glory.  Concerning PC I thought the speech by Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain was moving and one of the best scenes in the film however his sergeants comments about blacks was out of place and a little too much for 1863 !  I don't think its always necessary to have blood & guts all over the screen as in most current films depicting violence but I do believe that if ever graphic violence was necessary to convey a historical event it was needed most notably during Pickett's charge in which bodies were ripped to shreds by the massive fire that was inflicted upon them and was part of the great tragedy and horror of the Civil War.  I would have also liked the film to be in a wide screen format but again I think this has to do with Turner and TV. I liked all of the performances of the small star cast in the film even Martin Sheen as Lee "" I'm not sure why his performance was criticized so much "" my favorites were Jeff Daniels and Tom Berenger  with the only exception being Sam Elliott a perennial TNT movie star who was annoying with his over-acting.  On the plus side was the very fine score and for a 4+ hour film it flew by and had many moving scenes one of them was the rousing cheer of Lee's men as he came to greet them prior to the climactic battle and two great scenes involving Chamberlain "" his speech early on and leading his ammunition depleted men on a desperate bayonet charge"" . I also have to admit I watch this film every time its on Turner and my appreciation grows for it with every viewing and the shortcomings I mentioned bothered me initially but not in my repeated viewing and considering the extreme rarity of Civil War epics I now would highly recommend seeing Gettysburg."
"Quinn-5","10","2","2","29 December 1998"," Response to JOHN'S POST from AUSTIN, TEXAS
","Now I usually despise nitpicking in forums like these, but... John from Austin, Texas' claimed that ""Gettysburg"" is ""revisionist history at its worst""...what movie were you watching, John?? I can't think of a more grossly exaggerated line than that! John must be reminded that ""Gettysburg"" was a Hollywood feature film production, and not a play-by-play documentary narrated by eye-witnesses. Even without stating that fact, ""Gettysburg"" is remarkable for its accuracy, ESPECIALLY as Hollywood films go. John claims Longstreet did in fact favor a different strategy than Lee, but there's no evidence that supports he didn't accepted it. So what does that mean? Whether Longstreet accepted it or not is a moot point. A) Longstreet was a human being like you and me and did not shout out every thought or disagreement he had floating around his head, especially if the disagreement is with a highly respected superior, and B) this is a movie, and movies tend to have personal conflicts for the benefit of a storyline. The fact that Longstreet favored another strategy alone is grounds enough to assume he didn't accept the opposing strategy personally. Chamberlain is slammed by John as a stuttering idiot...what stuttering or stammering was in the film was a clever touch by actor Jeff Daniels to make Col. Chamberlain more real to the audience, and thus more vulnerable. As well, the speech he made, how do we know if he made it or not? Were you there, John? Do you think every spoken line was written down in 1863? Regardless, its a movie, and the speech was a development of character and a vehicle for the modern day audience to further understand the causes of the war and the countless men enlisted in it. I also failed to see when the Federal troops were portrayed in the movie as though they were on a holy crusade...I was a participant in the filming, and can tell you first hand there was no such atmosphere, nor were we given any such direction; I can't even see this coming across once during the film. As a final point (I'm trying to be quick, I can go on), Hancock's line of ""There are times when a corps commander's life does not count"" was something the real Hancock was quoted as saying during the actual battle; it was not made up Hollywood fluff as you'd like to believe.<br/><br/>John's comments are both fiery and exaggerated, and while I respect his opinion on whether he liked or didn't like the film, I believe he basically sat down expecting a 4 hour and 8 minute truth-telling history lesson without extensive knowledge of the battle in the first place (this is not meant to be a personal attack, how many of us really do have such a knowledge?) or a well-enough understanding of Michael Shaara's novel on which the film was based on, almost more so than the battle itself."
"chaos-rampant","Null","3","4","30 November 2013"," Just the gods
","The Civil War is an immensely interesting era. The philosopher, the sociologist, the historian of religion or technology, they can't fail each one to find a rich world to explore. It has everything. A rich political tapestry. War of course. Sagas of both victory and loss. It has on both sides a Cause and closure. Stories of both Northern innovation and Southern ingenuity. Gaffes, some truly huge ones.<br/><br/>Here we get possibly the most senseless aspect of it: the battle itself. The biggest one. The high crest of the Southern tide. The filmmaker has no doubt studied the great battle scenes in film. Eisenstein, Lean, Welles, Bondarchuk. He does mostly well. He covers most of the narrative ground fairly well. He does this all in the naturalistic pace of the western. <br/><br/>Overall it conveys a sense of Gettysburg, and yet it's the sense a highschool history teacher would try to convey to his class. Figures. Speeches. Heroism and futility. I don't know if it's constructive history or not. But here they had an opportunity to do something better. They secured close to five hours of screen time to cover just a few days, an opportunity to go from the epic trajectory, the closed saga, to the openended moment-at-hand.<br/><br/>And isn't this, as much as anything else, what captivates about the Civil War? At so many junctures things could have gone wildly different. Staying on Gettysburg, what if Ewell had taken the high ground on that first day? There is a rich story, the one jotted in so much Civil War literature, and yet at every point indeterminate horizons suggest parallel universes to ponder. But how to exemplify this as cinematic horizon?<br/><br/>A striking moment early in the film is where Lee with his aides is startled to hear artillery in the distance, what Lee doesn't know yet is that Southern troops a few miles ahead have run into Union cavalry and the battle has started. Lee turns and asks whose artillery is that.<br/><br/>So here's a war where the commanding general has no way of knowing, and has to wait for someone to ride all the way there to find out, and ride all the way back to report. Can you imagine the eternity of waiting? Of just hearing sounds of war but not knowing just what it means? <br/><br/>But this would require a wholly different film, one that goes where the historian can't with his pen and captures confused humans for whom there is no 'Battle of Gettysburg' yet and all that noise beyond the trees is not yet decisive fate.<br/><br/>I dream about a Gettysburg film that conveys the density of destiny not with speechifying but with spatial density. That isn't full of rousing music over senseless war. That explores the rich possibilities of sound and space, concealment and presence, one that is as gruelling to watch as it must have been for a young Union boy staring at the woods for hours waiting for rebels to materialize. This is too palatable. Too educative."

"glennsouthall","8","3","4","29 March 2006"," questions answered?
","OK, I'm British, let's get that out of the way. The American Civil War has fascinated me for many years for many different reasons - almost everything about it was/is unique or unparallelled in the history of warfare and it's sheer significance on a bewildering number of levels is staggering - but the one most important question that I am still trying to come to terms with is this; what was it that drove men, from both sides, to advance toward near-certain death - time after time - against fellow countrymen on such a vast scale? I have watched this movie only recently (amazingly enough) and I want to pick up on an element that most IMDb reviewers have dismissed or generally commented as being a negative aspect. There are many scenes of protracted dialogue between the fight-scenes that attempt to put the war, the motives, the higher principles, the morality etc from all sides into perspective and I was very thankful for that. I can understand that for some it may have detracted from their overall enjoyment of the movie by giving it uneven pacing and contributing significantly to the running time of over 4 hours, but not for me. Just like for the many thousands of men who fought in this war, the interludes between fighting must have been a time of reflection and reaffirmation of their cause and their own personal motives in the light of the horrors that they had just endured. I saw this as an element of the movie every bit as realistic as the battles themselves and so it enhanced my enjoyment overall.<br/><br/>Overall, as a movie?. I am no expert in ""movie engineering"" such as the cinematography, editing and so on, I can only comment on the end product whose only objective (surely) is to entertain. I can say that I was entertained to such an extent that I was drawn right in. I was there. Sheen, Beringer, Daniels etc. were not actors, but the actual people they were portraying and I was right there with them, a little like the British observer from the Coldstream Guards. Which brings me to the only reason why I could not give the movie 10 out of 10. Whose idea of a typical British officer was that? It was embarrassing (drinking tea from a china cup in the middle of the Confererate lines - perleeeaase!) to such an extent that I squirmed every time he had a line to say (I was reminded of good old Dick Van Dyke as a British chimney sweep - a travesty of a caricature). And I did notice that he was the only one to flinch when artillery exploded nearby, whilst all else appeared not to notice and remained erect, statuesque and gazing into the opposite horizon. I can only guess at the reason for this and it is unworthy of the nobility of the events being portrayed.<br/><br/>Did the movie answer my question? I would say yes, in part. But I came to the conclusion that no matter how much I learn about this incredible event in world history, a full understanding will always remain tantalisingly out of my grasp. Because, simply, I am not a product of its happening."

","Gettysburg.  Just the name sends chills down the spine of any 19th Century American History lover, which I happen to be.  I was exceedingly pleased that this film delved into the relationships between the officers who attended West Point together, fought in the Mexican-American War together, courted the same women, then met each other on opposite sides of battlefields during the American Civil War.  There are technical flaws in the movie, surely.  The most notable is the sight of a white van tooling along a road in the background of Pickett's Charge.  Look closely and look fast!!  But don't look for the technical flaws; look at the overall picture. Don't look for the language flaws; look for the story behind the words. A wonderful film, exceptionally superior work by Tom Berenger, Martin Sheen, Jeff Daniels and Sam Elliott.  The makeup is superb.  Please.  Don't sit down to watch it to rip it apart.

","One battle, one movie, one nation.  This is the promise of The Killer Angels, and Gettysburg delivers.  Sure, it's long.  Sure, there are historical inaccuracies (20th Maine).  But people criticizing the dialogue? You have got to be kidding.  Not only did people at least write that way, they certainly spoke that way.  Here in Mississippi, there are plenty of fine old Southern gentlemen of the WWII generation who talk in speeches (of course, most of the ones I know are from Oxford, which is a trifle more literary than the average Southern small town).  Some of the speeches are obvious soliloquies, turned into dramatic monologues to inform the audience of what is on the soldier's mind.  In particular, Buford's speech was completely ahistorical.  But Sam Elliot handled it wonderfully.<br/><br/>As for the rambling Virginian who says ""People in my state do not talk that way,"" I say, of course not.  But do you want modern dialogue in a period film?  Pshaw.  Martin Sheen was not the best choice to play Lee, but he played him marvelously (although yes, his accent was stagey and overwrought).  Tom Berenger as Longstreet is a revelation, as was Jeff Daniels.  Richard Jordan was magnificent in this, his final role, looking less like James Mason than ever.  My favorite part, besides Buford's heroism, is Kilrain's rant on gentlemen.  Every time I reach that part of the movie, I cheer."

","One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  The battle scenes are breathtaking, you can't help but get caught up in it.  You feel like you have gone back in time.  Everybody involved in this were excellent from the lead actors to the reinactors.  But the one that was the most outstanding was Richard Jordan.  He gave one of the best performances of his career, it just so sad that it turned out to be his last one.  But what better movie to go out on but this one.  He put his whole heart and soul into this role. The most moving scenes were in the tent where Armistead is remembering his last moments with Hancock before they parted for the war, at the angle where he is mortally wounded, that scene is the most heartrending one of them all, and his scenes during Pickett's Charge.  I don't think too many people realize this but he already had the brain tumor when he did this movie, so knowing this and seeing the wonderful job he did in this, you can't help but admire him for putting up with that pain and doing the best job possible at the same time.  I firmly believe he should have received something for this, he deserved a posthumous oscar for this role.  The other stand outs were Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain and Sam Elliott as Buford.  Also, the music was outstanding, Randy Edelman should also have received something for his great work.  I also think that the movie should have received some kind of an award because it was movie-making at its best.  The scenes, the acting and the music were all top notch."
"fritzgray","3","6","13","19 January 2003"," An Epic Disappointment
","Director Ronald Maxwell had a great opportunity to make a first rate film of the epochal battle of Gettysburg. First and foremost he had wonderful actors under his direction, particularly Richard Jordan and Jeff Daniels; superb source material in Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels""; superb camera work and a very high budget. Unfortunately the whole film disappointed me.<br/><br/>The screenplay is overladen with speech after speech after speech by each of the generals involved with the battle on either side. There is ironically very little tension and drama in the film. The music is overdone with a vengance, and it seems to sound the same. It is underlying just about every scene. It does get tedious after over four hours. In every scene we get the impression that the director is telling us 'this is great, this is memorable, what a sad thing to have happened, get on your knees and genuflect and reflect on the great tragedy.' I don't really mean to be sarcastic. The battle of Gettysburg was a great, tragic day for America. Its importance can't be overestimated. But director Maxwell keeps hitting us with this point over and over again that the message he was trying to convey gets lost in the morass. I visited the battlefields of Gettysburg myself, and it had an overwhelming impact on me. It was haunted with a sadness and loss that was both inexplicable yet very evident. There is almost none of that same feeling inherent in this film. It is watchable for the beautiful cinematography and the beautiful location scenery. Again, I want to single out the late Richard Jordan. He was remarkable. I suppose my ultimate judgement on ""Gettysburg"" is that it is a competent primer on the battle of Gettysburg, yet a disappointing, stilted drama."

","Jeff Daniels rejoin-us speech to the Northern deserters in the early part of this film is, to me, one of the very best pieces of film in the history of all cinema. Both content and his delivery soar over the efforts of others of this genre and should reside in the depths of the hearts of all movie lovers and Civil War buffs. I personally would give a great deal to thank Mr Daniels personally for this gift. He is, sadly, under-appreciated for his art both here and in other films. Given time and similar chances at such noble roles Mr Daniels will achieve the stellar appreciation he deserves. It can truly be said that preparation and opportunity met at exactly the right time and place here. It seems there are few actors who are capable to stand and deliver. Even fewer who hold the key to the lock to stardom who are adept at matching actor and role or even actor and true talent. With Mr Daniels we need not worry. Even in Dumb and Dumber his talent was clear. May it always be so."

It plays better as a mini-series I think, and a damned goof one too.<br/><br/>Dialogue-Stilted historical speechifying galore. Some of it-Lee before his officers, for example, makes sense. But alotta it is stilted and way too formal. If Gen Armistead needs to go answer the Call of nature, I think here it'd have been accompanied with strings and 9 paragraphs of the historical significance of it all. That coulda been done away with.<br/><br/>Pacing-Slow. More action was needed, believe it or not. The scenes around the fire were somewhat sluggish.<br/><br/>Gore factor-mostly an old fashioned 'show the body fall' but none of the Platoon, Private Ryan guts stuff. Maybe more of that was necessary?<br/><br/>But that's about it.

Anyway, GETTYSBURG is freegin great. And I don't wanna hear about Tom Berenger's beard or any retarded inaccuracies. We get to see some fine acting, archaic/glorious dialogue, and the best CW battle scenes (apart from the 1989 masterpiece GLORY) ever on film. Of course, during the Little Round Top sequence, there are some shots that are recycled two or three times. However, the sequence of the LRT is impressively edited otherwise. The panoramic views of Pickett's Charge, the sweeping aerial views of the battlefield... and so on.<br/><br/>And there's plenty of melodrama. Overacting? No. OK, maybe. But it works for this film. Here's a few sample lines: <br/><br/>""I'm Kilrain, and I damn all gentlemen."" (Buster)<br/><br/>""General Lee... I HAVE no division."" (Pickett)<br/><br/>""With me... who will come with MEEEEEE!!"" (Armisted)<br/><br/>""Give em hell, 54th!"" Ooops.. wrong movie.<br/><br/>Even in the midst of a serious, stoic event in or history, we are treated to some bits of humor. I particularly like the scene where Gen. Longstreet (T Berenger) and the artillery captain or discussing strategy. Some guy off in the distance gets blown head over heels and flies over his cannon. I always found it funny...<br/><br/>Now look... the movie was MEANT to be 4 hours long! You couldn't tell the battle of G-Burg in a standard 2 hour flick. No way. GETTYSBURG was made to cater to Civil War fans only, as well as history buffs - not a wide movie-going audience. It was made as about as flawless as a movie could be made. The right amount (in the form of a 4 hour running time) of solid, cerebral conversations, the right emotions for the right scenes, and of course, the heroic soundtrack!!!<br/><br/>Now about the dialogue, I've heard a lot of complaints about how it is spotty, lame, and robotic. Well, what'ya expect, realistic, modern CLERKS or PULP FICTION banter? <br/><br/>""General Pickett, are you OK?"" ""General Lee, I have no division, I'm pretty far from OK.""<br/><br/>The cast pulls the job off wonderfully. Berenger, Sheen, Richard Jordan, James Lang, Stephen Lang... everyone.<br/><br/>GETTYSBURG rocks. It's historically accurate as any ""period piece"" out there. Even the acclaimed SAVING PRIVATE RYAN had some continuity errors and anachronisms. I give it an A++ for sheer awesomeness. And why the hell wasn't it nominated for a SINGLE Academy Award? At least a lead or supporting actor for (insert kick-ass actor here), Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY!!! <br/><br/>An awesome movie. One of my faves. Just remember, GETTYSBURG, with the exception of GODS AND GENERALS, will probably be the last Civil War movie made. The WW2 and Vietnam War genre has been depleted... and there's only so many ways you can depict a CW battle differently on film. There is however, a movie coming out in the next couple of years with Liam Nesson as Abe Lincoln.. But just realize that GETTYSBURG is about as good as we can get for the War Between the States."

","""Gettysburg"" was an amazing depiction of the battle that was the turning point in the Civil War. From Martin Sheen as GEN. Robert E. Lee, Tom Berenger as GEN Longstreet, and Jeff Daniels as COL Chamberlain to the extras who played the citizens of Gettysburg the cast was terrific in their roles. <br/><br/>The ability to use the Town of Gettysburg and the actual battlefield only contributed to the films authenticity. The research the Art Director, Costume and Set Designers and crew did to insure the authenticity of costumes, props, and locations enhanced this epic tremendously.<br/><br/>This, in my opinion, is one of the finest movie depicting War ever made.

"zardoz-13","7","2","3","12 March 2015"," Admirable But Flawed Epic Worth Watching
","""Little Darlings"" director Ronald F. Maxwell's admirable but flawed epic ""Gettysburg"" qualifies as one of the better movies about the American Civil War. Unquestionably, it ranks as the best reenactment of this turning point battle because nobody has tried to mount a similar movie. Nevertheless, ""Gettysburg"" suffers from several flaws. Initially, the film was designed to be shown on television as a mini-series, so at a four and a half hours in length, it rivals anything that either David Lean or Sergio Leone could have attempted. Second, its loquacity occasionally overwhelms its sense of spectacle, but loquacity constitutes the hallmark of any mini-series. Everybody delivers a speech. Everybody who speaks is typically a general or an officer. Most of the dialogue is straightforward without a shred of irony. Rarely is anything uttered that is quotable. The enlisted men in blue and gray aren't so much heard as seen. On the other hand, Maxwell scores surplus points for apparent authenticity, with dedicated reenactors on up to conscientious American history scholars providing incomparable verisimilitude. Undoubtedly, Maxwell had more than enough to contend with during this sprawling $20-million production. My major argument is tone. ""Gettysburg"" boasts no surprises and Maxwell generates little momentum. During the actual event, the Confederates arrived at Gettysburg feeling invincible owing to earlier triumphs. Maxwell's Confederates are losers from the start and the music blends nostalgia with tragedy. Indeed, Maxwell treats ""Gettysburg"" as a national tragedy. Kees Van Oostrum photography is competent, but neither Maxwell nor Oostrum were as adept as they were later when they made the infinitely superior ""Gods and Generals."" Nevertheless, what salvages Maxwell's film is the magnificently staged Pickett's Charge, particularly the cannon barrages over a smoky battlefield. Tom Berenger, Stephen Lange, Richard Jordan, Jeff Daniels, Sam Elliot, and Kevin Conway stand out as the leaders."
"geoffawhite1978","7","2","3","12 March 2012"," A good, but somewhat flawed Civil War epic
","Most of the good and bad of this film comes directly from the source material. When you boil down the script, based on ""The Killer Angels"", Michael Shaara's excellent novel, you are left with two main plots: Longstreet's reluctant leadership of Pickett's Charge, and Chamberlain's desperate defense of Little Round Top. Throw in some eloquent prognostication from General Buford, voiced here by the grave and gravelly Sam Elliot, and you've got a focused narrative that unwinds over the course of four and a half hours.<br/><br/>What neither the book, nor the film deal with, is everything else. Sure, we are left with General Trimble's dire predictions concerning Culp's Hill, but the audience doesn't see one frame of that particularly bloody spot of the battlefield. Similarly, the Wheat Field and Peach Orchard, where an entire Corps was misled to a gruesome fate, serves only as a fleeting prelude to a single Regiment's bayonet charge.<br/><br/>These are not bad editorial decisions: any lucid historical narrative has to dispense with some important details to get at the heart of the overarching plot. The proof is in the pudding: ""Gettysburg"" is a better-constructed story than the meandering, pointless ""Gods and Generals."" So much for plot. Viewers must accept that this film only scratches the surface of the pivotal battle. Repeated viewings may help crystallize the characters, but the battle is still largely nebulous, with lots of ""Go over there"" or ""They're over that way"". One needs a map to truly understand the battle, and this film puts us very much in the shoes of the common soldier, who had no idea what was beyond each ridge.<br/><br/>So, is it a good MOVIE? For starters, it's definitely a good story. Joshua Chamberlain exercised enormous poise and control in the midst of a hellacious set of circumstances. Here we truly see a commander snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Longstreet's contrasting inability to do so makes him a pitiable character. Buford's appearance is significant in that it helps establish how and why the two armies settled into their positions.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Jeff Daniels is marvelous as Chamberlain. Tom Berenger is equally good as Longstreet, though his performance is necessarily more nuanced, his already stoic facial expressions hidden by all that facial hair. One of the biggest weaknesses of this movie is the inexplicable casting of Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee. Sheen, the erstwhile amazing president, gives the monumental general a mousy and diminutive quality. Robert Duvall did much better in the otherwise horrendous prequel. Perhaps no one can portray Lee, much as no woman ever made could hope to portray the quintessential Elizabeth Bennett. But Sheen doesn't even come close.<br/><br/>Gettysburg is equally favorable towards both North and South. Both have good and bad leadership, and the film manages to be sympathetic towards many of the opposing participants without descending into hyperbolic exultation.<br/><br/>This is not a film about slavery. The issue is certainly discussed by both sides, but it was of no immediate importance to the action unfolding at Gettysburg. Any criticism leveled at the film on that score misses the point. Those who are genuinely offended should watch ""Glory"" and note how many times the word ""slavery"" is mentioned there. There are heroes and villains on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. To charge a movie as being racist simply because it deals even-handedly with both sides is idiotic. Simply put, America deserves to see both sides, because America WAS both sides. America was both the conqueror and conquered, and the history must reflect that dichotomy.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what recommends this movie is more than what detracts from it. The representations, ranging from uniforms and equipment to the actual engagements, are dead-on accurate. But a better portrayal of Robert E. Lee would have helped show what kind of personality Longstreet was up against, and how his objections never had a chance, even after he was proved right. The film's understated use of metaphors is easy to miss. The fictional Kilrain has much to say regarding his place in America, and viewers should pay attention to where he fits in by the film's end. Also of note is the interplay between the two Chamberlain brothers, and what they're doing in the final scene of the movie.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, sure, but not a great one. We'll just have to keep waiting for that definitive Civil War movie to come along."

The actors were wonderful in the roles, in particular Stephen Lange as Pickett. I recommend this to the history lovers and those looking for powerful performances.<br/><br/>You see into the personal thoughts of each main character and the struggle that they overcome at the battle. Ordinary men rise above to accomplish great triumphs.<br/><br/>You can not choose a side as both views are shown and both the North and South are shown to be doing what is believed to be just cause.<br/><br/>This movie brings you right into the battle with the support of thousands of civil war reenactors."
"chizchaz47","9","2","3","18 November 2007"," Mighty fine recreation of an American tragedy
","As a Brit with a keen interest in American history I looked forward to seeing this epic. Despite a couple of niggles, already mentioned in previous reviews, I thought it was very fine depiction of an American tragedy that was one of the great turning points in history. Not just of American history but for all of us in the free world, if the Union had not held. Sad as that is for the brave and honourable people of the South, think how different the next centuries could have been with a divided America. For me the definitive reading is Shelby Foote's hefty 3 volume account ""The Civil War : A Narrative"". If you want to nitpick over some of the detail in the film, this is the book. Even in four hours or so the complexities of the events during those few days in Pennsylvania could not possibly have been fully covered. So some license should be given to the makers of this excellent film for taking a liberty or two. E.g., I find it hard to believe that Col. Fremantle, observer for the British Coldstream Guards, would allow himself to be seen mincing around holding a cup of tea, making a complete arse of himself, in front of senior Confederate Officers. And certainly not in uniform, (which he wasn't), but that's showbiz."

","I live in Australia, and have just seen the DVD. I am very interested in the civil war and have read many books on the subject and I found that Gettysburg the DVD was from what I've read to be very accurate as well as being totally absorbing to watch. I particularly enjoyed Martin Sheen's roll which to me was exactly as I've read about him. Thank you and hope to hear from anyone who would like to reply. P.s. The story of the 20th Maine was more involved than I had originally thought so it came as a surprise to me. The story and acting to me was very exceptional and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also thought that the meeting between Lee and Stuart was not as powerful as it could have been because from what I've read that Stuart was really censored by Lee for being missing for those days preceding the battle but this meeting was only a mild case and then what happened to Stuart for the rest of the battle, was he still there or did he go off scouting as the movie did not say. the music score was one of the best i have ever heard and I have ordered a copy. The acting by everyone and particularly the spokesmen for the deserters and the col. The photography was as good as i've seen anywhere and the smoke filled battleground looked very authentic."

","Gettysburg is without doubt the best war movie of all time, and I have thought so since its release in Australia in 1993. I now have it on DVD (after securing a VHS version earlier) and watch it, or at least parts of it regularly. Those very familiar with the movie would be aware that it is possible to select a scene, watch an hour of it, and still get as much from it as watching the full four hours and eight minutes.<br/><br/>The only down side for me is that, as a fan of the West Wing, it is hard to hear Martin Sheen without a southern accent. He portrayed a far better Robert E Lee than Robert Duvall in Gods and Generals, which I think was far too deep for its own good and missed some opportunities."
"rastack-1","9","2","3","23 September 2006"," The significance of Gettysburg can't be overstated
","The Killer Angels was a required book for Command and Staff College. It's relatively thin, so making it into a 4-hour movie was quite a feat in itself. My judgment was that is stays faithful to the book in all important ways. A few days ago, I pulled It off the shelf because my daughter's 5th grade class has a field trip to Gettysburg this year. It still brings up very strong emotions at critical points and this is what I hope our kids get out of this block of study (here come the spoilers): (1.) Col Chamberlain to the remnants of the 2nd Maine being forced to join his 20th Maine Regiment: ""Gentlemen, I think if we lose this fight, we lose the war."" Although the timing was off on this integration, it was important to set the importance of the battle. (2.) Chamberlain on Little Round Top with the 4th wave of attacks from the 15th Alabams - his decision that he was too week to defend, so he ordered fix bayonets and charged, saving the day and the battle since his regiment held the extreme flank. Chamberlain received the Medal of Honor for his actions on Little Round Top. (3.) The conversation before Pickett's Charge between Lt Col Fremantle (British LNO) and CSA Brig Gen Lewis Armistead, one of Pickett's Brigade Commanders. Specifically, the explanation Armistead gives about the American History of some his Virginians when Fremantel comments on the irony since Armistead's uncle defended Ft McHenry from the British: (Artillery Commander) 1st in his Class at West Point, before Virginia succeeded, (Color Guard Private) Grandson of a President of the United States, (Regimental Colonel) Great-Grandson of Patrick Henry, who said ""Give me liberty, or give me death"" (4.)(Major Gen Pickett to Lee) ""General Lee, I have no division"". (5)Finally, the exceptionally close bond, forged at West Point, between Armistead and USA Maj Gen Hancock and the anguish when Armistead learned both had gone down, ""No, not both of us, not all of us, please God!"" Indeed at Gettysburg today, the spot Armistead fell has a marker and is the high-water mark (furtherest point of advance) for the Confederacy. End of Spoilers. Our kids need to learn that as the Revolutionary War determined we would BE a country, the Civil War shaped what kind of country we would become. After Gettysburg, the war continued almost two years more. To say Gettysburg decided it all ignores the campaigns out West, but with Lincoln under increasing political pressure, it COULD have saved the nation from a negotiated peace with the South."
"zorn24601","10","2","3","20 June 2002"," Magnificent Civil War epic
","Based on Michael Shaara's great novel ""The Killer Angels"", this is one of the most impressive movies about the American Civil War that I've ever seen. It is a shame that the theaters are unable to screen a movie of this length, otherwise this would have been up for numerous Oscars.<br/><br/>
In one memorable scene after another, we are told the tale of the pivotal battle of the Civil War, where the Confederacy made huge tactical mistakes that turned the tide of the war against them. Particularly memorable is the scene where Colonel Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) addresses a group of deserters, and through the conviction and passion of his argument, convinces them to re-enlist for the coming battle. Martin Sheen gives the performance of his career (so far) as General Robert E. Lee, portraying him as a gentleman, a warrior, and a patriot to his cause.<br/><br/>The reason this film is so powerful is that it doesn't take sides, as some Civil War movies tend to do. The Rebels aren't shown as a bunch of uneducated, slave-driving rednecks, but as people fighting for their personal liberty. That they kept slaves but fought for liberty is an irony not lost on the Rebels; one Confederate officer comments ""We should have freed the slaves first, then fired on Fort Sumter."" The Confederates weren't fighting for the right to keep slaves, they were fighting to remain free from a federal government that they felt was growing too powerful, and that message is made clear in this film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended; I give it 9/10."

","If only more Hollywood brass took this kind of filmmaking to heart. Director Ronald F. Maxwell is the anti-Oliver Stone. He takes a well -known historical event such as the frightening battle at Gettysburg, and tells it like the books and participants say it went. No personal views, beliefs, or wild left wing theories. Just plain ol' American history. And it works. It works great. Based on the late Michael Shaara's most acclaimed novel ""The Killer Angels"" (Shaara, unfortunately, died four years before production even began), Mr. Maxwell has a first rate cast of big stars, yet not big enough to distract you as to who is playing who, who take the material given and run with it. Besides a fake beard on Tom Berenger's General Longstreet which is more than a bit silly, these actors are completely believable. Jeff Daniels certainly deserved Oscar notice for his part, and even Martin Sheen has his fair share of top-notch scenes, as does Sam Elliott, among others. Special note should be made of the irony in that Richard Jordan's final scene on film (Jordan died some weeks before the film's release) is a death one, and one of the more poignant moments of the movie. Randy Edelman provides a stellar score along with the rich color and cinematography, so much so that his soundtrack bosses recently released a five year commemorative expanded edition of his music. One can't help but be somewhat dis-heartened that Maxwell has yet to be seen again after ""Gettysburg"". The box office numbers were quite high considering the limited showing times at theaters because of this movie's length (at four minutes longer than ""Gone With The Wind"", screenings were limited to twice a day). Rumors are he's at work on a ""Joan Of Arc"" project , after which he will get to work on a prequel for this movie... followed by a sequel! I suppose only time will tell... until then, I'll be happy with this effort."
"filipemanuelneto","8","1","1","14 June 2020"," A truly long film about a battle that lasted three days.
","There are epic films and there are huge films. This manages to be both. It is an epic war film, and an immensely long film, four and a half hours long.<br/><br/>There is no point in telling the script. Anyone who knows a minimum of US history, even without being an American, knows the Battle of Gettysburg (1863) and all its relevance to the course of the Civil War. It was the decisive battle, which not only stopped the succession of military victories that the Confederates had been collecting but also destroyed the main body of their army, leaving the South, virtually, at the mercy of the Yankees. The film does a good job of focusing not only on the battle itself, but on the people who took part in it, on the small personal dramas, on the way the war separated people who even had close relationships before. The film manages to show us that human side of the conflict and to give it a face. Less well accomplished, at times, were the dialogues. If most of the time they work reasonably well, they sometimes sound theatrical, clearly false and unlikely in that time and context. But okay, I handled it well. More difficult to deal with was the slight feeling that this film, far from being neutral, has a clear sympathy for the Confederate cause, expressed in the enormous visibility given to the Confederates.<br/><br/>The cast is very vast, full of big names that give their best here but it is not possible to pay attention to all and not everyone had the same opportunity to shine. Personally, I would highlight the good performances of Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen, in the role of Confederate generals Longstreet and Lee, the faces of the Confederate military command, as well as Sam Elliott and Richard Anderson, in the role of Brigadier John Buford and General Meade, the leaders of the Unionist army in this battle. The four actors do an excellent job in their roles. The same can be said of Jeff Daniels and George Lazenby, in the role of two Confederate officers, as well as a number of other actors such as Stephen Lang, Richard Jordan, Cooper Huckabee, Patrick Gorman and Andrew Prine.<br/><br/>At a technical level, the film is a colossal show with a lot of money involved. It was done the old fashioned way, with hundreds of extras dressed to the letter and special effects to recreate the battles. Cinematography is quite good and manages to capture the action and the fights well, at the same time that it is well suited to the most still scenes. In terms of historical rigour, the film seems to me to comply with the minimum requirements. What I was most surprised about were the unnatural-looking beards and moustaches, the impeccable uniforms, without dirt or a single patch, the clean equipments and props. It looks like they started the war yesterday. And yes, there is no doubt about it: although the film is very well made and has immense value, there are at least 45 minutes that are expendable and that could have been edited to make the film shorter and palatable. Four and a half hours is too long for a feature film. But given that the battle lasted three days, I even think they summed it up pretty well."

Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen deserve recognition for their roles as General Longstreet and General Lee and on the Union side, Jeff Daniels was absolutely superb as Joshua L.

"timdalton007","9","1","1","23 July 2019"," An Epic In Every Sense Of The Word
","The American Civil War seems to speak to the epic nature of filmmaking. Indeed, it has inspired some of its most important and controversial cinematic works including Birth of a Nation and Gone With The Wind. The 1990s saw something of a resurgence in Civil War filmmaking with films such as Glory and the release in 1993 of Ronald Maxwell's film Gettysburg. Originally filmed for television as a miniseries, it nevertheless received a theatrical release as one of the longest films ever released in American cinemas. More than 25 years on, it also remains an epic.<br/><br/>I mean that sincerely: Gettysburg is a genuine epic. Take the sheer size of the cast, for instance. It features dozens of speaking roles including a dignified Martin Sheen as Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Jeff Daniels as professor turned Union officer Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Tom Berenger as Confederate GeneralJames Longstreet, Sam Elliot as Union cavalry officer John Buford, and even a bearded George Lazenby as a Confederate general. And those are just a few of the highlights from the cast which also includes appearances by any number of familiar faces. Keeping track of everyone can be easier said than done at times, especially when the battles come down, and that's something that rewards those willing to sit through the film on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>Beyond the cast, Gettysburg lives up to the word epic in both scope and length. It benefits, for example, from its filming taking place in and around the actual battlefield with what certainly seems to be thousands of reenactors taking part which gives it a further air of authenticity. Their presence can be felt in sequences such as Pickett's Charge which gives the impression of what it might just have looked like on that hot July day. To tell the story of this climactic clash of the Civil War, the film dedicates roughly an hour to each day that it features, portraying events from both sides and the decisions that led to them. Then there's the added addition od Randy Edelman's score built around a rousing main title theme that's put to great effect at the narrative highpoints. The resulting work is a film that feels grand in both artistic intention and presentation.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film, though? Probably not. The script from director Maxwell gets oddly preachy at times, a little too caught up in speeches delivered by its characters on both sides of the conflict. Whether that's down to the source material, Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Killer Angels, I can't be certain of those others have spoken to the film's faithfulness to it elsewhere. Those talks are all something that definitely adds to the running time, once causing Martin Sheen to quip in an interview that the film lasted longer than the actual battle. That being said, it's something that doesn't hurt the film too much either as their wonderfully by the likes of Daniels, Sheen, and Richard Jordan in his last ever film role.<br/><br/>Perhaps as a result of all that, from the cast and production to the sheer scope of the narrative the film recounts, Gettysburg may remain the last great film made about this defining American conflict. Unquestionably, Maxwell's follow-up prequel film Gods & Generals didn't recapture the lightning in bottle greatness of this film despite its own lengthy running time. But, even now, watching those opening credits or the 20th Maine swinging their way down Little Round Top or Lee being cheered on by his men still sends a shiver up my spine. That speaks to the power of filmmaking and to the lasting legacy of Gettysburg as a film."
"bkoganbing","10","1","1","17 April 2019"," The turning point of the Civil War
","Anything you ever wanted to know about the battle of Gettysburg will be here in
this 4 1/2 hour film. The turning point of the Civil War, Gettysburg stopped a
series of victories won by Robert E. Lee. Had Lee won at Gettysburg he had nothing to stop him had he chosen to march north, east or west. It probably
would have meant a negotiated peace and two nations.<br/><br/>It should be emphasized that Gettysburg is not a film concerning a defense of
slavery. It is about a lot of brave men who met outside a Pennsylvania town on
both sides. Some of the scenes between battle scenes show the commanders
on both sides talking about their relationships with folks on the other side
before the war. That the struggle tore people apart is well documented here.
People fought people who were friends before 1861 and geography tore them
apart.<br/><br/>No computer graphics here. A cast of thousands, movie making on the scale
that Cecil B. DeMille used to practice. The repelling of the Confederate advance off Little Round Top and Pickett's charge are particularly well staged.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is the anguish of Robert E. Lee played by Martin Sheen when
JEB Stuart finally reports. Stuart's cavalry which was indispensable to Lee
went off God knows where and Lee lacked vital intelligence. Sheen really dresses Joseph Fuqua as Stuart down, but then says you're still one of the best
I have.<br/><br/>The battle was not planned at all. Advance troops of Lee's moved into Union

commandeer footwear for his troops, some of them marching barefoot. Advance Union troops engaged and more troops poured in from both sides.
The battle just grew from a skirmish to an epic.<br/><br/>The Confederates get more time than the Yanks. But on the Yankee side
attention should be paid to Richard Anderson as Union commander George
Meade and Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain and Brian Mallon as Winfield
Scott Hancock. Tom Berenger has a big role he makes the most of as General
James Longstreet, probably Lee's most valuable corps commander.<br/><br/>Like Birth Of A Nation, Gettysburg is some living history and makes great use

","I,myself,am not a historical movie lover and I require a lot of action on screen to hold my attention. This movie had a decent amount of action/fighting scenes (but what do you expect with a pg rated movie?). Although I was a bit bored without the extra action, the movie hit many major points about the decision making that happened during the war. Honestly I learned many facts that I would never have known about the Battle of Gettysburg without watching it. The movie was quite accurate with dates,backgrounds,props,etc besides a few mishaps such as a few views of paved roads at different scenes and the view of an air conditioning unit at a farmhouse. The actors were amazing and showed a lot of emotion especially the actor who played as Col.Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. I wish that the actors voices were a bit louder because at many points during the movie it was very hard to hear them even with the volume on 60 and I am sure I missed many important lines because of this. Overall this movie satisfied it's purpose perfectly and the director couldn't have chosen better actors."

","At four and half hours long, this is like sitting through three 90 minute movies or two 2+ hour movies. It was a marathon but it was soooooooo worth it. Simply amazing. Not perfect, unfortunately, but worth just about every one of those 250 minutes! The Battle Of Gettysburg in the American Civil War was a monster fight over the course of three days leaving in its wake approximately 50,000 casualties. Not all of the battle is portrayed here as the movie would need to be 10 hours long! The main focus is on Joshua Chamberlain's hold of Little Round Top on Day 2 and Pickett's Charge on Day 3. Amongst many notable performances, there were tremendous performances by Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain as well as Sam Elliot as Union General John Buford. Unfortunate casting of Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee and C. Thomas Howell as Chamberlain's brother don't ruin things too much. Lee should have been more of a commanding actor, taller, more in your face so his underlings had no chance to argue against him. But he was on the bad guy's side so I did not feel too badly about that casting choice. The North's fight was the point of view I was interested in. Background of characters is not strong nor is the sentiments of those fighting. Why are they fighting? Chamberlain gives one of many speeches in the film about fighting to free men. One soldier from the South says he's fighting for the the South's rights (which means to own slaves.) Lee's #1 man, General Longstreet, also laments the South should have freed the slaves before starting the war. (He may have meant this for political reasons -- to gain England's support -- though after the war he was also outspoken for equal rights for blacks.) Not much more than that is spoken on the slavery issue as the film primarily wants to show the fight. And that it did. As I said right at the start -- epic. At times I sat stunned in horror at the fighting that took place. I cried at being so thankful so many fought to the last to defend freedom of all men. Now, I know that's not why every man put on the uniform and took up arms, but Colonel Chamberlain's sentiment alone on that had me in tears. Wow. I went to Gettysburg National Military Park as a youngin' and could not understand it's full meaning as I could as an adult. Now I'm ready to go back to observe this hallowed ground. Why did I never see this movie until now? Glad I finally did. It takes preparation to sit through 4 1/2 hours but I will surely do it again one day!<br/><br/>8.9 / 10 stars<br/><br/>--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener"

","Excellent, historically accurate to the last waistcoat button re- creations of the assault on Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge make up the middle and last third of the film respectively, and these are the highlights of this sprawling four hour epic by far. <br/><br/>An all-star cast is featured with Martin Sheen headlining as Robert E. Lee, but the real standouts are Jeff Daniels as Col. Chamberlain and Tom Berenger as Gen. James Longstreet as two ordinary seeming men thrust into an extraordinary situation and trying to provide leadership for frightened men headed likely to their deaths. Most of the character drama of the film however is stiff and ponderous with everybody pontificating at each other much of the time and aiming for doom-laden significance with every syllable. Director Ronald Maxwell never could direct actors very well, a deficiency that continued into this movie's later prequel 'Gods and Generals'.<br/><br/>The thing Maxwell does best is staging period battle recreations; the location cinematography is excellent and this pulls the viewer back into the moment very quickly any time the action starts up, however much the stagy theatrics might have earlier distracted."
"kevin_crighton","9","1","1","21 January 2010"," A truly epic re-telling of the battle
","I'm a huge fan of epics, movies with big casts and massive battles. In this regard, Gettysburg is one of the best I've seen.<br/><br/>Re-telling the famous and important battle Ronald F. Maxwell has done a fantastic job. I will state now that I'm not familiar with the history of the American Civil War, but from what I've read, this movie faithfully re-creates the battle. Using thousands of extras, and no CGI at all it would appear, the battle scenes are stunning. While they don't have the intensity of say Saving Private Ryan, they work brilliantly.<br/><br/>The script, written by Maxwell and based on the book The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara, gives the actors plenty of good material to work with, and the cast, led by Jeff Daniels, Tom Berenger, Martin Sheen and Stephen Lang are all wonderful. One of the things about the script is that it never favours one side or another. Most movies about battles or wars, tend to only focus on one side. Here, Maxwell makes sure both sides get their moments on screen. He also shows how each side had officers who were friends now divided by uniform. <br/><br/>It is a long movie, running over 4 hours, but it doesn't actually feel that long watching it. To be fair, the movie is trying to be a faithful depiction of the battle and probably needs it's full running time.<br/><br/>One thing that should be noted is that some of the movie was filmed at the actual battlefield. I don't know how much was shot there, but I can't recall another war movie that has done this.<br/><br/>This an absorbing epic that stands as fitting tribute to the battle and those that died."
"stumpmee77","9","1","1","4 March 2008"," I didn't mind the length.
","Its length not for everyone hence I recommend watching it in increments as opposed to me who can watch it in its entirety, hardly tearing myself away from it, in one afternoon. Events inside those three days would be poorly depicted if they did less an hour for each one. The length of this film is for a reason.<br/><br/>The reasons I love ""Gettysburg"" includes but nowhere limited to: 1) It goes by the days and is very authentic in terms of detail of encampments and technology of the opposing sides. Many cast members' make-up is so good as to make that actor unrecognizable. The best example in terms of the actor made unrecognizable by makeup is Tom Berrenger as Longstreet. Martin Sheen I can still recognize despite his add-ons to make him look like R.E. Lee but he more than makes up in his portrayal of that pivotal general. I don't know if I'll ever be able to accept another actor as General Lee but Martin Sheen; he's that riveting.<br/><br/>2) Its action flows with the day to day pulse of a soldier's life; both eventful and not. To describe it I'll paraphrase a quote from portion of the Ken Burns documentary of same Civil War (forget the particular episode): ""There were times of great tedium between moments of extreme terror."" No 2 scenes captures the ""terror"" better in ""Gettysburg"" than Chamberlain's army's defending their section on Day 2 and Pickett's Charge.<br/><br/>3) As opposed to other historical films there's very little Hollywood distorting of history. As far as I see, except for J.L.Chamberlain's character,none of the rest of the major roles receives no major Hollywood rewrite. The real J. L. Chamberlain was fighting mostly for the union preservation, not for the slaves freedom but as the writers needed someone to bring the slavery was wrong angle so they picked his character. While the change to Chamberlain is inaccurate, I can see why it was done. Indeed I became interest in Chamberlain's life because of Ken Burns' Civil War documentary and this film.<br/><br/>4) The Hancock/Armistead sad, ironic subplot is poignantly underplayed and in terms of the situation is historically accurate.<br/><br/>5) I think it includes plenty of refreshingly funny moments to alleviate any possible heavy-handedness: Tom Chamberlain's chat with the confederate POVs; The Chamberlain Brothers' interacting in the film's first hour; the government guy from Virginia talking to the British visitor about State's Rights. I give the highest comedy commendations to Pickett in every scene before his charge, General Trimble talking to Lee about another officer the former felt was incomptent. I don't know why to this day but Sam Elliot's 1st 5 minutes as Bufford just cracks me up; it just does.<br/><br/>Finally I would be remiss if I didn't mention this film's excellent movie score as one of the best I've seen in any war film."

","Gettyburg is a real pleasure to watch although there are flaws. For my part I wish that they would have curtailed some of the windy speechifying, especially by the Irish sergeant who doesn't add to much (this is the part where I usually go get something do drink or take a bathroom break). My pick for the phoniest looking beard and the phoniest accent goes to C. Thomas Howell. The best performance I think goes to Sam Elliott as Gen. Buford.<br/><br/>The movie follows the book 'The Killer Angels' fairly closely. I would recommend reading it. <br/><br/>The real battle wasn't actually the turning point of the Civil War, Vicksburg was. Gettysburg was a dreadful,bloody heave over the Pennsylvania hills but at the end of it Lee's army crawled away and fought on for almost two more years. At Vicksburg Pemberton's army was surrounded and destroyed and the Union ended up in control of the Mississippi valley and the Confederacy was cut in two. After that the end was only a question of time.<br/><br/>In fact everything that Lee did was with an eye on what was happening in Mississippi. He thought if he took his army into Pennsylvania and inflicted a giant beating on the Federals then he could wipe out the sting of the coming disaster at Vicksburg. That didn't happen of course."

","In addition to being one of the best films of the 1990s (Personally, it's my favorite film of that decade.), this is one of the finest films to deal with the Civil War, period. Director Ron Maxwell assembled a terrific cast, and with them, paid homage to not one, but both sides of the war. Heroism is shown to be on both North and South, and the officers aren't anti- the opposition. They're tired of the fighting, and just want to see it end. No one's there for the glory, and the film points out that the war dealt with so much more than slavery. The performances are terrific, and the music is outstanding. Somehow this film hasn't garnered the attention it rightfully deserves. If you get the chance, catch the Director's Cut."

","When I first saw Gettysburg, which was on Tape, from a friend, and long after its release, once I saw the opening I knew it was going to be one of the great films I'd see, and one of the great ever made. For one thing, my friend and I say that the film is made for the purpose of history- made like a documentary, which is a style that is very popular now. Secondly, in seeing the epic film, you come out of it feeling that nobody wins in any war, and the film also does not take sides. The film is very objective, adding to the documentary, history, and authenticity of the film. Thirdly, as I appreciate the amazing score that makes you proud to be American, the end is well met and touch with the symbolic coming of two brothers at the end of the civil war, brother against brother. That's why I applaud the film, and say that it had me and moved me when the men rally to General Lee for Picket's Charge, which is quite an emotional moment. Highly recommend it."
"JCBar","8","1","1","19 August 2005"," Still Worth Seeing
","Gettysburg comes off definitely as someone's labor of love  its length, its detail, the screenplay all display a meticulousness that can only come from someone truly enamored of the subject. Of course, labors of love sometimes don't make for good films, or outstanding drama. They can come off as tiresome, self important, and full of didactic monotony.<br/><br/>Now, that being said, Gettysburg at times can be all of the above  after all, in a 4+ hr film you'd have to be guilty somewhere of those sins. However  and I want to really stress 'however' - this film is well worth viewing. The battle strategies alone are enough (not even to mention Jeff Daniels' Oscar worthy portrayal as Col Joshua Chamberlain) if you care at all about history, the Civil War, or the major events that this country has gone through.<br/><br/>The music is excellent, although a bit repetitive, the cast believable (with the possible exception of Martin Sheen, who seems overly detached as Lee), and the historical accuracy of the events depicted all make this a film that can be defended and/or admired. Although the dialog is stilted and flowery, and is mentioned in much of the criticism, the author of the book it is adapted from  The Killer Angels  explains exactly why this might not be entirely fair criticism.<br/><br/>In summary, see the film if you like or even care about history. The faults of the movie will be overlooked."
"backstroke1","10","1","1","11 July 2005"," Great Historically Accurate Movie-One of the best War Movies Ever Made
","Gettysburg represents all that is great in historical dramas: great acting, superb cinematography, and quality action. The movie's success lies in the fact that it draws its viewers back to the 19th century and helps them understand the importance of the events of July 1-3, 1863. <br/><br/>First, I must talk about the acting. I do not believe there is a poor performance found in this movie. Every part is played to perfection from the stars to the re-enacters who make up the large scale battles that the movie shows. Jeff Daniels, who by the way looks just like the character he portrays, gives a standout performance as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the 20th Maine Regiment. Tom Berenger also nails his part as James Longstreet, who until this book and film was vilified as the man who lost the battle of Gettysburg for the Confederacy. Martin Sheen also accurately portrays Robert E. Lee by putting a human face on a general who has risen to legendary status in the mind of most Americans. The actor who steals the screen is Richard Jordan through his portrayal of General Lewis Armistead. In his final performance before his unfortunate death, this veteran actor brings out the pain and anguish of a man who knows he will die, yet still courageously leads his men in a suicide charge. This is perhaps the greatest performance of his stellar career.<br/><br/>The music also brings out the seriousness of the situation. The score by Randy Edelman is one of the best in the past 15 years in my opinion and the fact that he had to write music for an entire 4 hour film makes his job even more amazing. The sweeping views of battle are very impressive. From the defense of Little Round Top to the audacity of Pickett's Charge, the cinematography gives viewers an almost omniscient view of the battle. One final point about the battle scenes of the film is that this movie was made before the computer graphics of today's war movies were perfected. This makes the scenes all the more realistic and impressive.<br/><br/>Gettysburg is a terrific film about the most important battle of the American Civil War. It should be seen not only by history buffs but all Americans as well. The film assists its viewers in understanding where our country came from and the lessons it teaches can definitely be applied to our struggle with terrorism in the world today."

Lee (CSA) through the three fateful days. <br/><br/>The film leaves out way to much of the first day, it only shows part Little Round Top on the second day, and finish's with the infamous Pickett's Charge. If you weren't a Civil War buff (like myself) you would never believe that fifty thousand men were killed at the battle. <br/><br/>The film is better than Gods and Generals (2003) but not by much. the film leaves out major engagements in The Wheatfield, The Peach Orchard, and East Cavalry Field. But the film does with a three day battle could be shoved into a 3+ hour film. It would have done much better as a mini-series but what can you do now.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels as military Colonel Joshua Lawerence Chamberlain caught me completely off guard after seeing his work in Dumb and Dumber (1994) but did a fantastic job. The other acting jobs are solid. The on film location was completely accurate along with uniforms and weapon usage.<br/><br/>Acting is good, Stephen Lang with a stellar performance.

"nabor7","Null","1","1","18 October 2004"," Very moving movie
","While working in the Gettysburg area for a short time. I rented the movie, went to the battlefield and then re-watched the movie. There are some historical inaccuracies, as can be expected, but as one who looks for realism, I found it in Gettysburg. There was quite of bit of the actual battle that was omitted, but the interaction of the characters and their perplexing situations presented to us, more than made up for it. It would be hard for any reasonable thinking person to imagine what it was like for life long friends like Reynolds, Hancock, and Armistead to find themselves facing each other in war as enemies. I thought the movie developed the characters brilliantly. Reynolds was the consummate soldier. Hancock was also brilliant soldier, but also had compassion towards his rebel friend. Armistead was a soldier but cherished the friends he had served with before.<br/><br/>The casting was amazing as I watched the credits and saw how similar the actors selected resembled their roles. In a movie like Gettysburg, one has to look past the superficial and look at the time in history and how the military conducted itself. The point being made to Chamberlain about the 20th Maine was the end of the Union line. They were the extreme flank. Up until this battle, the Union army had been beaten and if Lee had prevailed, that would have in all likelihood been the final victory the south needed for the north to sue for peace.<br/><br/>Looking at Gettysburg as a must win situation for the north places make the character interaction and the discussions between the various commanders all the more compelling. They understood the gravity of what could be won or lost. This movie is a must-see to show what a dark time in history and in personal lives it was."
"Phd12741","10","1","1","2 September 2004"," Truly the best Civil War Epic
","(Spoilers...well actually history lesson but who cares) Gettysburg is a film that is just like most other long epics: It is great if you can make it through the time. Gettysburg is no exception. This 4+ hour long film chronicles all three extremely bloody days of the battle. From Buford holding Cemetery Ridge, to Chamberlain holding Little Round Top, and climaxing with Pickett's charge. This film has some truly great performances by Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain, Stephen Lang as the infamous Pickett, Sam Elliot as General Buford, and Tom Berenger as James Longstreet. What is keeping this from getting a 10 is Martin Sheen's performance as Robert E. Lee. He would have done well if he were playing a different character. But Lee at that time was still a popular outgoing man as opposed to the old feeble man played by Sheen. The battle sequences are great particularly Chamberlain's charge against the Confederacy. An overall the Greatest Civil War epic in my opinion. 9.5 out of 10 a must see for most audiences."
"baenos","7","1","1","4 July 2004"," Pretty decent
","Pros - The cinematography was mostly good; it seemed to capture the epic scope of the subject matter appropriately.  The movie did an ostensibly good job at incorporating various skirmishes to portray an overall picture of the three-day battle.  I especially liked Col. Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top-- probably my favorite part of the movie, I suppose because of the way it showcases the beleaguered resolve that was no doubt a large part of many commanding officers' decision-making during the war.<br/><br/>Cons - The score.  It's very overbearing, and comes up far too often.  Also, it's really high in the overall sound mix, so that increases its intolerability, but that could also be attributed to the copy I saw.  The facial hair, particularly Tom Berenger's, is really quite bad.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is really worth seeing if you have an interest in Civil War history.  I know it preserves the actual COs involved in the battle, and it was shot on location.  Granted, I have yet to look further into the historical specifics of the battle, so who knows how much is Hollywood inaccuracy, but I will say that it provided some impetus for me to look into the war further, so that in itself is meritorious."

Yes, they could have cut out about 45 minutes worth of material without losing much.  And yes, the character development is somewhat light.  But it is still a spectacular epic.<br/><br/>The movie producers apparently found every civil war re-enactor in the country to serve as extras.  All the details are authentic down to the uniform buttons.  And the battle scenes are an awesome sight, especially the final battle.  And, if you look closely, you can see a cameo appearance by Ted Turner himself--being shot. I'm not sure, but I could swear I hear the faint cheering of thousands of Turner network employees every time that scene appears!<br/><br/>Having read the book it was based on, it was much easier to follow the plot. I would suggest that anyone who wants to see this movie read the book either before or after--Don't worry, it's not a very long book.<br/><br/>An aside:  This movie was apparently pulled off store shelves a while back. I discovered this fact to my great dismay as I tried to buy it as a Christmas present. Worthless crap like ""The Master of Disguise"" and ""From Justin to Kelly"" sits un-purchased on the shelves of video stores, and yet this quality movie languishes in the Warner Brothers vault.

Also, unless you know something about the battle and how it unfolded it is sometimes hard to follow.<br/><br/>
I am sorry that Richard Jordan is gone though this is a great performance for his final curtain call.  He and Jeff Daniels are about the only ones who deliver a performance that has some real depth to it.  I also wonder what was up with all the well known actors popping in for about five minutes.  It was hardly worth Richard Anderson's time to come in just to deliver that already tired line about ""good ground"".  What the heck does that mean any way?  <br/><br/>Kudos to Maxwell and his team on the battle sequences.

The drama and personalities are spot on.  Martin Sheen played a convincing Lee, although I didn't care for the slightly negative spin the writers put on him.  The battle scenes, I think, are probably some of the best ever shot. The supporting cast--Longstreet, Pickett, Armistead, Chamberlain, Hancock, etc.--play their roles perfectly and add to the sense of the conflict and drama in this epic.

As a student (it is officially my college major and area of interest) of the Civil War, I enjoy this movie for it's scenery (It was actually filmed on the battlefield); it's superb characterizations: Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain, Tom Berenger as Longstreet, Stephen Lang as Pickett, Sam Eliot as the unsung hero of the battle, John Buford, and a heart-rending performance by Richard Jordan as 'Low Armistead.

","As a German, i didn't know much about the Civil War except what you learn in GWTW, so i wasn't sure what to expect when Gettysburg was offered in 2 parts on TNT Europe. I was quite impressed with the overwhelming battle action and the great number of extras and members of historical units, but i wasn't sure on the acting. Best performance is definitively by Jeff Daniels as the unwilling teacher-converted-to-leader hero. I only knew him as a soft failure e.g. in Terms of Endearment or even worse in Dumb and Dumber, but he really gives live to a historical figure. Closest to him is Tom Berenger terribly disguised with a 3 year beard, but showing the desperation of somebody knowing the disaster to come, but unable to stop it. Many other ""historical"" roles suffer from their history, they hardly dare to live as humans, as if their heroic picture in the history books might suffer from it. First to name Martin Sheen, literally suppressed by being the failing hero, also Sam Elliott and Richard Jordan. Anyway, it gives some idea about the heroic foolishness of the Civil War, especially from the southern side and provides great entertainment and suspension. What more can you ask, if you know the results for more than 135 years ?"

","I enjoyed this movie thoroughly regardless of its length--those interested in the subject matter should have no problems there.  Chamberlain's charge is a good choice for dramatic focus, tho it should be noted that there was another Union charge similar in nature under similar circumstances the same day.  Martin Sheen is a poor choice as Lee--he just doesn't have Lee's statuesque demeanor or dignity, and his acting was not good here (accent was a particular problem).  However, there were good depictions of Hancock, Pickett, and Armistead.  The dialogue was moving and original (compare Pearl Harbor), important in a war movie, where dialogue can be abstracted from ""plot.""  The cinematography did well all that was needed in an epic movie. Kudos for this one."

","I watched a while ago when it was being shown on TNT. I've always been interested in the American Civil War, and this, with the possible inclusion of Glory, is probably the best Civil War film ever made. A host of famous names and a driving soundtrack help this become a classic. It's not the most violent\bloodthirsty film, but besides that, and the fact that its on for 3 and a half hours, I would recommend to anyone who knows a good film when they see one."

"Mickey-2","9","1","1","9 July 2001"," An overwhelming effort to capture the spirit of the battle that ultimately led to the making of the country
","""Gettysburg"" is the cinematic effort by Turner Pictures to produce the spirit and courageous efforts by two armies during the three day battle of the American Civil War which ultimately led to the demise of the army of the Confederacy and an eventual Union victory.  Many times, movies based on historical fact tend to be dry, sappy, uninspiring efforts and they leave the viewer with a sense of ""So What?""  This film does not.  It is able to re-enact the saga that was Gettysburg, PA in 1863 without being too overly preachy or hard to take.  A bit long, but the film needed as much time on screen to share with the viewers the feelings as expressed by commanders on both the North and the South.<br/><br/>This film has been able to capture on screen some of the most authentic and realistic battle scenes from the time of the Civil War.  The members of the cast would be hard-pressed to present their individual characters than they did.  Tom Berenger, as Gen. Longstreet, CSA, and Jeff Daniels, as Chamberlain, USA, give strong character strengths to their roles.  In good form were Martin Sheen, as Gen. Robert E. Lee, CSA, and Sam Elliott in a role of Major John Buford, USA, upon whose efforts it falls to stem the Confederate advance till other Union forces can reach the battlefield. Richard Jordan, in his last role on film, gives a supreme performance as Gen. Lewis Armistead, CSA, who finds himself having to combat old friends from days past at West Point and in other campaigns.<br/><br/>Lengthy perhaps, engrossing definitely, a must-see or must own, for those who are involved with Civil War history.  9/10"
"Tom DeFranco","Null","1","1","18 June 2001"," Best ACW film there is
","What was the Englishman living Down under smoking? He's critiquing a movie about the largest land battle fought in United States and calling it American nationalism!? The movie is about Americans fighting Americans at a crucial point in the Civil War. I would guess that what that gentleman knows about the American Civil War wouldn't fill a Dixie cup.<br/><br/>Was the movie 100% accurate? No but, it was true to Michael Shaara's book. As I recall, Historian/Re-enactor Brian Pohanka recommended pages upon pages of changes and by his own estimation, Mr. Maxwell incorporated some 85% of them. That is good enough for me. I thought that the interpretations of their characters by the leading actors were great. I especially liked Tom Berenger as James Longstreet, Jeff Daniels as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Martin Sheen as R. E. Lee and Sam Elliott as John Buford.<br/><br/>Was there speechifying. You bet! But a world 138 years removed from the battle may deserve a little reminder of what made these people fight.<br/><br/>When the movie got down to the fighting, it did a terrific if not quite bloody enough portrayal of it. The scenes of the 20th Maine fighting the 15th and 47th Alabama Regiments on Little Round Top were gems. They did an excellent (if incomplete) job of showing what's going through a man's mind, fighting his first action in charge of his regiment. Historically speaking, the only flaw there was was not showing Chamberlain detaching Company B and then wondering what happened to them throughout the fight (something that occurred in the book).<br/><br/>Was the movie complete? No, I don't think the intention was to show the whole battle. It was trying to show what Mr. Shaara put in his book. I'd like to see a movie about the whole battle (somewhere out there, I'm told are 6 hour cuts of the movie - I'd kill to see one of those.)<br/><br/>Finally, to our English buddy: the book ""The Killer Angels"" was written at a time in our Nation's history (1974, I believe)when it was down on itself about anything that smacked of the American Military. Mr. Shaara intended to show American Military characters who were proud, smart, and pugnacious and, beneath it all were generally good people. All wore white hats in his portrayal of the events of these three days. The tension was in the battle itself and, we didn't get gypped there either."

"Pugnax","Null","1","1","13 November 1998"," Magnificent. Beautifully made, soberingly presented. Will become a classic.
","I have just one regret about ""Gettysburg"":  I've never seen it on a big screen.  This is filmmaking at its exquisite best, with gorgeous cinematography, thoughtful design, marvelous performances, brilliant execution from the grand sweep down to the merest detail, and a score that moves my heart up into my throat every time I listen to it.<br/><br/>Nowhere else have I seen such chillingly and hauntingly REAL battle scenes; it's more than just making it look right, you have to make it FEEL right, and ""Gettysburg"" feels more like a documentary than a commercial blockbuster.  Even the forced-seeming speeches, about which some viewers complain, are right - they really did talk that way in the 1860s, except that their phrasing was actually more stilted than we in the 1990s can sink our teeth into.  And the peaceful interludes do just what's needed to set the horror into perspective.  (Maybe it also helps that I've stood in the Devil's Den and seen the sweep of the killing ground over which Pickett's Charge advanced.)<br/><br/>I'm not sure a better cast could possibly have been assembled. ""Magnificent"" is too weak to do justice to their moving performances.  Richard Jordan's tearful soliloquy as Armistead, in Longstreet's tent; the stricken look on Stephen Lang's face when, as Pickett, he cries ""General Lee, I *have* no division""; the calm and thoughtful - and totally characteristic - way Jeff Daniels delivers Chamberlain's speech to the men of the 2nd Maine, these are hallmark moments of the art of the motion picture.<br/><br/>Everyone is costumed and equipped with complete, and accurate, attention to detail.  Except for the beard on Tom Berenger - the real Longstreet's beard was pretty scraggly.<br/><br/>This is probably one of a very few films whose producers really listened to their extras (several thousand re-enactors) and changed the way they were doing things to ""get it right.""  The worst gaffe in the entire film, from a Civil War addict's point of view, might be that the artillery barrage preceding Pickett's Charge starts at the left of the Confederate line and runs to the right.  It actually went the other way.  When they get things that close to right, I cannot help being tremendously impressed."

","I am extremely interested in the American Civil War. There is something about it that touches my soul. In England, very little can be found on this war and there is very little viewing matter. When I first came across the Gettysburg video, I was enthralled by everything about it. The scenery, the acting, seeing portrayals of the characters that I have been reading about come to life so very believably. There are so many good performances in Gettysburg that it is hard to pick out anyone in particular. Tom Berenger as Gen. Longstreet gave a perfect portrayal. One is caught up in the emotions that he experiencing at the various commands he had to follow through against his better judgement. My own personal favourite though, is Martin Sheen as the great General Robert E.Lee. He captured in his performance the qualities that I had come to associate with Gen. Lee. The battle scenes are wonderfully shot and compelling, though heartbreaking, to watch. After watching this film, I wanted to find out 'everything' about the Gettysburg battle, as we were given just glimpses of the various Generals and Officers involved, but enough to wet one's appetite. This film is what movie making is all about. Great acting, great viewing and incredible value for money."
"marko","Null","1","1","27 January 2001"," This is how We Became who We Are
","Based on ""The Killer Angels"" by the late Michael Shaara, ""Gettysburg"" gets so many things right that it can be pardoned for its faults.<br/><br/>The novel and the movie stand virtually alone in crediting Gen. John Buford in choosing and preserving the ground on which the Union army would fight this critical battle -- a strategic choice which may have dictated the battle's outcome.  The film also effectively makes the point that Longstreet and Hood BEGGED Lee to allow them to sideslip right and attack the Union flank, bypassing the Round Tops.  Having accurately dealt with these two critical themes, the film accomplishes more than military historians can expect of most historical movies.<br/><br/>But ""Gettysburg"" succeeds as a movie because of the people who populate this story, and the actors who play them.<br/><br/>Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is one of the authentic heroes of the Civil War. His action in holding Little Round Top can be classed with Thermopolae, Cannae, Waterloo, and the Normandy invasion for historical significance. Jeff Daniels is perfectly cast as a college professor-turned-soldier, who recognizes the importance of the role into which he has been thrust, and inspires his men to help change the world.<br/><br/>Tom Berenger is terrific as an anguished Gen. Longstreet, who knows the revered Robert E. Lee is making a monumental blunder, but is powerless to affect the resulting slaughter he foresees so clearly.  Sam Elliot may have been born to play the role of the tragic Gen. Buford, robbed by history of the credit he deserves, and dying of pneumonia within months of this battle. And Richard Jordan embodies the brother-against-brother nature of this conflict with his sterling portrayal of Gen. Lewis Armistead, who was killed while attacking troops commanded by his best friend. Seldom has the waste, frustration, and personal anguish of war been as well-portrayed as it is in this film.<br/><br/>This film can be justly criticized for its length, for the wooden portrayals by Sheen and others, and for taking some dramatic license with people and events.  But it is simply the best depiction ever filmed of a significant event in American history.  For all its flaws, it is must-see material for anyone who wants to understand why Americans are what we are."

I bet you will really enjoy those movies as well.  While you are at it, you may want to watch Patton, the movie regarding the American General who rescued Europe from Nazi rule.<br/><br/>As for Gettysburg, this movie really brought the battle alive for me.  I especially enjoyed the performances of Stephen Lang as Pickett, Richard Jordan as Armistead, and Kevin Conway as Kilrain.  Stephen Lang's response to Sheen (General Lee) toward the end of Pickett's unsuccessful charge, was wonderfully delivered, such that it brings tears to my eyes whenever I watch that scene.

"CAM-32","Null","1","1","7 August 2000"," A Fabulous Tribute
","Watch this movie and you will get a great four-hour lesson on America's most important event.  In part, Gettysburg teaches us the strategy and important events from the battle.  During or before the battle scenes we see the men in charge discuss the plan of attack so the viewer can learn a lot about the astounding achievements and blunders that occurred.  As an added bonus, between the battle scenes we watch the various characters discuss the moral and political issues of the war, and while this may or may not be completely realistic (it must have gone on to a certain extent) it serves as some great room for thought.  These conversations (particularly between Chamberlain and his sergeant) are quite graceful.   No opinions are forced, instead the expressions of the individuals serve as characterization and a chance to consider different viewpoints.  The music by Randy Edelman (Last of the Mohicans) is hugely effective, it complements every emotion perfectly.  The cast is just as brilliant.  Supporting actors C Thomas Howell (Tom Chamberlain), Stephen Lang (George Pickett), Brian Mallon (Hancock) and Kevin Connelly (Kilrain) all especially nailed their characters, but the clear standouts are Richard Jordan and especially Jeff Dainels who apparently geared up for Dumb and Dumber by playing Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain (the huge underdog hero) as well as any actor has ever performed.  Jordan, as Confederate Gen. Armstead, brings unparalleled emotion to his powerful, powerful death scene.  As it was, Jordan was aware that he himself was dying of brain cancer while the scene was filmed, the result is crushingly authentic."

","I really enjoyed this movie. I've seen it several times and it has held my attention each time. My favorite part of this film, above some excellent acting by the leads, was Randy Edelman's outstanding dramatic score. My question is this, ""Why was it overlooked at the Oscars?"" It wasn't even nominated. I consider this score and James Horner's score for Glory to be among the best film scores in recent years. Both were not nominated for Academy Awards. I think this is rather sad. While I'm glad that Mr. Horner won for Titanic, I'd rather remember him for Glory as opposed to ""My Heart Will Go On."" Mr. Edelman's score work has been uneven, but he also wrote the highly memorable music for Last of the Mohicans. Again, he was not nominated. In fact, he has never been nominated for an Academy Award. I suppose that not much can be done about this now, but I thought it would be good to draw attention to these two scores as (well, perhaps slightly) short of masterpieces despite the fact that they were overlooked at Oscar time."

I was initially disappointed having read the book and knowing many of the details that had been left out, but really, how much can you cram into 4+ hours?! Everything was awesome, especially the music...sure there were some things which didn't fit such as Lee's army not being very ""lean"", but hey, I think that no better tribute could have been paid than by using actual civil war re-enactors who know the scope of the situation and who had to outfit themselves. I also think a magnificent job was done in finding actors who looked and acted the part. Longstreet and Pickett were exactly as I expected them to be. The tie between Armistead and Hancock was a tear-jerker as was the loss of men in Hood and Pickett's divisions. The only REAL disappointment was Chamberlain. I think he is great, but Jeff Daniels just did not pull it off for me. Yeah he may have looked the part, but in the way he characterised Chamberlain he just didn't seem like a professor. For one thing, he never talked loudly or clearly enough until his order for ""bayonets!!"" which made him seem out of character. Of course they say his ""ums"" and constant repetition made him realistic, but the other officers (like Vincent) got by just fine without any of that. I guess you get used to him though and besides that, the movie is excellent.   Wonderful wonderful music and I'd like to say that people shouldn't comment about historical information that they probably don't know much about and though I'm not a Gettysburg expert yet, I know that this movie is definitely NOT a waste of time and that even if your interest in the Civil War remains stagnant after watching it, you'll at least have learned something about your nation's history and perhaps shed a tear or two for the men of both sides who are remembered through this film...."

","Four stars, a masterpiece, well done from start to finnish.  An honest, inspiring account of the greatest and most important battle in American history.  While movies like The Deer Hunter and Saving Private Ryan are excellent in their own way, it's refreshing to watch a war movie that's message doesn't try to go beyond the spectrum of the battle itself.  What really makes the movie brilliant is Randy Edelman's (Last of the Mohicans) score and the performances by an excellent cast.  In particular were the Chamberlain brothers, played by C. Thomas Howell (what happened to that guy) and Jeff Daniels in perhaps the decade's most powerful performance.  Daniels' range of performances (Dumb and Dumber to Gettysburg) is unparalled in both the characters he plays and the spectacular job he does every time."

","It should be noted that Randy Edelman's ""Gettysburg"" score is in fact not synthesizer-dominated, as previously noted by a viewer. And I would like to think Edelman does utilize a full sound with his orchestra here. I actually prefer the score to Horner's more standard ""Glory."" And John Williams, while a great Wagnerian master of motif and an exciting composer in the Romantic vein, couldn't have done a better job than Edelman has done here. I can't really imagine Williams doing this score in light of what Edelman has done. His work stands on its own for once. One might not usually enjoy Edelman's acoustic guitar-laden style, which isn't as theme-heavy as Williams, but most can at least acknowledge this work as one of his best efforts. He even uses some nice-sounding period instrumentation on ""Fife and Gun,"" the cue heard in the film leading up to General Reynolds's death on the first day of battle. Good stuff. And the themes are good- Edelman has stated in liner notes that he consciously attempted to follow the drama of the story more so than he attempted to fit the music to the time period. For comparison, listen to Ry Cooder's ""Geronimo"" score from the same year. The chant-heavy music was fitting for the time period and subject matter, but sounded aesthetically ugly for a movie to me. :)"

","I must say that I am surprised at how well this film has been reviewed; some even go so far as to believe it was robbed at Oscar time!!!  While I think this movie is nothing more than an exhibition of American nationalism, the movie does have some strong points.  Firstly, the set the design is amazing and the fact that most of it was shot on location is a wonderful attribute for students of history like me.  Secondly, the make up was brilliant, as the actors really did look like the people they were playing.  Thirdly, the battle scenes were perfectly re-created.<br/><br/>However, these three points are probably the only good things I could find in this film.  My problems with this film are numerous, but I will name the main three.<br/><br/>(1) Ronald F. Maxwell should never get one of his screenplays turned into a film again.  When looking at his previous films, I am not surprised that he turned in something as horrible as this, because it is very obvious that this kind of material is too much for him.  Maybe Michael Shaara's novel is to blame, but I have never read it and do not plan to after seeing this film.  The script was terrible!  It consists of one American Patriotic cliché after another and is more of a collection of bravo speeches than it is actual dialogue.  It is also one of the most one-sided views of history that I have ever witnessed as it portrays these people, especially the generals, as saints that were all so concerned with the problem of slavery. All I can say about this is: read your history books!! In short, the Civil War started over an issue of state's rights, and not slavery, and once Lincoln specified his war arms to be about slavery, it was an immensely unpopular decision.  None of this kind of thing is shown.<br/><br/>(2)  The acting was disgraceful and this made the short commings of the script even more obvious.  Then again, when was the last time people like Tom Berenger, Martin Sheen, Jeff Daniels or Stephen Lang give a good dramatic performance?<br/><br/>(3) The music was another element that made the film seem like one big cliché, with big dramatic `hero-scores' playing every time one of the 'heroes' rode his horse to the top of a mountain, looking all profound and about to head into another speech-like monologue.<br/><br/>I can understand why Americans must like this film, because it would undoubtedly feed into their nationalist beliefs about how wonderful their nation is, and deftly paints a picture of each of these people involved in the conflict the way Americans probably want to remember them. If you want to see good set-designs, makeup and battle scenes, then this movie is fantastic.  If you are looking for anything deeper than that, don't bother.<br/><br/>I give it 3/10."

"rimnod","7","3","6","9 February 2005"," ""Well sah.......they wouldn't leave!""
","""Gettysburg"" was first conceived as a miniseries. The original intent is easily discerned in the sometimes choppy flow of the story. At 4 hours the movie is long and the script is rendered anemic at times. Still, it is a decent effort to put real American history on the screen. <br/><br/>The first segment concerns Buford's brave stand on the first day of the battle. Sam Elliot is good as the Union cavalry commander who risked his unit to buy a few hours for the Army of the Potomac to come up and occupy the high ground outside of Gettysburg. It was a gamble that paid off. <br/><br/>The second part of the film centers on J.L. Chamberlain's 20th Maine throwing back the Confederates who were trying to turn the Union flank at Little Round Top on the second day. This action received much acclaim more than 125 years after the fact when it was featured in Ken Burn's Civil War (1990). In that series it was described as a feat that ""saved the Union army........ and maybe even the Union itself."". Jeff Daniels bears a striking resemblance to Chamberlain and does a fine job with the role. Unfortunately, the script gives him some lame lines at times. (""Here they come again boys!""). He is especially badly used by keeping his character around after the moment of glory to just duck Confederate shells in the back of the Union center during Pickett's Charge on the third day. Chamberlain's brother is dizzily played by C. Thomas Howell. His is the only character in the film that really got on my nerves---I kept hoping that he would collapse from heat stroke or get hit in the head and knocked unconscious by a spent minnie ball. <br/><br/>The scene where Howells' character talks to the rebel prisoners, at the end of the first day of the battle, is supposedly based on a famous Civil War painting. But John Huston must have had the exact same idea when he made ""The Red Badge of Courage "" (1951) --- The scene in ""Gettysburg"" almost exactly matches the one in ""Red Badge of Courage"" even down to some of the dialogue. Only John Huston had the good fortune of having his lines uttered by Arthur Hunnicutt and not C. Thomas Howell.<br/><br/>Another part of the picture follows the course of all three days of the battle as seen from the perspective of the Confederate commanders. Tom Berenger is very charismatic as Longstreet. However, like Daniels, he has got to spout some rather insipid lines at times. And he has to stand there like a dummy while his junior officers engage in a flip discussion on the pros and cons of Darwinism. Berenger's southern accent is overdone at times and on a couple occasions it seems to disappear altogether. Still - all in all - a creditable performance. Longstreet spends a great deal of the movie trying to convince General Lee (Martin Sheen) to disengage the rebel army and find a strong defensive position somewhere between the Union army and Washington. It's ironic then that he is left to plan and execute (against his own strong judgment) the futile Confederate assault on the Union center on the last day of the battle.<br/><br/>I see in the trivia section of IMDb that Sheen was only the 4th or 5th choice to play Robert E. Lee. Sheen does not match Lee's physical type. Lee being relatively tall and angular while Sheen is a smaller man. I think Sheen would make a wonderful General Grant - he bears a remarkable likeness to the Union General. However--taking all of that into account -it is a tribute to Sheen's acting ability that he does succeed to a large degree in this role. He shows Lee's fighting spirit, his dignity and humility. The scene where Lee rides among his cheering troops just before Pickett's charge is the most moving of the film---and apparently completely unplanned. More is revealed in the faces of the re-enactors in this scene- about the caliber of the men of the Army of Northern Virginia -than could be discovered in any other ten Civil War movies.<br/><br/>The conventional view is that Pickett's Charge was a horrendous blunder by Lee -- his only major mis-step of the war. I tend to hold with those who dissent from this view. Lee certainly knew that the final assault was a long shot. However, he also knew that it was imperative that a decisive defeat be inflicted on the Union Army somewhere north of Washington. He was determined to seize the day and the hour to attack the Union Army wherever he could and not let the campaign be deflected by stalemate or the uncertainty of further maneuvering. The battle of Gettysburg had a now or never quality for Lee. He rolled the dice and lost.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang is unmatched in theatrical flair as Pickett. If you want to see real life courage though- you had better watch Richard Jordan's performance as Armistead. A dying man in real life playing a man fated to die in the movie. The friendship motif that is played out between Jordan's Armistead and Brian Mallon's Union General Hancock doesn't work. The emotional connection is not made---but it is not from a lack of emotional sincerity or intensity on Jordan's part. <br/><br/>While this movie only succeeds modestly where it does succeed - it can at least be said that- where it fails--it doesn't miss by much. I have a real appreciation for the effort that I can see was made here to put American history on the screen. The commitment is made visible by the acting performances, in the use of re-enactors -- in the camera work on location at the Gettysburg battlefield--in the beautiful musical score. This is a movie worth owning."

","Gettysburg as a movie is less about the battle and more about the some 100,000 American soldiers (Union and Confederate) which took part of. What it tries to accomplish is to squeeze in every famous, and not so recognizable, name into the film with a bunch of zealous speeches including moments where they actually turn to you and EXPLAIN what they are doing as if we had absolutely no clue what the heck's going on. That is perhaps one of the biggest flaws. I don't want to hear them explain to me. I want to see it on the screen.<br/><br/>Speaking of speeches, too many for a war film. Sure, they want to show Gettysburg from the Union and the Confederate's side. Sure, they want to show that even though the two sides are in this extremely horrifying and bloody political war, they are still Americans at heart. They still love each other. I like to see that once. I don't like seeing and hearing it over and over again on the film.<br/><br/>Overall I gave it a 4, and only because I'm a sucker for war films... except maybe Pearl Harbor.

","I a real bit of a war history buff and really enjoyed reading about American civil war, the ins and the outs, the various battles and generals involved. As such I even more so enjoy movies about battles and also adds perspective that simply reading can't achieve. So when I saw this movie about the famous battle that was the 'turning of the tide' as people say, I thought this should be really good.<br/><br/>But to be honest I was really disappointed. I spent most of the movie fast forwarding it. That's how bad it got. Enjoy the battle scenes and I like to watch the dialog between the generals and reasons/thoughts about tactics, but omg talk about talking for sake of talking absolute rubbish. I just keep fast forwarding through the needless crap. I know it was 1993 when it was made, but obvious fake facial hear, repeated scenes, some bad acting in spots. And more so that it really really doesn't do this epic 3 day battle justice with the poor realism on the 'pickets charge' to really try and bring the movie goer into what it would've been like.<br/><br/>It really was pretty bad. I'm surprised people voted it so well. Maybe it's just me, so if so someone tell me. So much bad acting and like they just thought, how long can we make this go for, maybe we'll just show the men talking among themselves about not much whilst flashing between various important peoples faces showing some level of really bad faked emotion. EPIC EPIC fail. Please do a new 21st century verison about this battle that does it some justice to honour it appropriately."

","If you are looking for an authentic portrayal of the dramatic events of Gettysburg, this is a must-see for history buffs. Without expressing any bias toward the political dynamite that is the U.S. Civil War, this movie fairly shows two narratives to what I can assume is accurate in terms of what soldiers, politicians and generals experienced.<br/><br/>Knowing that this movie is not for everyone (especially main stream movie watchers), do not be intimidated by the movies length. Acting is superb (Martin Sheen and Tom Berringer shockingly good) and the props used for this film further gives the immediate feeling of authenticity. The fact that this film had scenes shot at the actual battlegrounds of Gettysburg is amazing enough.<br/><br/>What this movie lacks some time is better pacing, but other than that this movie accomplishes in all ways what story it wanted to tell and how to tell it.<br/><br/>Watch it, judge by yourself.

","It is my favorite topic in the US history - the great and tragic Civil War. When brothers were killing brothers. When fathers were against their kids. When the whole country was torn apart. For me as a Russian, it is a very challenging and difficult to grasp the war that raged on a far away soil far many years away. But we had our Civil war, too, so the topic of fierce fight for the home turf appeals to me greatly. The movie, albeit its 4 hours running time, is a real winner. It is a huge success and a real masterpiece of cinema. Not ever before had the movie captured my attention and for so long. Plus, this is one of the rare instances when the movie gets only better with each repeat. It doesn't age with the course of time, it never gets boring or trite. The main characters are so real, down-to-earth people with their fears and feats, that you can never doubt they are so real. The parts played by great Thomas Berrenger, Martin Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, George Lazenby, among many others, are excellent and superb. The Little Round Top fight and the famous ""Bayonets!!"" charge from Joshua Chamberlain is blood-thrilling. Or, the final hopeless attack of the Confederate Army in an open field, towards the volleys and canisters - this is heartbreaking. What is really great, the movie does not say North is good, South is bad. Nay, it is far from that. The film shows the real tragedy of a war, the real suffering of real people."
"sackharin","5","2","4","30 January 2003"," perfecting my day, along with its ""genre""..
","When I yesterday came to the conclusion that a reviewing of this film might be interesting, it eventually made the whole day worth its dawn. Last summer I rented the film, for a cheap prize. And when I experienced (couldn't think of a more proper choice of word) it, my mind told me it was a decent film about the American civil-war. The following week I had almost completely forgotten about it.<br/><br/>But as mentioned, I yesterday felt like ""experience"" it again, for some reason. I honestly haven't read any other comments about it, but I guess for some people, a four hour exceeding film is maybe two hours more than it requires (whichever the genre). Especially in this case now, when the plot can be seen as very simple, as it is only circuiting around one of the most striking and powerful battles in the history of America. The use of the word ""only"" in the last sentence was very objective and personally I couldn't agree with it less.<br/><br/>Perhaps if the film contained stupid* speeches about America's superiority in comparison to the rest of the world..<br/><br/>Perhaps if the battle scenes would have been made with less astonishing beauty, tense and feeling of something overwhelmingly powerful..<br/><br/>Perhaps if one of the sides in the conflict would have been obviously privileged or similar to that in moral, loosing the whole point, the whole idea of this film..<br/><br/>Perhaps if the characters would have been less researched (a wild guess of sensibility from my side that a research was actually made), if it would have been casted, not with worse actors but with worse fittingly actors for the characters (especially then general Lee, who I think is brilliantly performed by Martin Sheen; his wonderful accent nearly brought tears to my eyes in the end).. ..perhaps then, this would have been a ""decent"" film, made with historical authenticity. But it's not. It is so much more than a decent film produced for TV-audience. It is an extraordinary milestone in its genre (which one that might be.. 19th century war account..?) And I love it. I love it deeply, as deeply as a man (sixteen years, nine months.. all right then, not a man quite yet, to be perfectly accurate with the details) can love something that is beautiful in his eye.<br/><br/>And the beauty always, and only, exists in the eye of the beholder.<br/><br/>

"carissawolff","7","0","0","4 January 2015"," Not too bad
","Overall, the movie had many factual errors and held significant bias. At many points, the Union was portrayed as fighting for equal rights for African Americans, while many were actually fighting for peace and unity within America. There were also historical mistakes regarding the point in time that the Civil War took place, such as too many stars on flags and incorrect currency. Although errors were displayed, Gettysburg depicted history with great detail and was closely related to the real event. It took its time to get to the point, which is both helpful with information and incredibly boring. There were points that were exciting and ones that seemed more like a lecture or watching paint dry. It was worth the watch though!"
"johnvernick3","8","0","0","4 January 2015"," Good movie describing the civil war
","I found the movie very interesting especially how well the attacks were planned by both sides before battle also the mind set of the soldiers both for the north and the south impressed me. They showed just how much they cared for what they were fighting for and what they wanted as a result from this war. This movie also shows just how bad the civil war really was. Also I didn't realize that so many generals and high ranking officials died during this war. It just shows that they didn't put their lives before the lives of the soldiers that they were commanding. One other thing I was surprised about was how Robert E.Lee didn't really listen to his fellow generals about how they feel they should attack the Union instead he felt his way was always the best but that proved to be wrong at Gettysburg."

Although not gory or graphic in any way, the movie depicts the high death rates in the war and how it deeply affects the soldiers and especially the generals. <br/><br/>I thought the acting in the war was good as well. Sheen's portrayal of Lee was very good, I thought. The movie has some good scenes as well, the action scenes especially. However, the movie fails in some parts, too. Most noticeably, it was obviously too long. It has the record as the longest American movie ever made, I think, and it shows. It could have easily been cut down by at least an hour, by shortening some of the seemingly endless marching scenes. There was one marching period that I timed to be nearly six minutes long. This had no dialogue and just showed people walking and bring on horseback. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie was good and kept me interested throughout, but it could have been much better. It remains, to me at least, a good movie, but more for people who are very serious about history."

","The range of marks here in my view is partly explained by the fact that it is good (in fact, very good...) in parts and pretty dire in some in others. On the one hand some of the battlefield scenes are pretty gripping and hard to take your eyes off, on the other the movie is interspersed with long periods of inaction and melodramatic hogwash. As others have said, the 4 hours could easily have been shrunk to 3 without too much trouble especially if the film hadn't tried to pack so many characters in. That said I have watched some 90 minute movies that felt as if they had lasted twice as long. <br/><br/>As a non-American (though one who has read a bit of the battle's history) can't vouch too much for the historical accuracy though I note a range of views from other reviews here. The hairy beards and handlebar moustaches do look sometimes as if they are straight from an under-budget pantomime production (though to be fair some of the photos of the characters in real-life do too). <br/><br/>To continue the curate's egg theme that's also reflected in the acting. Thought Jeff Daniels was great but Martin Sheen struggles to pass OK. Some of the other performances would be better suited to Little House on the Prairie (no offence meant against that great harmless family entertainment).<br/><br/>Worth a watch and maybe like me you'll end up liking some and thinking 'what the heck was all that about' for other bits."

","I liked the movie very much, as it was quite accurate in so far as the attitudes, tactics, and atmosphere are concerned. The battle scenes are very well choreographed, but (1) there needed to be more visible ""blood"" - I'm not a big fan of violence for violence sake, but this was the bloodiest battle in the Civil War, and nary a bit of it is seen in Pickett's Charge. Also, (2) it got ""preachy"" in spots. Most soldiers were fighting because that's what they were told to do and they felt they were defending their ""country"" rather than fighting for a higher, moralistic idea. Finally (3) the musical score just didn't fit in some spots (tried to be too dramatic) and was unconvincing in others (the repeated ""Dixie"" melody for instance). Berenger, Sheen, Daniels, Lang and Elliott were all marvelous in their respective roles, but Richard Jordan stood out head and shoulders above them all. Very good film, but it had the potential to be perfect and missed."

","Movie Review - Gettysburg: This is one of my all time favorite movies. It was released in 1993 and stars Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, Stephen Lang and Jeff Daniels. For those that aren't history buffs or Civil War buffs this movies tells the story of the Battle of Gettysburg fought during the Civil War on July 1 through July 3, 1863 in Gettysburg, PA. For those that are history buffs or Civil War buffs you might agree that there are some discrepancies but not enough to make this movie a complete disaster in the telling of this battle.<br/><br/>Gettysburg is based on a book called Killer Angels written by Michael Shaara, published in 1974. Michael Shaara passed away five years before the release of Gettysburg in 1988. Usually the adaptation from book to movie is quite different, names are changed, scenes are changed, but this is not the case with Gettysburg.<br/><br/>It would be counterproductive to give a detailed account or retell the whole story about this battle based on what is depicted in the movie. I say this because the movie is four and half hours long. I will point our the three scenes I find most poignant.<br/><br/>The first scene I like is actually a collection of scenes that lead up to the death of Major General John F. Reynolds, played by John Rothman. A Union Calvary unit under Brigadier General John Buford has engaged the Confederate Army at Gettysburg and has held his ground waiting for Reynolds to bring his unit to Gettysburg. When Buford finally sees Reynolds' unit arrive Buford visibly is relieved.<br/><br/>The second scene is of Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain's 20th Maine Infantry defending their position at Little Roundtop. After several hours and successfully repulsing the Confederates at least a half dozen times the 20th Maine Infantry is dangerously low on ammunition; this prompts Chamberlain to make the decision to have his soldiers to fix bayonets and charge down hill into the Confederates. Do this catches the Confederates off guard and many surrender.<br/><br/>The final scene I like another collection that depicts Pickett's Charge. I won't go into detail about this scene as I would like very much if you watch the scene for yourself. I will say that in 2010 I took a course for my Masters in which we took a tour of nine Civil War battlefields in seven days. Gettysburg was the final battlefield we visited and we walked the route that was used for Pickett's Charge. It is a march of more than a mile over open ground, in which the Confederate soldiers were within range of Union Artillery. Imagine walking more than a mile wearing wool in heat, probably near 90 or 100 degrees, with high humidity and high dew point.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie highly for those that are interested in Civil War history or history in general. I recommend this movie for those that even like war or action movies. There are some very graphic scenes, especially after the second days fighting is done and General Longstreet is walking through a makeshift hospital where amputations are being depicted."
"swfan94","7","0","0","3 April 2011"," Mixed Feelings
","I have mixed feelings about this movie. It's a slow movie, choosing to showcase characters and dialogue over the battle scenes. Which is fine as the characters and dialogue are both exceptionally good, and the acting is, for the most part, fine. But there are so many characters, with so many conversations and so many back-stories, by the end I had trouble keeping track of any of them. The battle scenes, however, are fantastic. Long and brutal, they really are great to watch, though a PG rating prevents them from being appropriately brutal and therefore realistic. I also didn't like how one-sided the battles were. Though the movie is quite balanced and has main characters on both sides of the conflict, the battles are only shown one side at a time. The first big battle on Little Big Top is shown entirely from the Union's point of view, and the ending battle is shown entirely from the Confederates point of view, which kind of hurt the movie and it's character development. For instance, Colonel Chamberlain, is shown anticipating the final battle, but is never actually shown in the battle, nor is he shown afterwards until the final scene, so we have no idea how he held up or what he was doing throughout the entire battle. All in all, though, this was a pretty good movie, and a great experience, though it would have been better if it wasn't four hours long."

","Despite its length I thot Gettysburg was a gripping movie that for the most part captured the drama of this epochal event.    My main complaints with it were the rotten treatment given to Union Gen. George Gordon Meade and one of his staff officers, Governeur Kimble (G.K.) Warren.  Meade is given hardly any exposure in the movie, and Warren none, despite the pivotal role both played. Meade had only been in command for a few days and was under tremendous pressure from Lincoln, yet showed remarkable coolness when faced by Lee and his formidable army.  It was Meade's decision to fortify the Union center in anticipation of Lee's attack, a fact not mentioned in the movie, nor was Warren's rapid reinforcement of Little Round Top. But at least Meade got more respect in the movie than in Shaara's book. <br/><br/>    Throughout the movie one got the impression that the proper command decisions should have been obvious for both sides, but this is only possible with 20-20 hindsight.  If the Federal center had been weak and Pickett's charge had succeeded, Lee would have been hailed as a genius.  His daring gamble at Chancellorsville, when he split has forces, was a success.  He gambled again at Gettysburg and this time he lost.     The entire Union Army was not made up of the Irish, as the movies seemed to imply.     Despite this it was an enjoyable movie & I'm looking forward to Gods & Generals."

I agree with others who have posted that it is too long.  Many of the scenes cried out for editing.  The acting was generally good, although I would have preferred a different actor to portray Lee.  Martin Sheen did what he could, but I think the legendary status of Lee required an actor of similar physical stature and charisma.

","This is a terribly long movie and you feel every minute of it.  Not that being long is bad---some stories need that extra hour and when it is done like ""Titanic"" the time just flys by.  But the pacing in ""Gettysburg"" is excrutiatingly slow, even most of the fighting is done at a walk or a trot.<br/><br/>The movie does have an authentic look to it and great care was made in having the actors look like twins of their real-life characters.  The upside of using the Civil War reenactors is that the costuming of the extras is very good.  But I agree with other comments---where did all these whizzened, elderly privates and corporals come from?  You see far too many overweight extras---I can guarantee you that there certainly couldn't have been that many overweight Rebel soldiers, not given all the marching they did and the scanty food they had!  <br/><br/>While it was good that the movie used the real Gettysburg battlefield, one jarring ananchronism is that as the camera pans over the Southern army prior to Pickett's charge, you can see a truck or a car driving down a road behind them. <br/><br/>The battle scenes, particularly Little Round Top, were done well in this movie but that is the only reason to see it.  The acting in this movie is pretty bad with the exception of maybe three or four people.  Jeff Daniels was in the running for an Oscar nomination as Joshua Chamberlain and Tom Berenger and Richard Jordan do well as Longstreet and Armistad.  But I thought the rest of the actors were just too over the top.  Martin Sheen's take on Lee was so reverent that you'd thought that he was playing Moses. The characters go on and on in these overwrought speeches and entire scenes are devoted to things like Southern generals debating the theory of evolution! <br/><br/>I've tried to like this movie but it simply puts me to sleep every time I see it.  I've resorted to fast-forwarding to the battle scenes and leaving out the rest.  Despite this being a Union victory, most of the story is told from the Southern perspective and one cannot help but feel a Southern bias in the movie.

The actual number of troops present numbered somewhere closer to 150-179 thousand, taken altogether, though not all were actually engaged.<br/><br/>You know from the moment the opening credits start to roll off your screen that this is going to be a powerful film experience.  The musical score alone will take you to heights seldom experienced in the Hollywood of today. It's too bad I'll never see this one on the large screen.  What a magnificent experience that would be."

","This film is one of the best ever made about the war between the states. The settings and makeup is just splendid, these people and locations really look like a 19th century enviorment. The fighting is very well done and gives you a good insight in 19th century warfare The acting is terrific, Berenger gives his best performance ever as general James Longstreet, Martin Sheen is very good as Robert E. Lee, both of the displays the mens character and personality. Jeff Daniels also gives a great performance as Joshua Chamberlain, and a good portrait of his idealism, and how that idealism helped turn the tide of the entire war. Every performer in this film makes a good job, maybe C.

Of course, all this would not have been made possible without the fabulous actors. Tom Berenger as James Longstreet, Martin Sheen as General Robert E.

","Gettysburg, based on the best-seller ""The Killer Angels"", is certainly one of the better war flicks I've seen. Despite some of the dialogue being fictional, the historical context of the movie is quite good...To have filmed the movie on the actual battlefield was wonderful, and kudos to the Civil War re-enactors who devoted their time to make this such a grand epic. I especially liked how the movie concentrated on several ""unsung"" heroes such as John Buford and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who went on to become one of the great generals of the war, and whom General Grant picked over all other generals to be with him at Lee's surrender at Appomattox....But there were a few problems with the movie. I had problems looking at many of the corpulent reenactors, knowing that the months of marching and being on lean rations would have made for a much thinner army. Also; Martin Sheen as Gen. Bobby Lee...Everything I have read about Robert E. Lee tells of him as a tall, handsome man; quite dominating, and a commanding presence.. Sheen merely comes across as dumpy and wimpy.However, all in all...these were only minor distractions in an otherwise excellent movie on the Civil War."

","""Gettysburg"" is certainly an impressive achievement, given the complexity of the storyline and the sheer logistics involved. Having accomplished so much, its ""might have beens"" take on added significance. The long speeches seldom ring true; the bloodless, comic book battle scenes trivialize incredible bravery in the face of overwhelming carnage. And the ""lean, mean fighting machine"" that was the Army of Northern Virginia is largely, and I do mean largely, composed of overage, overweight extras. Yes, I know re-enactors eat well--but couldn't the more obvious examples have been hidden deep in the ranks? Four minutes into the movie, I winced as reality was shattered by a grossly corpulent picket--how tough would it have been to cast a more believable actor in a simple, inexpensive ""day-player"" role? With all respect to the dedication and perseverance of the director, who fought to get this important picture made, it's not surprising that we've haven't seen more of Mr. Maxwell on the Big Screen. The whole thing was a bit ham handed--I often felt like I was watching a tableau, with sweeping dolly shots and woodenly staged foreground and background action. I didn't buy the carefully placed ""artillery"" pyrotechnics, rather benign white puffs of smoke eliciting not so much as a flinch from men 10 feet away (during dialogue scenes) while decimating entire ranks during battle scenes. None of this would matter so much if the picture hadn't been so powerful and rife with potential--a simply brilliant performance by Jeff Daniels, and solid support by Richard Jordan, Sam Elliott, and Tom Berenger. Heck, even Martin Sheen was fairly watchable, despite my initial incredulity at his casting. I wish more of the dialogue had played as ""thoughts,"" in the style of the book upon which the movie was based. It would have cut down on the monologues. If only, if only...nonetheless, a very worthwhile experience. Kudos for the effort."

","Amazing, engrossing.  Never has a movie so long seemed to go by so quickly (for some).  Very few epics like this are released theatrically these days, especially one that is four-plus hours like Gettysburg.  Great movie, but has some difficulty balancing its impartial treatment of both the Union and Confederate causes.  Martin Sheen makes a stocky Robert E. Lee, and Tom Berenger's Longstreet is a bit false, but both actors do well with these pivotal roles, as do Jeff Daniels and Sam Elliot on the Union side of this drama.  The amazing, large-scale battle scenes and fascinating exploration of motives might bore today's modern audience, though, who have become used to having their historical movies served up as bloody spectacles in the Braveheart tradition or fictional farce like James Cameron's Titanic."

","Hi - I just rented this the other day. And I must say without reservations that this is one of the worst war movies ever made. I thought that with Ted Turner's backing that something halfway decent would result out of this production, but I'm sorry to say it didn't. I majored in the Cinema at the University of Maryland in 1986. I am also a military history buff, and I have seen 100s of war movies in my 42 short years on this planet. I try to see as many good ones as possible, because I have a life and don't want to waste time. I can't even believe my eyes when people put this in their top-10 list, any top-10 list!! 'Best Civil War' movie yet?!! Did anyone of you see 'Glory'?!!! 'Glory' is far superior drama to this film. In fact, any scene from ""Glory"" is infinitely better than any scene in this film. God, I had to turn off 'Gettysburg' after a few scenes. A lot of scenes are simply pedantic, and they assume that all the viewers are history morons who don't know jack about the battle. In terms of drama, or lack thereof, let's all remember the scene where Colonel Chamberlain (one of the pivotal figures in the Civil War), takes on those rag-tag, near deserters near the beginning. Where is the drama?! Where is the conflict? The film is simply rampant with a lot of melodramatic scenes such as this. Most of the battle scenes look like they were made by high-school film crew; they lack any suspense, build-up, and suffer from awful direction and editing. The acting is so-so, but these talented actors were burdened with such a mediocre script. If you want to study an excellent war movie script, just download 'Saving Private Ryan'... Again, there is more depth in one scene of that film than this entire movie. The only thing this film has going for it is A) Talented actors and B) Half-way decent production values."

","For a full decade or so I was what you'd call a ""Civil War Buff."" I formally and informally studied the 5-year ultra-bloody engagement. I've been to Antietam in Northern Maryland, the bloodiest single day of the war, Vicksburg, Mississippi, and, of course, Gettysburg (amongst other less significant sites). When I was at Antietam one of the eye-witness quotes was: ""Bodies filled the entire field with every imaginable wound."" I was so overwhelmed tears flowed from my eyes.<br/><br/>Why do I bring all this up? I just want you to know how INTO the Civil War I was (and still am, to a lesser degree), not just on an intellectual level, but an emotional one as well.<br/><br/>So in December 1993 my then-fiancÃ© and I went to the theater to see the over-four-hour-long ""Gettysburg"" with much interest. All I can say is it was VERY DIFFICULT to sit through this entire film in one sitting.<br/><br/>""Gettysburg"" has a lot going for it: an all-star cast, including Tom Berenger (Longstreat), Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain) and Sam Elliott (Buford); great authentic Gettysburg locations; good battle scenes; a commitment to historical accuracy; and thousands upon thousands of Civil War reenactors.<br/><br/>The subjects of the Civil War and Gettysburg are immensely interesting. You would think, therefore, that ""Gettysburg"" would be overflowing with life, but that's hardly the case. It takes FOREVER for things to get going. Plus there's an undeniably lazy and unexciting feel to the settings and dialogue when the forces aren't actually fighting. One has to REALLY CONCENTRATE to listen to and get through the interminable dialogue. Plus the mawkish melodrama factor is high.<br/><br/>Part I is highlighted by Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top and his mad bayonet charge while Part II ends with the South's infamous Pickett's Charge. Both of these sequences are great and they give the viewer a good feel of what it must have really been like, which is one of the reasons I enjoy seeing historical films.<br/><br/>The score is only half good. You'll definitely hear spots of brilliance but way too often it's sickeningly ultra-""heroic"" or melodramatic.<br/><br/>One aspect I liked was seeing the officers and soldiers pray while standing in line right before significant engagements. Yeah, it's hard to be an atheist when you're about to walk straight into friggin' cannon fire.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: There's a lot to respect about ""Gettysburg."" It's a story about war and the men who engage in it, pure and simple. There's no female cast members, no forced romances. Unfortunately it's bloated, melodramatic and just plain lazy. Trust me, the REAL Gettysburg battle was anything BUT lazy and uninteresting. Still, if I concentrate hard to pay attention to the dialogue and non-action events in the film, I get a lot out of it. In other words, if you're braced for its shortcomings it's worth owning or renting. I'm glad I own it. But don't expect something great like, say, ""Glory."" <br/><br/>The battle of Gettysburg took place July 1-3, 1863 and was a huge victory for the North, the turning point of the war, in fact (along with Grant's simultaneous siege of Vicksburg). After the failure of Pickett's Charge, General Lee and his troops retreated back to their own territory. The war would go on for another two long years (almost) as the Confederates continued to put up an incredible and courageous fight, but the odds were against them. Gettysburg and Vicksburg were the seeds of their impending doom.<br/><br/>General Meade congratulated his men for driving the Confederate invaders from the North's turf. But President Lincoln was upset because he wanted Meade to DESTROY Lee's army, not allow them to safely retreat back to their Southern sanctuary. Lincoln groaned: "" 'Drive the invader from our soil'? My God! is that all?"" <br/><br/>Four months after the battle of Gettysburg, on November 19th, Lincoln came to the small town and gave his potent 'Gettysburg Address' to honor the fallen soldiers and motivate continued Northern commitment and victory. So many people died at Gettysburg they were STILL burying the dead (!!).<br/><br/>GRADE: C"

","The film that was supposed to serve as a jump-board for producer Ted Turner to make the very large leap from television production to the silver screen, ""Gettysburg"" ends up becoming a trial of a film to sit through. It is a legitimate kidney buster/sleeping pill as the film runs over 250 minutes (not a misprint). The title says it all as the Battle of Gettysburg is the focus to bring a wide range of characters together from the Union and the Confederacy back in the summer of 1863. Most definitely the most famous battle of the U.S. Civil War was Gettysburg. That is why this movie is such a large disappointment. Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger and Stephen Lang (playing a different role from ""Gods and Generals"") are the key performers from the Confederacy's perspective while Jeff Daniels, Sam Elliott and C. Thomas Howell dominate the action on the North's side. Writer-director Ronald F. Maxwell shows his shortcomings as a film-maker here as he tries to make an epic ala David Lean and ends up landing flat on his face. The production values are not as high as they should be and everything has that television mini-series feel to it. The actors struggle through with corn-filled dialogue and interminable battle sequences that looked rushed and un-choreographed. More dull than being in a sorry teacher's history class, ""Gettysburg"" shows some of the worst things the cinema has to offer. It is an under-achieving dud of epic proportions. Would be followed by equally dim-witted prequel ""Gods and Generals"" 10 years later in 2003. 2 stars out of 5."

","Once again, Hollywood has taken an actual  historical event and tried to improve on it. To its credit, this is one of the most beautifully shot and scored films you are likely to see.  But the makers of Gettysburg were not about to let this film be confused with the facts. Jeff Daniels  makes an impassioned speech that the actual Joshua Chamberlain never made. It's not even a good speech. He says that his men form an army like no other army in history...an army fighting for an idea. This would come as an enormous surprise to members of the Continental Army of the American Revolution who also fought for an idea.  General James Longstreet continually argues with Robert E. Lee about which strategy to adopt. Longstreet did favor a different stategy, but there is no evidence to support the fact that he didn't accept Lee's plan. He is shown so wracked with doubt that he can't give the order for Pickett's charge. Witnesses say Longstreet was overcome by emotion, not doubt. He states in one scene, ""I don't think about the cause much anymore,"" while the Federal soldiers are depicted as being swept up in some kind of noble cause. In actual fact, by 1863, the north was so sick of the war there was strong sentiment to just allow the Confederacy to leave the Union without further violence. But with the exception of a few men from Maine who are unhappy with their enlistment deal, the Union soliders are depicted as a happy lot on a holy crusade. The death of Stonewall Jackson just two months prior to Gettysburg gets no treatment in this film. If there is one single historical event that altered the outcome of the battle it was Jackson's death at Chancellorsville...something that is completely overlooked. Lee is depicted as a starry-eyed old man; George Meade, the Union commander barely puts in an appearance; John Bell Hood whines his way through the film; JEB Stuart's absence is never accurately explained-you're left to believe he was out joyriding; Corps Commander Hancock utters such ridiculous statements under fire as, ""There are times when a corps commander's life doesn't count;"" General Armistead is a blubbering, sentimental old fool; Chamberlain is almost comic in his stammering attempts at conversation. George Pickett is a fopish baffoon, and on and on and on. It's a wonder the war went on as long as it did with such a collection of officers. Revisionist history at its worst. Skip it."

"hall895","7","1","2","27 May 2013"," Epic battle, epic film
","At well over four hours in length it is easy to criticize Gettysburg as being too long a film. Yes, there are some pieces here and there which could have been cut to provide a more reasonable running time. But you also realize that there was so much more which could have been put into the film. Even with its exorbitant length it can be said the film only begins to scratch the surface of the epic Battle of Gettysburg. The film focuses on a few key events in the sprawling three day battle, most famously and effectively the second day attack on Little Round Top and the final day's climactic Pickett's Charge. Even at four hours-plus there is no room for some critically important elements of the battle. Really each of the battle's three days could have been its own movie which is probably why the film was first conceived as a miniseries. Once the decision was made to make it a theatrical release a delicate balance was necessary. Make it long enough to fit everything in but not so long that nobody will want to sit through it. There may be some minor quibbles with how that balance was ultimately achieved but by and large the story of this great battle is presented about as well as you could have hoped.<br/><br/>The film takes a little while setting itself up, providing historical background and letting viewers know the stakes as Union and Confederate troops converged on Gettysburg. Given how long the film would ultimately end up running it probably could have gotten to the start of the actual battle a little quicker. But once the first shots are fired the film has you in its grip and holds you there throughout. The battle's first day, both in history and in this film, is somewhat overshadowed by the more famous events of the following two days. But day one has its own stories to tell and those stories are presented very well here. The key figure of the day is Union Brigadier General John Buford, portrayed wonderfully by Sam Elliott. Buford's troops hold their key position, setting the stage for the incredibly dramatic events to come.<br/><br/>The star of day two is Colonel Joshua Chamberlain whose 20th Maine regiment leads the famous Union defense of Little Round Top. The film has taken the time to allow us to get to know Chamberlain. This makes it all the more compelling when he leads his men into battle. Jeff Daniels does a truly amazing job in portraying this heroic man. The repeated Confederate assaults on Little Round Top and the response of Chamberlain and his men combine to provide one of the best battle scenes ever filmed. It is more than just the high point of this film, it is as good as anything you will ever see in any war film.<br/><br/>It takes something truly spectacular to follow up Little Round Top. Day three at Gettysburg brought us Pickett's Charge. Perhaps the true drama here comes before the charge begins. Lieutenant General James Longstreet knows the charge cannot succeed, the attack is hopeless. But he has his orders. The anguish on his face as he gives the order to proceed tells it all. He knows he is ordering men to certain death. Tom Berenger captures Longstreet's pain beautifully, the man unable to even verbalize the order to attack. A simple, woeful nod of the head sends men to their doom. The attack may have been folly but the bravery of the men who performed it was amazing and the film's portrayal of their march toward aptly-named Cemetery Ridge does the men justice. Another brilliant battle scene to bring the film to a close.<br/><br/>Most war films try to invest you in the personal stories of a few combatants to ensure you feel an emotional tie to them as they face great peril. This film has so much ground to cover there is not much time for that sort of thing. We get to know Chamberlain a bit and there is something made of the prewar friendship between Confederate General Armistead and Union General Hancock. Richard Jordan plays Armistead and gives a wonderful speech reminding you of the human stories behind the slaughter in Gettysburg's fields. But there are few of these personal moments. The scale of the battle, and thus of the film, is just too big. The film by and large has to focus on the fighting itself rather than those doing the fighting. There are a few occasions where the film steps away from the fighting in which the film starts to drag a bit. But no film this long was ever going to be without a few slower moments. The film has more than enough big moments to make up for any lulls. It has wonderful performances as well. Daniels, as Chamberlain, is the standout but the likes of Berenger, Jordan and Elliott all have their moments as does Stephen Lang as Pickett. And of course the most famous figure at Gettysburg was Robert E. Lee and Martin Sheen, seemingly an odd choice for the part, does well in the role. It was a literal cast of thousands and every man played his part. They all combined to bring history alive in an epic film about three of America's most epic days."

While we all know that Chamberlain was no soldier to begin with, he rises to the occasion and was instrumental in helping to secure Little Round Top, and subsequently the town of Gettysburg. By managing to repel the Confederate forces, Chamberlain and the men he commanded should be praised for what they did.<br/><br/>Go to Gettysburg.

The depiction of events during and before the pivotal battle of Gettysburg is wonderfully directed by Ron Maxwell, who uses sweeping panoramas to create an impressive and large scale picture that allows an audience to attempt to discover what the battle was actually like. It is the stars however, (Tom Berenger, Martin Sheen and Jeff Daniels) who make the movie what it is. In particular, Daniels, who delivers a convincing performance as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, masterfully delivers one of the best monologues I have ever seen in cinema. Also worthy of note is a very underused performance from Brian Mallon as Winfield Scott Hancock, a sadly little used character, despite capturing perfectly the nature of this legendary general. A final note is the soundtrack, which sounds very stirring and grand, helping to create a very heroic atmosphere for the movie and the central characters. <br/><br/>In conclusion, a fabulous movie, with good actors and impressive directing.

There are tons of speeches to explain cause and character, but it all becomes too ponderous and portentous, and will not look deeply enough into the soul of America. The South were not to blame because they fought for State's rights, and the North was not to blame because they belatedly were fighting to free the slaves and enforce a union. So who was to blame? The acting is stiff - these are American heroes, so no-one can look bad (the recent TV series 'John Adams' managed it). The battle scenes aren't bad, but it looks too much like a re-enactment - no body parts flying around and disintegrating so again the impact of death and war is softened. A great pity - good intentions and an opportunity to absolve the South drift away into lengthy stilted set pieces. And what About general Meade who barely merits an appearance? Ah well!"

","...but not a bad epic. Nowhere near as good as Glory,but what was? The strength of this movie was the use of the actual battlefield and neighboring areas,rather than use a Hollywood back lot or some such. Another strength was the accuracy in casting actors who look like the characters they were portraying, even under a beard, and not the ""close enough"" approach some historical films take. There was also a lot of great acting here-Martin Sheen as Robert E.Lee was superb,and Kevin Conway as Kilraen stole most of his scenes(even his lifting of ""colonel,darling"" from Victor McLaughlin was spot-on.) Sam Elliott makes the most of his limited screen time as Buford and Richard Jordan as General Armistead is a picture of professionalism,doing his job while he knew he was dying. The worst acting had to go to Stephen Lang as Pickett-his pompous,sissified portrayal,tho not too far off the real Pickett,had me laughing. Kudos to all the volunteer reenactors,who labored,without pay or credit,who came at their own expense to be in this movie. I'd give this a 7.5/10"

","The center third of what was to be a trilogy of movies based on a series of Civil War books, this one is awe inspiring. I am not a Civil War buff, my area of historical expertise is more in early medieval history. But I was astounded and overwhelmed by this beautiful and tragic story of the greatest battle of the War Between the States, where the future of the nation was turned once and for all. <br/><br/>A better cast could not be picked. Martin Sheen made you understand the love that the army of the South had for Robert E. Lee, whom even the north honored as a gentleman and a great soldier. Tom Barringer as Longstreetin his finest role to date, as was Stephen Lang as Picket. Jeff Daniels was marvelous as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and C. Thomas Howell as his brother. Kevin Conway was very believable as the crusty old Irish Sgt Buster. Sam Eliot as Buford gives a powerful performance, and Richard Jordan a poignant place as Armistead (he died very shortly after filming tragically)There are too many others to name as well, but the story is what holds here.<br/><br/>I especially liked the opening narration of Morgan Shepherd which sets the tone of the film. Finally, the music sound score of Randy Edelman is a brilliant counterpoint to the action on the screen. This film should be required viewing by American History classes."

","I bought the Gettysburg DVD because I am a Martin Sheen fan, but almost forgot about watching him, as the whole film was such an amazing depiction of Gettysburg. In fact Sheen's performance was a little disappointing; while I could appreciate the dignity and humility that he portrayed as Lee, I felt he lacked Lee's strength and charisma - but I did like his accent, and felt that he did look like Lee. His finest moments were receiving the cheers of the men before Pickett's charge, which was a very moving scene, and then his anguish after the failure of the attack when he said 'It's all my fault.' <br/><br/>However, for me it was Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain who was the most memorable character. He was totally believable as the college professor turned colonel, and all his emotions were there on his face. The battle at Little Round Top was awesome with the bayonet charge. <br/><br/>Longstreet's beard was a real distraction but Tom Berenger faithfully played the part of Lee's most trusted general, and the discussions between him and Lee about tactics were extremely well done. <br/><br/>Richard Jordan as Armistead reduced me to tears when he talked about his friendship with Hancock - two friends on different sides, fighting against each other, a situation that was replicated by many in this war. <br/><br/>Stephen Lang as George Pickett was exuberant and enthusiastic, which made the final scene with him even more emotional when he told Lee 'I have no Division.' <br/><br/>The 3rd day battle scenes were absolutely superb and looked very authentic.<br/><br/>Once I had seen the film, I definitely wanted to know more about Gettysburg - I have already ordered two books about the battle. This maybe is the best recommendation I can give for this film, it really makes you want to know more."

","What I really like about this movie is the way it demonstrates how warfare was in those days..the importance of the grounds, the formation of troops, and the general strategies. In particular how communications and intelligence played a role. No radar, no phones, no re-con planes. How would you handle a 80 000 man army grouped together for a single battle? <br/><br/>One of the longest movies ever made with 261 minutes, don't expect it to be all out action and entertaining. There are a few scenes that are way too long with dialog that stresses the point that many of the soldiers on both sides felt the war was wrong since they all were Americans, and many knew each others. I don't mind that the movie is true to the figure of speech of the time, but sometimes the dialog and acting is just too theatrical, though most of the actors are credible.<br/><br/>I got bored on a few occasions, but altogether I think this may be the movie that shows the strategical aspects of the civil war best, as well as how the conflicting parts felt about the war."

","When i first saw Gods and Generals, i saw the style of presentation that the creators of these movies were trying to communicate. Though Gods and Generals had its flaws, it was a great demonstration of history. Craving more, i decided to rent Gettysburg and watch it. After enduring four hours, it was clear that Gods and Generals was pale compared to the masterpiece that preceded it. Gettysburg digs deep into the historical background involving the largest and bloodiest engagement ever to take place in the Western Hemisphere. As a pivotal moment in one of the most influential wars in history, the event would be something that could not be tampered with. It should have been something that was never changed from the real fact. This movie did a magnificent job with keeping to the real story though adding lines that may very well have been spoken in similar forms. The large scale battle sequences demonstrated the massive efforts and actions that formed this great battle. The speech of the time was well printed into the dialogue, the music score that accompanied the epic scenes was adequate and superb, the historical accuracy of the event was remarkable, from the uniforms to the tactics, from the weapons to the actual positions on the field. I have to give the makers of this move credit. The thousands of re-enactors who possessed a great passion for history came together with Hollywood and actually made something worthwhile. While the gore is underdone, the pros greatly outweigh the cons. The length of this movie should not interfere with people perception of its quality unless they do not respect history; in which case they should not be watching it. The acting by all actors fed this masterpiece and the outcome was tremendous. Gettysburg should be seen as the greatest epic of the civil war; one that represents war, and the times as they were. Truly a remarkable achievement in terms of war films."

The most heartbreaking scene of the entire film, next to the actual brutal charge of General Pickett, was when General Hancock rides out amidst the cannon fire to see if he can spot his dear friend General Armistead. I am proud to share the same name as Ted Turner. He made a true masterpiece with this film, and should be very proud. I was sorry to see him get shot however in the final few scenes of the film.

","for a war that was supposed to be fought over slavery , this movie presents a paradox .. only one black person is presented . I was impressed with Martin Sheen's performance as General Lee , and Berenger's role as General Longstreet.  Porter Alexander's role as General JEB Stuart should had been deleted or presented differently. The film falls short in allowing the viewers not to gage the full discomfort and disgust felt by General John Bell Hood in protesting Lee's orders not to be permitted to attack the federals behind Little and Big Round Top mountains.  Also missed is the importance of union general Reynolds, as the last general invited to become the next federal commander instead of being ordered to become its commander like was done with Meade. The largest cavalry clash up to this moment in time between Stuart and Custer was completely overlooked and not even mentioned as well.  Its impossible to be able to present all aspects of this battle of course, but I felt it would had only added a few more lines to the script and minutes to the film to acknowledged these events.  All in all the best civil war military film I think ever made.  Much better than ""Gods and Generals"" which followed ten years later (2003)."
"floridawar","Null","1","2","2 August 2002"," Epic TV does not translate to the big screen
","Gettysburg was an ambitious project to say the least, but the finished product lacks depth (replaced by length) and fails to break free of the fictional constraints imposed by the novel the screenplay was adapted from. This was an epic television production which is sadly lacking as a theatrical release.  The cinematography fails to create tension so much as tedium (I think Pickett's charge could have been filmed better, with less overhead shots,  showing the flank etc. It has the effect of minimalizing the movement. Also, only ONE scene, filmed from in front of the troops, gives the effect of a rolling mass, a juggernaut closing ranks as its torn by shell) It may be fine for the constraints of the small screen, but just wasn't as effective on the big one.  Regardless, as a TV movie it stands head and shoulders above the majority, and Ron Maxwells' ambition has been proven correct by the wide popular acceptance of his film, despite its gaping cinematic and historical errors. The biggest drawback to this flick is its source material.  Its screenplay was adapted from ""the Killer Angels.""  While this novel has been lauded as a great work, it is in the end only FICTION.  It suffers most from creating caricatures rather than characters.  Author Shaara linked a series of historical anecdotes to a bunch of necessarily inaccurate personal ""thumbnail"" sketches, Oh yeah, and a big battle, and POOF: instand Drama! The movie suffers from adopting too many of these 2-D paperback personas: Sullen Longstreet, Otherworldly Lee, Wildcat Pickett, Gentle Poet Warrior Chamberlain etc.  Again, caricatures rather than characters, although many of the talented actors at work do give life to the lies.  Add the overtly simplistic, and outrageously lengthy dialogues and the roar of our greatest battle becomes a tragic groan! I just have the feeling Maxwell could have conveyed some of the inner turmoil through a few well done closeups, body language, you know, ACTING; but he had to fill time to make this a MINI-SERIES, and the end result is just that.  Gettysburg; the TV Show. In closing, I would like to say that despite my criticisms I appreciate the efforts made to make this film. I even enjoy watching it now and again, well, only the action scenes anyway (I grew bored with the FICTIONAL dialogues and scenes: when will they learn truth IS more intiresting than fiction in historical films?)  Sure most of the reenactors are too old, but they are the ones with enough free time to participate in such projects.  I also appreciate the dedication of Ron Maxwell and others to tell this story, even if it isn't truthful as history."

Many notables, including Jeff Daniels and Tom Berenger.  But I was most moved by Richard Jordan as Gen. Armistead.

"tarali_wannabe","Null","1","2","13 May 2000"," An excellent movie and teaching skill-that's hard to find.
","I have recently seen the move ""Gettysburg"" in my Social Studies class (I'm in the 8th grade).  We have also just studied the Civil War. Unlike most people in my class, I actually liked it!  I have found a few things that I thought could have been improved.  For the most part, though, I thought that this was a great movie that was made very well.  As you will probably see, this was originally an assignment for my class, but hopefully it sounds okay.  Because, hey, I did get an A on it!<br/><br/>One of the many things that I found as a good feature of ""Gettysburg"" was the people who portrayed the historical people and the people who were responsible for putting the movie together.  Instead of just showing the facts, the actors made the characters seem more alive in our time.  The actors and the writers or directors expanded the essential information to a thorough presentation, not skipping little things.  This helped to me to better understand events that occurred during the Battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War in general.  An example of this is the way they had to fight. At Gettysburg, battles went on in open fields and in wooded areas.  Both of these places must have been very difficult to fight in.  Also, they had single-shot riffles that they had to take time to reload in-between shots. This film also helped me to understand exactly what went on during the Battle of Little Round Top, Pickett's Charge, and many other things including what happened when they weren't in a battle.<br/><br/>Another reason why I thought that this was a great film was because I found it very interesting.  ""Gettysburg"" was based on a book called The Killer Angels.  About this book, the author, Michael Shaara, said that he used the words of the men in the battle to write the book.  He said that he wrote a lot through their letters and other documents.  This makes the movie a bit inaccurate, as another review suggested.  It does, however, let the viewer get closer to the characters, unlike a documentary, which only gives pure facts.  Although they did not only give facts, the movie was MOSTLY accurate.  For example, there is a story that says the Confederate and Union armies went to Gettysburg because there were many shoes there.  This is a rumor.  I also thought that this was interesting because it was very detailed.  Much of this was shown throughout the movie including the backgrounds.  Some of this included scenes at the hospitals and at their camps.  At the hospitals, it showed that many of the soldiers had to have a limb cut off.  At their camps, it showed things that went on including people playing violins and banjos.<br/><br/>Another reason why I found that this was a good film was that it was not at all biased, like a number of war movies are.  It did not take sides of the North or the South.  The movie didn't show something from just one person or one side's perspective.  It showed viewpoints of men of both armies, the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac.  Because of this, the viewer got to see what happened to both sides at Gettysburg.<br/><br/>""Gettysburg"" also has a different approach to the subject of how slavery was involved with the Civil War.  It acknowledged that slavery was not the reason why the war had started.  This is said in many other films as well.  However, there is something that those other films don't say which ""Gettysburg"" does.  It says that even if slavery was not the cause of the Civil War, the issue was very important to the North and was a reason that many of the soldiers volunteered to fight in the war.<br/><br/>As you can see, for the most part I see this as an excellent and interesting movie.  However, I have found a few minor reasons why I believe that it could have been slightly improved.  One of these reasons is that it was hard for me to keep track of who was playing who.  Even though it showed the actor and the character he portrays at the beginning, I don't remember seeing who the characters' name were; I can only remember seeing the actors' names.  I believe that they should have put the characters' names as well, which would have made it less confusing.<br/><br/>Another thing that I think could have been improved was the fact that the showed many different battle scenes, yet they focused on a few and squeezed some others in.  It did not seem like a good balance.  It also confused me when they talked about those squeezed in scenes; I was not sure exactly what they were talking about.<br/><br/>In summary, I believe that this was a wonderful film and had a lot of hard work put into it, by both the actors and people behind the camera.  I found a few minor faults, but nothing too big.  I enjoyed this film especially because it was very interesting.  It was also very accurate and detailed."

Gettysburg had way too much story. The battle focuses on every character. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I've studied the battle itself and every commander made a difference. Was it necessary though to add a speech for every character? It seemed to me the diector wanted each hero to be glorified, and there were alot to begin with. The movie doesn't focus on the Union, nor the Confederates, it does to both. Having both, the movie breaks down and focuses on each and every general to the lieutnenants. Why so much? If the movie focused on a group of characters, a piece of the battle, it would have scored higher for me. There was just too much, too much talk, and too much of the battle altogether that nearly made me fall asleep.<br/><br/>
Gettysburg isn't a great documentary. If it were broken down to a made for television series, then it would have been enjoyable.  Otherwise, I found it too long and it didn't keep my interest for too long."

Both are problematic films that do not quite fit the mold.<br/><br/>I saw this turkey in one of the big old palace theaters in Montreal on the day it was released. I managed (somehow) to sit through its three hour running time. The three things that raised my ire were: First the unabashed rah-rah patriotism. It makes me sick. It brings up all my worst American bashing instincts. I remember thinking at the time, here is a people who are priming themselves for another war.<br/><br/>The long theatrical speeches. This has been discussed at length by others.<br/><br/>BUT WORSE were the pointless battle scenes. The heart of any war film are the battle scenes. All the great war films have some kind of aesthetic point of view. What made the Peter Jackson Lord Of The Rings movies so effective were that you are there with the characters on the battlefield. Scared. Cold. Sad. Blood mad. No matter what the emotion, you are there with the protagonists, feeling it.<br/><br/>I began by mentioning Is Paris Burning? As disjointed as that film was, Rene Clement was smart enough to make each little vignette in his film about something. About crossing streets under sniper fire to get to a building. About an exchange of fire between a Sherman tank and a more heavily armed Panzer. About a man returning home after two years and rolling past his house without stopping.<br/><br/>In Gettysburg the battle scenes are about re-creators running across fields. Thousands of them. With the camera placed in just the most boring spot."

","I never thought I'd say anything bad about Martin Sheen. After all, I think he's very good in the TV series ""West Wing,"" and in many other efforts. But, here it comes: I'm afraid Martin Sheen had me actually physically wincing at his monumentally unsuccessful effort to portray Gen. Robert E. Lee in ""Gettysburg"". Sheen's acting was not good at all; I, for one, call it downright bad. His pseudo-southern accent was atrocious; worse, his out-of-place high-pitched, piping voice made a caricatured mockery of one of the world's greatest military figures. Ironically, all the other actors were just fine! I think craggy, gentlemanly Shelby Foote, the historian (not an actor), with a fine, low voice and truly beautiful southern accent, would have made a much better R. E. Lee portrayer! (edited later: I was quite sorry to see that Shelby Foote had died on 27 June, 2005.)<br/><br/>""Gettysburg"" depicted battle scenes in quite convincing ways, not at all like the History-Channel-fake-slow-motion-substituting-for-good-cinematography method so often seen in similar flicks. That it was filmed in the Gettysburg National Military Park, on the actual battlegrounds, is a real plus. However, I was very disappointed to see at least one visual clip (of a Union Artilleryman next to a firing cannon) shown at least _three_ times; the first repeat was a bit of a sad surprise; the second made me quite angry at such a cheap, totally unnecessary cinematic trick used to ""flesh out"" the movie. Come On, Mr. Editor! Jeeeeesch!<br/><br/>The character-developing dramatic plots were fair, although they tended to go overboard at times, obviously to jerk tears from the audience. The music ranges from good to embarrassingly tear-jerking... in lock-step accompaniment with the drama; at least they got that coordination ""right""!<br/><br/>I made a sad mistake in buying the ""Gettysburg"" DVD from a cut-out bin for $10; half that price may have been about right. I'll still use it to glean interesting history from the overlying drama. Although I have only a moderate knowledge of some Civil War battles (albeit not Gettysburg), as far as I have seen the historical facts in ""Gettysburg"" are interestingly portrayed and accurate.<br/><br/>Everything about the movie was at least adequate, except for Sheen's role in it; that was so bad it almost ruins ""Gettysburg"" entirely for me..."

Pile on a musical tract that has one theme endlessly replayed for both sides, overacting by most of the cast and, frankly, a lousy script that is rife with numerous clumsy attempts to make historical references and discuss the slavery issue as if it were a current topic still up for discussion makes this film a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen is miscast as Lee, his subordinates salute so often it becomes an annoyance. There is little discussion in the Union General staff of overall strategy but an over emphasis of Confederate tactics and strategies that ultimately fail.<br/><br/>The film has a decidedly southern point of view and almost implies that the Confederate cause was actually justified."
"mendy66","4","2","9","22 October 2006"," Good drama but appalling history
","Gettysburg perpetuates many popular misconceptions of the Civil War. Despite the Chamberlain's noble speechifying in the movie, for example, the North fought the war first and foremost to preserve the union. Ending slavery was a minor concern, especially since most northerners had no more interest in freeing salves than most southerners. The popular perception of the South as fighting the war in a noble, but impossible battle to retain their independence, freedom and traditions is pure revisionist history. After the war, the southern elite rewrote history to make disguise their real motivation, maintenance of slavery, which they knew would not sell well, especially overseas. These ""lost cause writers"" made up this nonsense about freedom from central government, etc. No, the South's one and only goal for fighting the war was slavery.<br/><br/>The other major fiction perpetuated by the movie is that the fate of war hung in the balance at Gettsyburg. This is more nonsense. If the north had lost, there would have been no ""clear road to Washington"" because the Union army would simply have pulled back and set up a new defensive line. The South didn't even see the battle as a major defeat at the time. The war went on another 2 years and the South, in fact, came closest to winning in summer 1864, a year later. Despite the blather in the movie, Gettysburg was no more significant that many other Civil War battles. The ""lost cause writers"" elevated the battle to unwarranted significance because they could pinpoint their loss to a specific battle and specific villain - Longstreet, who oddly shows up as the main hero in the movie. By far, however, the strangest part of the movie was the portrayal of Longstreet, as the sagely Cassandra who sees the future but is ignored while and Lee shown as gentlemanly and kindly, but not really too bright. This is a complete reversal of the norm, where the ""lost cause writers"" vilify Longstreet for losing Gettysburg and by delaying his attack in a fit of pique when his advice was ignored while Lee was the brilliant, infallible military genius who could only be defeated by the incompetence of his subordinates Â– in this case Longstreet.<br/><br/>Apart from the poor history, the movie consists of three parts, reenactments of battles, dialog about strategy and dialog about the deep meaning of it all. The first two are fine, but the corny dialog that boils down to ""ain't it shame that two swell fellas like us have to fight it out"" is mind-numbingly sappy. They movie-makers are careful to airbrush the entire issue of slavery right out of the movie so as not to offend anyone. For example, the relationship between Armistead and Hancock is clearly meant to symbolize the relationship between the two sides, but borders on homo-eroticism. <br/><br/>In sum, enjoy all the battle scenes and laugh heartily at the ridiculous looking phony beards, but don't take the story any more seriously than you would Star Wars or the next Batman movie."

Despite a massive budget, some of the beards look ridiculously fake. And the dialogue is often very unnatural, thrown in to make a point. The speech where it is shown that many Confederate soldiers were the grandchildren of Revolutionary War patriots is very interesting, but it is extremely unlikely that any such conversation happened. Why would a general even know who a soldier's great-uncle was?

","After watching ""Gods and Generals,"" I was compelled to watch the second movie ""Gettysburg"". I was not disappointed. ""Gettysburg"" is the continuation of ""Gods and Generals"" and is yet another stirring epic of the War Between the States, commonly known as the Civil War. The actors did a wonderful job in their individual portrayals of the Generals and staff, very believable, and should be commended for their performances. The battle scenes were very intense and had you wanting to join in the battles for (whichever side you were on, of course). I had to buy my own copy and when my son came over, we watched it together. He enjoyed it immensely and borrowed my copy to show his father and expressed his desire of watching it again. This is a must see for an action film and a must own for Civil War history buffs. Gettysburg is one of the most dramatic and true to history films of the Civil War and will promote those interested in history to find out more about this time when American was in turmoil. I also highly recommend it for teachers in their use in their American history curriculum. It is my hope that Warner Bros. would complete the trilogy and produce, ""The Last Full Measure,"" to add to the scope of this excellent production of ""Gettysburg."""

","In later years, when Pickett was asked what caused the failure of his famous charge, he reportedly said, ""I always thought the Yankees had something to do with it"". Perhaps an apocryphal story but a great line anyway.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, I rented Gettysburg and re-watched it after more than ten years since my initial viewing. I still think Martin Sheen was a poor casting choice for the role of Robert E. Lee but, all-in-all, it's a movie well worth watching just for the battlefield scenes. Buford's initial engagement, the defense of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge will never again be filmed with such scope and authenticity.<br/><br/>The historicity seems to be very good with a couple of exceptions, the main one being that Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine took no part in the defense of Cemetery Ridge and weren't present in that area of the battlefield. The scenes showing Chamberlain ducking the artillery shells are both specious and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Other complaints and quibbles:<br/><br/>The musical score is far too dramatically dominant and often drowns out the dialog; particularly in the battle preparation and execution scenes. Pickett's charge is made to seem glorious rather than misguided and futile.<br/><br/>The poor makeup job with the facial hair is very distracting -- especially with regard to Longstreet/Berenger in close ups.<br/><br/>Buford's mounted infantry men were mainly armed with breech-loading carbines, not the muzzle loading rifle-muskets shown. That was a principal factor in their ability to increase volume of fire, to delay and thwart the initial Confederate plan and thus to alter the entire course of the battle. This isn't a big quibble but a noticeable omission in my view. If the Confederacy had been able to take and hold the high ground at Gettysburg, the Civil War might've lasted much longer and ended quite differently. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a good movie to watch and a ""must-see"" for civil war buffs."

","I continue to be amazed by two things: First, the sheer emotion I feel every time I have watched this movie. You would think after watching it 10-15 times, that it would begin to subside. It doesn't. This is one of the greatest movies ever produced. I can only imagine what the real battle was like, but, this re-creation gives me a much better idea of the passion and tragedy that must have engulfed those brave men who were there. Their bravery, valor, and sacrifice, was indeed heroic. Second, I'm amazed by how many people have not seen this movie. For starters, this movie should be required viewing by every high school student in the country. Maybe, they would appreciate this nation a little more, and the cost that has been paid by our ancestors to preserve our country.<br/><br/>The acting was very good in most every area. Richard Jordan gave his best performance as General Armistead. Tom Berenger was excellent as General Longstreet. Jeff Daniels was great as Col. Chamberlain. General Lee was an impossible task, but Martin Sheen did a good job portraying someone that is almost revered as God. There is almost no way to meet everyone expectations.<br/><br/>The music and photography were outstanding.<br/><br/>How this picture did not get an Oscar for something, is beyond me. Movies far worse than this have won awards in the past. The Motion Picture Academy must be brain-dead.<br/><br/>I recommend that everyone who has seen it, make sure their families and friends see it. It is well worth the time!!"
"DeeJsBabe","8","1","3","2 January 2006"," This is no Gods and Generals and Sheen is no Lee, much less...
","I still have to give this film an 8 out of 10 because of all it is to history, but.....<br/><br/>Martin Sheen had no business playing Robert E. Lee. Duvall and William Schallert did the role proud. Was Lee flawed? Yes, we all are. Could Lee's judgment have been so grossly in error? Yes, but I doubt it was so pathetic as Sheen portrayed him. Come on! Give me someone taller than a elf.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang is riveting, which may have spiritually trained him for his role as Stonewall Jackson in G&G. He reminds me of the old timers I met in Kentucky as a child: ever positive; ever intense, in a kind sort of way.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels took a little getting used to, only because I saw G&G first. He certainly looks the part. In this role he is quite a bit more believable than in G&G. <br/><br/>Turner's appearance is less of a pain in the butt here than his goofy smile in his other film. That said, praise God that someone cares about bringing these movies out. I'll forgive him his Hitchcock moments. <br/><br/>This movie, on the whole, took a little more getting into than Gods and Generals. However, it did suck you in. It did its job. It was a tale of the North, though. G&G gave our glorious South back some honour. It reminded us the meaning of living and dying in Dixie. <br/><br/>Frankly, give me Stephen Lang, Stonewall, and G&G all day long. Gettysburg makes good filler in between G&G and North and South viewings."

","As Gettysburg tries to be very accurate on what happened on the battlefield when you look at the formations, historic weaponry, correct uniforms etc. it utterly fails to show the psychological ""cracks"", the inconsistencies, the doubts that every participant in a war always has. Even when the men are exhausted and deadly wounded, there is always a general in this film with some heroic words that can keep the moral of the troops up. Under the utterly heroic tunes of the pathetic soundtrack you see thousands die, just to make a few hundred meters on some grassland hills. Nobody deserts, nobody goes crazy by the horrors. This is as glorifying as the Riefenstahl-Movies in the 30s.<br/><br/>This might work for civil war romantics, but as a propaganda movie its a bad one. Its at least two hours too long, badly edited, it has no tight rhythm and only alternates between overlong large battlefield scenes and heroic speeches on both sides.<br/><br/>So I think the only ones I would recommend this are film-buffs and historians, who are interested in how even badly made propaganda movies about the civil war get so much praise from their fans."
"jdbeatty","5","1","4","15 January 2003"," Mediocre movie based on a mediocre book
","Not all that compelling as a film, though it does give a sense of the South's desperation.  Shaara's book ""Killer Angels"" was somewhat compelling at the time for the narrative voice that he gave to characters that before had been wooden.  Eliott's and Daniel's performances are the only real shining points.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film is that its fascination is based on a historical myth: that Gettysburg was the most important battle of the war. With Vicksburg falling the day after, whatever happened at Gettysburg short of the destruction of the Army of the Potomac was quite irrelevant.  The Civil War was won and lost in the Western Theatre.<br/><br/>Confederacentrist myth-makers are happy to state that if Meade had lost, the Union would have sued for peace, and other such nonsense.<br/><br/>I won't even bother with ""Gods and Generals,"" written by this author's son, since the book was abomidable."

","Gettysburg was not very good. Why does everyone think it was so great? You may fancy yourself a student of the Civil War but don't surrender your objectivity and engage in sylogistic logic for the sake of self preservation and symmetry. I love the Civil War, ""Gettysburg"" is about the Civil War, Therfore I love ""Gettysburg""!!! That's idiotic logic. It is a weak film on so many levels. The least of which is it's length which so many people seem to focus on as their 'token' criticsicm. Civil War reenactors (who I'm sure love!!! this mediocre movie) are fat, old, and out of shape to have any credibility as Civil War soldiers. Sorry folks but that's the awful truth!!!! I'm sure the producers thought they were getting a great deal. No extras would need to be hired (and paid) no extensive wardrobe Dept. would be needed. These reenactors bring all of their own stuff. But they are a bunch of clumsy, grey-haired, lard butts!!! I've never seen grey-haired privates and corporals in period photos. Civil War soldiers were young men who were not so well fed. I won't even bring up their lack of acting skills and awful melodramatic death scenes. I'm sure most of these ended up on the editing room floor but unfortunatley a few found their way into the final movie. Cheese cheese cheese!!! Reenactors, contrary to what one might think, ruined this movie!!!! The studios reliance on them was a mistake. If you hire extras you can impliment some quality control over who you get, you can use good advisors to outfit and train them accordingly. If you get some good looking reenactors (which there are many) then fine, by all means use them!!!! but don't rely exclusivley on these fat clowns, which that hobby unfortunatly seems to attract. Additionaly the script was bad, the actors hardley gave inspired performances (except Jeff Daniels), the soundtrack was decent but poorley used and placed within the movie, awful editing, and battle scenes that were by no means frightening. I think John Wayne's ""The Alamo"" had more frightening battle scenes. Put aside your reverence for all things Civil War and admit it. ""Gettysburg"" is not a very good movie. Stop feeling so afraid to say so."
"rupie","5","1","4","8 July 1999"," a contrarian opinion
","The makers of 'Gettysburg' are to be commended for releasing it on video in 'letterbox' format to preserve the broad sweep of the cinematography as seen in the movie theatre, which is especially important in the battle scenes.<br/><br/>This is a looooooooooong movie (over 4 hours) and I wish I could say it didn't seem that long, but I can't (It took me 3 nights to get thru it, so maybe I missed the continuity that would come from a continuous viewing). I have mixed feelings about this movie, which I wanted and expected to rave over, but something about it is lacking. It never seems to rise above being a good documentary to the level of conveying in a fully involving way, emotionally and intellectually, the full historical significance of this seminal battle in a seminal war. One wonders what a David Lean would do with the subject.<br/><br/>Part of it was the score, which I found sadly lacking. This subject needs a John Williams and a full symphony orchestra; the producers settled for a synthesizer and a composer not up to the task. In many cases, I found the music inappropriate in mood for the particular scene, and the pacing of the score overall did nothing to build the dramatic tension. There were lapses in the accuracy of the speech patterns for the period (I don't think ""how ya doin'?"" was in currency as a greeting at that time). 'Meaning' is provided by the heavy-handed insertion of many dialogue scenes, so we have a disjointed effect of action-dialogue-action-etc. The script in the dialogue scenes is, overall heavy-handed and obvious.<br/><br/>Good acting all around, especially Sam Elliott as Gen. Buford and Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee. But the standout is Richard Jordan, who brings real emotional impact to his portrayal of Gen. Armistead (his death shortly after the movie was finished, gives an added poignancy to his portrayal).<br/><br/>No quibbling about the battle scenes, which are played by hundreds (thousands?) of history buffs from clubs which regularly recreate Civil War battles. In particular, Pickett's charge, the climactic point, is powerfully portrayed in all its horrible and tragic grandeur.<br/><br/>'Gettysburg', flawed as it is, is none the less essential viewing for Civil War buffs. But if you aren't one, you'll never make it through all 248 minutes."

The story telling quality is pulled down by the gadawful syrupy music and stiff acting. Poor Robert E.

"rhinocerosfive-1","4","1","5","20 March 2009"," And Yet They Made Another
","What great scenery, and what big teeth to chew it with! <br/><br/>Now, yes, Jeff Daniels is great as always, quiet and true. Martin Sheen's Lee is majestic, visionary, awesome in the original sense. And Tom Berenger is at his most restrained and earnest.<br/><br/>But for every solid, believable performance, there are two or three outrageous characterizations so large they seem not designed to fit the biggest of big screens. Rather, in the inverse ratio of acting size, a performance as large as Sam Elliott's Buford could only seem appropriate if watched on a cell phone. Stephen Lang's Pickett is so big he threatens to explode my television. And the late Richard Jordan's Armistead, while obviously heartfelt and impressively teary, very nearly blew the windows out of my house. Here's the thing: these are good actors. Sam Elliott's never this bad. C. Thomas Howell and Kevin Conway are never exactly naturalistic, not to say credible, but Richard Jordan's never been so damn unrestrained.<br/><br/>So we must point the finger at this film's writer and director Ronald Maxwell, a finger aimed in persecution of his terrible mishandling not only of some fine performers, but of nearly every element of this godawful production. This pompous dolt has made an embarrassing habit of attacking the work of better men. His idiotic snipings at Luc Besson's Joan of Arc picture - not that I'm defending it - are among the least accurate and most self-serving in the history of sour-grapes hack hyperbole. With GETTYSBURG he leaves himself wide open to broadsides of the same sort of derision, only this time the criticism has some basis in reality.<br/><br/>Maxwell takes Michael Shaara's classic novel and keeps all its philosophizing - the stuff a novel can get away with because of the depth of investigation of which only a novel is capable - while abandoning most of the simple human action that makes the book readable. What remains is three hours of hopes-and-dreams speechmaking, followed by 90 minutes of bad second-unit photography: men running uncertainly up toward the enemy, then performing pantomime stage combat exercises. The battle's most tragic and hideous example of the horrors of war (about which this movie mouths many words), Pickett's Charge, doesn't seem to be in the movie. At least, it is indistinguishable from the other bland scenes of men trotting with muskets that serve only as background to Randy Edelman's obsession with his string section.<br/><br/>Another bizarre mistake, just absolutely unaccountable in a movie this god damn long, is the abandonment of the central character IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE. Maxwell follows Daniels' Chamberlain from forced march to bayonet charge, and this is in fact the most compelling portion of the picture, featuring the only characters created not just by actors but in the script as well. So when the 20th Maine is moved to the center, where Lee has just announced he will concentrate his attack, the audience is led to believe that they will get to experience the further tribulations of the single unit with whom they have been allowed any intimacy.<br/><br/>Nah. We pick up with Daniels and his brother after the battle, just long enough to see them fade to black.<br/><br/>True, the earlier defense of Little Round Top has moments of tension and suspense. Good work, Ron. So, that's about ten minutes out of, what, two hundred and fifty? Nice. I think Luc Besson, pretentious Frenchman that he is, was quite cowed when he heard that the director of PARENT TRAP 2 had criticized his work. Sorry? You say your prequel, GODS AND GENERALS, was the biggest selling DVD the week it came out? Good, good. Did it make back any of the $50 million it lost on theatrical rentals?<br/><br/>No, I don't think the quality of a movie is measured in receipts. But neither is it measured in the number of minutes your picture runs. Nor in the number of times good actors were clearly told to ""go for it! pretend you're on stage in the Astrodome!"" I have great respect for the theater, having spent half my life in it. I also know that film is not quite the same medium, not for directors, not for writers, definitely not for actors. <br/><br/>Ron Maxwell doesn't seem to know anything about movies. Given his inefficiencies in this regard, I kinda doubt he's much of a stage hand either. But I bet he talks a good game."
"trinity729","5","1","5","9 July 2005"," Slightly disappointing, but worth watching for the outstanding acting
","I just watched this movie for the second time and my feelings are the same as upon first watching. I absolutely loved the book 'The Killer Angels', so of course the movie had a lot to live up to. What disappoints me most is that this movie could have been amazing. With such a cast and excellent source for the script, a competent director could have created a masterpiece.<br/><br/>My chief complaint is the tempo. So many scenes (even battle scenes)just dragged. Some directors have a way of taking all liberty with time to create an atmosphere, be it tranquil or tense, yet without the scene feeling mired down (Peter Weir is a master at this). Maxwell does not have that talent, or if he does, he does not display it here.<br/><br/>My second complaint is the score. I have no idea who Edelman is. Maybe his other work is better. There were a few nice moments where the score supported the scene nicely, but very few. One scene that stands out as particularly bad is Pickett's charge. The music seemed incongruous to the action on screen. It's as if the director said, 'Let's put something military-sounding in this scene' and the composer just slapped together some brass and drums without even watching the scene.<br/><br/>I won't get into the make-up problems as those were self-evident.<br/><br/>I just hate to see such a good opportunity squandered. That said, the acting was wonderful. Such a shame to have a wonderful cast like this and not turn out a better picture. I have to say my favorite performance was Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain. I fell in love with Chamberlain after reading 'The Killer Angels' as well as some biographies. Jeff Daniels captured Chamberlain's spirit exactly.<br/><br/>For all its faults, there are some very moving scenes such as Little Round Top and Pickett's charge (in spite of the score). It is worth watching for the acting alone.<br/><br/>I would love to see a remake of this with a better director and score, although it will be hard to match the original casting."

While there is plenty of violence and battle scenes, you don't get much of a sense for the power dynamics, the passions and hatreds, the gritty ugliness of a nation tearing itself apart. It's as if the film is holding back, so as not to offend or put off audiences. It's a film about an bitterly fought civil war but this film offends no one.<br/><br/>The dialogue between characters is interesting. The location and cinematography very good. Mostly, I found the soundtrack overwrought and dated, making the film feel overly romanticized and out of step with the subject matter. Sometimes it seemed like a bunch of reenactors got together to make a movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps this movie should be remastered and updated, stripping the film of the musical score.

Generally, the movie seems to present a fairly accurate representation of what transpired, barring the discussion and confusion of the Little Round Top incident.<br/><br/>I can recommend that this is worth viewing for someone who takes fancy in the history, but I have several qualms that will likely prevent me from viewing it again.<br/><br/>First, the soundtrack is distractingly overdone. If you are ever unsure of what emotions to feel in life because you are a sociopath (or for another reason), then fret not. The huge orchestral soundtrack will blatantly tell you when to feel patriotic, sad, pensive, etc.<br/><br/>Second, I very much did not like the portrayal of Lee. From what little I know, this does not seem to match the character of the man in the history books. It seems more like Mr. Sheen just did a caricature of a somewhat wise, proud old southerner.<br/><br/>Third, the facial hair. So much of it was so obviously fake.

","Gettysburg is a great war movie if you are interested in them (war movies) as I am. Many historically based movies are out there in this world and this is one of them...although it took pretty much 4 hours to watch the whole thing, it held my attention. Through the constant fighting, and watching the stress the commanders and soldiers were experiencing were very real. Real, as in you're fully attentive to see what's going to happen next and if the North will really be able to keep the South back! Historically, you can also relate as many of the true issues of the Civil War were mentioned and/or apparent as you watched. One, being the difficulty of loss and the tragedy of the situation...men from the same country were killing each other...men who were friends were supposed to be killing each other...starvation, over-exertion,and simply, yet, very importantly...the necessity of winning the battle of Gettysburg. The battle that we all know, was the defining moment of the war and its winner. Along with the historical allusions, the characters made it very real-the division was quite clear. One of the colonels had even said that this war was being fought due to the fact that it is the right thing to do; and along with that,freed states vs. slave states is not something that should be happening and that unity is an essential value of a functioning country. <br/><br/>In all, the con for me was the time consumption...however the action and the history made it enjoyable."

"joncheskin","8","0","1","22 December 2016"," Reenactment with Actors
","Gettysburg, an adaptation of the novel by Michael Shaara, is a huge war epic that tells the story of the famous three-day battle in Civil War Pennsylvania. Like the novel, the film centers on the experiences of a few main characters, especially Joshua Chamberlain, the Yankee colonel commanding the 20th Maine regiment, and James Longstreet, the dour Confederate corps commander who foresaw the final disaster, and uses their lenses to tell the story of the battle as a whole. The film has a terrific ensemble cast including Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain, Tom Berenger as Longstreet, Sam Elliot as Union cavalry commander John Buford, and Martin Sheen as Confederate army commander Robert E Lee.<br/><br/>Gettysburg differs from its source novel, the Killer Angels, by projecting a sense of vastness and majesty. The battle scenes are done by thousands of volunteer reenactors, and the musical score by Randy Edelman projects a sweeping romantic breadth. The novel was more of a character study of Buford, Chamberlain and Longstreet and how they are essentially both killers and virtuous human beings at the same time (""Killer Angels""). The movie, on the other hand, gets caught up in the project of reenacting the battle as a sort of visual memorial to those who fought. Some scenes in the movie develop the book's characters well, but others seem a bit clunky and clichÃ©d. Also, because the movie follows the book in its narrative conception, some key parts of the battle are left out of the movie. Civil War buffs will notice these deficiencies and might wonder why the movie omitted such important details (the battle for Culp's and Cemetery Hills, for instance).<br/><br/>On the other hand, this movie succeeds brilliantly in creating that sort of visual memorial that the makers were seeking. The reenactors perform a tour-de-force, really taking us to the center of the action. The tactics and strategies are very clearly relayed in the movie, the sense of terror and courage are all well projected. Northern and Southern ideologies are presented without bias so the audience can draw its own conclusions. The production is very lovingly done, with tremendous admiration for the officers and soldiers of both sides. It is also one of the rare movies that is four hours long but seems much shorter because of all of the very gripping drama that happens on screen.<br/><br/>In short, Gettysburg will certain thrill the Civil War buffs, but will likely entertain and interest others as well. The time capsule is not perfectly faithful in all of its details, but its spirit is spot-on."

","My feelings toward this movie are rather ambiguous and therefore not likely to be well received by people who thoroughly enjoyed it. I will divide my opinion about it in a part about what I liked and a part about what I didn't like.<br/><br/>I liked that the actors and their performances and I also liked the fact that the officers they represented and their armies very much looked the part. Troop maneuvering and costumes, the large hats, the gloves, the cigars. A lot of effort seems to have been invested to strive for historical accuracy. Acting was great in my opinion, especially by Martin Sheen and Tom Berenger.<br/><br/>The parts I didn't like included the moments where some of the officers engage in conversation with each other and reflect on the moral and historical implications of their actions. These scenes were so obviously directed at the viewer, to provide a sense of historical perspective or explain a particular kind of military maneuver that they merely humored me. The British emissary present with the Confederate army is used on multiple occasions for scenes like this and especially the part where he explains a military tactic to the commander that is supposed to perform a vital part of it borders on ridiculousness.<br/><br/>Secondly the fighting scenes are hard to watch. They look more like historical re-enactment scenes you would watch on a news report than they do a modern movie. In some scenes you can actually discern actors making very nonchalant moves (when they are supposed to be fighting for their lives). This is the weakest point of the movie in my opinion and it is especially apparent at the big charge at the center of the front near the end of the film. What's totally missing in these scenes is the utter horror and despair that I imagine real battles to be like. The actors and the scenes showed none of that. The human element of battle is also missing in its entirety, nowhere do we see the enormous fears that young men moving into battle must feel. There's mostly bravery and beautiful words from the officers. The level of violence is also very modest for a big war movie. When you see large troop maneuvering for example the explosions always seem to be right beside them. This makes sense from a filming perspective of course, but not much sense from a war movie-viewing perspective.<br/><br/>In short, I thought it was rather enjoyable if you can look past these shortcomings and don't expect a very realistic representation of what the civil war was really like: a bloodbath. In this movie you will see a lot of dressed up men with beards that are very gracious towards one another and seem more concerned with their former comrades now turned enemies than they are with their own troops or themselves. In my opinion there must have been a good deal of hatred on both sides, which is natural to occur after some of your friends have died in a gruesome way. The movie is therefore a better depiction of war movie-making history than it is of war itself. To me it was a lot like The Longest Day when compared to Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. The Longest Day is an enjoyable movie but large parts of it are utterly ridiculous from a historic point of view. Gettysburg is very much like that and looks more a 1960s movie than it does like a one from the 1990s."

Henry said.<br/><br/>""Oh my...""<br/><br/>""I tell you the most important lesson of this movie though. Which can only truly be evaluated when watching another movie which is called Civil War reenactment documentary. About everyone interviewed must have been about thirty pounds heavier than their civil war counterparts. Which is probably why you never see them much up close. If they could learn anything of this is that the civil war soldier was more likely to die from a bullet than from obesity, while now it is probably the other way around.

You play with guns and act all snobbery because you have something of historical value to pass on, while all the while you are nothing better than other people playing video games, drawing pictures, doing origami, climbing mountains or watching horror movies. Cause the only thing a war learns is that it is a horrible affair that should be avoided because it kills people.""<br/><br/>""Uhm. You are quite vehement."" Henry was taken aback .<br/><br/>""Yes. And I will tell you why. I happen to have been so stupid to spend most of life on the study of warfare. Now you think 620.000 people is much. Compare that to the Taiping Rebellion at roughly the same time. It killed at least fifty times as many people and might even have killed a hundred times more. And this was no warfare in which women and children were spared. No, everyone was killed: cities destroyed and countries wasted. It was total war. And I doubt you will find anyone willing to reenact that. Now if some fat civil war reenactor wants to learn something from his past, he might at least learn to eat less and exercise more, because that war is a horrible thing is apparently lost on him."" And, overcome with emotion, Kristl stormed out.<br/><br/>Henry listened to the door shutting and thought that letting Kristl cool down was the wisest thing to do. He then went to the kitchen and brewed some home made coffee according to a trusted and tried recipe that his family had handed down the generations and he knew it was something from his American past that Kristl really liked."

","Prior to seeing this spectacular movie, I toured the battle site at Gettysburg and I read the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel on which it is based (""The Killer Angels"" by Michael Shaara), so I suspect that I understood the personalities and the tactics of the conflict more than most non-Americans (I am British) which was certainly a help. Originally planned as a mini series for television, thanks to the support of Ted Turner the work had a theatrical release in 1993 in a version lasting over four hours (making it even longer than ""Lawrence Of Arabia""). It did not do well at the box office but has been praised by critics.<br/><br/>There is a great deal to admire, notably the huge efforts made to ensure authenticity. Much of the film was shot at Gettysburg National Park and over 13,000 Civil War re-enactors volunteered their efforts with their own props and costumes. Visually the movie is stunning, with the defence of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge providing thrilling cinema, all enhanced by Randy Endelman's rousing score. Most of the casting is spot on, with Jeff Daniels as Laurence Chamberlain and Sam Elliott as John Buford on the Confederate side and Tom Berenger as James Longstreet and Stephen Lang as George Pickett on the Union side all giving fine performances.<br/><br/>But the movie does have weaknesses. The most obvious is the last-minute casting of the normally splendid Martin Sheen as Robert E Lee, an odd choice (he is too short) and an odd portrayal (he comes across as somewhat effete). Another problem is the preponderance of full-scale speeches which sound preachy and slow down the narrative. Finally, for non-Americans and for Americans who are not Civil War enthusiasts, the film really is too long and could have benefited from some sharper cutting.<br/><br/>The whole project took some 15 years to bring to fruition, by which time Michael Shaara was dead, but he would have been very happy with this production which follows closely his plotting and uses much of his dialogue. For Ronald F Maxwell, who both wrote and directed this massive enterprise, the movie is a triumph and it will stand as one of the best war films ever made."

","Finally, there is a a historical movie that is accurate in more ways than it's not. Maybe that explains why this movie is over four hours long. Those four hours did fly by despite being more talking/planning than actual battles. This is a really good film to watch if you're interested in learning about Gettysburg.<br/><br/>This film is based on the actual battle that took place in Gettysburg between the Union and the Confederate soldiers.<br/><br/>There are some powerful performance in this film. I was really pleased with Jeff Daniels as Colonel Chamberlain. Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee wasn't an obvious casting choice, but it works out in the end.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fine if a little long war film. Some of the speeches given were powerful ones. The last half hour of the film is no doubt the best part of the movie. However, I did notice that some of the extras during some battle scenes looked fake. I rate this film 8/10."

","The American civil war has got to be one the most interesting yet horrid wars ever to break lose in pre-modern history.Even with modern technology developing and battle tactics changing, it has become one of the most heartbreaking wars as brother fought against brother for a cause right in their own eyes. And out of all the civil war movies produced, only one truly shows this to it's full extent.<br/><br/>This is my review on Gettysberg.<br/><br/>The plot goes like this; It's July 1863, halfway though the American civil war. The leader of the Confederates, Robert E Lee, launches a attack on the little town of Gettysberg. Little did both sides know that it was going to be the most ghastly battles ever to be raged on American soil.<br/><br/>The American civil war is one of my favourite topics in history. There is just so much political intrigue between the to sides of the war. Both sides had very good reasons to grab a gun a fight for their country. Conferderates wanted Slavery and felt that the union, who wanted to end slavery, was taking away a major part of their economy. The union thought slavery was completely inhuman. In a way, this topic is depressing because they weren't fighting against another country that they could join together and fight. This war pitted friends, brothers and loved ones against each other, sometimes unwillingly. America was on the brink of collapse.<br/><br/>Onto the movie. the movie centres around the topic mentioned above but delves deep into it. However, unlike most civil war movies, Gettysberg shows both sides of the story, highlighting every reason for fighting. In my opinion, they couldn't have done it better as you feel for every character in the film. every loss in battle makes you cringe. Wiether your loyal to the union or the confederacy, you are going to feel for each individual character.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch for a film like this. Jeff Daniels takes centre stage on the union side, staring as Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. His performance is definitely memorable as he recites many of the films great speeches and delivers the best performance of his career. Other people that stood out were Martin Sheen, Stephen Lang and Tom Berenger. Each and every performance was heart felt and they all seemed to enjoy every minute of their performances, even when their characters are suffering loss. <br/><br/>The tone of the film is fantastic. It's start6s off a bit slow developing the characters back stories but once the battles take place, you really start to get the feeling the director is trying to get across. All the scenes before battles sometimes feel a bit meaningless, but most show the true depressing fact that all the soldiers don't want to fight, they just want what's good for their state and country. One thing this film does brilliantly is the relationship between two of the characters. Both play Generals on both sides of the war. They both long to see each other again before the battle proceeds but fear that they might not make it out alive. This is where the film shines and it portrays one of the best friendships in the history of film. <br/><br/>The action scenes are also fantastic. Each scene, including the huge main battle at the end, begin with a huge battle plan which is interesting to see them establish. History/military fans will enjoy each and every moment. The body count is huge with thousands of human bodies on screen at one time and it works to the film's advantage, making it feel huge.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you probably know how I feel about the movie. It is VERY long and it could have been cut down a bit as there seems to be a lot of fill, but I'm not going to mark the film down for that. I say if you like history and the military see this film. Many may find this film boring and I would see where they are coming from but this film is right up my street. <br/><br/>Im giving it a solid 10/10."

","I am a New Zealander of Scottish ancestry who has family in Virginia and N. Carolina. I see them at clan meetings from time-to-time.<br/><br/>I am told that the family has a unique claim (to fame?) regarding Gettysburg. Major Thomas Turnbull commanded the Union artillery at the trees that are now called the 'High Watermark of the Confederacy'. Opposite him were 5 cousins lining up for Picketts Charge. Thomas's battery is credited for killing one of the cousins, supposedly the only known case of family/family killing at Gettysburg.This gives the battle, and thus the movie, more than trivial interest, especially as I have trudged it twice now.<br/><br/>The movie is far from perfect. It is long, over focuses on certain individuals, and is somewhat over dramatic in parts. To little is made of crucial mistakes on the part of the CSA (such as Lee's ambiguous orders to seize the Round Tops, which were not carried out, and cost the CSA the battle).<br/><br/>No real explanation is given for the prolonged absence of the CSA cavalry and there is to much focus upon the Union Maine Regiment. Other critical engagements, such as the Peach Orchard, are ignored.<br/><br/>For the most part, the acting is very good, the historical accuracy fine, and the general feeling about the movie is good, but it does seem to get confused as to whether it is a documentary or entertainment.<br/><br/>However, the good parts easily outweigh the rest and I would recommend it."
"The-Sarkologist","6","0","1","16 February 2012"," Quite a long movie about a famous American Civil War battle
","The one quirp that I had with this movie is that it deals more with the television station that broadcast it than the movie itself. They advertised it for about three hours and it went longer so I missed the ending of it. Okay, I know how the battle of Gettysburg ended (as many people who know about the Civil War know) but it would have been nice to have seen how the characters dealt with the defeat/victory, depending on the side.<br/><br/>For those who do not know much about the American Civil War, it was a war fought between the states of the North, in which slavery was illegal and the 11 States of the Confederacy, who seceded over the issue of slavery. The goal of the South was to continue with slavery as their entire economic system rested upon it, while the North did not want to see the union dissolve and fought to save it. Thousands of books and periodicals have been written on the war and there are a lot of other issues, such as the industralised north wanting to defeat an agraian south that relied upon slave labour.<br/><br/>The battle occurred when General Lee's troops from the South, moving around to attack Washington from the north, encountered the Union troops at Gettysburg. From the movie the battle lasted three days, with only minor skirmishes on the first day finishing with a huge southern defeat on the third day. Gettysburg is seen as the turning point of the war, though the fall of Vicksburg on the Mississippi is considered to be another turning point as the entire South was divided into two. Gettysburg is famous more because this battle was a forerunner of the devastation that modern wars would bring. What we see in the battle of Gettysburg is seen on a much bloodier scale in World War I.<br/><br/>Another show I say described the battle of Gettysburg as the last battle where the Napoleonic charge was used. Guns before that were not that accurate, and troops would charge the enemies and when they were in close range, they would then fire, hopefully hitting people. The Springfield rifle had been developed and was put to use in this battle by the North. This rifle was far more accurate and had a greater range than the rifled musket of previous decades. As such, the Northern troops were able to cut down the southern troops as they charged.<br/><br/>Gettysburg is a historical reenactment of the battle, but because it is a movie, they create a few characters to try and capture the feel of the war. One incident are two of the generals who are friends but have landed on opposite sides of the fighting. They focus of the tragedy of this situation, as they were good friends but are ordered to kill each other by their superiors. This is one of the big tragedies of the war.<br/><br/>They also use the movie to show both ideals of the sides. One commander stands up and gives the patriotic speech of how they fight the war for freedom. The southern troops claim that they fight the war because they want to leave the union and the Union won't let them and is forcing them to conform to their ways. This comes down to State Rights, mainly that the states have the right to behave how they like and the Federal Government cannot intervene. Of coarse the ideal and the reality is far different.<br/><br/>Finally I would like to theorise on what could have happened if the South won. The issue of slavery is important but consider that the confederacy was not a strong unity, and even as they fought for freedom from the North, if the North had lost then the union would have been weakened even more. Possibly the United States would have disintegrated into a loose collection of warring states attempting to push their ideals onto each other. Britain might have resumed control of their lost colonies. The more important things happen when we hit World War I because without the American reinforcements, Germany would have probably won, and forced the allies to pay reparations to them. The Ottoman empire would still be in existence, World War II might have still happened, but the dictator could have come out of France or England, and the USSR would have expanded unopposed. This is only theorising (and I like doing that), but there were are lot of factors that led to the South's defeat, the battle of Gettysburg being a minor one.<br/><br/>I didn't say much about the movie, but what is there to really say. It is an okay movie, a little long, but they wanted to capture the essence of the battle. I didn't see the end so I cannot comment on that either. Instead I just look at the events that the movie is based around, because it is these events that tell the stories and the themes that the movie is trying to portray."

","I'm not a civil war buff but I've always had a fondness for the War Between the States. It's the point in time where America realizes on what their views should be for any race and not just the white Anglo Saxon individuals. I am proud to own this movie for multiple reasons. The first is that it is the longest in running time in the history of cinema, four hours! And that's not even the extended cut version, that one's even longer! I also love the performances, the music and the way everything was film at up-most accuracy. If I could give this film eleven stars out of ten, I definitely would.<br/><br/>The cast for this movie is way too large for me to all name but there are many good actors in this film. Starring as one of the main characters is Tom Berenger as General Longstreet who has the beard almost as amazing as Albus Dumbledore's! Berenger is a fine actor and I enjoy watching how he acts and reacts to situations. He does a magnificent job and I only wished that he had reprised his role in Gods and Generals (2003). Along side Berenger is Martin Sheen, playing as General Lee. He too does a good job at his part. Whenever he talks, he gives his character the impression that he is gentle but also a strong leader who knows what he's talking about. <br/><br/>Jeff Daniels plays as Colonel Chamberlain. Whenever the camera is focused on him, I lose the sense that this is Jeff Daniels talking. That is how good Daniels acts out his role. It's almost like Chamberlain came back just for this movie. Even Sam Elliot has brief role in this film as General Buford. Although it is hard to picture Buford talking like Sam Elliot he's pretty convincing with his part. The last actor that I think does a superb job with his part is Richard Jordan who plays General Armistead. I've always enjoyed Richard Jordan's performances. He has a way of doing things that are just so believable. There were points in this film where I almost cried because of the way Jordan acted. And for me, it's not easy to make me cry. Although his part is not as major as the other roles, it's still just as powerful. And what a fine way for Jordan to end his career because not long after he passed away (unfortunately).<br/><br/>The music in this epic was composed and conducted by Randy Edelman. I love Edelman's work, I really do. The way the music starts out, and the way it ends is so noble and unforgettable. There is one song that I really enjoy listening to; that song is Kathleen Mavourneen. This song can be heard when Armistead and Longstreet have a heartfelt conversation. It was so beautiful to listen to that it is now one my most favorite soundtrack tunes. <br/><br/>One thing that I've heard some say about this film is that it is not a good war movie unless it has blood, guts, and body parts flying everywhere. I agree TO A POINT. Sure it would have been nice to see a little more bloodshed to make the film more realistic but isn't it realistic enough as it is? The film contains all the military movements of both armies; it shows the viewer how they were executed and the mistakes that were made. And its not like there AREN'T people shown getting shot or blown away by a cannon shell. Is blood and guts really necessary? That's just icing on the cake if the viewer can handle such graphic images. Plus that would restrict the age limit for this movie, which could have possibly lowered the amount of money it could have made. There is nothing wrong with a PG war movie, The Big Red One (1980) was like that too. Case closed.<br/><br/>Director Ronald F. Maxwell has created a fine piece of cinema for anyone to enjoy; even non civil war buffs will like it. Although it is long for a movie, Gettysburg sustains realistic images, great acting, and a memorable soundtrack."
"MovieGuy109","7","0","1","23 November 2011"," Long but powerfully directed
","Gettysburg is both boring and powerful at the same time. The production values are truly what makes this film so compelling to watch and the acting is powerful especially by Sheen and Daniels. The movie goes on and on for 4 long hours and often challenges our attention span especially if the civil war does not interest you. Many of the battle scenes are very well-staged however and the filming on Gettysburg National Park itself has never been more authentic and real in a war movie. If you enjoy war films and you appreciate long movies, you should be as entranced as always by the climatic and cinematic storytelling."

","I too have watched this over and over. Criticisms of the fake beards and other flaws miss the overall meaning and majesty of this film.<br/><br/>If I was a teacher of American history ... or of English in another country ... and wanted a film for my students to see which would epitomize *American* beliefs and resolution, this would be it. As at least one other reviewer has pointed out, Jeff Daniels' monologue about the North's case for war is deeply moving and explains why and how antislavery was the basic issue at stake.<br/><br/>If the film is too long for the classroom, that monologue, Buford's cavalry's desperate holding action at the outset of the battle, the pre-battle conversation between Longstreet and the British Army observer Freemantle, the fight for Little Round Top, and Pickett's Charge are the excerpts that most should be shown.<br/><br/>A personal anecdote: An old Army buddy of mine, who had to put up with my love for military history even while we were draftees, lives in Bethel PA. My then 13 yr old son and I were visiting the Naval Academy, THE Academy (West Point), and swinging back through PA to go home to Illinois. Ron was eager to show off Gettysburg to me, even though my primary interest has been World War 2. We got to the top of one of the Gettysburg observation towers - since torn down - and even before he could start his local history lecture, my son started exclaiming ""Hey! There's Seminary Ridge! There's Cemetery Ridge! There are the Round Tops!"" etc. etc.<br/><br/>You see, Robert and I had played the Gettysburg board game - Cemetery Hill - in the old Simulations Publications Inc. Blue & Gray ""quad"" game set, and we had fought back and forth over the terrain ourselves, being motivated to learning the true history of the battle from the set's historical commentary and other sources. :-) <br/><br/>Ted Turner did a profound service to our Country, seeing this film through to completion, and he has my deepest thanks.

","I have always loved American History, as I grew up with a father that encouraged me and my brothers to educate ourselves in it. So, after being inspired by the History Channel's recent airing of various Civil War battles, I purchased Gettysburg online and couldn't wait to watch it when it arrived.<br/><br/>Honestly, I cannot understand why the majority of the reviews in here are praising this film. Although there are several bright spots and some very good actors involved, this film is unnecessarily long and clouded by ridiculous over dramatized scenes. From the very opening scene the acting was unbelievable. Even Tom Beringer's first appearance made me cringe as the dialogue between him and the scout (Harrison, I believe) was anything but believable. I only hoped it would get better as the film progressed. Unfortunately, Stephen Lang, as General Pickett, was the only bright spot, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Not even the best actors, however, could have come away delivering Academy Award deserving performances with the horrible scripts they were given: unrealistic dialogue, contrived interaction between the characters, unprovoked emotions...the list is simply too long.<br/><br/>The battles, given praise by most of the reviewers in here, came across to me like Civil war reenactment performances (and they probably were). Not to mention, there were so many scenes that were repeated over and over again to lengthen the effect. A great example is on day three at the onset of the final battle as the cannon fire begins. Watch and notice how many times the same sequence is repeated. I even caught several scenes where the actors stopped performing, as if the cameras were supposed to cease filming - and somehow were overlooked in the editing room. One scene in particular, during Chamberlain's charge downhill, you'll catch several soldiers lifting their guns to pummel the onrush of enemy, and then halt in mid swing, as if waiting to hear the word ""cut!"" from the Director. Horrible. Embarrassing.<br/><br/>The over-saturated dramatic speeches by one General after another made me glad I had a ""forward"" button on my remote. The emotions spoke for themselves due to the loss of so many lives and the tragedy of a Country torn apart by ignorance and differences of values and opinions. We didn't need their speeches to rub it in and create an unnecessarily long, drawn out movie.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was the worst part. I own over 200 soundtracks and believe that music can make or break a movie. Knowing when to elevate climaxes, stop to breath, draw forth emotions, and support the dialogue are no different than a cook knowing what spices to use and how much. Randy Edelman drowned this movie in the major chords of over-embellished patriotic nonsense that lost its luster when he repeated the same theme over and over again. If you want to enjoy all 4 and 1/2 hours of this movie's music, just repeat each track ten times and you're there.<br/><br/>Now I understand that a film about our History that requires thousands of ""extras"", stand ins, and the need to have as many physical bodies as possible is going to result in some poor acting or those in the background who have no experience in acting, but if you really want to see a great Civil War movie, which doesn't fall into these obvious traps and flaws, pick up Glory. I am pretty sure, anyone who has seen that movie will find ""Gettysburg"" nothing short of laughable.<br/><br/>I'll refrain from continuing this review in fear that the producers of this film might see my somewhat long, over dramatized, and possibly unnecessary rambling, and ask me to participate in their next film, seeming that I meet all of their qualifications.<br/><br/>P.S. If there are any misspellings or poor grammar, I am sure they pale in comparison to the inaccuracies of this film."

","While GETTYSBURG has several drawbacks--mainly the sprawling amount of time taken to depict the fierce Civil War battle with two viewpoints and philosophies--it compensates with its historical accuracies while at the same time compressing the three-day battle into the framework of a lengthy film.<br/><br/>Its major asset is the sincerity of all of the major performances--and that includes TOM BERENGER looking magnificently scruffy behind his impressive beard, MARTIN SHEEN as Robert E. Lee, STEPHEN LANG as George Pickett, JEFF DANIELS and C.

The sets, costumes and color photography are all first rate, but some will be impatient with the talk between battles which is sometimes a little too extensive. All of the battle scenes look like a re-enactment, a soft core version of the more graphic horrors of war that are rampant in many more recent war films.<br/><br/>Still, it's an impressive film from start to finish and the performances are all admirable.<br/><br/>The most haunting exchange of dialog occurs at the end of the battle with Pickett being told by Robert E.

","personally I""m a historical purist, in many ways this movie hits the mark. the detailed discussion with the leaders in the battle gives a big insight into their thinking, their fears, their weaknesses, their genius and or failure to take effective action. the portrayal of the battle on some levels is extremely good, the scale of the reenactment and attention to a lot of the detail of the battle scenes , costume, equipment. the faithful reproduction of the battle itself trying to be true to what happened historically is great on many levels but, and fortunately for this movie, Saving Private Ryan came out after this movie. at a single stroke Spielberg raised the benchmark for realism of battle scenes. the horrific carnage wreaked in such battles wasn't rally attempted in Gettysburg, the tearing apart and splattering of flesh across the battlefield. people died gallantly, not hideously as they do in real life. Spielberg did what few other war movies did, make people look at the reality close up in all its repulsiveness in a way that had been hidden from the public even by the protagonists, large caliber cannons and lead musket balls wreaked serious physical damage to flesh, ammunition like that is outlawed today due to the fact that the injuries caused are usually a lot worse than caused by modern small arms! the fact is it takes a realistic depiction of a battle scene to present people with all the facts to make their own accurate analysis of history, the generals knew what sort of carnage would ensue , and they made a career our of doing it, using the same tactics that led to the butchering of tens of thousands but the viewers of the movie never saw that. many injuries results in very slow and agonising death that could take days or Weeks, medical complications easily treated today were non existent then. about 60% of deaths in the civil war were from infections, often contagious, not related to battle injuries. packing large no's of people together, in poor or non existent accommodation, with often poor nutrition and sanitation cause the proliferation of disease, wiping our hundreds of thousands of lives in the war, slow lingering miserable deaths, of men separated from loved ones dying in squalid conditions that wouldn't be tolerated today. ironically someone calculated that in Iraq and Afghanistan, medical science means only a quarter of the men die today who would have died in the second world war from battle injuries, compared to the civil war the ration would have been about eight times as any without penicllin that existed in world war two."

","I was just in Gettysburg for the first time in May of this year. I watched the movie last night. I knew the history from touring the battlefield, and visiting the new museum (excellent museum), so I was very interested in seeing the scope of the war. It was difficult to imagine 90,000 men in battle.<br/><br/>The film did a good job I thought of showing the scale of Pickett's charge. I just couldn't imagine that in real life.<br/><br/>I also thought many of the actors did an excellent job. Berenger as Longstreet who had his doubts the entire time (and was correct). Daniels was very good as Chamberlain.<br/><br/>Few films are 100% historically accurate, but I think the differences don't lessen the impact of Gettysburg - still the largest battle ever fought on the continent."

","This movie makes little sense for anyone who isn't already familiar with the characters, locations, tactics, etc. of the Battle of Gettysburg. There is so much talk about high ground to the west, divisions coming in from the north, General So-and-So doing this, General Such-and-Such doing that (which side is he on?), that it's quite meaningless unless you already have lots of good background information. To me it looks like a clumsy job of trying to maintain historical accuracy - unfortunately, at the expense of a clear storyline and dramatic coherence.<br/><br/>Another major problem is some truly awful dialogue spoken against a background of swelling, inspirational music. Characters pause, stare into the distance, the action around them comes to a halt, and they give long, noble, philosophical speeches. The effect verges on the embarrassing, even the comical. It's just plain very bad, amateur writing.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels does an interesting job of portraying a Union officer with a soft heart.<br/><br/>Sam Elliott (Brig. Gen. John Buford), the officer leading the Union troops in the first encounter, is less impressive. He had an annoying habit of, in the middle of a speech, suddenly spitting out a sentence with great force and a great show of passion without communicating any sense of why that sentence possessed him so much. It looks like an actor trying to inject lots of feeling into his words without quite knowing why and where.<br/><br/>I watched it tonight for about two hours until bedtime, fairly bored most of the time.

","A long but very well done epic. However, everyone who has ever read about the Civil War knows that the most stirring moment at the battle of Gettysburg was the charge of the First Minnesota. As the Federal line was about to breached by three Confederate regiments, Gen. Hancook ordered the First Minnesota-commanded by Col. William Colvill-to charge into the gap. Colvill had had differences with Hancock in the past, but his men charged valiantly, and stopped the Confederate advance. How the screenplay of a movie entitled ""Gettysburg"" could ignore the role of Colvill's men is beyond me. The story of the regiment that took over 80% casualties in order to save the Army of the Potomac had to be told. I know the movie was long, but at the very least Hancock and Meade could have been shown having a brief discussion wherein the incredible courage and sacrifice of the First Minnesota was mentioned."

","This was truly a watershed event in this nations history.The Battle of Gettysburg represents the end of the beginning and as well the beginning of the end for the confederate cause.The debacle was preceded by another first in the civil war which was like Gettysburg.The North was growing in strength,in numbers and in know how.This was illustrated at The Battle of Brandys Station.It is considered the largest cavalry engagement of the Civil War and it occurred late June 1863.It was J.E.B.Stuart Cavalry Corp that had been assigned the task of shielding Lee's army of Northern Virginia as it made its way across Maryland and on into PA.Stuarts Cavalry Corps first duty was to protect Lee's flank and as well it was also to deny the ability to see Lee corps at all.J.E.B.Stuarts Cavalry Corps did that at Brandies station,however it also provided proof that the confederacy was on the move and that Union Cavalry was gaining ground in its ability to go toe to toe with the Rebel and beat him on horseback.It was to prove to be a drawing even as Union forces gained a foothold.Gettysburg did not show that perhaps they should of.J.E.B.Stuart Cavalry Corp was caught of guard at Brandies Station however Gettysburg failed in another Stuart debacle when he lost a critical battle as he attempted to flank the Northern position on Seminary Ridge.There he was defeated with a series of reckless charges attributed to Brevet General George Armstrong Custers Michigan Brigade.Stuarts Corp of some 4500 was turned back by a force less than half the size of Stuarts Corp.It was a story that deserved to be told as here ""Long Hair"" was brave,courageous even resourceful.Custers conduct was untold in this Motion Picture but it was as much a part of the landscape as it was about the battle of Gettysburg.It was such a critical accomplishment that it protected Meades Rear and did in its own right prove an invaluable part of the Unions ability to hold its ground.J.E.B.Stuarts Cavalary Corp was often thought to be Lee's eyes and ears,when Stuart was no where to be found as Heaths Corp engaged Buford, Lee was groping for intelligence and Stuart was not present.This was done well,even convincingly as the dramatic intent was convincingly portrayed.Lee indeed was playing for keeps and perhaps Gettyburg was it!His admonishment of Stuart was not without sentiment however the North had learned.The Motion Picture Gettysburg did show an historical perception that the north on that day,that day being July 1,1863 came into Gettysburg from the South and in fact the South came into Gettysburg from the North.Buford,s defense has long been held in high account as a superior rebel force was slowed to such a time that the retreat was a calculation to attain higher ground on the other side of Gettysburg.It was to paraphrase, a lesson in how to retreat.It is interesting to note that Lee's confederates when marching into the Gettysburg community as things were to progress,many had no shoes.It is here another belief of history that this battle in Gettysburg grew out of an attempt made by Southern forces to procure from the Gettysburg community,shoes.Worth mentioning is the contribution that General Longstreet provided while all the while arguing for a redeployment.This was excellent story telling ability that jived with history.This film by Ron Maxwell rates higher than merely a motion picture but a motion picture that jives with history.Little Round Top is an inspiring story,General Hancock is an inspiring story,so extreme was the need for hospitals to care for both the wounded and the dead that the hospitals place in Western culture was made permanent.It seems almost an endless task to assess the drama and effect this event and its accompnaying Civil War have provided this Nation and our culture that merely a film like Gettysburg may in fact be more of a Motion Picture than it can be a lesson in history.This is witnessed to the fact that there is much that is not included and as yet the ""Last Full Measure"" has been permanetly put on the back burner.We have in this battle of Gettysburg the rudiments of a day of Thanksgiving.Please refer to Oct. 1863.I would watch this film again indeed perhaps even again.It was worth the many viewing as history became a dramatic account whereby we were all the while a participant in an event of July 1863.An excellent telling of the Battle of Gettysburg."

","Shaara's book reshaped how the battle is viewed by the public and the film is a further refinement from the novel. As an historian I have to point out that Shaara shaped his narrative by selecting from the memoirs of the surviving generals, and the film went even further in its picking and choosing of portrayals. Shaara made choices. For instance we only hear Chamberlain's account of Little Round Top -- not that of his subordinate Ellis Spear who had a variant tale to tell, nor do we hear from Col. W. Oates of the Alabama regiment that was at the bottom of the hill, attacking upward.<br/><br/>So the film is excellent (except for the men's beards which appear to have been culled from local small mammals), but it is a script based on a novel based on memoirs, and that is a far cry from the history of a complex three day battle in the midst of a four year war.<br/><br/>By choosing his voices, Shaara's Union POV is left only to Chamberlain with little mention of the men who commanded and died on Little Round Top. Until 1974 Chamberlain had vanished from the accounts and Shaara put him back in the spotlight to the expense of Vincent, Weed, Hazlett, The Army of Northern Virginia is reduced to the Army of Nothing but Virginia. ""Longstreet's Assault,"" later called the ""Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Charge"" (Longstreet didn't want his name attached to it) has again been popularly reduced to just Pickett -- whose men suffered no worse than those in the other two divisions. The plan was Lee's and Lee's alone. And General Pickett hated that the charge bore his name and he hated Lee for ordering it. It comes out in the film but only just barely.<br/><br/>Shaara was a novelist, not an historian and the film is based on the novel, not the history. So enjoy the film, get a taste for the subject and then go seek out the rest of the story. Far more happened than could be contained in any memoir, any novel or any film, but this is a good start. Just don't base your history term paper on it."
"floyd7904","9","0","2","24 February 2008"," some thoughts from a long time lover of this movie and richmonder (VA, for the uninformed)
","i first saw this movie when i was 14, to lend some perspective on my view of this film. i am well learned on the ""facts"" of the war and am aware that this movie was not exactly an accurate portrayal of all the events that transpired in Pennsylvania in those heady days of '63. for instance, chamberlain wasn't even in the center during Pickett's charge and so forth. to defend the film, they didn't portray him as being effective as the bulwark against the south on that valiant charge. as a matter of fact, they show him cowering in the onslaught of the rebel charge. no, it was Hancock, who later ran for president. nonetheless, the film is notable. one, for the obvious fact that had it not been produced, even if by the infamous Ted turner, we wouldn't have this outstanding film to criticize. i'm a member of the lower middle class and a socialist, so i have no predilection to defending media moguls. but i think we should be grateful, those of us who care enough to write comments and think about this film that it was ever made. sure, it could've been better. the props sucked. that's common knowledge. Longstreet's, lee's, chamberlain's beards sucked altogether, well that's like saying Nixon knew nothing about the break-in at the Watergate offices of the democratic national headquarters. of course the movie is nothing but speeches, one for states rights and the other for preservation of the union, and of course it's questionable whether fighting men thought of it so much in those terms. Jackson that made it so clear that was what it was all about and that was some thirty-odd years before the great conflict. of course it was about ideals and we all know literacy wasn't that great in those days so an inspirational speech may have been the vehicle to get some of these simple boys to fight. i know that scene with rebs being interrogated by chamberlain's brother was overdone, but when those southerners retorted about their rights, they weren't acting. those poor downtrodden white boys of the south had been fooled into thinking they were fighting a war against an ever encroaching federal government, and maybe they were right. i live, hell i was born in Virginia, and i believe that if i am to be held for a crime, it should be the governor of Virginia that accuses me of a crime, that i should be punished by laws applicable to Virginia. after all, for all those out there who know Virginia's history, we did not ratify the constitution until it was already ratified by the necessary 2/3, in other words, we didn't support the constitution because it didn't go far enough to support civil liberties. don't forget, we're the home of Patrick henry, a major detractor of that hideous document. he knew that the second amendment did not go far enough. as it reads, people can only have guns for the support of the militia, so as not to have a Bastille where all the guns are in one place. in other words, the 2nd amend means that people can have guns in there homes because it is the governments best interest not to have all arms located in place lest some rebel force react and try to take over the central arsenal, e.g. the Bastille. the 2nd amend was never meant to guarantee average citizens the right to bear arms and henry knew it and that's why he fought so hard against Hamilton's oligarchy. but back to the movie, all in all, we're lucky to have it. it could've been better, but i guess Forrest gump could've been too, or maybe Casablanca, or the longest day, etc, etc, guess someone could've done Charles ingalls better than m. Landon, guess someone could've been better first pres than g. Washington. where does it stop?"

But there are no women involved, and in stead every main character ends up crying somewhere down the line. What is the message here? That war is hell?

","My 90-year old mother and I saw the videotape of this film from our town library several months ago. We are now at the mid-point in the copy of Gods and Generals from the same library and I have commented numerous times that this or that scene had been in Gettysburg, as well. I told her I would research the matter overnight.<br/><br/>Judging largely from the cast list here, we saw a substantially different version than that listed here. It is bizarre to see the scenes with the Pickett character so easily exchanged with those of the Jackson character; for example the scene in the version we saw, also in Gods and Generals, with the Pickett/Jackson and the African-American cook praying and discussing the inhumane folly of slavery.<br/><br/>Maxwell must have re-cut this film relatively recently to include this material. I suspect the listing ""Gettysburg (VG) 2001"" should be about this version, but it came up a blank when I clicked on it.<br/><br/>The actress who plays Pickett/Jackson's wife is the key to my realization about the new version. She has no credit for Gettysburg, yet I clearly remember both she and the term ""mi esposa"" from it.<br/><br/>As I recall, we both enjoyed or, more precisely, we were both deeply moved by this film and would recommend it highly despite its length and the tediousness of some scenes. In point of fact, isn't war always long stretches of tedious boredom punctuated by flashes of terror, gore and gruesome death?

","This film is ostensibly based on the great novel ""The Killer Angels"" by Michael Shaara. While the history matches, most of the original dialogue made me cringe.<br/><br/>According to this politically correct film, most Confederate generals were angry religious kooks who were stupid enough that they could have invaded Pennsylvania only through some bizarre accident. Meanwhile, the Good Guys in Blue Coats(TM) all fought for Tolerance and Enlightenment(TM)! If the filmmakers had discarded the weaker speeches and lame dialogue, ""Gettysburg"" would be about two hours long, by my estimate.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Jeff Daniels shines as a realistic Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. The film is not the gratuitous gore-fest it would have been with many directors, and the battle scenes are cinematically well-shot.<br/><br/>For a better Civil War film, see ""Gods and Generals,"" which is a prequel of sorts to this one. It is based on the novel of the same name by Jeff Shaara, Michael's son, and remains mostly true to the spirit of the Shaara novels."

","Who's going to want to watch a movie about the American Civil War? Oh, sure, maybe the public will watch an ageless soap opera like ""Gone With the Wind"" but a movie about nothing but a BATTLE? No women in it? No slashers? No aliens or car chases or huge explosions or sex? Americans seem to have little interest in their own history. A recent survey of high school seniors found that a majority could not place the American Civil War in its proper half-century.<br/><br/>In a way, it's not too bad to have moguls in charge of things instead of a committee of MBAs whose eyes dart first to the bottom line. It USED to be this way in the movies when there was still a studio system and the Louis B. Mayers and Sam Goldwyns and Harry Cohns could manage (or mismanage) their empires as they liked. It used to be that way in publishing too. Mr. Simon and Mr. Schuster and Mr. Knopf and Mr. Scribner could print whatever they liked, even if they thought it would turn out to be a quality loser instead of an immensely profitable but brainless blockbuster.<br/><br/>That's all pretty much changed now, and a lot of people would argue not for the better. So you have to give Ted Turner a lot of credit for financing this expensive production. As Ronald F. Maxwell, the director, put it -- ""He followed his passion."" (Cf., Joseph Campbell, ""Follow your bliss."") You have to give the reenactors credit for following their passions too. I doubt that they were paid although I expect they were fed. For what it's worth, the staging of the scene in which Lt. Chamberlain chats with three Confederate prisoners is copied directly from a Winslow Homer painting.<br/><br/>It's an excellent movie, blending character study with action. Of the performances, I thought among the best were Sheen as Lee, Lang as Pickett, Jordan as Armistad, and Mallon, who played Winfield Scott Hancock. Not that the other performances were poor. They're all up to professional snuff but, well, for instance, how much could Jeff Daniels do with a character who is a taciturn and inexpressive New Englander beyond speaking his lines woodenly? I should also mention Lancaster as the British observer. He's pretty good. He comes across at first as simpering and dressed like a bellboy in a fancy French hotel, but when the situation calls for it his head tilts back and his eyes narrow searchingly. He does a splendid job of being just friendly enough to absorb information without expressing any opinions about the events he witnesses. It's a small part but nicely done. Stephen Lang's General Pickett is a descendant of the cavaliers who settled the South, gentlemanly, proud, brave, and filled with a kind of Errol Flynn factor. Sheen's Lee is thoughtful, religious, and wrong in his decisions. Jeb Stuart has a small part, as he did in the battle itself. He was given to riding in complete circles around the opposing Federal army and he did it at Gettysburg too, but that wasn't his job.<br/><br/>I won't go on about the story of the battle itself because, if the MBAs are correct in their assumptions about us, any further discussion of the battle would be a spoiler. So -- no hints about who won. (PS: There is no Confederate States of America anymore.) What a bloody and stupid war that was. Well, they all are of course, but some are unavoidable while others seem even more irrational than most. And the emotions generated by that conflict seem to persist beyond any real reason. It wasn't that long ago that roadside stands in the South displayed beach towels picturing a tattered Confederate soldier carrying the battle flag over his shoulder, and the caption, ""Hell no, we won't forget."" Why not? Nobody who fought that war is still alive. It's the sort of sentiment that will lead to the next war and the one after that.<br/><br/>The production could have used more maps though. We get exchanges like this, between General Buford and a courier. ""What is Heath doing?"" ""He says to tell you he's putting in his reserves, sir, but not all of them. What should I tell Heath?"" ""Tell him to put in his reserves -- ALL of them."" Who and where is Heath? Why should he put in all of his reserves?"

I don't know how much of it is true but i find it hard to believe that such a great and respected general could have been so stupid. Also,in this battle the losses on both sides were enormous and about equal,but judging from this movie one gets the impression that the Yankees practically butchered the Confederates,and one wonders how the war went on for another two years or how anybody would respect and follow general Lee after such a stupid disaster.

My main gripe is the camera remained too tight on the actio and lost the sweeping panorama (Cliche, I know) of the events. I am refering to the Little Round Top sequence. The early battle scene with General Buford's Cavalary was a better example - mix long shots and close ups. Repeating three times the same shot - a close uo of Jeff Daniels' character Colonel Chamberlin firing his revolver is inexcusable. He is a major character.<br/><br/>The director should have spent more time watching John Ford's four calavry films,John Huston's ""Red Badge of Courage"", and  ""Lawerence of Arabia"" to get a sense of perspective.<br/><br/>On a positive note, Jeff Daniel's characterization of the decent Colonel Joshua Chamberlin was the most impressive work I have seen by him. I look forward to seeing his continued portyal in the sequel.  Not that it matters much but I have an uncle, much removed, who werved a a corporal in the 8th Maine.

There are virtually no large panoramic shots of the battlefield to give the viewer any kind of sense of scale. We've read for years about the grandeur, for example, of Pickett's charge.

That said, as much as I love the movie Gettysburg (being a fanatical amateur historian), I cannot honestly place it in my top-five (three, four, or whatever) movies. However, it is as close to being an accurate representation of historical facts as Hollywood is willing to get.<br/><br/>For my top movies, therefore (which all happen to be period pieces), I must choose those which accurately reflect a certain period, without becoming caught up in historical facts.<br/><br/>
In no particular order:<br/><br/>. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN: As real a depiction of combat which has ever been placed on film. Brilliant in that it accurately portrays the D-Day landings and breakout without becoming hung up on the facts -- the only ""true-life"" character in the movie is George C. Marshall.<br/><br/>. SCHINDLER'S LIST: Ditto, above, substituting ""Holocaust"" for ""D-Day landings"" -- although the story is based more on facts than Saving Private Ryan. Exemplifies Speilberg's genius in being able to tell a good story accurately while remaining loyal to the subject matter.<br/><br/>. UNFORGIVEN: Hands-down the best Western ever made (plus one of Clint's best performances). Again, accurate, without relying on facts, Unforgiven is probably the truest (?) depiction of the ""Old West"" on film, showing that not all historical figures from that era were larger-than-life characters -- nor were they all ""good guys"" vs. ""bad guys."" Actual history is replete with such grey areas.<br/><br/>. The GODFATHER, Parts I & II: I include parts I and II together, because I consider them two parts of the same movie (and don't get me started with Part III). Again, these follow the same patterns for success in historical filmmaking in that they accurately reflect historical eras, people and places, without having to be slavish to actual facts. Plus, they offer a brilliantly classic story line that rivals Greek tragedy.<br/><br/>Honorable Mention (also in no particular order):<br/><br/>A Thin Red Line; Empire of the Sun; Gallipoli; Breaker Morant; Lawrence of Arabia; Glory; Goodfellas; Braveheart; Gladiator; Last of the Mohicans (1992 version); The Bounty (1984 version); Age of Innocence; The English Patient; Dr. Zhivago and yes, last but not least, GETTYSBURG.<br/><br/>
I could go on and on, but I'll stop there.<br/><br/>P.S. -- Throw in Animal House -- apropos of nothing, except that it's my favorite goofball comedy."

"emverano","9","0","1","29 October 2001"," Not Perfect, But Excellent. I Recommend it.
","Over the last twenty to thirty years, movie studios have been reluctant to make history-based large epic films because they cost so much but are rarely successful financially.  In spite of this trend, in 1993 Turner Movie released ""Gettysburg,"" a large-scale epic film depicting the decisive 1863 Civil War battle.  When I saw this film for the first time back in 1993, I thought that it is an excellent film although not perfect.   <br/><br/>
The cast members were generally excellent.  Although some professional critics gave negative comments about Martin Sheen's portrayal of Gen. Robert E. Lee, I felt that Sheen did a great job of depicting this Civil War general.  I still clearly remember the nobility of Sheen's Lee when he answered his soldiers' cheer of  `Lee! Lee! Lee!' Tom Berenger, who is really at home playing gung-ho characters, superbly played Gen. Long-street, a large, tacit man.  Sam Shepherd played the forgotten hero of Gettysburg, Brigadier Gen. John Buford, quietly and convincingly.  Jeff Bridges was excellent as the dauntless scholar-soldier, Col. (later Major General) Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who won the skirmish on the Big Round Top which, some historians say, changed the entire course of the Battle of Gettysburg and ultimately the Civil War.  Bridges played this quiet ex-college professor, who immediately went back to teaching after the Civil War, so ef-fectively that I could feel this scholar-soldier's courage and strength through his performance. I was glad to see Buck Taylor, whom I have not seen for a long time.  (He was Newly O'Brien in the TV series ""Gun-smoke."")  Thanks to the great performance of the cast members, I was not once bored during the entire 4-hour duration of this very long film. <br/><br/>
The battle scenes were staged competently. Unlike many other films, this movie was not myopic in its portrayal of battle scenes.  Many other war movies look awfully myopic because the directors have to make a limited number of extras to look like tens of thousands of soldiers; therefore, they can rarely use the panoramic long shot.  However, for this film, the director assembled thousands of Civil War re-enacters and, therefore, could use many panoramic long shots.  For example, Pickett's charge (estimated to be 15,000 strong historically) absolutely came to life in this film.  I knew about this ill-fated charge since I was only about eight; nevertheless, until I saw this film, it was merely a vague description in pages of history books.  It was re-enacted magnificently in this film with approximately 5000 Civil-War re-enacters. <br/><br/>There are many good points about the script.   I am happy to see that the creative minds behind this film cared about historical accuracies unlike many other Hollywood screenwriters.  This film was relatively faithful to the history and the book ""Killer Angels.""  (Although Michael Schaara's ""Killer Angels"" is relatively accurate historically, the author did take some liberties with history--including some of the positions of the Union troops during the battle.)  Even though this movie was depicted largely from the point of view of some famous historical figures like Gen. Lee and Longstreet, many parts of this film was seen through the eyes of Col. Joshua Chamberlain, a historical character and a regular Joe who turned into a tiger when confronted by hundreds of screaming Confederates.  He is a sympathetic but heroic character whom an average moviegoer can easily relate to.  No screenwriter could have created a more ideal movie character than Col. Chamberlain, but he is a real human being who lived until just before World War I.  (This is a good lesson for many Hollywood writers who are known to frequently add unnecessary and boring fictional characters to historical epics. By adding fictional characters, the historical epic loses authenticity.  Moreover, there are usually no need to add fictional characters to history-based dramas.  Many of the historical figures--including Col. Chamberlain--are fascinating people, much more interesting than most of Hollywood's fictional characters.) <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, the script also has some Achilles' heels.  For some inexplicable reason, the screenwriters made many of the lines of the film's characters seem sermon-like and unnatural.  Take for instance, the conversation between Gen. Armistead and Lt. Colonel Freemantle just before Pickett's charge.  Armistead's lines were so stilted and unnatural.  He sounded more like a politician making a speech to a large audience or a preacher making a big Sunday sermon.  Because of the time constraint of a theatrical movie, many interesting subplots and story lines of the novel ""Killer Angels"" were deleted from the film.  (For example, the meeting between Longstreet and a shadowy pro-Confederate spy or the scene in which Gen. Meade and his staff were having a sumptuous meal oblivious to his starving men.)   To portray many of these interesting story lines, Turner Movie should have made `Gettysburg' into a ten-hour TV mini-series. <br/><br/>
Although not perfect, ""Gettysburg"" is a fine historical epic film.  I highly recommend this film."
"markguszak","6","0","2","26 July 2001"," Read the book!
","I had just read Sharra's ""Killer Angels"" when I rented this video. I thought that I would enjoy the film, because the book was so excellent. However, I was a bit dismayed. The movie simply lacks a lot of the emotion found in the book. Moreover, the director chooses to ignore some of the more interesting storylines in favor of some of the more inane ones. In fact, the movie is somewhat contradictory to the book in some places. It does a very poor job of showing some of the anger that many of the Confederate Generals had towards Lee and Stuart. Moreover, it fails to show just how fanatic the Rebs were in there trust of Lee and how that fanaticism, led to their defeat. However, the thing I disliked most about this film was Martin Sheen as General Lee. His accent was laughable and physically was not near the specimen of the actual Lee. Sharra's book was a very open and critical look at the battle of Gettysburg, this movie was not. Not a bad movie, it just had big shoes to fill, because the book was that good."

","Of course historical films all use a ""fudge factor"" to keep the audience involved with the characters - but.... I was dragged to this movie kicking and screaming about a 3 hour history lesson.  I left crying and deeply moved.  We took our next vacation in Gettysburg.  I recommend this film most highly.  We are on our second VHS set and our 3rd CD soundtrack.  See this film!!!"
"Kurt Lehr","Null","0","1","6 July 2001"," Good movie with flaws, but very riveting
","Despite the numerous historical attacks on minute details by historians and psudo-historians, Gettysburg is a good film: good enough to see time and time again. As a social studies teacher, I have shown the Pickett's Charge scenes to students, and as a movie fan, have seen the movie, and sections of it, repeatedly.  The battle scenes are nothing like the gory-yet-riveting Saving Private Ryan or even like those in another Civil War film, Glory, yet they more than measure up in scope and choreography, due in no small part to the reenactors and the main stars. The main characters of the film, however, are the reason to watch Gettysburg. You know you want one side or the other to win, but there's good guys on both sides, and you hope for a draw, and that no one gets hurt.  So much for wishful thinking.<br/><br/>This was to be a TV movie, and elements of this are apparent. The often melodramatic speeches by the stars and amateurish acting of the bit players shines through in many spots, and one often winces at some of the over-acted performances and hokey dialogue. One wonders why more heavyweight players weren't in place as generals: many of the actors' resumes are sparce in comparison to the four or five ""big stars"" of the film.<br/><br/>A surprising star of the film is Randy Edelman's musical arrangement and soundtrack: the music, both the score and historic tunes (Dixie), are performed and mixed perfectly, saving many an otherwise snoozy or sappy scene: one of the best soundtracks in recent years for a historical film, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The Confederate General George Pickett, played by Stephen Lang, almost steals the show. Other good performances are Martin Sheen's pious, contemplative, exhausted Robert E. Lee, Tom Berenger's cautious Gen. Longstreet, and Jeff Daniels' thoughtful Col. Joshua Chamberlain. Sam Elliott played U.S. Cavalry General John Buford, and was his usual excellent self. I could have done without the often-fruity performance of James Lancaster's Col. Freemantle, the British observer. Also, the guy playing J.E.B Stuart quite simply needed to glue his fake beard on better. (I was waiting for Lee to put a piece of Halloween candy in his pumpkin bag when Stuart arrived at Lee's headquarters' door.) But this is nitpicking an otherwise good film.<br/><br/>You'll find yourself quoting quotes from the film. Try waking your kid up in the morning by saying ""Colonel Darlin', rise up, me bucco,"" in a thick Irish brogue. During your next one-sided flag football game, try screaming out ""What's happening to my boys?"" as did Lang's Pickett during the slaughter; or even saying a frustrated ""Damn!"" when you don't get those office supplies you ordered, as did Berenger's Longstreet when he found out that his attack was to happen with little artillery support. You'll get weird looks, but it'll prompt a repeat showing of a good historical film."

","This is a very good film. This is especially true considering how long it is. Most films about the same length tend to get boring. While it does get preachy at times, but it gets back to the action quickly. However, I feel the filmakers portrayal of General Lee was off. At times it seems like he is a dottering old fool. The worst case of this is at the end when Lee and Longstreet are talking about retreating the army. To me this does not seem like the General Lee I learned about in School. I know the filmmakers had to try to justify why Lee would order the disastrous Picket's charge. However, I find it hard to believe that a the General Lee shown in the film could be the same man who held off the Union army for almost 4 years."

"ddicarlo-2","Null","0","1","22 February 2000"," This movie failed to deliver; far to sterile
","Though it may be regarded as blasphemy, I did not think that ""Gettysburg"" was very good. In fact I thought it failed miserably to deliver the horror of 19th century warfare as well as the mood of the country in 1863. By that I mean how Lincoln was under tremendous pressure to find a diplomatic solution after several bloody attempts at capturing Richmond had failed. This is very important to remember in understanding what was at stake when R.E. Lee made his move into Pennsylvania. While watching this movie one does not get a sense of urgency that the Union Nation has been invaded and there is a general panic throughout the lower north. I said blasphemy because I would not have followed Michael Sharra's format so faithfully, but rather use a little of what Sharra did and join it with a little of what Attenborough did in ""A Bridge Too Far"" and you will get the perfect mix of History and dramatic license. As far as the horrors of 19th century warfare this movie was so incredibly sterile. ""Glory"" was a FAR FAR better movie (on all levels)in it's depiction of Civil War combat. I guess it's a question of quality ""Glory"", over quantity ""Gettysburg"". Do Civil War Reenactors really make the best extras? it sounds like it would work on paper. Professional Civil War soldiers must sound great to movie studios but in reality they are entirely too well fed and far to old. Were there really so many white haired privates and corporals? ""Getysburg"" tried so hard to be profound and sublime but it just fell so flat. I don't think the cast would have been anyones first choice and some of those actors were down right bad (the guy who was Hancock)!!!! And if your not going to develop Gen. John Reynolds character then don't show us his death and try and create a powerful 10 second scene in which we're supposed to be riveted by the heroic death of a character whom we don't even know. ""Gettysburg"" should and could have been one of those ""David L. Wolper"" extravaganzas from the 70's or 80's nice, censored, sterile, and hardly uncomfortable to watch."

","In his defense, were YOU there when they said those lines? Were any of us there?

Now I understand that this is something a plus since the soldiers that fell in Gettysbugrg were all heroes and we should see them at their best. Really, should we have everyone give their own little speech?<br/><br/>If you look at Glory, the dialogue flows together making one whole movie. One story. Gettysburg is a mixed up culmination of several stories going at once. That can be thrilling for the true Civil War fanatic but to the general audience it's not fun to listen."

It appeared to me that the directors and producers wanted to glorify the battle even beyond and that is a total thumbs down. If you're looking ot see a Civil War movie, try ""GLORY"" instead and skip this."
