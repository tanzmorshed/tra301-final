"johaschrei","7","99","123","6 May 2015"," Good movie, reflecting witch hunt mentality in social media/TV
","I never wrote a review before in my life so please excuse my poor attempt, but after reading some of the reviews I just felt I had to give it a try.<br/><br/>I really thought this movie was very good. It's starts as the typical ""missing wife, husband main suspect, no body yet found"" tale we all have seen once in our lives. But after the first act it really gets extremely unsettling and special. I felt sick in between because of the horrible, frightening character of Amy. I can't describe it any further and think you should simply give it a try.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>I now would like to address certain plot holes many people have been pointing out. <br/><br/>First of all, every movie has plot holes. I'm usually the first to notice, and even though there were some things that bothered me I got over them quite quickly since the movie had a tight grip on me.<br/><br/>Many are mentioning to different cameras in Desis house. First of all I know that many surveillance cameras overwrite their data after some time, so it is very likely that only the last few days (where she never left or entered the house) would be available to the police. Second of all, as far as I could see, the cameras only showed the outside of the house not what was happening IN the house. That's why she went near the window, which was within the perimeter of one of the cameras, to do her screaming attack. If you pay attention, you never see Amy appearing on any of the cameras when she checks them, only when she actually wants to be seen.<br/><br/>I could address many other so called ""plot holes"". I don't think they actually were plot holes per se, but made intentionally in order for us watchers to go...""But wait, how does she get away with this??"". Think of the police officer who is in doubt of Amy's statements or even the lawyer.<br/><br/>What Fincher in my opinion wanted to demonstrate is the exemplary control Amy had over the public, were no questions were asked, nobody ever doubted her. It is kind of symbolic for witch hunts we ourselves have witnessed on TV or social media, were no second opinion is sought, nobody looks at the story from a second angle. Amy is the personification of the American Sweetheart, and is treated as such. It just shows us how blind and angry the crowd gets when you push certain buttons, Amy herself actually talks about that in the car scene. The pregnant intelligent wife, who was cheated by her husband. Or the poor girl next door who was always nice to the strange kid. Or the rich guy who thought he could have everything. <br/><br/>That is basically the story and that's why this film is so intriguing in my opinion. It's a mirror of how our society in the age of internet, social media, TV etc. functions. How we can be tricked into anger or sadness, and how little people actually question certain statements."

","How on earth is this film attracting so much criticism?! This is one of the best films of 2014 and people are labelling it ""utter tripe"", ""an enormous heap of illogic and nonsense"", ""wish I had missed it"". Are these people serious? Can we no longer appreciate - or even identify - a great film?!<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a peerless plot-driven story about a wife who goes missing. Seems pretty ordinary, right? Well it's not. And it doesn't take very long at all for any sane viewer to recognise this. <br/><br/>You start watching and - as you do with any mystery - you start collecting the clues and piecing together an explanation for the events which have taken place. But no sooner than you have formed the perfect explanation in your mind is it immediately swept away in the most overwhelming twist of the year. <br/><br/>And it only gets better from there.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a roller-coaster; only you're riding it in the dark. You don't know where the next turn is, you can't see where you're headed, and you have no idea how many more ups and downs you're going to experience before it's all over. <br/><br/>It's a film that keeps you guessing and just as you're beginning to (once again) think you've got it all figured out, the game changes and it's all up in the air once more. <br/><br/>The diary-exposition format is also very clever and was executed perfectly. Many films fall victim to losing the viewer when jumping back and forth between past and present, yet Gone Girl - you guessed it - does it just right.<br/><br/>This film ranks high in the mystery/thriller genre. It is just as compelling and perplexing as Shutter Island - if not then moreso. <br/><br/>And let's not forget: the acting. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike do a phenomenal job in their roles as husband and wife. Not a line feels out of place and both seem as though they were born to play Nick and Amy Dunne. By the end of the film I felt so immersed in their story that I found it hard to believe it was just a film. <br/><br/>All in all, I for one am thoroughly pleased with Gone Girl. I knew from watching the trailer it would be something I would like, I just never imagined it could thrill me this much.<br/><br/>A very underrated and overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by all."

","Wow, actually a thriller that's pretty good. Yes, it's fair to say that 'Gone Girl' is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it's based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven't read the book, so I haven't got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don't care. I just enjoyed the ride.<br/><br/>'Gone Girl' is one of those films where you don't want to say too much about for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who haven't seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose well-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts to reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems (not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It's fair to say that what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really get one chance to watch it and not know what's coming.<br/><br/>Many people don't really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even less now he's due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will relate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You'll have to wait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with a flawless American accent. Again, you'll have to see whether she's found alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time, making sure you're just confused enough never to put too much together before the film's ready to reveal what's happening.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint it's that the film is a little too long. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three quarters mark, just to speed it up. But that's a minor gripe. Basically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a couple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate on) give this one a go."
"BoxOfficeKid","10","240","368","21 December 2014"," Slow burner with a twist for the ages. Fincher does it again.
","The first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing, the husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in the theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers. To the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not the case with Gone Girl.<br/><br/>Yes, the first act is very ordinary, but the second act uproots whatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn into thriller stardom, resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock movie. Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's narrative through editing, and Fincher is one of them. I know there is a lot of praise around Rosamund Pike's performance, which makes it easy to overlook Ben Affleck. He plays the tired, oblivious and boyish really well. This may be the very reason why he is completely overlooked.<br/><br/>And in a time of sequels, prequels, remakes and biopics, finally a contemporary piece of work! Stellar!"
"CalRhys","Null","472","749","8 October 2014"," Dark And Twisted, Full Of Great Visual Storytelling
","Dark and twisted, David Fincher's stylish new mystery thriller was derived from Gillian Flynn's intriguingly slick tale from her complex and suspenseful novel. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck, 'Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as a mainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audience within the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario. Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which makes 'Gone Girl' a movie full of great visual storytelling."

"avik-basu1889","9","144","229","19 December 2014"," All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players !!!!!!
","I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher. <br/><br/>Like many of his previous films, Gone Girl is a very long film, but in a true Fincher-esque fashion, it is as engaging as possible without any scope for the viewer to feel bored. The pacing is perfect. The scenes have a dreamy style to it, which brings the dilemma of ""whether this is a true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator."" <br/><br/>The theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are all actors and pretenders. Very seldom do we decide to be our real selves. Generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good in front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person that our nearest and dearest want us to be. Gillian Flynn's screenplay based on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment of how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a cynical account of the institution of marriage.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is good, but this movie from an acting perspective belongs to Rosamund Pike. She owns every scene that she is in and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.<br/><br/>Fincher has once again has made a fantastic film. The last 30 minutes might not be completely logical, but it is still symbolic. If you are about to get married,stay away from Gone Girl."
"mariontalavera8","10","173","285","3 November 2014"," Best performance of an actress for 2014!
","Having read the book, it was not an easy feat who will be able to bring to life the leading character of the book, which is Amy Dunne. Her character is so complex, that Rosamund Pike deserves all awards that will be coming to her. She was able to give Amy the mysterious vibe but likable aura of a socialite New Yorker.<br/><br/>The score of the film is perfect, as it builds up suspense and the tone of the story. Great supporting performance by Ben Affleck, and the actress who plays her sister. Great ensemble cast who works together to delivery the dark humor lines in the film.<br/><br/>This movie will definitely be an instant classic and I cant wait to watch it again!"
"banana-83","1","1085","1912","11 October 2014"," An enormous junk heap of illogic and nonsense
","One of the most ridiculous spectacles of bad storytelling I have ever  seen in my entire life.  ""Gone Girl"" gets its title I think, from the fact that she was supposed  to be done away with (murdered and disposed of) but is really ""gone""  psychologicallyshe is a pure psychopath.  The movie tries to tell you that she is highly intelligent, and  meticulously plans to fake her own murder and frame her husband for it.  Here's the pathetic execution of her plan:  1. he leaves the house one morning, and she springs into action.   2. she breaks the glass coffee table, pours about a half quart of her  own blood in one puddle, in front of the kitchen sink. That much blood  from a violent attack would be all over the room.   3. she flees, leaving the front door open.   4. A nosy neighbor notices the door ajar and calls the husband (somehow  the neighbor knows exactly where he is.) But no one saw the wife leave.  5. The husband comes home. He has not a scratch on him.   6. he is totally co-operative with the police.   7. They eventually find her diary In a wood stove at the husbands  father's house. The wood stove door is ajar and the diary is only  partially burned; it really makes you wonder how that played outthat  the husband put the diary in there to burn but just left it singed, all  that work, cleaning up the blood at home, but not to burn the book, as  if he needed to make a special trip to his dad's house to dispose of a  stupid book. and the only thing incriminating that she wrote was on one  page which he could've simply torn out.   8. When the wife runs away, she only changes her appearance slightly  and then, instead of secluding herself, she makes friends with some  low-lifes, with whom she sits and watches her story unfold on TV.   9. she murders the Neil Harris character in an attempt to switch the  blame to him. That would then imply he was the one that drained so much  blood from her back at her home, he cleaned it up and he put her diary  in the wood stove (?!)   His car wasn't seen at her house.   He then kept her a prisoner, starved and raped her.Yet she found the  opportunity and strength to kill him, but didn't call the police from  his house to come rescue her. rather she jumps in his car and drives  all the way home.   10. upon returning home she has no wounds consistent with the  bloodletting at her original house or at the hands of her alleged  kidnapper.   11. There is no visit to or investigation of the alleged kidnapping  crime scenehouse on the lake.  12. The hospital sends her home in a nurses uniform, underneath which  she is still caked in blood.  This movie is just about the lamest piece of S**** I have ever seen."
"bmcdannell","1","696","1217","3 November 2014"," Astonishingly bad plot
","If this had been written and played as a straight-out dark comedy - and if it had been at least half an hour shorter - perhaps it would have passed as a run of the mill movie. But since it has been presented as a serious mystery, it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking - that of disrespecting the intelligence and/or perspicacity of the audience. For us, the film represents a significant achievement in that it contains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen - and we've seen many! This was even worse than Babel! That said - and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory - the following is by no means a comprehensive list of the major holes in the plot. So ladies and gentlemen, start your engines and drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plot stupidity: 1. Amy buys a car listed on Craigslist for cash so there's no record of the purchase. How about title and license? Where does she keep the car until she needs it? How does she get to it when she needs it without being seen? 2. Amy buys lots of tech toys and crams her sister-in-law's shed with them. How does she get into and out of the shed without her sister-in-law (who doesn't like her) noticing? 3. The shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman. They don't notice the accumulating gadgets? 4. The gadgets are bought online. Who is signing for them? 5. When the gadgets are investigated, whose fingerprints will be all over them - if there are any? 6. Desi is supposed to have broken into the house, beat her bloody and kidnapped her. There's blood all over the kitchen, but none where she would have been dragged out of the house? 7. As he supposedly leaves the house with an at best barely conscious Amy, Desi picks up her diary, takes it to her father-in-law's place and attempts to burn it in the furnace. Why? 8. How does Desi know where Amy's father-in-law lives? 9. Several days elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until Amy winds up at Desi's lake house. Can nobody attest to Desi's being at home during the time he was supposed to be kidnapping Amy? 10. What will be made of the video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for the first several days? 11. Desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner. Did nobody at the casino notice them there - including the man who thought she looked familiar? 12. Where does Amy's car wind up? 13. Phone records I: Amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the police off to the contents of the shed. No record of that? 14. Amy scores a hole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy - which causes her money belt to fall off. This apparently was an Acme money belt on loan from Wile E. Coyote. 15. A couple robs Amy of all her money. Being the psycho she is, are we to believe that she is going to let them get away with it? 16. Phone records II. What is going to be made of Amy's phone call to Desi? Sure it was from a pay phone, but isn't it going to raise any flags? 17. Amy self-inflicts wounds - supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras - to make it seem as though she has been bound and raped. Yet wouldn't the cameras show her entering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18. Amy winds up in the hospital upon her return. They put wristbands on her and one guesses they examine her - but they don't bother to wash the blood off of her. 19. Do they also fail to notice that there is no evidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20. Nick knows that Amy tried to set him up for her murder, thus opening him up to a possible death sentence. He also knows that when her plan blows up, she elects to murder someone who has never wronged her (other than being male) in order to cover up her actions which, until that point, may have been criminal - but not capital - offenses. Why does Nick elect to live in the same county as this woman, let alone in the same house? I could go on, but I realized before the movie was halfway over that I had already wasted too much of my life on it."

","I'm only writing this review because I noticed this appears in the top 3 of IMDb's ""Top Movies of 2014"" at the time of writing. This in itself was enough to make me p*ss my trousers, but I then went on to read some of the reviews, after which I completely soiled myself.<br/><br/>I'm all for suspension of disbelief, especially when watching Hollywood fare, but how is anyone buying this bullsh*t - and people are making comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock!? <br/><br/>It's as if the second half of the movie forgets the first half had happened. Let's look at what unfolds:<br/><br/>Psycho woman fakes own murder and plants enough clues around to implicate her husband. All the clues are so contrived that, for a short while, even the detective suspects all is not what it seems.<br/><br/>Meanwhile psycho wife has skipped out of town and disguised herself by dying her hair slightly less blonde and smacking herself in the cheek with a hammer, presumably to look like some trailer trash victim of domestic abuse and consequently giving her an excuse to wear Jackie Onasis sunglasses. All of this is keenly noted by the perceptive woman she moves next door to, yet despite watching her story on the news every day, her actual identity completely illudes the observant neighbour.<br/><br/>Despite psycho woman's meticulous planning and care, everything unravels when she accidentally drops a money belt (how does this happen?) with all of her cash in it, whilst, wait for it, playing crazy golf thus tempting said woman next door to rob her, which she does with the aid of her hick boyfriend. Calculating psycho woman sits by and does nothing at this stage. Instead choosing to call up an ex boyfriend and potentially throwing her entire plan to the wall. Luckily (phew!) her ex boyfriend is so obsessed with her (no-one knows why at this stage, or even cares) that he puts her up in his lake house with security cameras everywhere for her safety. He is quite happy for an innocent man to be sentenced to death it appears, despite having a visit from the guy in which he implies that there may be more to his wife than meets the eye. He does have very expensive sheets though.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, despite their best efforts, animators fail to make the Ben Affleck model appear in any way emotional or human. Not even CGI has any effect, so they just give up an go home. By now, no-one in the audience cares and Ben is replaced with a peace of plasticine that was left over when Tony Heart created Morph. Nobody, not even the supporting actors, notice.<br/><br/>Just when you think things couldn't become more contrived, psycho wife ties a ribbon round her ankle and throws some wine down her top to emulate the fact that she has been raped (?), or had a miscarriage, or just, I don't know, ""Was that her favourite top she threw wine over, because she looks very upset in front of the porch camera."" <br/><br/>She then has what clearly appears to be (for the sake of the cameras), consensual sex with her ex, before cutting his throat with a box cutter and making a dramatic return to her husband, without so much as a call to the police. Falling into her play-doh spouses arms, she is then rushed to hospital, where she convinces local detectives and the FBI that she was abducted and held as a prisoner, by her ex, this whole time. Detectives and FBI suddenly suffer from complete amnesia and forget entirely about the murder set up. If she was abducted by her ex storming into the house and whacking her with a club, why does she have no injuries, is she some kind of self healing salamander. She'd only been gone for just over a week. Why did no'one notice this altercation, or the ex-boyfriend appearing in the middle of the day - after all, the neighbour noticed the door was open? Where did the several pints of blood come from on the kitchen floor? Why was the lounge area staged? Did the ex-boyfriend leave a slightly charred copy of her diary in her husband's father's oven? Even window-putty Nick has the sense to ask ""Erm, how did she cut his throat if she was tied up all the time as she claims?"" ""To which the uninquisitive police response is, wait for it, ""Can't you just be happy your wife is home?""<br/><br/>""Yes, of course, we should invite Bundy, Manson and the Wests around and celebrate""<br/><br/>It's good to know that all you need to do, to hoodwink the FBI is act like a damsel in distress, wrap some rope around your wrists too tightly, and re-enact a scene from Big Brother using a champagne bottle for them to forget any evidence that may implicate you in murder or conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. <br/><br/>I'm sorry but even as some sort of metaphor about domestic bliss or mass media, this film fails on so many levels. <br/><br/>Total sh*t."
"antonius87","2","380","659","7 October 2014"," What a terrible lump of trash. I am baffled by the good reviews.
","I really cannot figure out why this movie is so highly reviewed. Everything it sells itself as is a lie. For starters, it is portrayed as this suspenseful thriller where there are constant twists and turns and you never really know what is truly happening. Well, that is a total lie. There is no suspense, there are no serious or intelligent twists, just a litany of idiotic contrived absurdities.<br/><br/>Spoilers below: <br/><br/>You clearly see what is happening in very beginning with Nick (Ben Affleck) and you pretty much know he did not kill his wife 30 minutes in. Your initial sense is that she is not dead and he did not kill her, and you are right. There are no more ""twists. ""The ""twist"" is that she is insane, and the movie descends into 2 more hours of ever increasing idiocy and farcical garbage. Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes off into a series of illogical and irrational behaviors, including consorting with some random trash at a trailer park, despite having faked her own death and being the subject of a massive manhunt. The story just gets more and more absurd, with more illogical stupidity and unbelievable actions by other characters, which include police getting a search warrant on a house based on an ""anonymous tip,"" Nick and his sister being apparently the dumbest people on Earth who would not move any of the loot out of the shed before the cops find it, the police engaging in the largest manhunt ever for a missing person after about 6 hours, etc. The movie starts out decent but gets continually worse as it goes on, and just starts getting worse and worse at a faster rate as it continues.<br/><br/>The acting is decent to middling, with Affleck probably giving one of the better performances overall, and Tyler Perry actually being an enjoyable aside. The other characters are largely unlikeable, unbelievable or just stilted caricatures.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes are, as others have noted, unbelievably ridiculous and moronic. The woman who so carefully plans out her own death with a massive amount of preplanning, somehow commits a savage crime of passion, which is a story FILLED with holes, but somehow is supposed to have gotten away with it. Also, apparently even though she plotted all along to have her husband executed, she somehow had the presence of mind to save the sperm sample, keep it, then AFTER he is exonerated and she has to alter her plans to return to him last minute after murdering someone else, has the means to get it successfully implanted in herself. Oh, she is an absolute psychic apparently.<br/><br/>The ending is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic farces that only someone who desperately wants to love this movie would believe, the story is overrun with artificial plot devices and deus ex machinas that serve only to advance nonsensical story lines, and the movie is in no way a twisting, changing thriller. Its just a predictable drama where the only ""unexpected"" things are unexpected because they are absolute nonsense that are make about as much sense as random dog running on stage and relieving itself. One of the worst movies I have seen in years."

","I guess one thing this movie is really good at is getting people to just roll with whatever happens. Well, it's also beautifully shot and well-paced. But if you are intent on watching 'Gone Girl', I dare you to stay critical. Think logical. Because if you do, the plot is almost insultingly bad.<br/><br/>Plot: (spoilers)<br/><br/>Woman fakes her own murder and tries to frame her cheating, violent husband for it (a divorce wouldn't do?). In the movie you're presented with the framing plot around the 1-hour mark (or far earlier if you see it coming). So what happens for the rest of the movie? A train- wreck, is what. <br/><br/>-The GOAL was to have her husband killed. As soon as she loses ALL of her runaway money (what was her plan once her husband was jailed, anyway?), she flees to her obsessive, creepy high-school sweetheart (who, mind you, was already similarly framed once before). Once he turns possessive (who'd have thought!), she KILLS him rather than try to flee, and manages to drive home, fully blood-clad, without alerting anyone along the way. Home, to the husband she wanted dead... right?<br/><br/>-Upon arriving, she gives the police a terribly contrived story where she explains to have been kidnapped and raped day after day (doesn't really match with the security footage) until she (mercilessly!) killed her alleged captor. What she says hardly makes sense (interrupted several times by the one investigator who still has a brain), yet she is simply sent home. Still covered in blood. Yes, really.<br/><br/>-There appears to be no further investigation in the past scheme of framing her husband: the countless credit card purchases stored in the shed, the diary which was conveniently left only slightly burned, the POOL OF BLOOD which was cleaned up in the original murder story (her kidnapper did all that??). The other ex-boyfriend who she had charged with statutory rape, surely he could help prove her extremely manipulative and utterly insane behavior?<br/><br/>-Despite all this, there is apparently ""no way"" to come up with any concrete evidence of her crimes. No, we're not even given a remotely satisfying conclusion to this mess of a story. SURPRISE: his sperm from the fertility clinic was somehow stopped by his wife from being destroyed (even though she wanted to kill him the entire time?) and she manages to get pregnant with it (without him, her husband, being alerted of this at all).<br/><br/>And then the credits roll, and I'm left thinking ""how come so many people actually like this movie""."

","Two movies for the price of one. <br/><br/>That's a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked, but it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard ""did he or didn't he"" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the perspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you're watching – perhaps – the most pitch-black comedy that you've ever seen. <br/><br/>Despite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together extremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck's Nick manages to inspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike's Amy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying, hilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all at the same time.<br/><br/>David Fincher's direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and several scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his brilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint would be over the length – it really didn't need to be two and a quarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in the first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to the point just a little more quickly.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a movie unlike any that I've ever seen before and as such largely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all (with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially those with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better."

The ensuing search and all the subsequent events, which shall not be revealed here, draw the viewer closer and closer into a complex world of everyday suburban reality and everyday suburban horror.<br/><br/>As if it needed to be pointed out, this balance of reality and horror, or horrendous reality, is the domain of Mr. Fincher. In his clear-cut no-nonsense style he has fashioned a powerful mystery-thriller that lands somewhere between Hitchcock, Lynch, Bergman and Chabrol. Although vastly different directors, they have shared an interest in dissecting reality and human nature.<br/><br/>Profiting from two exceptional lead actors (doubts about Mr. Affleck's acting abilities will hopefully be dispelled), it is Ms. Pike, who reveals herself as an immensely versatile and unpredictable force in this movie. Over more than ten years Ms. Pike has played big parts in small movies, or small parts in big movies (such as Pride & Prejudice"", Wrath of the Titans"" or Jack Reacher""). Under the guise of Mr. Fincher she excels in every aspect and if any contenders for awards are to be named so early in the season, hers would be one of the first names (next to the outstanding cast of Richard Linklaters Boyhood"") to be written down.<br/><br/>Visually stunning as one would expect from Fincher, with an immersive soundtrack by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross and an editing rhythm that cuts like a knife through the tissue of the story and its characters, Gone Girl"" leaves no doubt about its craft and the deceptive nature of its source novel by Gillian Flynn. The author adapted her book into a tightly wound screenplay, that adds fuel to an already burning analysis of modern marriage and human frailty.<br/><br/>The themes are familiar to Fincher, but he assembles them in an expertly fashion. And we are left wondering, amidst the suspense, about many of the so called estimable American values of the 20th century, that have now come crashing down under the weight of an economic, political and spiritual crisis."

","David Fincher is a phenomenal craftsman. His visual style dominates every inch of the frame but why is it that I left the theater so untouched, so unscathed. I told the story to someone over dinner and I couldn't do it without laughing. This is no comedy, or is it? So, what is it about David Fincher's movies that include some shocking stuff without shocking me. I can observe without participating. Cold, maybe that's it. The passionate story is told without passion but with a feverish attention to the cosmetic veil that covers or masks the real story. I wasn't bored, just impatient and a bit put off. I admired the performances and wondered about the casting of Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. I suspect is code for something but I can't imagine what. After all said and done, goo see it."

OK for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tells everyone that Neil Patrick Harris ""kidnapped"" her (Rosamund). He did this by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which he cleaned up. Then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house to burn!!!!! (how does he even know of this location)?????? But he makes such a p!$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to do properly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood. and no one questions this even once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No one even looks for any wounds or asks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds. Oh and the hospital sends her home covered I mean a copious amount blood. No flipping way, the hospital would clean her looking for wounds especially with this much blood.I could go on and on but just read the other truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring mistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense.

","Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film."

It's meant for those that anticipate watching the whole movie not just parts. It requires attention and attention to detail; thought provoking.

"ajaysinghjaswal-133-244502","4","75","124","15 November 2014"," Too Many Loose Ends
","I have not read the book so I cannot compare this movie with the book. But judging from the fact that Gillian Flynn has also written the screenplay of the movie I trust that the movie has done justice to the book. Which might not be a very good thing to say about the book because I wasn't very impressed with the movie. <br/><br/>Please don't get me wrong, I like David Fincher's works. He picks up off-the-line subjects and execute them very well. Sometimes he also leaves loose ends. Loose ends are not bad because sometimes they get the audience to think more than what the movie is trying to convey. Unfortunately, this movie has too many loose ends and turns. The movie starts as a psychological thriller then turns into a treasure hunt with well-planted clues which are easily understandable; then into a war between a smart psychopath wife and a clueless husband. In the end, the movie turns into a common hate story of a husband and a wife.<br/><br/>What surprises me in the movie is that the wife is a smart psychopath, the philandering husband also gets there gradually, being smart. But the general public, media and FBI are just dumb. How is it that FBI is not able to understand that a man gets enough time to go to his father's house to burn the diary but does not have enough time to burn it completely and still leave pages which can get him caught? How it is that FBI cannot find the missing wife? Now I am not a detective but I do know the general modus operandi of any detective agency - keep a tab on the previous acquaintances of a missing girl. Might not be a bad idea to pay a visit to one of her ex-boyfriends and Viola, there she is, living a good life. Found and case closed. More surprisingly, when the missing wife has decided to come back nobody even wants to re-look at the clues that she had planted against her husband. After all, everyone had started to doubt him. The list does not finish here. How come the camera at Desi's house can only catch her alone, evidently tortured. But there is no video of Desi actually torturing her. But no one wants to ask these questions to the wife. Only a few questions and FBI just lets her go. How come doctors forgot to check her so called bruises which she was supposed to have when her husband was supposedly dragging her?<br/><br/>So there are too many loose ends. Is it that the makers of the movie think that the general public both within the movie and out of the movie is so dumb? Within the movie, the general public thinks of the husband as bad guy when the wife is missing. But when she is found nobody is questioning her motives and now the poor-dead-ex-boyfriend is a bad guy. <br/><br/>On top that, there is a supposedly smart lawyer (Tyler Perry) who is of no help to the husband besides making few funny comments.<br/><br/>On the good side, Ben Affleck and Carrie Coon still managed to be convincing. Rosamund Pike is Okay. But that's the only good part I could see.<br/><br/>All in all, I am a little disappointed with David Fincher. Se7en, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button were really good movies and had given its audiences lot to think about. Unfortunately, this movie does not do that besides giving message that every man is a sex maniac and women are psychos. What surprises me the most, the book and the movie are getting good ratings. <br/><br/>These are only my opinions but if you still want to watch it please go ahead. After all it is your money. It does have few funny moments."

","Thought this would be a good thriller, but ultimately it was draining and depressing. Would think any man who sees this film would never want to have sex again......it portrayed woman/women as being monstrous and men as passive, sex-crazed zombies. The story had so many loose ends and unbelievable scenes, such as where she returns home covered in blood.....then she's at the hospital - there had to be an exam, then giving an interview to detectives, then comes home still covered in blood....how much time elapsed during these scenes, and who would allow her to drive around, carry on, covered in blood for all that time? With great emphasis on crass words for women, violent sex scenes, and a score that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an airport runway, this was one depressing film. The only place it was believable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in tragedy and perversion. If this becomes our prime form of entertainment we are in big trouble. Need to watch a pre-1960 film or musical now."

As for the story, I can deal with sad endings where the hero dies like Braveheart, Cool Hand Luke, and endless others. When the credits came up on Gone Girl, I could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me that angry. I would have preferred she had just killed Ben Affleck and gotten away with it. Assuming the book had the same ending I would have thrown it across the room upon finishing it. I enjoyed the movie up till the end but that completely ruined it for me."

The score was ham handed and clashed with the film itself and I was embarrassed for the actors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the terrible script. I felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie. At one point my husband turned to me and whispered ""this is really bad"" and we started laughing. Then we started rewriting the story and recasting. For example, Ben Affleck could have played his own twin sister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous. You might love it.

"mwburrows","9","169","299","11 October 2014"," Almost as terrible as the book.
","It's a mistake to recruit the author to do the screenplay - they are too emotionally invested, and if they aren't known for writing scripts the disparity in quality can be obvious. Take The Exorcist III for example. Or Gone Girl.<br/><br/>The Gone Girl novel was a lavishly praised exercise in cryptic dialogue, high school prose, and incompetent storytelling that defies conventional formula. Unfortunately, you can only defy the formula and get away with it if you are very good. Gillian Flynn just isn't. <br/><br/>Her characters speak with bizarre, hyperactive energy that made me feel breathless just from reading it. It's like listening to someone recall a fond memory at a party - a memory that nobody else cares about. It's inexplicably cryptic. It's not how people talk, and you can tell that on screen Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike don't really know what to make of their lines. Their sentences are too long, too wild, too verbose. They talk like stage actors fresh out of drama school. The supporting cast are also similarly lost - the two detectives especially. The female cop is just a frustrating ""loose- cannon-independent-woman/symbol-of-women's-suffrage"" poster girl. She talks fast and drinks coffee - black, no doubt (Yawn). Her male partner just seems to follow her around like a lost dog and nod agreeably with everything she says - three cheers for women's rights! Down with the glass ceiling! <br/><br/>You might as well slap a domestic violence advertisement in the credits.<br/><br/>The lack of tension evident in Flynn's writing translates well to the screen. Your nails will not be bitten to fleshy stubs watching Gone Girl. More likely you'll end up filing them into neat, buffed arches out of boredom. Fincher can't elevate the inherent drabness of the source material. He, like the rest of the cast, seem to misunderstand the script. They just ""don't get it."" Gone Girl is one of those wrongly-praised cause celebres. People are too keen to jump on the bandwagon after learning about the *gasp* ""shock twist"" in the final act (that is hardly shocking, original, or interesting). <br/><br/>Re-watch some of Fincher's better work instead. If you've already invested money in the novel, take solace in knowing it is the perfect size for a doorstop, and about as entertaining."

","Gone Girl is directed by the mastermind of David Fincher. Amazingly written by Gillian Flynn whom wrote the novel the film is based on. Starring Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as Amy Elliot Dunne. On the day of their 5th wedding anniversary Nick's wife, Amy disappears out of nowhere, and this crazy, intense and haunting journey begins. David Fincher and Gillian Flynn's intelligent storytelling trough out this fantastic journey will keep at the edge of your seat from start to end. The soundtrack and score is also very intense and haunting, and has huge impact on the film. The performances from all the actors, especially Rosamund Pike are top notch which really helps the element of the realism stand out in this film. <br/><br/>Gone Girl is easily the best film I have seen this year so far, and I have to give it a 10/10. It is also one of the best films from David Fincher in my opinion. I strongly advice everyone to go and see Gone Girl, it is one thrilling ride."

I must say that in general the acting is very bad, and there are very stupid moments. Like when the wife returns after killing her ex-boyfriend, she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood, telling the story that she was raped. Well nobody cleans all the blood of her in the hospital, and she is in a room with at least 10 FBI agents that look goofy, a lot of local police, plus husband, lawyer etc etc. Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together.

There were rave reviews in news articles both on and offline, on social media sites etc.<br/><br/>I enjoyed parts of the movie even if I felt some of the characters did not have a good fit with others and most scenarios were not plausible. The story was interesting enough and fast enough paced to keep the viewer wanting more, but wanting is the key word here. The full air of mystery did not exist. Many areas did not leave much to the imagination and one was able to draw conclusion long before it played out on screen.<br/><br/>Finally the ending failed miserably. Almost as if the writer reached a peak, ran out of thoughts and threw something together for a quick finish. I was very disappointed. I would have given a higher score if not for the movie's lack of a fulfilling end and the many unexplainable loopholes. Bottom line I was surprised after all the hype this movie turned out to be so very, very bad."

In fact I was kind of hoping that his wife was dead and not just missing. I really hoped he killed her because I didn't like her character and I really hoped Affleck would die too in a shoot out with cops; and I kind of hoped he would get lucky and kill them also. Well maybe not the sidekick, he was cool. I just couldn't relate to all of the pretentiousness of the wife's family or even Affleck himself. I mean, I even hoped her parents would die because they were jerks too. About the only person in that movie I found interesting was Affleck's sister, I think her name was Margo. The movie just failed to hook me in an hour and fifteen minutes. No plot twist can recover the amount of boredom I had at the one hour mark. Plus there were some very graphic scenes that didn't really add to the movie (not all, some very well expressed how disturbed individuals were). I don't need to see Affleck going down on a chick on his first date to kind of figure out they bumped uglies. Graphic scenes have their purpose but when you over-do it, you lose value."
"rainbowpoet","1","192","356","11 October 2014"," A Cavalcade of ""Deepities""
","I've always considered David Fincher to be one of the greatest directors of all time (though 'Zodiac' was a mind-numbing, energy-draining train wreck, and 'Fight Club' is one of the most pathetic excuses for brute-masculinity-worshiping, apocalypse-craving, self-righteous, pseudo-philosophical, sexist-in-both-directions garbage I've ever seen, and possibly the most overrated film of all time, though there are certainly a few other contenders for that title). Still, Fincher was also responsible for 'Se7en', which is, by my index, one of the most powerful, engrossing, genre-defining films of the last few decades, not to mention his relatively recent direction of the brilliant 'The Social Network', his previous stewardship of 'The Game', and his laudable work on 'House of Cards'. So I was relatively certain, especially given its largely stellar reviews and a personal recommendation from one of my best friends, that after I went to see 'Gone Girl' this evening, I would have, at the very least, moderately enjoyed it, if not referring to it as a ""modern masterpiece"". In the end, what I enjoyed most about it was the pervasive running criticism in my head.<br/><br/>I am locked in the throes of the biting emotional disappointment and vitriol this film just inspired in me, so my feelings are probably influencing me to go overboard with this particular slaughter, but I'm going to say this anyway: THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN (and no, I'm quite sure that that is not an exaggeration)! It's not quite in my bottom 10 or 20, nor will it be, but it lives merely inches above them on my list (in Size-10 font), still swirling the soil at the bottom of the toilet bowl. It is an insult to whatever audiences it victimizes. It is, to borrow a word from one of my intellectual heroes, Daniel Dennett, a cavalcade of ""deepities"", as if a bad soap opera graduated to the big screen and suddenly got a little better at passing itself off as important and hoodwinking its viewers into swallowing its not-so-well-veiled insults at modern culture, marriage, men, women, logic, and law enforcement. Don't get me wrong: these are all things which are imperfect, and which often have aspects which beg for condemnation, but said condemnation for its own sake, or for the sake of uniqueness or political correctness or rebellion or ostentation, and built on a quagmire of its own obvious narcissism, doesn't convince, but rather sickens. And for all the moments it could have had in its Brobdingnagian duration, it found no honesty in any of them. SPOILERS AHEAD (though they might not all be well-understood by those who haven't seen the film)<br/><br/>1. First of all, nobody in their right mind would believe Rosamund Pike's character after she ""comes back from being kidnapped and raped"" and gushes about her ""loving and misunderstood husband"", a story that most everyone in the general public (and the FBI, in one of the film's countless absurdities) seems to fall for, 'Gone Girl' equating the American general public and the FBI with Charlie Brown, and Pike with Lucy.<br/><br/>2. I really do wonder if Ben Affleck has ever had a single truly honest moment in front of a camera, whether in interviews as himself (one quite recently with Sam Harris and Bill Maher, among others), or in his ridiculous movies playing wooden characters ('Daredevil', 'Jersey Girl', 'Gigli', 'Pearl Harbor', 'The Town', and now 'Gone Girl', to name a few). He is somnolent and one-dimensional, with rarely a hint of color.<br/><br/>3. I know a film is bad when my absolute favorite thing about it, not to mention the most convincing thing, is a character played by Tyler Perry. What a joke.<br/><br/>4. This film tries to convince us that all or most men are lascivious, shallow sex-pigs who only care about women into whom they have a chance of inserting their penises, and into whom they wish to do so, and that all or most women are manipulative, vindictive, masterfully-controlling, mind-reading femme-fatale-potentials, who are always putting on a face for everyone, who are so complex and misunderstood and deep and brilliant, and who only want husbands who are completely spineless and too afraid to stand up to them, and whose love of anyone but themselves is not but a well-crafted charade. Such notions are not only adolescent stereotypes (and pathetically tired and pedestrian, even for that age group), but bear little, if any, relationship to reality. Reality is far more nuanced, more interesting, and more pleasurable, with many more twists and turns. And both men and women are aggregates that consist of mostly very good people, despite many examples to the contrary. Norman Bates really isn't that common in real life.<br/><br/>5. Neil Patrick Harris' character (the worst-cast character in the whole story) made no sense. It is not believable that he would side with Pike after everything she put him through before, when she set him up similarly to the way she set Affleck up, and it is not believable that he would keep in contact with her or let her into his house. The film is just littered with increasingly-laughable implausibilities.<br/><br/>6. The scene where Affleck and Pike meet is one of the worst-written scenes of dialogue or human interaction I've ever witnessed, far more absurd than anything from 'Titanic' or 'Dawson's Creek' or 'Twilight', and far more nausea-inducing. I expected so much more from David Fincher, though I guess the dialogue is Gillian Flynn's fault. Still, he should've fixed it.<br/><br/>To conclude, I beg of everyone who reads this: please don't contribute money to this film! Seriously, you could inevitably be doing something far more valuable with both your time and said money, and films like this should stop being made."
"Danusha_Goska","2","108","198","6 October 2014"," Cheap, Contrived, Exploitative
","""Gone Girl"" is a contrived, exploitative, pretentious film that aims for the middlebrow audience and hits its mark. The filmmakers insert – no pun intended – a sex scene every ten minutes or so, and alternate those with buckets-of-blood scenes of violence, and utterly predictable flashlight searches for clues of a Nancy Drew level of sophistication. If you want to see someone stabbed to death while climaxing during sex and bleed out like an upside down pig, this is the film for you. <br/><br/>The dialogue is pseudo-clever. Example: a man compliments a woman seated at a table full of strangers by informing her that she has a ""world-class vagina."" She smiles girlishly. <br/><br/>The film is capped up with a plot twist so implausible it blasted me right out of the movie onto the moons of Jupiter by the author's straining, sweating, thuddingly manipulative hand. And then the movie piles on the single most unbelievable ending I have ever seen. <br/><br/>There are movie surprises that rearrange the furniture inside your head and make you shout, ""Oh! Of course! How could I not have seen that? Now everything makes so much more sense!"" The best such surprise is in the film ""Sixth Sense."" ""Gone Girl"" surprises you by showing how desperate a writer can get.<br/><br/>Warning: The rest of this review will reveal the ending of ""Gone Girl."" If you don't want to know the ending of ""Gone Girl,"" stop reading now. <br/><br/>Nick (Ben Affleck) is married to Amy (Rosamund Pike). They live in Missouri, the show me state. Amy disappears and Nick is under suspicion. Did he kill her? <br/><br/>So, now, you are thinking that ""Gone Girl"" will explore the interesting question we all ask when beautiful young women disappear and their husbands are suspected of murder. Those questions are: How could a loving marriage go so wrong? How could a marriage look perfect on the outside and be rotten on the inside? How could a loving husband murder his own wife? Does our 24/7 media coverage encourage us to form lynch mobs? Forget it. ""Gone Girl"" explores none of this. <br/><br/>Nick had cheated on Amy with one of his students. Hurt, Amy faked her own disappearance. Amy is incredibly beautiful, the star of a series of children's books, a sexual Tantric master, a psychopath, and a criminal mastermind. Heck, the filmmakers may as well just added invisibility, flight, and the ability to conjugate Polish verbs at will to Amy's list of superpowers. She is that unbelievable. <br/><br/>Amy just wants to hurt Nick, because he hurt her. So she flawlessly fakes her own murder. Amy seeks shelter from Desi, an old boyfriend, Neal Patrick Harris, whom she had accused of stalking her. Desi makes Amy his virtual prisoner in his lake house. He, too, is a criminal mastermind, psychopath, and Tantric sex master, and his lake house is carefully designed to prevent Amy from escaping from their hot sex, good food, and discussions of opera and philosophy. You had no idea Missouri was this interesting, did you? You'll never call it ""flyover country"" again, will you? <br/><br/>Amy stabs Desi when he is climaxing during their hot sex. Buckets of blood gush out of him. The director wants you to see all this – this is what you bought your ticket for, is it not? Certainly not for intelligence or heart. <br/><br/>Amy returns to Nick. No one bothers to indict Amy for Desi's murder, because she is incredibly beautiful, famous, and a criminal mastermind. And because the plot of this movie holds together like a wet Kleenex. Nick knows that Amy is a murderer and that she attempted to frame him for her murder and only returned after that went wrong. Nick hates and fears Amy. And Nick stays with Amy, as her husband. The End. <br/><br/>I think the author of ""Gone Girl"" was trying to use flamboyantly exaggerated premises to comment on a few themes: none of us can fully understand what keeps marriages together, women are terribly hurt by infidelity, beautiful women can use manipulation and sex to get what they want in life. <br/><br/>All of these themes are genuinely interesting, and good art inspired by them is compelling. I kept thinking of ""The Country Girl,"" a brilliant treatment of a complex marriage that outsiders don't understand. TV coverage of the Laci Peterson murder was ten times more watchable, interesting, and educational than the idiotic ""Gone Girl"" could ever hope to be. ""Body Heat"" was a hundred times better as a depiction of a hot blond wrapping a big, dumb, handsome guy around her finger. And ""Body Heat""'s plot twist leaves ""Gone Girl"" in the dust. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck's broad shoulders and chest look really good here. His acting is vapid, absent, and clueless, appropriate to the part of a man manipulated by a woman. Rosamund Pike's performance as a human who could never actually exist is good. Basically, she's playing a Star Trek space alien, and she does it well. The excellent Tyler Perry is wasted."

Nope, and I don't plan on expounding on any of this stuff here, either. That's already been done more than adequately, and would just be piling on to the exceedingly obvious. <br/><br/>So why did I register here to write my very first review EVER on such a forum? I guess it's mainly because such a huge percentage of the viewing audience enjoyed this rancid bucket full of wriggling fish guts, and I seriously need to vent. Look, we all have our guilty pleasures when it comes to film, and I'll be the first to admit that I probably like my fair share of stinkers for one reason or another. But Gone Girl goes beyond the pale of what should be minimally acceptable in terms of base artistic competence. What the hell is wrong with you, movie-goers? Were you not paying attention at all? This movie is ridiculously bad, bad, BAD, and at every turn! How can the public, not to mention the lion's share of professional critics, for godsake, lap up this excrement? Was there a big sale on lobotomies somewhere?<br/><br/>Anyway, I guess that's my rant. I DID want to extend my sincere thanks to all the reviewers here who seem to more or less agree with my take. To tell the truth, I was so riled up by the end of this picture that I literally felt physically ill for some time afterwards, and it was such a refreshing balm to come here and discover it wasn't just me. To those who agree with me, I'd just like to say thanks, and that I feel your pain. :)"
"BrentHankins","10","202","387","2 October 2014"," Every single element is incredibly, undeniably good.
","My first exposure to Gone Girl came when I devoured Gillian Flynn's  critically acclaimed novel in less than two days, frequently succumbing  to thoughts of ""just one more chapter"" and finding myself still  engrossed some 30 minutes later. With its captivating characters and  painstakingly constructed mystery, Flynn's complex, multi-layered  thriller was the very definition of ""page turner,"" and when news broke  that David Fincher was interested in bringing the novel to life, I  couldn't think of a better pairing.   On the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben  Affleck) comes home to find the front door open, the glass coffee table  in the living room destroyed, and his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike),  nowhere to be found. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer  Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) are the first responders, and they  immediately get the sense that Nick isn't telling them everything - for  example, if the living room was the scene of a struggle, then why  aren't any of the photos on the mantel turned over? That's just one of  several unanswered questions that begin popping up as Nick is  scrutinized, first by the police, and then by the media as Amy's  disappearance quickly becomes headline news. Nick certainly doesn't  seem like a guy distressed about his missing wife, and as Amy's diary  entries (presented as flashbacks) begin filling in some of the blanks,  we start to wonder just what else Nick might be hiding, and if he knows  more about Amy's whereabouts than he's letting on.  In a wise move that pays dividends in the finished product, Flynn  herself was tapped to write the adaptation, stripping the story down to  its most important elements while still maintaining the frequent  juxtaposition between Nick and Amy's conflicting points of view. While  some purists will complain that the film lacks much of the novel's  nuance and subtleties, it's hard to find fault with a screenplay that  was written by the author of the source material, particularly when the  results are so impressive.  Fincher's involvement is another necessary cog in the machine, as even  with Flynn's screenplay this film could easily have fallen apart in the  hands of a lesser talent. Never one to shy away from the darker side of  humanity, Fincher obviously feels right at home playing in this sandbox  and exploring the terrible things that a once-loving couple can do to  each other in times of duress. This also marks Fincher's third  collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, whose original score  once again perfectly complements the visuals by accentuating, but never  overpowering, the on screen proceedings.  But even with all these elements in place, Gone Girl still wouldn't  work without being anchored by absolutely stellar performances across  the board. Pike is at her career best, particularly in the film's  second half, and should find herself positioned as a major contender  for this year's award season. Affleck is no slouch either, being tasked  with a lot of the weightier moments and nailing them like a seasoned  pro. Affleck expertly plays up Nick's winning smile and boyish charm,  but there's also an almost uncontrollable rage bubbling just beneath  the surface, and his portrayal should give those Batman v Superman  detractors plenty to reconsider.   Some audiences may balk at Gone Girl's 149-minute running time, but the  film is so meticulously paced that it never really slows down long  enough for moviegoers to glance at their watches. Each scene is allowed  just enough time to breathe before we're rushing onward, and every  single component is so incredibly, undeniably good that you won't want  to miss a single second. Pound for pound, Gone Girl is 2014's best  offering thus far, and should prove to be stiff competition for the  rest of the year.  -- Brent Hankins"

","Gone Girl had the potential for a great plot and movie, the plot was given away very early on as you knew he didn't do it because of the bar scene with his sister, then I sat there bored with a couple of moments of interest. Seemed to have some resemblance to the Lacy Peterson case, in other words lost some otherwise originality. So you know what is going to happen what you didn't know was all the details of why, which found dull, I like more of a traditional mystery/drama. Personally didn't see any academy award acting. The ending was way to far fetched, just absolutely unbelievable that 3 law enforcement agency would just take a position of ""Oh Well"", the group grope to interview her was totally unrealistic, I really was wondering if this was such a low budget film they just didn't have enough funds to complete the movie and they had to jam multiple plots in a single scene. I think the hype this is getting is why people believe our entire world is contrived, we can't all be crazy. The movie was a loser."

","The ratings were so high for this movie.I was sure it would be a great film. What rubbish it was. For the first hour I kept looking at my watch,it was so slow moving. Ben Affleck was average in his performance. The acting of Rosamund Pike was way over the top,even though she played a psychopath. There was so much sex,oral sex,suggestive sex in this film for pure shock value or maybe to make a boring movie more interesting. But nothing could help this moronic film.At the beginning I couldn't even hear the dialogue between them.It was so garbled.The plot was silly in my opinion. There are more fascinating plots in real life. And the men portrayed in this film are spineless weaklings while the women are tough and crazy.For example,the crime stories of killers Jodi Arias,Casey Anthony,and all the other crime plots on 48 hours or Dateline are mysteries which are fascinating,as well as being true.Thankfully,I had a gift card to this mess of a film,so paid very little. Why it is considered the best new movie out this week doesn't say much for the calibre of movies made today. Do not waste your money on this very bad crime mystery.Better to watch 20/20,or 48 hours at home. I like David Fincher as a director but nevertheless was extremely disappointed.The lesson here is don't believe the critics, audience and/or ratings all the time. Do some research.This film is a waste of your time and money."

","I finally got around to watching 'Gone Girl'. With all the hype, I figured it might be worth watching. It wasn't. My opinion is that this movie fails due to poor directing, awful acting, lousy continuity, lack of plausibility, zero suspense. The biggest issue was Ben Affleck. Come on people, he can't act. He doesn't act. I believe he could be replaced with a cardboard cutout. Rosamund Pike was little better, but that may have been a direction issue. Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon were the only two that brought game. Spoiler Alert, in my opinion, watching this move will spoil your day. The rest of this is just filler.

"svicious22","4","65","121","8 October 2014"," Lifetime movie with a big budget
","Gone Girl is a mixed bag of good and bad. It features some fine performances and a mildly interesting plot but has some weak casting and clichéd character archetypes. It is definitely entertaining, but ultimately unconvincing in its plot. The acting is generally good but hardly perfect, and the movie is longer than it needs to be. This meandering movie features a frustratingly ambiguous ending that feels like a cop out. <br/><br/>In terms of acting, Ben Affleck and his sister are both very good, as is the lead detective. Various supporting actors cast as members of the sleazy mass media and Tyler Perry as Affleck's attorney are also fine. However, Amy, the ""gone girl"" is far less convincing, and I found Neil Patrick Harris' character Desi to be artlessly stilted. The worst casting was the white trash couple who relieved Amy of her travelling funds; conceptually they came off as a low-rent rip-off of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis' characters from Kalifornia-utterly unoriginal. Amy's parents were annoying, in part by design no doubt, and again the casting felt lazy and obvious. <br/><br/>The plot holes were massive in this movie, far too much suspension of belief was required of the audience. Whether it was the faux rape in Amy's past, the faux pregnancy and its supposed legitimacy on the basis of a contrived urine test or all that time Amy spent at Desi's lake house that would have shown her to be moving about of her free will and completely contradicted her one staged scene she got on camera where she was supposedly injured by Desi, I wasn't buying any of it. I am not sure if this was handled more adeptly in the book or not (haven't read it and not likely given the author wrote the screenplay I doubt it) but I sure hope so or the reading public that made this book a hit has some explaining to do. <br/><br/>Overall, there was a Lifetime movie with a big budget feel and unrealized artistic aspirations to Gone Girl. The movie's attempts at being philosophical (people in a marriage being someone they're not and all that) rang hollow and phony, again I hope these were better handled in the book. Having written this review, I am trying to reflect what was good about it, and apart from a few strong performances and decent production values I am having some trouble. I give it 4/10 stars on the basis of some solid acting and its fair share of semi-mindless entertainment value, but there are far too many negatives to consider this fine cinema or a must-see movie."

"eddie_baggins","10","85","165","2 October 2014"," Fincher has done it again! A brilliant thriller with outstounding acting turns
","As if it wasn't safe to say already, but after Gone Girl there is  little doubt or argument to be made against the fact that David Fincher  is one of the most consistently great directors working in the industry  today, for Fincher's latest efforts behind the camera with this  meticulously made, perfectly paced and often thrilling story is  movie-making of the highest order. Gone Girl (exactly like it's source  text) is a mystery/thriller that steadily morphs into what can equally  be described as a darkest of dark comedy, a searing account of married  life and an edge of your seat police procedural, all elements that  combine to create one of the year's best films.  Fincher from day one has shown an uncanny ability for visual atheistic,  haunting and atmospheric surrounds and with the help of his composers  (this time once more teaming up perfectly with Trent Reznor and Atticus  Ross) finely moulded musical accompaniments and Gone Girl shows off all  these skills once more. The suburban surrounds of the world of Gone  Girl shun the safety in numbers feel that they provide these residents;  it's not dissimilar to a world akin to Blue Velvet where beneath the  grassy exteriors lies deep seeded secrets that threaten to tear at the  seams of idealistic marriages and those double lives we people lead.  Fincher relishes every element of Gone Girl from the mysteries through  to the reveals and like only a handful of movies each year this project  feels like the perfect meeting of subject and maker who meet in synch  to create such a finally tuned product. Fincher really has become the  master of the thriller genre, much like Scorsese with his mob pictures  and after Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and  now Gone Girl, there is a legacy to his directional work that will  forever be hard to match much like Fincher's continued fine work with  his actors.  Much noise was made initially by rabid fans of Gillian Flynn's source  novel about the casting of leads Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick  and Amy Dunne but after witnessing first hand one of the year's best  double acts by the two on form actors there will be little doubt that  the casting choices were staggeringly spot on. Affleck is at his  polarising best at Nick Dunne a man we as an audience are unsure of, do  we like this man or do we loathe him? It's refreshing to see Affleck  put in such an assured turn, from inappropriate smiling through to  outright rage, Affleck's turn is an award worthy one that in a less  standout year for the male acting category would be a turn featuring  strongly come February. While Affleck once more showcases a talent we  all know he has, the breakout turn from Rosamund Pike is the films  largest revelation.  Finally given a chance to chew through not only a high profile but  layered role, Pike excels as the ""amazing"" Amy at the centre of this  twisted and depraved tale. Pike truly creates one of not only the years  but modern day cinemas most memorable and unique leading ladies, a  creation who at any given time can be compelling, outrageous,  disgusting and calculated, it really is a stunning turn to witness and  it would be unwise to suggest that Pike isn't now head and tails ahead  in the female acting awards circuit. Surrounded by quite amazing  supports from Kim Dickin's dogged detective Rhonda Boney, Carrie Coon  as Nick's twin sister Margo, Tyler Perry (proving there's more to the  man than Magdea's fat suit) as high profile lawyer Tanner Bolt and  Barney Stinson himself Neil Patrick Harris in a box cutter sharp turn  as creepy rich man Desi Collings, Pike and her on screen hubby Affleck  are encompassed around by one of the years strongest ensembles.  Without spoiling any of Gone Girl's many varied and unexpected twists  and turns (this is the type of movie best seen with as little knowledge  as possible), this is a movie thriller of the highest order that  shouldn't be watched by those expecting an everyday murder/kidnapping  mystery, for what transpires throughout this tale is anything but your  run of the mill narrative. One of the most involving movies of recent  memories, Gone Girl is bitingly funny, white knuckle tense, starkly  violent and as we've come to expect from Fincher, quite brilliant. Gone  Girl is without question one of the year's best films, one of the  year's most unique films and one of the films of this year that you  can't dare to miss.  5 Gummy Bears out of 5"

However, the transition is abrupt and awkward. It fails as a suspense movie, and the discussion on marriage is very little developed, if at all.<br/><br/>It fails as a suspense movie because half way through suddenly the audience becomes aware that the wife is alive in a way that undoes all the previous efforts of building up the suspense. After that audience would expect a plot twist that at least connects and completes a good story. That is not delivered either. In fact, the twist is so implausible that the film becomes comic and almost laughable towards the end. <br/><br/>The lawyer, the police investigation and all that becomes complete redundancies under this plot structure. Too much time and attention are devoted to building up the intensity that later is destroyed. The real important characters are left underdeveloped.<br/><br/>In the end the movie seems desperate, trying to cover up the failed storyline by shifting the attention onto a topic that many can relate- marriage. However, we do not know what exactly the movie wants to talk about, since most of the time the focus is not devoted on the marriage/relationship. The audience learn about the interactions of the couple mainly through the description, or rather, opinions of the wife or the husband on events, and that clearly is not enough.<br/><br/>Not a good film. I do not recommend it."

","There's really very little to like about this movie unless you are new to movies and haven't seen directors work a camera before... Like all of David Fincher's movies there is a decided like of real substance. He tells stories with visual and auditory gadgetry. Some people are probably wowed when the director calls attention to himself with an endless array of moving shots, weird angles, and quick cuts, that end up basically turning a movie into a long commercial spot. While it doesn't quite go on forever, it does seem long when sitting in the theater, and that is because honestly, not a whole lot happens in this movie. They get a horse to run (OMG she's a crazy b*** of a wife!!) and then they kick it and beat it to death... <br/><br/>So... Fincher starts off the movie by constantly swinging the camera around, and of course, while keeping everything perfectly framed, he IS a master at this you know! (And don't you ever forget it!)<br/><br/>Yeah, yeah David, congrats, you've mastered film school 101.

I GET THAT! Why that needs to be told amongst scenes of wine bottle self rape, or ejaculation while throat slitting, or any of the other absurdities presented to the viewers in Gone Girl is a mystery that only lasts as long as it takes to tally up the $$$.<br/><br/>Here's a metaphor from the movie: <br/><br/>WOOD STOVE = HOT VAGINA.

"left-of-center","9","22","37","19 April 2015"," Another Tense, Finely Crafted Effort from Fincher
","""Gone Girl"" is yet another gripping, tense, carefully crafted film from the one and only David Fincher. He's one of my favorite directors and like most of our modern-day Greats, you know when you're watching one of his movies. You know it's a Fincher movie when you get a dense, slow-burning, meticulous effort that stuns you with it's growing sense of dread. You get the same thing with ""Gone Girl"", which is the adaptation of Gillian Flynn's bestselling novel (Flynn also wrote the screenplay) about the media circus Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) goes through once his enigmatic wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), disappears and he becomes more and more of a suspect.<br/><br/>Now, let's get to the story. I just need to say that some of these one-star reviews really miss the point. I don't want to spoil this thing too much for you. I didn't read the book before I saw the film and it's better to remain surprised. All I will say is that Amy is certainly not as innocent as she appears to be. And all of the so-called ""plot holes"" are intentional. Even a few of the characters in the film point out that ""things don't add up."" That's the point! That this woman's story is full of holes YET the media and the police are all willing to overlook that because this whole fiasco has become an incredible story. It harks back to the Scott and Lacey Peterson case; one of those national-news dramas that everyone's talking about and everyone has an opinion on. The media and the police have invested too much into this whole thing for them to not get the story they want. So, they overlook the holes, highlighted in a very telling scene near the end that also shows just how differently this all could've progressed if Amy was a man (something that Pike herself interestingly pointed out in an interview). <br/><br/>Basically, the Internet is full of people who love to complain and trash what's popular. A lot of it is just unimaginative nitpicking. So, don't let the negative reviews disparage you. Fincher is still at the top of his game. It might not be on a ""Seven"" or ""Fight Club"" level of resonance. But, I found it incredibly entertaining, from beginning to end. Flynn stays true to her novel, retaining a cynical and disturbingly realistic ending that matches perfectly with Fincher's nihilistic outlook as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly excellent. Affleck has never been the greatest of actors. Yet, he seems tailor-made for the role of Nick. Effectively callow, distant, and fumbling, you don't know exactly what to think of him until the halfway mark. Carrie Coon is a lively, relatable presence as Nick's frustrated yet loyal twin sister, Margo, and provides some comic relief. As does Tyler Perry, who surprises by breaking away from his usual Madea shtick to deliver a straight-on, confident, coolly composed portrayal of a slick lawyer, Tanner Bolt, who Nick enlists for help. Neil Patrick Harris is mostly believable as Amy's creepy, obsessive ex-boyfriend, Desi Collings, but you can sometimes feel his comic archness slipping through a bit too much. And Kim Dickens rounds out the supporting cast as Detective Boney, who alternates between doubting Nick and wanting to trust him.<br/><br/>But, make no mistake: this is Rosamund Pike's film. Though, at first, she seems to have a bit less screen time, you eventually realize how she's always controlling this entire show, whether she's on-camera or not. After years of noticeable supporting parts, Amy Dunne was Pike's leading-lady coming-out party, nabbing her a much-deserved Best Actress Oscar nod. She is downright chilling in this role. Not only does she nail the stone-cold calculation and focus of Amy but she understands the range that is required to play this role. Amy is so manipulative and such a role-player that Pike is called on to be charmingly sophisticated, laidback, and vulnerable, as well. And, looking back, we realize the insincerity of such moments. And then there are times where she's flat-out dangerous and unsettling, revealing the depths of her psychopathy. Pike's voiceovers, narrated through her so-called diary, will also get in your head and stay there. An extended montage where she reveals her entire plan, set to the haunting score of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (working with Fincher for the third time), stopped me in my tracks and is bound to become a classic.<br/><br/>Pike alone makes this film worth a watch. She's like a female Hannibal Lector or a new-millennium version of Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction""; a very memorable movie psychopath. But, in my eyes, this is also a very solid, gripping film with some interesting things to say about our media-driven, image-obsessed culture."

","Big spoilers in this review! From the off this movie was slow, slovenly written, tediously directed with some half decent acting. I just could not connect to the characters, which were just there to be manipulated by the writer(a theme of the film). Plot - wife disappears, apparently killed by her husband, who becomes increasingly under pressure to be arrested (media and a rent-a-mob crowd holding banners!). Suddenly big twist as wife reappears to tell her story, and the film drags itself to an unsatisfactory conclusion with the odd pot shot at the amoral media (TV actually). The plot of the first half owes itself to 40s noir with all those pictures with Barbara Stanwyck and Lana Turner in - now regularly revisited in made-for-TV movies. Then the second half turns into 'Basic Instinct' with buckets of blood, and the will she - won't she get away with it trying to drum up some vague tension. We even get a sex scene, where the wife's panties never move but she is being entered by a right schmuck. Another case of the star actress does not flash but earlier a minor actress goes topless in a fumble with the husband!<br/><br/>Awful rubbish and a waste of two and half hours of my life. Certainly not the intricate shredding of marriage as an institution by everyone using facades/manipulation to merely survive that the press reviews trumpet. It is unbelievable because the characters have stepped out of an author's head and not anything remotely resembling real life. The only problem for reviewers was a lacklustre final third which some have tries to explain away as satire.<br/><br/>The day after I saw the movie, I was still mulling over that problematic final third, when it struck me that the whole thing built into a savage condemnation/diatribe at FEMALE EMPOWERMENT - something the Liberal Intelligentsia could never approve of, even if they noticed it1 Let me explain. the wife (Rosamund Pike who is OK) is upper middle class and well educated, but also a psychopathic, manipulative, uber-bitch. The two female TV anchors are well spoken, manipulative bullies and control freaks. The working class robber from the motel (don't ask) is a manipulative, vicious, controlling bitch. In fact, out of the six female characters in the last third of the film, only two are likable - one, the twin sister, loves her brother (Affleck) unconditionally, while the other, the detective, has treated the husband with outstanding even-handedness. And the non-moving pantie scene takes on another meaning - it is a visual which tells you that a man does not really enter an empowered female! But all you liberals will be screaming 'no.' So how is it Ben Affleck yells out - 'God save me from female empowerment!' Or did I hear it in 'Midsomer Murders' later in the evening!? Yes, well done, Mr Fincher, you really have slipped in a crafty anti-feminist movie right under their noses!<br/><br/>A last point - shouldn't the final scene have been of the two robbers in the motel recognising the wife on TV and saying to each other 'Now we can make some real money!' Pity the movie did not star Reese Witherspoon herself (given a producer credit here) and her husband had been played by ex Ryan Phillippe. Now that would have made for a really engaging and creepy movie!"

","So here's the thing. The setup for the movie is very engaging. It's a fascinating story told with an interesting plot sequence.<br/><br/>I've seen reviews here, and they seem to run the gamut from amazingly good to amazingly bad. It is the latter, and yet I say two stars because the story of how their lives got to the point of the disappearance is fascinating, but even while watching the movie, questions entered my mind that I just couldn't answer, even after knowing the ending.<br/><br/>Why did Neil Patrick Harris' character show up so early in the story? Once he showed up, why did he appear to actually work against our protagonist? How could the feds be so mind numbingly stupid? You've got a police officer in your midst with valid questions: why would she be ignored? And the worst offense: that ending. Not since ""Solitary Man"" have I seen the credits appear, and I felt the need to complain out loud in a movie theater about the ending. Boy, was that a stupid ending! I've already noted that this review could include spoilers, but I feel the need to not spoil too much (if you're a sucker for punishment, by all means, spend the money: it's tripe, but it's pretty tripe), but oh, how I wish I had someone else to talk to about how stupid this movie was in more detail."

","And I don't think it's me. If you want to know specifically what's wrong with this flick look at some of the other 1* reviews. It's been spelled out in detail. What I want to talk about is how this dumb movie has an 8* rating with over 200k people rating it.<br/><br/>The first thing that comes to mind is what I read about another new release, ""The Interview"" which had a high rating and lots of positive reviews within 24 hours of it's release. Someone pointed out the statistical aberrations of those numbers suggesting IMDb was getting bombarded by false accounts with an addenda to deceive.<br/><br/>For this movie I don't think that's the case so I'm wondering how so many people can be so uncritical in their thinking. Well, about half the voters in the USA voted to re-elect George W Bush, so that explains a lot.<br/><br/>For those of you who gave this movie high marks and didn't vote for Bush's second term, please consider this for the future:<br/><br/>There are movies where we are presented with a made-up reality from the start. Like time travel for example. Or unreal mental states like in Tron or The Matrix. With those you say, OK, it's bs, now entertain me.<br/><br/>But when a movie takes place in the world we know and live in, there is a higher standard. As the story progresses, it must be logical. It can't defy gravity. It can't do things that are not gunna happen in real life. Those are the 'holes' in the story. In GONE GIRL there are so many holes and those holes are so ridiculous, you gotta ask yourself, ""Do they think I'm stupid?"" I guess the answer is yes. I guess they are correct. I guess I'm now a minority. The dumbing of America is happening."

","I really like David Fincher as a Director and some of his previous movies are my favorite (e.g. Seven). Gone girl is a dull movie with totally no surprise or tension. Everything in this movie is so predictable. Actually from the very first minutes of the movie you know that the wife is responsible for all what is happening and that she faked it all herself to make the husband look bad - as a revenge for their unsuccessful marriage. On top of that we have really, really bad, fake acting (especially Ben Affleck). The story isn't realistic and sometimes behavior of the characters or their actions seem simply stupid. The idea for the movie is actually quite interesting and could turn into a really great movie. But well... it is what it is"

However the second half quickly undoes everything that's been shown earlier.<br/><br/>What's worse, the second part becomes incredibly implausible, very tedious, and lacking any interest because it ventures into so unlikely situations and reactions, you cannot help but wonder why people act like they act. For instance the police, who are very captious in the first half of the film, later believe everything they're told without doubting. Other people similarly and drastically change their mind and we are not given any reasonable explanation.<br/><br/>To give the film due credit, it's impeccably played, it has, like many other Fincher's films, its very likable palette.<br/><br/>Probably this film is about all sorts of psychos, at least its lead characters are.

","I didn't always vote on IMDb but if my two-cents could warn people not to let their hope up on this movie or not waste their time watching at all, I would. However, if you like a lousy crime thriller film wanna-be, this one is your very choice.<br/><br/>I am wondering why Gone Girl is getting a pretty good score here. 8.4, huh? Are you kidding me? Are people not seeing that NOTICEABLY FAT PLOT HOLE? I had raised my brows at how cops in this movie worked since their first appearance. The writer had no knowledge how the system worked but he dare try to write a crime fiction. He used many wrong imagination. So, what we got and paid for is this piece-of-s--, I mean, art.<br/><br/>Gone Girl tells a story of a manipulative lady who got a bunch of idiots around her, so, compared to them, she was real smart. One day, she thought she'd set her cheating husband up for a murder, so she sent him out and drove her evil plan in motion. She drew out her blood, threw it around the house then cleaned the house, not knowing when her husband would come home and discover all of it. Luckily, he didn't come home before she got away. For her, everything was perfect timing and a piece of cake.<br/><br/>As the film went on and on, everybody believed what she said and ate what she served without any doubts in their mind.<br/><br/>This sounds very 'Mary Sue' to me.<br/><br/>Every cops in the writer's world worked like an amateur. They worked fast (too fast) but use no brains. They didn't work the evidences or traced any phones. They used only what she fed them. <br/><br/>FBI wouldn't do anything about a bloody murder even though the feds had the murderer sitting in front of them soaking in blood, confessing and not even feeling freaked out although she told the cops that she had been kidnapped and raped. And then, the cops let her husband drive her home, still soaking in blood. (When I saw that scene, I was going to fall apart.)<br/><br/>That's it. That's the whole story.<br/><br/>Tell me she used some kind of dark magic, that would be more reasonable than everybody in the world being an idiot and listening to this Mary Sue's words regardless.<br/><br/>This movie was disappointing."

","Luckily I watched this soulless piece of crap as part of awards season screenings, which means I didn't pay for it. I cannot believe this is the shooting script they signed off - the amount of plot holes and continuity gaffes is staggering. I cannot believe that all these highly talented people agreed to be in this hollow piece that uses all of its 148 minutes to say absolutely nothing. David Fincher is clearly a talented director, in full technical control of the medium, but after watching this, and having watched most of his previous films, I have to conclude that his films very often have nothing relevant to say. Technical prowess counts for nothing if the film has no soul, which is what I think of Gone Girl. I gave it a 4 for the acting, it is the only aspect worth noting here. The end is absolutely appalling, character development is shallow, and that graphic extended murder scene was pretty gratuitous, horrid and unnecessary. But what else could I expect from a director who chose to remake an already perfect film (Girl With The Dragon Tattoo)?"
"santiagocosme","1","25","45","19 December 2014"," Great movie ruined by terrible ending.
","At the time of watching this movie, it had a rating of 8.4 on IMDb. I normally trust that whatever movie has an 8.0 rate or more should definitely be a great film. Well, I hope this is the exception that confirms the rule, because this movie might be one of the worst I have ever seen. Why? you must be wondering. Because of the last 30 minutes. Up until that point I was really enjoying it, generally speaking. But man, that ending is appalling, utterly atrocious, and plainly nonsensical! A great thriller turned into a love story of pathetic proportions in a matter of minutes. The only positive i found at the end was the way they portray the power of media and public opinion in society. The rest should go down the garbage shoot.<br/><br/>In these types of movies, there's only one premise: keep it real. If you do, you'll have a great film, which will improve with every twist and turn you add. If you don't keep it real, and your thriller becomes too surrealistic, you'll find yourself going from cleverness and brilliance to false cleverness and stupidity. And that's exactly what happened in this film in the last half hour.

","I hate loose ends in a movie. The lawyer tells Affleck's character that he is putting two ex-Secret Service agents on the case to track down his wife. We never hear what they did or didn't find. It's amazing that they apparently found nothing considering that the lawyer was aware of ex-boyfriend #2 who had a possible motive. If they had set a stakeout on him they would have found her.<br/><br/>And the two low-lifes that stole her money? The Secret Service guys couldn't find them either? And what happened to them?<br/><br/>The first ex-boyfriend, who had much the same experience with the wife as Affleck's character tells his story and is written off. We must assume that his life remains forever in the toilet<br/><br/>And that is part of what makes for a lousy ending. Not one, but at least three people are condemned to lead lives of living hell because the writer could not find away to end the story with any kind of justice. Some may say, ""Yeah, but that's reality."" No it's not, it's a movie, it's entertainment, and I paid good money to see it.<br/><br/>It's a scary sign of the times when a movie like this gets good ratings. The acting, filming, directing, and editing were all great, it's just the message that was bad."

Too much ineffective character build up that took 90 mins of the film. The plot was like an easy murder case from a Dateline episode and I am sure everything wrong with the story has been enumerated on previous reviews. And I cannot believe how dumb the policemen were portrayed. The plot really sucks. When the credits started rolling, this movie left me with anger.

"Turfseer","3","47","92","19 October 2014"," Absurd characters and plot sink this poor man's 'Fatal Attraction'
","'Gone Girl' is one of those films in which I have no guilt feelings whatsoever in giving away the plot. If you must see it, wait until cable or when it comes to Netflix. The first third however, actually isn't that bad. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne whose wife, Amy, lived a sheltered and privileged existence after her parents created a series of children's novels entitled 'Amazing Amy', based on her life as a child in NYC.<br/><br/>We learn in a series of flashbacks from Amy's journal, that when she first met Nick, it was similar to a perfect, whirlwind romance. Eventually, however, the couple is forced to move back to Missouri, to take care of Nick's mother, who has cancer. Amy is forced to give back a substantial sum of money to her parents who basically bankrolled her career, when they go into debt. Amy pours the remaining money into a bar, which is run by Nick and his sister.<br/><br/>One fine day Amy disappears and the investigating detective, finds a series of clues purposely left there by Amy (including her journal). Soon, Nick fast becomes the prime suspect in Amy's disappearance. Nick tries to keep himself together, despite the media circus right outside his door. Eventually we learn in a twist, that Amy is a psychopath who seeks to humiliate Nick. This basically is where I lost interest in the film. Amy is too much of a bizarre character to be taken seriously. Her main motivation for wanting to do her husband in, is that he cheated on her. The way in which she tries to frame him, seems too complicated to pull off in real life; one also wonders if she was so enraged at him, why doesn't she simply try and kill him by making his death seem like an accident?<br/><br/>The plot becomes even more bizarre when Amy allows herself to be ripped off by two rednecks who learn that she has a lot of cash on her, while they're all staying at a motel. For a clever psychopath like Amy, it seems a little too easy for her to be ripped off so easily by the two low life's she encounters. Now penniless, she contacts Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) who stalked her in high school. Now rich, the one-note Desi believes this is his chance to help Amy, while attempting to woo her again. Desi comes off as an equally unbelievable character as Amy, since there is no reason why he should have remained obsessed with her for all this time (not to mention the restraining order that Amy took out against him years ago). Amy ends up murdering Desi (in a very gruesome and unpleasant scene), slashing his throat with a box cutter. Before doing so, however she pretends she's been raped by Desi in front of a surveillance camera..<br/><br/>The last third of the film features the last and equally noxious twist. Nick ends up 'lawyering up' by hiring the big media attorney, Tanner Bolt, who encourages him to be interviewed on a Nancy Grace-like show. By owning up to having an affair, Nick improves his media image after his girlfriend came forward to reveal their affair. Suddenly, Amy decides to nix the original plan to frame Nick and returns home, much to everyone's shock across the country, who have been following the case incessantly for the past few months on TV and social media.<br/><br/>Somehow, Amy gets a hold of Nick's sperm in a sperm bank and impregnates herself. Much to his sister's chagrin, Nick decides to stay with psycho Amy, and raise the baby together.<br/><br/>'Gone Girl' for me is a poor man's 'Fatal Attraction'. Somehow, Rosamund Pike's 'Amy' doesn't compare to the much more chilling, 'Alex', excellently played by Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Here Amy is practically a comic character, who gets away with both an attempted frame-up and murder, and ends up humiliating her poor schlub of a husband, who is forced to go back to her, under duress. <br/><br/>'Gone Girl' is not to be taken seriously and those who admire the absurd characters and plot, to my mind, have low standards indeed."
"AvalonToo","1","33","62","11 December 2014"," After watching Gone Girl, I want to cry, vomit and cry again
","It is very difficult to describe how angry I felt after sitting through nearly 2 hours. I felt like some smug a**hole who thinks he's smarter than everyone just kicks me in the head, spits in my eyes and then call me names. I have never felt so insulted by a film. But then again, I had never bother to watch the Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>The plot is full of holes and the twists and turns are hardly plausible. It is true that here are instances good acting can be a saving grace for a bad movie but there is precious little of that in the film. The lead characters are unconvincing and tedious bores. Ben Affleck... well, he's Ben Affleck. Sometimes, he does decent work, but only sometimes... <br/><br/>The biggest disappointment is Rosamund Pike. I know she is no Maryl Streep but she is usually not this bad. First of all, her American accent. She Talks like she is in some black and white movies from the 50s. Fine, so may be she is channeling some heroine from a Hitchcock film but who talks like that anymore. Okay, I am being a nitpicky here. My bad. Her character was supposed to be highly complicated but there was no depth. She couldn't even do a half-way decent mimicry of a damaged person. It's down right pathetic.<br/><br/>All the supporting characters are awful. All except Kim Dickens. She IS the saving grace of the film if there is one. It's wonderful to watch her as the lead investigator of the case of missing wife and the only thing that keeps the movie from flying away like a kite in a wind storm. She held on as long as she could, all the way until near the end when David Fincher ran out of time. Alas, she cannot save this hot stinking pile of garbage. Somebody please give Ms Dickens a better position in her career. She deserves it.<br/><br/>The worst one is probably Neil Patrick Harris. What happened there, Doogie? I cannot talk about what is wrong with his character without going into a tirade and spill too much beans so I will stop there. Doogie, stay with comedy please.<br/><br/>I am glad that not everyone is fooled by this American Beauty-esque bull doo doo. Frankly, I did not go in with too high an expectation. I saw the high rating on IMDb but I also heard grumbles that it was not that great. The bar I set was in the middle and I still gets crushingly disappointed. That is how bad this movie is."

"SimonJack","6","6","8","1 March 2019"," The holes hold the clues to solving this mystery
","Not having read Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel of this same title, I don't know if the book had plot holes as the movie does. Fellow mystery aficionados know that for every plot hole in a story the writer is omitting or covering up a major clue. And, so this film has some, which leads crime and mystery buffs to suspect what follows.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is a good murder mystery, but not a great one. It is presented in such a way that audiences won't know right away if there has been a murder. And, it's obviously portrayed so that many will assume that Ben Affleck's Nick Dunne really ""done it."" (I couldn't resist.) Then, it's only a matter of time as the story unravels and viewers see the ""what"" and the ""how"" of the crime. Aha, but what crime?<br/><br/>I don't know if the author or the movie producers were trying to emulate Alfred Hitchcock, but the fright factor here doesn't come close to him. Nor does the suspense equal that of the usual Dashiel Hammett, Agatha Christie or John Grisham mystery. It is apparent very early that Amy Dunne has staged her disappearance to make it look like a killing, probably to get even with Nick. As the story unfolds, it bears that out.<br/><br/>None of the performances here are great. Some are very good - Rosamund Pike as Amy, Carrie Coon as Nick's sister, Margo, and Tyler Perry as attorney Tanner Bolt. The rest of the cast were fair to good except for Affleck. He was lifeless and underplayed his role terribly. One suspects that was intended by the director to further build suspicion of him. I just saw him as lazy, and bored stiff.<br/><br/>While one can see the deception very early, the second plot and murder of Desi Collings is a surprise. The end to the story isn't clear, so that keeps the suspense going.<br/><br/>Some other reviewers have noted the portrayals of the frenzied crowds, in response to the social media craze and modern news media that tend to be in one's face. That's a good thing to highlight. The ending doesn't bring the story to closure as endings should. In that also, ""Gone Girl"" doesn't belong with the good mysteries of the masters named above. Hitchcock or Hammett could wrap up the mystery and still leave readers and viewers with a question or two. But, they always saw that justice was served, one way or another. Not so, though, in this film.<br/><br/>Detective Rhonda Boney was very competent as a crime investigator. That is, up to the point of the plot holes. And, those are where Amy's ruse would quickly have unraveled. Here are just the most obvious ones. The first is the car Amy is driving. Was it her car, and if so, why were the police not looking for it? If it was a car she just bought or rented, she would have had to stash it some place where she could get to it quickly. And she would have had to pay for it. The car company people would have recognized her face from all the later publicity.<br/><br/>The second big hole, which the movie doesn't really show but talks a lot about, is the huge store of goods that Nick was supposed to have bought. When and how did Amy get all that stuff past Nick and stored in their garage and his father's house? How many people might have seen her hauling the stuff there over a few weeks? If she had bought the stuff in person, police checks would have nailed her. The golf pro or store clerk who sells a fancy set of golf clubs is not going to soon forget the person who made such a purchase. And, Nick didn't golf so no one would ever have seen him golfing. Likewise for anyone using someone else's credit card over the telephone.<br/><br/>Among other holes would be the tapes at Desi Collings's home that would have shown them arriving and being normal. Amy would have had to somehow erase those. And competent police would wonder why they were erased?<br/><br/>What was the very clue that Amy was not murdered but had planned the ""crime?"" It was the police finding the envelope marked Clue One. That told one that Nick did not know about that note before their anniversary, and that Amy had left it as she always did for a treasure hunt on their anniversary.<br/><br/>Those not satisfied with the ending might imagine any number of future horrors living with the psychotic Amy who says she is now going to have a baby. What of that poor baby or toddler the first time he or she upsets Amy? But, as the film actually ends, it invites an obvious closure that would be classic Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Remember Greta and Jeff who robbed Amy of all her money? Greta had sat with ""Nancy,"" watching all the TV coverage of Amy's disappearance. She knew Amy was hiding out and had phony glasses. When she and Jeff run out of money, she will have a nice story to tell a newspaper about remembering that woman in the Ozarks. Or, if she and Jeff get in trouble with the law, she can plea-bargain by telling about that gal from the motel who was on the run with a wad of dough. She was always watching the TV coverage and commenting about the missing Amy Dunne.<br/><br/>Hitchcock would have a final scene as the credits role. So, the psychotic nymphomaniac, Amy, would come to justice. Greta dials the phone in a phone booth. She starts to speak, ""About that Amy Dunne who said she was kidnapped and raped..."" and the sound fades as the camera pulls back and the credits roll."

","*Big Spoilers*<br/><br/>I give it a 1 not because it this movie was dreadful from beginning to end but because it was engaging for most of it then the last half an hour was so unrealistic that the investment you make as a viewer to that point is completely trashed. <br/><br/>By early in the film (if not the trailer) it is apparent that Amy had been keeping a diary/journal of her marriage to Nick which went from fairytale to horror story over five years. <br/><br/>What is also really obvious is that the police do not have this diary at this point so will eventually find it and that it will incriminate Nick. So the obvious conclusion is that it is a set up. <br/><br/>That is not a bad thing as long as the story is well told and for the most part it was. <br/><br/>Several characters were of interest. Super lawyer Tanner Bolt comes in to help Nick with his case. Unfortunately that thread is a waste of time as Amy returning makes his involvement of no real service to the story. <br/><br/>Officer Jim Gilpin who was suspicious of Nick through the film could have been a more interesting character when confronted with new information simply remains a one dimensional character who therefore serves no significant purpose and was never intended to be a real person. <br/><br/>Toward the end when Amy comes back Nick is having a drink with his hotshot lawyer and the police officer who had been investigating her disappearance and tells them that Amy had confessed to him to murder (she had ripped a guys throat out) as well as having set him up. <br/><br/>No issue with that except the police officer says there is nothing she can do now and the lawyer makes a joke and leaves smiling while another police officer jokes that Elvis is leaving the state. <br/><br/>So for most of the movie we are given the impression that it is grounded in reality. Events that could happen. <br/><br/>Then to wrap it up the writer just gets lazy and creates a scenario that would never take place. <br/><br/>I have heard some say that the film is a statement on marriage but who cares. It still needs to be told within the framework or the rules for which the rest of the story has been set. <br/><br/>I read someone else say that it is OK to switch your brain off for a movie as long as that is established early in the film but not in the last half of an hour. <br/><br/>The ending ruined several story threads and made them pointless. If anyone seriously thinks the film was some serious commentary on the state of marriage then I think you are kidding yourself in the hope of convincing yourself that you are smarter than you are. <br/><br/>But even if it was no excuse for dropping the ball to get the story over with. I have no issue with Amy getting away with it or being convicted or being killed or whatever end the author chose but that needed to be done well. <br/><br/>Instead it ended in the laziest way imaginable and therefore ruined the time I had invested in watching the movie to that point. <br/><br/>I don't expect every film to be a winner but this dropped the ball so badly it is lucky to get the 1 out of 10 that I gave it."

Nick soon finds himself at the center of an enormous cluster of problems, including the growing media circus surrounding the case, uneasiness with local authorities who are trying to find Amy, and his own inconsistent attitude, which is painting him in an increasingly suspicious light. What happened to Amy? Is Nick truly the loving husband he wants to work to believe he is, or is he the sinister sociopath that media wants to paint him as? And, most importantly... did Nick in fact kill his wife?<br/><br/>While I cannot give too much away as to avoid spoilers, I must say the casting and performances are incredible, and absolutely spot-on. Affleck knocks it out of the park as a troubled man who may not be the figure he outwardly tries to portray himself as. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry make for thrilling supporting roles that take you by surprise, especially considering their predominately comedic backgrounds. Kim Dickens gives a great turn as a local officer who is simultaneously one of Nick's biggest assets and also one of his biggest detractors. And Carrie Coon shines as Nick's sister, who serves as his moral support, despite not always telling him everything he wants to hear.<br/><br/>But it is Rosamund Pike, the titular ""Gone Girl"", who shines the brightest. This is her film. Everything about her role is intriguing, troubling and keeps the mystery and suspense alive. In particular, her journal entries which comprise the backbone of the film... and also lead the audience to question whether she or her husband had their own ulterior motives in the marriage, and warps the perception of the story. Pike deserves so much more recognition for this role. Because this is the role of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Writing duties are handled by Gillian Flynn, whom also wrote the novel upon which the film is based. While I have not read the book (and therefore refuse to compare it), Flynn constructs a tight, concise, yet also deliciously mysterious tale, and some of her framing devices and artistic flourishes help elevate what could have otherwise been quite the routine film. I'm excited to see what comes next for Flynn, because this film has definitely made me want to keep my eye on her work in the future.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher continues to prove his status as one of the great directors working today with this film. As he has with previous works, he soaks this film in his deliciously dark, twisted, sometime nihilistic visual and storytelling sensibilities. And it fantastically compliments and augments the uneasiness of the story, and the unsure relationship the audience has with the characters.<br/><br/>And finally, there is the remarkable score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. My god, this is one of the most unique and fascinating musical scores I've heard in some time. I've been increasingly interested in the duo's work, especially after their last collaboration with Fincher on the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" remake (which I will admit, I think has a slightly superior score), and they once again provide the perfect audible backdrop to the visual experience of the film. Bravo, Reznor and Ross.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is easily one of the best films of the year, in my opinion. It's a stellar example of modern mystery and tightly- assemble character drama. And it's a film that will haunt you long after it ends. <br/><br/>It's a perfect 10."

","When Nick Dunne (Ben AffflecK) meets Amy Oliver (Rosamund Pike) at a New York City party, the attraction is instantaneous. She is smart, witty, and beautiful. Nick is handsome, and funny in his own right. Amy is the successful writer of the Amazing Amy series of books, and has a trust fund. Nick writes for a men's magazine, the future looks golden for both of them. They get married, it starts out well, but in five years, the magic is gone. Amy is writing quizzes for a women's magazine Nick is unemployed, the trust fund money is gone, and they have moved from New York City to Missouri to care for Nick's mom, who later dies of cancer. Nick opens a bar with his sister Margo (Carrie Coon) the bar is losing money. On their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears. Nick is immediately suspected, but did he actually kill Amy?<br/><br/>I did not like the book, and I do not like the movie Gone Girl. There is a reveal in both book and movie. After the reveal, both book and movie grind to a slow and painful stop. It's supposed to be an indictment of the reality show, feeding frenzy court TV mentality, every time there is a murder of the century in America or worldwide. But this is more a parody of the American realty TV culture than it is a serious indictment. There are many clichés in this movie, I won't bother to name them, but even the characters fall into cliché territory. The Tanner Bolt character is Johnnie Cochran, the Ellen Abbott character is Nancy Grace. The tone of the story is inconsistent, is it a suspense movie, or is it a dark comedy? What I like least about this story is that it savages both lead characters, if neither character is sympathetic, the viewer stops caring about either of them, and that's exactly what happened here. I will lay all the plot flaws at the feet of author and screenwriter Gillian Flynn, who created a carbon copy of her book with the screenplay. A better, more satirical version of this movie is To Die For, with Nicole Kidman. Watch that instead.<br/><br/>The acting is not bad. I don't like Ben Affleck, when Tyler Perry, playing his lawyer, gave him a direction not to be so wooden, it is ironically funny. But Ben uses what I dislike about him most, the glib, smug, pretty boy to good effect here to play a pretty despicable character. Rosamund Pike is very good at maintaining a cool and calm exterior while constantly thinking to stay one step of the collapsing situation around her. She makes her character almost believable, and that is saying something. Tyler Perry also does a pretty good job of playing a cartoonish character. Neil Patrick Harris does not fare as well playing Desi Collings another poorly written character.<br/><br/>Part of the responsibility of the profoundly poor quality of this film resides with the director David Fincher. Fincher has directed some really good films, like the Social Network and the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, but this is not an epic story, and does not require a 2 ½ hour running time. Fincher could have easily edited the running time by a half hour or 45 minutes and not lost the essence of the story, but he did not, and so the story drags.<br/><br/>Fincher also gave the film a dark look trying to make it feel more sinister, but maybe because of the gallows humor or because I knew the story from the book, the movie never felt sinister to me.<br/><br/>Before your movie ticket money is Gone girl (or guy) check out my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com."
"willhaysnoe","3","48","97","6 October 2014"," What is a Mystery is This Movie's High Rating
","With all due respect, I have come to the conclusion that I really disliked this movie. When I got home from the theater, people asked me and I said, ""It was pretty good"", but the more I thought about the more ridiculous things kept coming to mind. The stereotypes of the cunning women was unwelcome. Amy's sudden turn to violence was absurd. Prior to slashing Doogie Howser all she'd been guilty of was fraud. How do you go from fraud to cold-blooded (and very bloody) first-degree murder without batting an eye? Also, all the cops were skinny dudes with ordinary haircuts. Been up close to a police force any time in the past 30 years? They're all skinhead bullies nowadays, not clean-cut gee-whiz do-gooders like in this movie. And then Nick wordlessly ends up staying with Amy? Just awful. The only mystery here is why people thought this was any good."
"claude-molosiu","1","33","64","16 November 2014"," I don't buy this story
","If a movie doesn't have a story, it's not a good movie. I thought Fincher tried to shove the movie's ending down my throat. I have not read the book so I can't tell if this is Fincher butchering it or not having much to work with. The movie started out great, very promising. However, after that Amy phone call from the gas station to Desi, the movie deflated quickly. From there to the end the story is a bunch of hooey. <br/><br/>*How does Desi, an apparently successful LOCAL person, harbor a missing person appearing on a cover story nationwide and subject to a manhunt? Is just his college fling with Amy that would make me believe that he would take that crazy amount of risk? He appears also too naive or stupid for someone to be taking that risk, which is in stark contrast with his successful image and obsessive/paranoid character (security cameras everywhere). I have never seen a paranoid/rich person who is also that gullible. That character is as fake as a three dollar bill. And Neil Patrick Harris is a bad choice for that character as he strikes me as neither stupid/gullible nor psycho/paranoid.<br/><br/>*Amy's return home storyline has way too many holes to pass as remotely credible. Was she able to access Desi's state of the art security system so as to delete all incriminating evidence? Her staging of the rape was enough to make police buy her story? Was she an advanced computer programmer to erase Desi's hard drives from those security camera downloads? Or should we take that for granted? It's just not believable.<br/><br/>*Pike's performance is absolutely outstanding, probably the only thing of the entire movie worth watching."
"chelseapithiya","1","8","12","3 November 2016"," Am I watching the right film???
","I'm utterly confused...after so many good reviews and the film being uploaded on Netflix (and Ben Affleck, enough said) I decided to watch it. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'm totally missing something, but there are so many plot holes in this movie. And I don't mean like tiny ones you can overlook, but supermassive black hole plothole types. I cannot actually believe it was so close to winning an Oscar. Absolutely shocking. <br/><br/>These are the things that just did not add up (I'm not a CSI, I just have a brain and logic):<br/><br/>1. Why did he not divorce her years ago?<br/><br/>2. The puddle of blood is a very neat little murder. A blow to the head (as the detectives think) would have left splatters everywhere.<br/><br/>3. Would Amy not have struggle against Nick? If she did struggle and Nick had murdered her, there would have been nail marks, bite marks, bruises on Nick's body, sure signs she struggled. This should be the first thing detectives look for on the husband/partner of someone who goes missing - not intimacy marks but wound marks.<br/><br/>4. If the bat thing was the murder weapon, there was no mention of Nick ever touching it!! They can't pin the murder on him unless they can prove the weapon was in his hand. There were no fingerprints left on it etc.<br/><br/>5. How did Amy sneak in all those gifts to Margo's house without her noticing? Also, does Margo just have her shed permanently empty and not visit it ever?<br/><br/>6. CSI could've very easily done some sort of DNA test for any skin residue etc left on those pants in Nick's office. This was left with no explanation.<br/><br/>7. How did no neighbours see a car/Amy's body being dragged out by Desi/Nick?<br/><br/>8. If Nick had done the murder, why would he not bother to properly burn the diary? Or just rip out some relevant pages? If Desi was guilty of kidnapping & raping, what reason does he have to burn the diary? How would Desi get to Margo's house? Does he even know Margo?<br/><br/>9. Nick has a crystal clear alibi with people who can vouch for him and no-one saw him at the scene.<br/><br/>10. Why did she bother making friends with those people at that motel or wherever she was when she should've been laying low? Also a totally rubbish identity change from Amy's part. Her 'intelligence' (or so a poorly executed representation of intelligence) should cover that, no?<br/><br/>11. At Desi's cabin, would there not have been CCTV footage of her coming into the property, completely without a fight, and a fair few days after her abduction? Would investigators not question where she was between that time?<br/><br/>12. What about the CCTV of Amy and Desi happily having dinner together, watching TV etc? <br/><br/>13. What about the CCTV footage of Amy going into the bathroom without any ligature marks on her wrists, to magically appear upon her exit of the bathroom?<br/><br/>14. Why would Amy not run out of the house or call the police when Desi leaves the house?<br/><br/>15. Why would there be no wounds from Desi's abuse on Amy's return?<br/><br/>16. There was no investigation on Desi's crime scene, they just took Amy's word for it.<br/><br/>17. Blunt force trauma wounds do not heal fast - Amy would've had the original 'kidnapping' wounds upon her return. Why did they not investigate this?<br/><br/>18. If the investigators actually did their job, they would've cleaned her up and looked for evidence to match her story to. Instead they sent her home, dripping head to toe in her kidnapper and rapists blood for the press to get some meaty footage. Logic.<br/><br/>19. If Nick is totally out of the suspect list, which he was by the end, there was nothing stopping him from divorcing her. Apart from maybe a bit of hate mail. Nothing would've kept me married to Amy after that.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I've already wasted enough time by watching this film. Also, Amy just needed to stop with that accent."
"john_meyer","2","8","12","30 May 2016"," Extraordinarily poor script
","I have seldom watched a movie where the script writer took as many random shortcuts as those taken in ""Gone Girl."" I've seen this before when a writer -- either because of laziness, lack of talent, or time pressure -- simply has the character do something which advances the story, but without any foundation or rationale for that action. In ""Gone Girl,"" each scene failed to supply sufficient information or motivation for what each character did next. At the beginning of the movie, this was merely annoying, and I thought perhaps it was being done deliberately in order to provide a simple sketch of the characters' backgrounds and then quickly get into the meat of the movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, those ""sketches"" turned out to be essential to the rest of the movie, and because these scenes were not completely fleshed out, much of what followed rang hollow.<br/><br/>It is a complete mystery to me how Gillian Flynn, the screenplay author, could have been nominated for any awards for this mess, and yet she was. This makes me very suspicious of the awards process.<br/><br/>The script is so bad that, as the movie progressed, I kept thinking perhaps they had filmed the ""treatment"" (the script outline used to sell the movie idea) rather than an actual, finished script.<br/><br/>By the time the movie stumbled and lurched to the final, totally unsatisfactory conclusion, I found myself almost angry at all the holes in logic and motivation, and the completely inexplicable things each of the two main characters said and did.<br/><br/>I don't mind endings that are unexpected or unusual, but I do mind endings that feel as though the writer copped out because she lacked the creativity to come up with a much more interesting, clever, and logically consistent ending.<br/><br/>This ending was none of those things.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave the film two stars instead of one is that the basic production values are quite good"

","I have not read the book but will now just in the hope of finding something that justifies the hype around this story. The film was like a farce which to me verged on the comical with the cartoon-esque type characters. Another reviewer comments that had this been billed as a dark comedy it might have just cut the mustard and with that I agree but a tense psychological thriller? No way. It was not cleverly written, there were plot holes galore (the diary really bugged me...even after slight burning I think they could have told that it had been recently written)and the whole of Amy's escape story was just utter hogwash. The acting was abysmal; with the exception of Carrie Coon (Margo)who presented the only sympathetic and remotely realistic character in the whole thing, Not my cup of tea at all."
"nadine-angel-16732","1","9","14","19 February 2016"," What a piece of sh*it. Trashy movie with trashy characters.
","*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>Welcome to a world where everyone is an ass-hole. The husband is an ass-hole. The wife is an ass-hole. The ex is an ass-hole. The mistress is an ass-hole. The other character didn't get enough screen time otherwise they would probably be ass-holes like everyone else in this movie. Let me explain:<br/><br/>The lead character, Nick, is a 40-year old something who used to be a teacher and now sleeps around with his former student half his age. As if teachers sleeping around with students wasn't bad enough, Nick is also married to another woman, making him a cheater also. In short, Nick is a dishonest, immoral jerk. Now working at a bar, he comes home one day and finds his wife missing, and instead of feeling shocked or touched by what looks like a violent murder of his wife, he calmly fills the necessary police formalities and keeps sleeping around with his student. Now when you just begin to think, that the insanity couldn't get any worse, it turns out that his wife is a psycho who fabricated her own kidnapping/murder!! And why did she do that? Well, apparently she has an old habit of getting involved with scum-bags just to press (often false) charges against them later on... Which makes her a scumbag whose only aim in life is to punish other scumbags. Then there is Desi, who is stupid enough to believe all her lies when its obvious that she fabricated the crime herself. He doesn't even has a problem with sleeping with another man's wife. In top of that, he is a snobbish character who believes that he can buy people with money. And if that wasn't enough, Amy was right about him stalking her. Just when you get confused over whose the biggest ass-hole in this movie, turns out that the wife is also a killer!!! At the end of this movie, when Amy and Nick are seen reunited, you realize that these two ass-holes do indeed deserve each other.<br/><br/>At an additional note, this movie is filled with unrealistic scenes, just to take a few examples: The amount of blood that the sociopath used would have killed her in real life, and how could she be sent home from the hospital filled with blood? And why was the diary placed in the dad's house?<br/><br/>This movie is a piece of sh*t. Stay away."

OK even if there wasn't a note confessing to all the crimes and ending the mystery and the movie, still, when they found all that stuff in (HIS SISTERS SHED!!!) why would they not go to the police then, no normal human being let alone two would think that the police wouldn't find it or try to hide it for a minute.

I'm a prolific author and so did I.<br/><br/>A woman (Rosamund Pike) frames her husband (Ben Affleck) for her own murder, even though she's simply disappeared.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is the investigation and finding out what really happened from the wife, Amy, herself; the rest of the film covers what happens as a result.<br/><br/>Most people hated the ending, which felt ambiguous to some. I thought it was okay.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, with Ben Affleck doing a good job in the lead. Talk about turning your career around. Rosamund Pike is excellent as the treacherous Amy, and Carrie Coon, as Affleck's twin, does a wonderful job. On hand is also Tyler Perry as an attorney, Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex-beau Desi, Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit as the police investigating the case, and Sela Ward as Sharon Scheiber.<br/><br/>This is another winner for David Fincher, who proves again that his casting is as skillful as his directing.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the book. I found the story intriguing. As far as plot holes, more often than not, there are plot holes. For a movie like this, I usually just let everything go and get into it so I can enjoy the film.

If you want to suspend your normal/intelligent life, this movie (notice I did not say film) might be for you. Early on, I caught myself thinking of Ben Afleck as the new Richard Gere, a guy who made good in one film and has now gone on to star in B-grade flicks thanks to his looks, but that is a slam to Ben, who likely just needs a better agent or help managing his cash. The acting from Ben and Carrie Coon (plays his sis in movie) is good and the staging of a tired (TV drama) plot is decent enough. Sadly, as the action escalates towards a climax, it becomes far too obvious that the intended audience is the somewhat brain addled bunch who enjoys daytime TV 'talk' shows and hyped-up news shows which hype up crime stories. If you can suspend reality and forget that cops (especially detectives following up on a possible murder/kidnapping and rape) check for fingerprints, dig through computer/cellular records, and follow up on even small leads, you might yet give this 'roll of celluloid' a five or more of ten.

If you've read Gillian Flynn's book or have seen the film, then you already know the story, but I'll spare the details just for the sake of spoilers.<br/><br/>David Fincher has a penchant for making films that are stylistically rich, masterful in many ways, though not always exactly thematically profound. ""Gone Girl"" falls somewhere in-between, heavy on visual slickness with some profoundly interesting ruminations on marriage, celebrity, social status, and the all-seeing spotlight of 21st century media bleeding into our lives at the most inconvenient and horrific of moments. These are obviously transferred from Flynn's novel, but Fincher's treatment of the material is apt and his vision is stunning.<br/><br/>The sinister quiet of suburbia echoes throughout the film's open spaces, and an unusually haunting aesthetic is carried with it. The million dollar house tainted only by the smallest speck of blood; a wife who may or may not be in a danger; curbs alight with news vans and paparazzi. The universal hysteria and obsession we have with murder and crime is fully realized here, and the nightmarish situation is brought to life in a way I've never seen on film before. Flashy modernist photography accentuates thematic elements while juxtaposing with the film's more classic narrative roots, and to great effect.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the performances here are incredible. Even as someone who is not a Ben Affleck fan, I found his performance to be truly admirable, walking the line between innocent small- town guy to deserved hex object. It wasn't until halfway through the film that I realized just how nuanced Rosamund Pike's performance was— she is so good that I was fooled by her banality, and the role becomes almost metonymic as the film unravels her throughout its narrative. Carrie Coon is wonderful as Affleck's spunky and supportive sister, and Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris somehow work here despite my skepticism of their casting. <br/><br/>The film eventually unveils its absurdist thriller roots about midway through, and unfolds in a way that is Hitchcockian in both style and substance, with shades of ""Vertigo"" bleeding into the frames. The film's conclusion is of similar Hitchcockian proportions— unbelievable and yet wholly tangible. No matter how absurd it may seem to be, we do not question it because we really aren't allowed to.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Gone Girl"" is a solid thriller through and through, and is one of the best movie-going experiences I've had in recent memory. Like all the greats, its narrative has all the appropriate twists and turns and is consistently engaging, but rather than simply doing that and taking the route of imitation lone, it's very aware of and engages with its sociohistorical locus. 9/10."

","When the movie finally ended, the audience was quiet. Nobody clapped, only silence. It was as if everyone realized at the same time that they had just wasted good money and valuable time that they could never get back. How terrible it is to walk out of theater feeling insulted by a film. The sheer stupidity of this film frustrated me to no end. I read so many glowing reviews, making me wonder if maybe I saw the dumb downed version? Please, please, please. I didn't know if this was a comedy or a thriller. What was it??? The producers of this film should be ashamed. Give your audience some credit, we are not stupid. We will not accept holes in a story just because Ben Affleck is the star. Did anyone read the script? Why didn't anyone stop and ask some questions before shooting? A laughing attorney, a Fargo like female investigator, the sarcastic yet loving sister, the cold distant wealthy parents, the creepy stalker, the dumb stay home mom, the list goes on and on. I just want to thank the makers of this film for the worst movie experience I have had in a very long time."
"ScottGentry","8","43","89","29 September 2014"," ""Gone Girl"" is a thriller destined for 'vintage' status.
","""Gone Girl"" (18) Directed by: David Fincher. Starring: Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris, Carrie Coon and Scoot McNairy. Rated: 18 for containing strong bloody violence and very strong language. Running time: 148 minutes, 51 seconds. Released in UK cinemas from Thursday, the 2nd of October, 2014. <br/><br/>Earlier this year Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel, ""Gone Girl"", left me devastated. It was a paperback which led me to believe that it had great potential, yet it only managed to provide riveting entertainment throughout its first two thirds. However, it was the ending that spoiled a perfect novel. An ending so inconceivable, that I refused to read another book by Gillian Flynn. Since then I've contemplated why I felt that way, and have graced Fincher's adaptation with gleeful abundance. But, the novelist lied. When Flynn promised a different ending to the film adaptation (which she has also scripted) I was overjoyed, but it turns out that there is no difference whatsoever between the ending of the book and the film.<br/><br/>Personal ranting aside, Fincher's attempt at another critically acclaimed novel is exceptional. It opens with the idea of a perfect marriage, and descends into a convoluted series of mind-games and elements of social commentary, based upon the media's idea of what it is to be accused of murder, and how to deal with their wrath. <br/><br/>Nick Dunne (Affleck) is a thirty-something writer who lives in the heart of Carthage, Texas, alongside his beautiful wife Amy (Pike), who is a writer of the ""Amazing Amy"" book series. All is well in the Dunne household until one day, when Nick returns home from his morning errands to find that Amy is nowhere to be found. With smashed objects lying around the living-room, Nick discerns that his wife may be missing. Upon notifying the police and his family, the media swarm upon Nick like a pack of wolves, aggravating him at every turn. Soon through Nick's albeit strange behaviour, the public perception of Nick's intentions begin to change, with many people asking the same horrifying question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? <br/><br/>You think you know the story? Think again. Sticking close to the source material, Flynn has allowed for Affleck's best performance in many-a-year. Portraying a potential murderer has allowed him to expand his acting talents, with added humour and bite, putting behind his previously disappointing performances and adding this latest role to the shelf of his recent successes, emerging a fully- fledged actor.<br/><br/>Without Affleck's participation the film wouldn't work with another actor in his role, and it's the same case in relation to Pike. Ever since she was viewed in Pierce Brosnan's ""Die another Day"", she has continued to excel in all of her films. Here she plays with the audience's mind, allowing us to encourage her character at one moment, and hate her, the next. It's a strange quality, but her performance is a quiet, yet absorbing one, eventually revealing how talented she really is. A career best performance, I have no doubt. <br/><br/>Apart from the two leads, the film also benefits from a constantly intriguing cast, full of actors who show a side of themselves that didn't deem possible. There are two actors in particular: Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick-Harris.<br/><br/>Yes, Tyler Perry has finally delivered a solid supporting performance that doesn't involve dressing up in a ridiculous stereotypical costume and requires him to actually act. And that he does. Every detail is understated, but he is surprising. As is Harris, who also astonishes within the film, as a constant reminder that he too can actually act when not required to be starring in ""How I Met Your Mother"", delivering a peculiar performance that's both creepy and comforting. Scoot McNairy also appears within the film as a troubled ex-boyfriend of Amy, who, when confronted about Amy's past relationship, creates a dark presence which suits his style exceptionally well. He may only appear for one scene, but it's definitely appreciated. <br/><br/>Gillian Flynn may be adapting her own novel, but why not? She's the perfect candidate for the job. She has spent countless hours carefully crafting these characters and events for her novel, so she should know them from the inside out. That itself is evident. For each scene the audience are treated to characters that are written with affection and the idea that they are actually worth caring about. It's a skill that is worth having, and shows that Flynn may be more than just a novelist, despite her decision in regards to the film's finale. <br/><br/>As always, Fincher is a master behind the camera. His ability to get the very best performances out of his actors is phenomenal, and he does it again here, in a thriller that seems as if it was written especially for his mind. Perhaps it was, and along with his camera angles and general skill in the art, he produces a sleek looking film that mirrors his vision of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (2011). <br/><br/>As most recent Fincher films have been scored by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross (""The Social Network"" and ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo""), the pair have returned to produce a strange and absorbing soundtrack, which fits the tone of the film perfectly. In particular, their track named ""A Reflection"" is a splendid example of how talented they are, and how dark the film actually becomes. It couldn't be better.<br/><br/>Fincher's latest film is an unflinching rendition of marriage in its true form. Darkly comic and boasting some of the finest and most unanticipated performances for many years, ""Gone Girl"" is a thriller destined for 'vintage' status."
"rebeccaspurlock","9","19","35","26 January 2015"," David Fincher is great again.
","Ben Affleck stars in this twisted thriller, based off the best selling novel by Gillian Flynn and boy was it perfectly adapted to the screen. Now Ben Affleck I thought was gonna shine over everyone, but Rosamund Pike's twisted, dark performance improves this film to a near masterpiece mystery. I thought Ben Affleck was just great, but he didn't get the Oscar nom, well there was just way more competition. The David Fincher direction is very noticeable in the film and he has perfectly made another dark mystery, making it more effective with every twist. Rosamund Pike, she very well gives the best performance of the year for a female, also just acting in general. This woman knocks it out of the park and she embodies the twisted, insane darkness of Amy from the book. Tyler Perry was a huge surprise of all and he didn't ruin the film and actually improved it. Neil Patrick Harris was OK, but he just wasn't the right guy for this role. This film was snubbed by the Oscars in the Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Score categories. Let's just hope they reward the only thing nominated; Ms. Amy Elliot Dunne."
"sean_howsyourfather","1","19","35","3 January 2015"," Farcical studio cliché too clever for its own good
","About a quarter way into this movie, I was hooked, won over by the cleverness of the script and its execution. The increasingly tense story of a husband whose wife suddenly disappears is skilfully intercut with scenes of the couple's relationship, from the first throes of love, to the falterings that hint at something darker. The acting and direction promised to deliver a polished thriller, with deeper social commentary on the media and its corruption of the judicial process.<br/><br/>This looked like big-budget, star-laden Hollywood storytelling at its best, so well executed you could almost overlook the slightly ludicrous proposition that police would immediately launch a manhunt and press conference for what looked like a routine missing person report. This was clumsily explained with 'there has been a lot of crime lately', a lame plot contrivance among many that would increasingly litter the movie.<br/><br/>Gone Girl never lived up to its promise and quickly descended from smart thriller to predictable whodunit, with a twist, of course, because all clichéd whodunits have to have a twist. This movie, however, did the old twist on a twist, with another twist  or two. I gave up counting, gave up on this complete inanity after it became more and more ridiculous, less and less believable, with a host of silly plot flaws that destroyed the suspense and degenerated to a laughable conclusion.<br/><br/>All of that money, all of those people who worked on this movie, and they couldn't put together a decent believable story? Kind of sums up the dysfunction of studio formula: all show no substance, all artifice no art. Just another star vehicle with a lame story.<br/><br/>So I'm giving it one star. Those who can suspend all disbelief and like slick-looking cliché may think me harsh, but flawed rubbish like this is a waste of millions that could have been spent so much better elsewhere. And someone has to counter all those fake 10/10 reviews and massive studio promotion budgets that pump up trite fluff like this."

","Quite frankly one of the worst movie's I've ever sat through. Forget the length, forget the plot, forget the acting. The story was so far fetched and actually insulted the intelligence of the paying viewers. This movie isn't even worthy of a review. The acting was terrible across the board with the exception of Rosamund Pike. Even Neil Patrick Harris was terrible. Ben Affleck has some talent, but I've never seen an actor's talent meter swing so radically from one side to the other. There's no redeeming value or consistency in anything Affleck does. Those of you that are digging deep and sharing your views of the ""brilliance"" of this movie need to have a reality check."
"graestella","1","23","44","11 March 2015"," Agatha Christie for the Internet Generation
","The mumbled and unintelligible dialogue lost me for the first ten minutes, but I gave it a second chance as the mystery developed. The boring characters were just about bearable as the plot began to twist and turn. But Affleck and Pike were so cold and mysterious, even with each other, that it was hard to like either of them. So where was your emotional engagement here? Only Margo was remotely interesting. This film also had some of the least erotic and downright odd sex scenes ever filmed. This was a film of two parts. The first part ran through all the clichés of the detective thriller. But we were cheated in the second part when the villainess inexplicably got away with it. In Agatha Christie books, when the killer makes a mistake and has a sudden change of plans this is usually their undoing. As things planned for the original crime stand out like sore thumbs in the adapted scenario. Then they get caught. End of Story! In this particular tale it was the diary. Why would Desi have taken it to a house he didn't know existed, and fail to burn it properly, when he could have burnt it in seconds in the fire at the crime scene ? The cops would have seen through that in seconds, and then the rest of her contradictions would have unravelled. What about the attempted purchase of an illegal gun ? The purchase of the car, the credit card purchases of the electronic toys, the puppets, the Treasure Hunt clues ? None of which could be attributed to Desi, so someone else must have organised or staged them. And just who was supposed to have tipped off the cops to the woodshed ? All non – sequetors that made no sense in the end. Columbo would have had her in the slammer long before the final reel. But the cops just let her off ! The non – examination by the medics of the blood covered Pike was utterly ridiculous. This hospital must miss lots of wounds as they simply don't look for them. Don't let me get taken to this sloppy hospital if I get run over ! She would have had none of the injuries from the initial kidnapping, but a mysterious venepuncture wound on her arm, both of which would have lead the cops once again to think the kidnapping had been staged. We also got treated to homages to Fatal Attraction and The Hand That Rocked The Cradle were the female lead had to be totally insane, not just confident and calculating. This is the old 'male gaze' all women are evil psychos drivel being rehashed for a new generation and we can do without it."
"dass-istnumberwang","4","27","53","17 October 2014"," Seems like I have a minority opinion here...
","You know, I was ready to give this movie a good review. It was going along, I was enjoying things, but then they had to go and ruin it. This movie has one of the worst endings I have ever seen in my entire life. While it might not top Monster A-Go Go (and nothing ever will), as a fan of MST3k, this is not a statement I make lightly. I mean, I don't like endings where the antagonist wins to begin with, but it takes more than that for an ending to genuinely anger me. This movie has the antagonist win for unbelievably stupid reasons. I mean, she tries to frame her husband for murder, which would get him put on death row, when someone else gives her shelter she murders him, but only after she uses him to get pregnant so she can guilt her husband into getting back together. She is unapologetic about all of it, and at the end, THEY GET BACK TOGETHER. And it's not even like Ben Affleck's character is just oblivious, he knows everything, right down to the fact that the kid isn't his! But he lets her get away with it because... I dunno, because she makes great gnocchi! Better answer than the movie will give you! Considering she admitted to murdering Neil Patrick Harris in front of him, Ben's character comes off as being literally too stupid to live! And you know what the worst bit of it? The ending draaaaaaaaaaaaaags. It's not just stupid, it takes time to drive in just how stupid it is.<br/><br/>You know, I can forgive a movie, or a TV series or whatever for a lot of things, and this movie certainly had flaws to begin with (Ben's sister is the only likable character, the news anchor is such an over-the-top caricature of feminists that I'd almost call it sexist, the police charge someone with murdering someone they can't even prove is dead, etc.), but if there's one thing I think is unforgivable, it's an ending that leaves you angry."

","I wasted two and a half hours of my life watching this awful film. I didn't enjoy the plot, which was completely pointless and it had a terrible ending. I like to be moved by a film in some way, the only emotion I felt after watching this was annoyance that I had wasted a good Friday evening. Also, the dialogue was very quiet and difficult to follow at the beginning, a trait in film making which I dislike a lot. The film was recommended by two other people - I shan't be listening to them again! All in all this was one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen and I would not recommend it to anyone.

","This is a thrillingly boring movie. It is cliché ridden, its plot is an insult to the average intelligence of the audience. You can only wonder how good actors and actresses throw largely implausible domestic arguments at each other as they do in this movie. The only role that adds some credence to the murder story is the one of the detective who doubts that the husband was the murderer of his wife and that the wife was not the murderess of her pretended rapist. <br/><br/>In short, you are faced with a poorly constructed plot which in my view would make a successful commercial for lingerie cut to less than 10 minutes and lingerie would provide more thrills than diaries.

","GONE GIRL<br/><br/>Based on the critically-acclaimed best selling novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn, here we have a thrilling, engaging picture that will keep you constantly doubting yourself just when you think you've sussed it out.<br/><br/>The story, for those that haven't read the book, revolves around the disappearance of Nick's (Ben Affleck's) wife, Amy, with Rosamund Pike playing the titular role. Split into a solid three acts, each one will have you confused - in a good way - more than the last, with you either rooting Team Nick or Team Amy for who you think is in the right - or the wrong. <br/><br/>Some powerful narrative is provided by Pike, which only aids in the deep story and gives insight into the characters inner thoughts. At two and a half hours long, it's a lengthy sitter, but being so engrossed in the film as you are you will hardly notice, so an achey bum shouldn't be a worry.<br/><br/>Each member of the cast are fantastic in their roles, especially praising Pike who - really stealing the show - convincingly shows us her idea of 'crazy bitch wife'. Brilliant, none the less.<br/><br/>Neil Patrick Harris, of How I Met Your Mother fame, also gives a great side performance as ill-fated, creepy stalking ex Desi.<br/><br/>This has to be one of, if not, the film of the year. No fantasy, no science fiction, this is something that could happen, which makes it all the more compelling. David Fincher - director of Oscar winners The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and nominee Fight Club - adds another picture to his impressive portfolio and with it, a sure Best Picture winner."

","I cannot believe how disappointed I was watching this film. Form all of the reviews I thought I was about to see a modern classic. In instead I watched a movie so lacking in common sense that the last hour was almost unwatchable. The plot is very obvious (even the ending). Without giving away any plot lines, it seems that in this film, common sense and the trail of evidence does not exist once the real story is revealed. As the last hour of the movie dragged on and on, I was hoping for some redeeming scene that would make everything right or at least make sense. Unfortunately this did not happen. Maybe one of the worst ""good"" movies I've ever scene. If this is what people think is good plot twists, then the IQ of movie watchers has gone down into the single digits."
"johnnydancer1969","1","21","40","29 December 2014"," Absolute Garbage
","Watched Gone Girl last night - absolute pile of garbage! Odd film that doesn't know what it is. Tries to be a parody of the modern world where the media subverts any notion of the truth but the characters are nowhere near defined enough and so we never buy in to it (well I certainly didn't). No real development behind the break up of the couples' relationship - one minute they're having sex in a bookshop, next thing he's lost his job and they hate each other. Silly things like the way the Pike character drops her hidden money during the crazy golf scene, the way she eats a lot and dyes her hair but still looks like the absent wife and the jelly baby scene with the lawyer. Very contrived - worst case of plot manipulation since Crash. As for Pike's certain Oscar nomination, it's a really bad version of Glenn Close's routine from Fatal Attraction; blank expression and the odd violent outburst does not an Oscar performance make. Best bit in the film was the mistress' breasts which were a major highlight considering the dullness of the movie - to quote the Pike character: ""The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits."" Very astute; shame Fincher wasn't as perspicacious."

","The most satisfying thing about this movie is writing this review. Whilst I'm a firm believer in the adage, ""to each his own,"" and I certainly mean no disrespect to others' opinions, I do worry over consumers' standards that movie-goers are able to say anything redeeming about this film. Many other reviewers have nailed the stupidity of the plot and the absurdity of most aspects of the storyline so I'll leave that alone. Suffice to say that at the end, I felt as violated as Amy Dunne claimed she was. I can't believe that such a large group of professionals watched the rushes and felt satisfied with what they'd created. Oh and about the foul language - how did Bogart, Wayne, Heston, Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Davis and Crawford ever make an impact without the filthy language? Oh yeah - they call it acting. I rate myself as reasonably intelligent and I'm no prude but I like a bit of subtlety which I believe any true art form allows for.

However I did have to endure this painfully bad film nonetheless, seeing as how I went to see it at the theatre with friends. Anyway, calling this film the worst Hitchcock film I've ever seen is about as much praise as it's going to get out of me. Nearly every scene in this film seemed overly forced and ridiculous to me. The entire film felt like a sarcastic farce, as if the filmmakers themselves felt their audiences were just a bunch of morons when they made this crapper. Maybe they are right for the most part, judging by the ratings on here. Oh well, each to their own. If you liked it, you liked it and good for you. I for one felt it was one of the worst big budget mainstream thrillers I've ever seen, in fact, maybe THE worst! I was wishing I conned my friends into going to see The Judge during and after watching this garbage. Honestly, what separates this film from your average Lifetime movie? Not much, slightly better acting and much better cinematography, that's about it. I couldn't wait for this overly long and incredibly dumb film to end.

Dangerously -- for Hollywood -- her key manipulations involve deploying feminist tropes against men, the better to get away with the crime. Well, that couldn't be tolerated for long, so 30 ludicrous minutes are tacked onto the film, to make us feel neutral about her and less sorry for the male victims.

","This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The theater I was in a quite a few people in it and from what I heard not many people liked it. I didn't hear one person arguing when a lot of the rest were saying it was a waste of time and money. I actually heard a few people saying Ben Affleck was dead to them since the last 3 movies he did were mind numbingly boring. A lot of people laughed and I agree! Another man that left the theater behind us was actually telling people not to go in because it was a waste of time.<br/><br/>I thought the concept was interesting, but if you stay there figuring something is going to happen soon, you're wrong. Nothing ever happens and the end is as boring as the rest of the movie."
"jenizook","1","36","75","22 October 2014"," Tired of Movies Like This
","I went into this movie ready for a mind twisting mystery and walked away with more of an angry and disappointed disposition. I will say that this movie has made me doubt what Hollywood is capable of and what they deliver to the public. There was a good twist in the middle of the movie, but the beginning and the end were just plain boring. I was waiting for the story to pick up and the characters to begin developing. About an hour and a half in I gave up all hope. The plot twist happened and then it died down again. So, after a painful two hours (give or take), a nice shot of breasts that I would have really preferred not to see, multiple sex scenes that were really unnecessary, and the surprise c**t word at the very end just for good measure I grabbed my purse ready to leave and the credits started to roll. Yep, that was it. A real waste of time and money. Time I could have used to be cleaning my house, working a few extra hours (so in effect gaining more money), or working on many of my projects.<br/><br/>This movie has made me swear off the cinema for awhile. Is it really so impossible to see a movie that isn't made for children without sex, boobs, or the ""C"" word these days? Apparently that is the adult thing now, and even in movies that you wouldn't think would have a reason to show up they do. Wish women would get some self respect and writers would start giving us good, entertaining stories to watch."
"ajanajan","1","14","25","18 January 2015"," Disappointing waste of time
","Like many others, I was shocked by how bad this movie was, and the many plot holes. It's hard to know where to start--Amy being sent home from the hospital still covered in blood was one low point.<br/><br/>I also agree with the earlier reviewer who says the movie is anti-female empowerment. It makes the commentators on TV talking about domestic violence seem like the enemy-because you ""know"" at that point the husband is wrongly accused, so you see the women talking about husbands murdering wives, on the pseudo-Nancy Grace talk show, as false accusers and man haters. Very disturbing.<br/><br/>However, I wrote this review to point out one plot hole, one very big plot hole, nobody else seemed to notice. Again, spoiler here: Amy is a psychopath, supposedly. The whole story turns on the idea that she is sociopathic and abusive and has been for years (witness her framing of the ex-boyfriend 8 years earlier). Why, then, does she give/lend her parents almost her entire trust fund, simply because they ask? It is already established that they care more for fictional Amazing Amy than for her. Her reason: At the end of the day, the trust fund is ""really their money."" Huh? That's how a psychopath/ sociopath thinks, about parents she doesn't like? Or was it part of her ""evil plan"" all along to end up broke in Missouri, so she could start to hate her husband and try to frame him? (sarcasm) It's just dumb.<br/><br/>How did this movie (and book) get such great buzz? I left the movie wondering sadly, is this what people like now? BTW, I watched this with a largely college age audience who laughed several times, especially when Amy flips her (non-bloodsoaked) blond hair at the end of the bloody murder scene. At then laughed again when the credits were rolling."

What is the most unbelievable thing going on with the story? Well, from my point of view there are two major topics: 1. In the end Amy gets home from the hospital still all bloody after everything that happened?! 2. The whole movie Detective Rhonda Boney is very sceptical and focuses on evidence instead of stories and answers from her main suspect. When Amy is being questioned in the hospital, she just asks one or two questions and that is it? Well my friends, for me that is just so far-fetched that this blew the whole movie for me...

"asad_yaqoob10","2","19","36","22 December 2014"," The movie literally mind f***ed me
","I have never reviewed a movie before but after watching Gone Girl, I couldn't prevent myself. I am a big David Fincher fan but this movie literally made me angry in the end. First to start with the positives. In the reviews, the appreciations were focused more on Rosamund Pike than Ben Affleck. I think Affleck was simply exceptional and perfect for the role. As for beloved Rosamund Pike, I will never watch her the same way I used to. The supporting cast played their parts well, especially Margo(Affleck's twin sister). Moving on to the negatives, which were many in my opinion. Not spoiling anything for the viewers, how can the authorities be so inept at the end? There were so many flaws in the story told by the one of the lead characters. It seems everyone was so frenzied by the dumb wit media that they forgot to check the facts. The kidnap story was complete rubbish; tying marks were not accurate with the story, nobody checked the alibi of the perpetrator, nobody focused on the history of the so called victim(It happened before, didn't it??) and nobody saw anyone leave or move. Finally, nothing disappointed me more than the the end. How can someone live with that? What was the point of all this? I love David Fincher movies and can watch his dark classics repeatedly. But will I watch ""Gone Girl"" again ? Never !!"
"Rendanlovell","10","29","59","4 November 2014"," David Fincher proves he is a hard hitting Director once again.
","Gone Girl could be the best film so far this year but Viewer discretion is DEFIANTLY advised. The film follows Nick and Amy Dunn a newly wed couple settling into life in Missouri. But it that all changes when Amy goes missing. The entire country jumps on board to try and help find Amy. And slowly everyone starts turning on Nick. The Back nice guy that is pretty oblivious to everything around him. But if you think you have this movie figured out, think again. <br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFF! It's directed by David Fincher. One of the most ambitious dark directors of the modern age. And he's done it again. The script is very tightly written. Movies based on books tend to either flop or are critically praised. But when you have the author of the book writing the Screenplay not much can go wrong. The Dark humor that is sprinkled in is perfect for the scenes that its used in and is often hilarious. The film has a mood surrounding it that is unlike any movie you will ever see. Through out you are at the edge of your seat yet also constantly looking behind you as a deeply unsettling feeling creeps over your body. This is in large part thanks to the performances by the leads. Ben Affleck and Rosamund pike are so terrific in there roles as well as just about everyone else. <br/><br/>THE BAD STUFF... Well like I said there isn't to much that can go wrong when the books author is on board helping write. There is really only one thing that I didn't like in this film. Near the beginning there was a lot of nudity. Now don't get me wrong i'm OK with it as long as it helps to obtain what the film is going for. Which closer to the end its used perfectly. But the nudity at the beginning feels completely unnecessary and forced. And there wasn't much shortage of it either. <br/><br/>The Verdict Gone Girl is without a doubt one of the best films of the year. Featuring outstanding acting, superb writing, and just an overall mood to it that is unlike anything in film. But some of the nudity took me out of the movie because of how forced it felt."

","Quite honestly, this was one of the best movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews.. It seems to me that most of the negative reviewers are trying not to ""follow the crowd,"" and seem unique in their unrealistic absolute hatred of this film. Everyone is entitled to their opinion.... But jeez, even if this film isn't your cup of tea, it is incredibly entertaining. And this is coming from someone who usually is one of those ""don't follow the crowd"" people. I reluctantly took my girlfriend to see it a week after release since she had been begging me since we saw the previews. The theater was entirely sold out, even having been out a week at that point, and the entire theater was on the edge of their seats and gave quite the standing ""O"" at the end. I'm just saying, in my humble opinion, even if you don't like the movie, you certainly won't feel as if you've wasted your time."

","An 8.4? Are you high? I always thought that there would be a good reason for a movie to last 2 and a half hours. I don't see why so many girls my age (16) were so into it. After watching Gone Girl, I felt as if I had wasted so much time in which I could've accomplished something and made myself more useful. <br/><br/>This movie was a waste of time. It was boring, long and totally ridiculous. <br/><br/>I don't see what is ""feminine"" about it since there are some totally disgusting scenes that I think some men couldn't bare to watch, which of course had nothing to do with the plot. <br/><br/>Fake rape. Was there really a need for it? Was there a need in using seduction to kill your ex? Couldn't you just kill him in his sleep? But NO! I had to be done in a sexual way to make to movie stand out more. The sex scenes were totally outrageous, disturbing and completely unrealistic. And next time you make a movie, try and reduce the amount of oral sex. No one wants to see someone implying that are having oral sex.<br/><br/>I don't know what else to say but this movie is just really bad. And it annoyed me because I was spending so much time desperate to see it because of the high rating, and when I did I felt like I wasted so much time obsessing over nothing. They could've chosen better actors and actresses too. I hope I never come across a movie that was this bad every again.<br/><br/>Sorry, but this movie was an epic fail."

Rosamund Pike's with her blank rather cold expression finally finds a role suited to her as Amazing Amy.<br/><br/>The different perspectives and plot twists keep one interested and entertained for over 2 hours but the murder is just too much, more shocking than plausible.

"pascal-charpentier81","3","24","48","23 October 2014"," Don't fall for the big names or the good ratings
","Gone Girl despite of names like Fincher and Affleck is nothing but a big disappointment. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. But from a technical standpoint it is a poorly written screenplay an even worse movie.<br/><br/>1. First, you don't have a hero. Ben Afflecks character at first comes across as let's just say not very nice guy. This is intended but gives us nobody to root for. And since he is portrayed as kind of a coward and cheater when you find out his wife is alive you still do not really care for him. When the movie comes close to the end and she goes completely bananas we finally care a little bit for him, but that leads to problem number 2.<br/><br/>2. Ben Afflecks Performance: I am really an Affleck fan...as a director. Gone baby gone, Argo, good movies. But as actor he is just not good. There is a scene close to the end where is sister is crying because of his predicament. And its kind of funny because you would have expected that from him. I mean his life is living hell, he must live with a killer and he is not able to pull that desperation off.<br/><br/>3. Why is she like she is? She is unhappy with her marriage and decides to fake her death in order to kill her man and than herself. Are we supposed to believe that? 4. The movie never takes anything serious so can't we. The way the characters are played like the blonde show host, the dumb neigbhour or even Afflecks wife and the the way marriage is portrayed is very exaggerated the whole time which leads to too much comedy and less drama. Rosamund Pike is the best example which leads to my last point.<br/><br/>5. Rosamund Pike is the only good thing in this movie, amazing performance. But that creates a problem. Because she plays it so exaggerated it becomes kind of funny and cool. Which it maybe is supposed to be but till she cuts open poor Neil Patrick Harris with a knife we kind of root for her because she is the cool bad guy. All this planning, and the ""switch"" she pulls whenever she needs to act innocent is just too cool for the ""bad guy"". And this where we have come full circle: We have a movie without a hero who has to overcome a personal conflict. Affleck tries to be that guy but its hard to like him because the first half of the movie he is portrayed otherwise. To have a even more likable hero we need to have a really despicable bad guy. Which we don't have because when we learn that she is alive the movie shows us how she planned it like the clever planning from oceans eleven. So we have a cool bad guy half a hero and what do we learn? What's the message? Be always good to your wife or she will frame you for murder?? Which by the way I was wondering the whole time. The writer must have had some bad relationships because this movie goes on and on about how marriage really leads to complety apathy and hate for each other.<br/><br/>And this one of the movies where people who now find it so cool in a few years won't remember why. It is different but its different because the story and the way the characters behave doesn't really make sense."

I didn't care much about any of the characters but maybe the lead investigator.. But not much time is actually spent on the police work anyway.<br/><br/>The plot is just to impossible/incredible and the twists are just too convenient and stupid. Ultimately you don't really care about what is happening because the Husband character is flat and Ben seems completely disconnected with the events that happen to him... He seems to not give 2 s****. Why would he have married this psycho without noticing anything? I don't know, and I don't care."

Anyone would pack and move to the other side of the world. The husband stays. Who would ? Such an absurd denouement ruins the plot all over. You just don't have the spectator for more than two hours waiting for an outcome to see things come out the way they do. At several points in the story the husband promises to make a statement to the police about his wife, but he never does. They discover the stuff in the garage but then they do nothing about it either. Come on, all of this looks like the old movies from the sixties where the blonde always triples and falls when chased by the bad guy. I have seen somewhere this movie compared to The Fight Club.

It is so full of holes, and not little holes that are easy to let go, but massive, gaping, sucking black holes where some sense of logic should have prevailed but none did, that it is impossible for any person of sound mind and logic to accept all the impossible and implausible outcomes.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with details or spoil the excruciating pain of the length of this drawn out movie that starts off interesting, shows some early promise, then gets caught up in its own plot twists that have no plausible premise, and finishes with some of the most absurd scenes and leaps of faith I can ever recall in any movie that is termed ""drama"". An easy cop-out seems to be some reviewers (those rating it 10) referring to it as ""the blackest of black comedies"", but this is just an attempt to subvert the reader from the simple fact it was so bad we couldn't even really laugh at it.<br/><br/>It's truly a ridiculous film, a total slap in the face for an intriguing book. The first half was acceptable, but the second half was an absolute mess. This movie should offer refunds to those who paid money to see it.

","Gone Girl starts just as good as it ends with an unforgettable bang!<br/><br/>If you're unfamiliar with Gillian Flynn's book Gone Girl, Gone Girl is about Nick Dunne's wife (played by Rosamund Pike) who suddenly disappears one day without a trace and a subsequent search ensues. It's a pretty basic story and premise on the surface but under the surface, the film touches on themes such as marriage, trust, perception and how we view people through the media.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is beautifully crafted by the master of deep moody films David Fincher and that essence is present in this almost masterpiece. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is spellbinding and almost revolutionary. You can expect to see praise at the upcoming Oscars for directing and cinematography.<br/><br/>The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was so pulse pounding and riveting that it gives the movie an entirely new meaning and feeling. Once again expect an Oscar nod for these gentlemen.<br/><br/>Finally the magnificent acting. The acting all round was just brilliant with no one lagging behind. However, the best performance of the entire film and possibly the entire year is the magnificent and awe inspiring Rosamund Pike. Her performance just took the film by storm! You can expect some Oscar recognition for her this year. <br/><br/>My problems with the film are to do with the script. In some scenes (which are as rare as a good M. Night Shyamalan film), things just fall flat. I also disagree with the ending - I thought it ended a bit too abruptly for my liking. <br/><br/>I highly recommend you check Gone Girl out - it's an impressive and unforgettable film that will be recognised at the upcoming Oscars and that will stay with you long after the credits have finished. <br/><br/>★★★★ or 8/10"

","Hate to burst the bubble (IMDb top 250, average mark over 8), but I just didn't get this David Fincher thriller at all. With its combination of unsavoury lead characters, jaundiced view of television reporting and fantastical plotting, I found it unengaging, unbelievable and I'm sure many more ""un's"" I could think of if I put my mind to it.<br/><br/>I'm guessing the main theme here could be the unravelling of a modern marriage in the face of the recession but no, on consideration it just seems like another study by director Fincher of a psychopath. Just what the movies need today. <br/><br/>Nothing is credible here, the relationship between brother and sister, the husband's casual attitude towards his wife's unexplained disappearance, his revealed-out-of-nowhere fling with one of his class students, the wife's misadventure with trailer-park trash, her jilted high-school lover-become-Howard Hughes who gets a poor reward for his admittedly somewhat possessive assistance to her at time of need (seems to me she should have gone after the two who rolled her at the caravan park rather than her ill-fated worshipper). If you're wondering how these random sounding events link together, then, even after watching the movie, so am I. It takes forever to reach a conclusive act of bloody violence which even then isn't worth the wait.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it was no big deal. Ben Affleck looks and acts like a slobbish Hugh Grant and to be honest does so with about as much depth as the Englishman. Rosamund Pike wants us to think she's a latter-day Hitchcock mystery-blonde but she can keep wanting. Almost the only things I liked about the film were Trent Raznor's atmospheric soundscapes in the background and the fluid camera-work throughout.<br/><br/>Otherwise, for me this was a major disappointment and demonstrated no real progress in the genre by this ""name"" director going back to ""Se7en"". The emperor's new clothes methinks."

In summary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and expectations of a true police investigation, but it's as if the author gets so far and doesn't know how to end the story and after dragging it one for nearly 2 1/2 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very unsatisfactorily. The characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and the main character played by Ben Affleck who has been stable and consistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly changes 360 degrees to become a completely different character, which again makes no sense.

Given a score of 8.3 on IMDb, I really expected a gem of a movie; I couldn't have been more wrong! Throughout the movie I kept expecting a breakthrough moment, a moment, a frame that changes the course, shocks me, delights me...anything..but no. All this movie got out of me was confusion that never went away even after the credits started rolling. The only normal character was the woman who plays detective Boney (why that name?).<br/><br/>In so many parts, the movie is just so lame, I cannot begin to imagine why the creators must've made those parts. For instance, Desi's lake house, the fake rape claims and the funniest part being the FBI blindly believing or blind FBI members conducting the investigation. Either way, it was stupid. And what's with the tag line? 'You don't know what you're missing'..The man bloody wanted her gone! And would've been happier had she stayed gone.<br/><br/>I'm glad I haven't read the book, because that would take me longer than watching the movie and that would've been worse. In conclusion, I'd like to congratulate all the people who disliked this movie. You rock!"
"mjoll","1","18","35","19 January 2015"," Really awful
","Please don't waste your time or money on this hyped-up piece of garbage. I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in an ending (not that the beginning and middle were all that great) as I was with this stupid, illogical movie. The only spoiler I have is one of the biggest plot fails ever... she's escaped her captor by slitting his thread, she's virtually covered with blood, and the hospital simply allows her to go home, where she coyly showers it off. Totally amazing that this movie has gotten the positive press and reviews it has received - if this doesn't make you realize how incredible Hollywood hype/marketing system is at distorting reality, nothing will. I only wish I could give it a zero."
"lwellerla","1","8","13","5 September 2019"," Reminiscent of botched Season 8 of Game of Thrones
","Sorry to break the spell, but GG reminds me of botched Season 8 of Game of Thrones or a ridiculously plotted B movie. Evidence to follow.<br/><br/>The story development boils down to whatever character thoughts, actions, or traits serves the writer at the moment, even if they're illogical or contradict what was previously presented. Making story matters worse, we're subject to lengthy and peripheral side stories, such as the media, detective, and attorney. All supposedly clever people who enter the story to establish suspicion of the husband's guilt, when it's not needed because only the reader needs to be convinced the husband is guilty. We don't need these add-no-value side stories that take up time and detract from the main characters' relationship.<br/><br/>For background, the female protagonist (Amy) is established as smart, sophisticated, and cleverly pegs other people. So let's peg this script's list of issues, just the short list because we don't have room for the whole wad.<br/><br/>The writer can't make up her mind how Amy feels about her husband. In one chapter, she describes Amy acknowledging to herself that the male squeeze is her soulmate. Chapters later, she simply changes it to Amy never felt he was the one - because it serves at that moment instead of rewriting the story to make the switch logical. Chapters later, she writes herself into the opposite corner, so changes it again, but seems to remember that she had written the opposite so tosses in a toss-away line that's supposed to take the place of a difficult rewrite to clear up these and gobs of other story holes.<br/><br/>To set-up her husband as a potential wife abuser, Amy pretends that she needs to buy a gun to protect herself from him. So she goes to a run-down shopping mall because she knows the place in inhabited by an assortment of drug users, con men, homeless, and ex or current criminals who may be able to sell her a gun - for protection. Yes, you read that right. Amy's fearful of bodily harm so goes alone to a decrepit mall where she wades in deeply with a wide assortment of characters who could individually or collectively create bodily harm; and she does this because she's in fear of bodily harm. Amy bypasses safe and convenient gun stores and pawn shops because the writer clearly didn't think it would look cool enough. Not logical doesn't factor into the equation. If the writer wanted cool and logical, then figuring out how to have both is the hard job of the skilled writer instead of this lazy option.<br/><br/>And there's more nonsensical plotting. Amy uses this gun acquisition as fake evidence, but then she stays with her husband for months AFTER she buys the gun. To elaborate on this last point, Amy is educated, has no children, and has parents who live not so far away. Yet the reader and police are to believe that a woman who is portrayed as smart, clever, and independent - and not suffering from any mental condition that intimidates her from leaving - stays and sleeps in the same bedroom with a man she supposedly no longer loves and is deathly afraid of instead of leaving in spite of having every means and supposed reason to leave.<br/><br/>Amy's disguise: The missing and possibly dead Amy, whose face is widely broadcast across media channels, isn't recognized supposedly because she changed her hair color and style, gained 15 pounds, and donned eyeglasses. This is like saying if a coworker attempted the same disguise while on vacation, upon her return, no one at work would recognize her? Everyone would be flummoxed stating, ""Who's the new person!"" But no, the writer wants Amy to mingle with other people, so to get around this little problem of her being a missing person who's all over the news, the writer barely modifies her appearance and she's safely incognito.<br/><br/>While supposedly incognito, Amy is easily manipulated by a couple who are presented as questionably ethical. But isn't Amy's supposedly super clever about reading people? So the story needs her to be ignorant about people now, so she's simply written that way. And yep, they don't recognize that's her, the famous kidnap victim, behind her new hairdo, glasses, and 15 pounds.<br/><br/>Amy's hiding from the news media, yet she agrees to meet her old boyfriend at a casino - yes a casino - filled with guests and employees, and where cameras are taping everything. Adding to this mess, Amy later decides to kill her old boyfriend, but her supposed smarts don't kick in to alert her that his whereabouts will be traced back and she'll be seen meeting him in that casino. If your brain isn't hurting at this point, then you don't care about carefully plotted stories.<br/><br/>To build evidence to support her claim of being kidnapped, Amy conveniently feigns distress in front of her fake captor's home security cameras (yep, now that security cameras are supposed to serve the story, they simply do). Yet, those same cameras have shown her willingly entering the home. The reader is simply supposed to ignore that contradiction.<br/><br/>Amy's pretending to be missing, but - I kid you not - she CALLS the police to drop a clue that they should look in her sister-in-law's shed. The police simply look in the shed to find a key clue to then charge her husband with her disappearance. Yet NO ONE asks who that woman was who CALLED IN HER OWN VOICE to give them a KEY CLUE that she SOMEHOW knew? We're to believe that the police didn't immediately trace where the call came from and then question everyone in the area and search for video recordings that may have recorded who was there? And wouldn't the police have played the tape for her husband and relatives to see if they recognized the voice, because if they had, everyone would have realized not only is Amy not dead, but she obviously set up her husband, and the police can now trace where she had been. Yet because the story needs the police to charge her husband at this point, this nonsense is simply plopped into the plot, but we're still to believe that not only is Amy smart, but the police and reader are abject idiots - because they need to be so that the writer doesn't have to do the work fixing this mess.<br/><br/>After killing her old boyfriend, Amy drives for hours, bypassing homes, stores, hospitals, and fire and police stations to drive directly back to a man whom she had portrayed in her diary as an abusive and suspicious potential murderer. Amy is suddenly portrayed as someone with no mental concept that the police will find this suspicious. So why now this ridiculous contradiction? Because the writer wants to describe the husband's reaction when he discovers his wife has returned by having her appear directly in front of him. So the writer simply scribbles it in even though it makes no sense and contradicts Amy's diary, makes her look suspicious, and contradicts how smart Amy is supposed to be. This type of ""write whatever serves at the moment"" style of story development is insulting. As always, there's more. After driving for hours, lucidly stopping at light after light, making turns, etc., Amy walks into her husband's arms then pretends to feint for dramatic effect. And no one is suspicious. And we're also to believe that Amy's parents and police wouldn't address and try to prevent Amy from returning to a man she portrayed in her diary as someone she feared might kill her?<br/><br/>Amy planned to kill herself hoping Nick would be blamed. After changing her mind and returning home, she supposedly uses her husband's frozen sperm to impregnate herself. No matter that she's been all over the news as a kidnap and rape victim and she's now home with her supposed lovey-dubby-hubby who can do the fathering himself, we're to believe she runs to a sperm clinic to impregnate herself with his frozen sperm. And apparently no one at the clinic is suspicious, especially of this woman who must still be suffering from PTSD. Why is frozen sperm even in the plot? Because the plot needs something convenient at this moment to show Amy as having 'cleverly' plotted the pregnancy to get her hubby back. But wait! Hadn't Amy planned to kill herself? But now the plot wants her to decide not to kill herself, so the writer goes back to drop in a frozen sperm story even though it contradicts subsequent sequences where Amy plans to kill herself. So we have Amy changing her mind, killing someone to cover up her own self-kidnapping, and returning to hubby, who she predicts will reject her, so she has frozen his sperm months in advance so that upon her return she can get pregnant to rope him in?<br/><br/>As part of Amy's fake kidnap crime scene, she claims she was hit on the head, but upon her return, she receives a medical exam and there's no evidence of the injury. How does the writer fix this contradiction instead of doing the hard work of making the plot logical? She simply has Amy threaten to make the police look bad if they question her and then show the police intimidated by this limpid threat. The police, medical team, and reader need to be treated like idiots for this to work. Not only, but the police haven't been portrayed as idiots who are instantly fearful of a limpid threat. And what was it with Amy parading around in blood soaked clothes after leaving the hospital where she had been examined? The hospital and police supposedly release a crime victim still clothed in blood soaked evidence! The writer wants the character to parade around in blood for ridiculous shock value, so she simply writes it in even though it's insanely illogical. The story also needs to show that not one detective has checked into any of these contradictions and sought evidence even months after her return. The reality? Her ruse would have been discovered within days by looking into just one of her slew of mistakes.<br/><br/>This story comes across as a not-worked-out draft. Anyone can decipher why this story had any draw, which was nothing more than a few flip-flop twist scenes. Like Season 8 of Game of Thrones, shame on everyone who greenlighted this convoluted mess."

"mgruebel","4","8","13","1 March 2015"," ""Body Heat"" + ""Misery"" = Meh
","This movie wanted it all: the plot where the insane woman frames her husband for murdering her (she framed the lover for her husband's murder in ""Body Heat,"" but same idea), and the plot where the insane woman keeps her husband in the house against his will (it was a crazed fan and a famous writer in ""Misery,"" but same idea). Instead, the sum of the parts is much less than the individual parts.<br/><br/>I have not read the book, and so I must hope that its logic is constructed above the five-year-old-level. That's certainly not the case for this film. Its first two overly long acts work pretty well, gradually revealing the husband's sleazy behavior and downfall to (undeserved) murder suspect in act I, and then the wife's adventures on the lam, when she ironically gets fleeced by low-lifes in act II.<br/><br/>In the third overly long act, the screenwriters have written themselves into a ridiculous corner: Accused of his wife's murder, hated by her parents, his adultery exposed on TV, with plenty of circumstantial evidence that she is a murderous psychopath and the police investigator on his side now, hubby Ben Affleck has nothing whatsoever to lose by dumping her. Au contraire, his life may be on the line. Yet he plays along with his insane wife's 'I'm coming home' ploy! He's motivated by an implausible explanation of how she owns his bar and might be pregnant with his child - the latter a situation that only arose in the first place because he took her back in! We have investigators who let her back to her home within a few hours of her mysterious reappearance, still drenched in her dead captor's (really: her dead victim's) blood, no need to investigate! There's plenty of additional silliness, but this shall suffice.<br/><br/>To make a long story short: in mindless action movies, I wholeheartedly forgive plot holes. In a thriller, not. The last 45 minutes of this film are some of the silliest nonsense I have seen on the screen in a long time. Go see ""Body Heat"" (1981) instead for a well done version of the first part of this movie, and then see ""Misery,"" with an unforgettable performance by Kathy Bates, for a well done version of the last part of this movie.<br/><br/>4/10 for strong acting by Rosamund Pike, who plays the girl turned into a nut job by her parents because they marketed her childhood as a children's book. Affleck also did a solid job, and an excellent supporting cast is at hand. If only they had gotten screenwriters of the same caliber on board, it could have been a 7: I am assuming the novel, with more space to explain and finesse the plot, does not descend into a pile of nonsense at the end."

I think people that wrote good reviews actually were getting paid to do it. My wife likes chic flic's but this one is so stupid and the dialogue is so stupid that only an idiot could like it. The scenes are ridiculous, the police in the story are stupid and do not act like police.

"dierregi","1","6","9","16 February 2015"," If you are blonde and beautiful the police will believe everything you say
","Gone Girl is based on convoluted premise: a psychotic plot to frame somebody for your murder. This deranged idea is not popular for movie plots and could have been worth exploring. It was developed much better in the great film noir ""Leave her to heaven"", where the framing was done in a subtler way. <br/><br/>But we do not live in subtle times, so here we get plenty of gore and graphic violence.<br/><br/>For the few who still do not know the plot, the story is about unhappy couple Amy and Nick. Ben Affleck, woody and expressionless as usual, is creepy Nick the unfaithful husband. During the first half hour he is - quite convincingly - the main suspect for the disappearance of Amy.<br/><br/>Beautiful Rosamund Pike is psycho crazy wife Amy, a woman with a demented agenda and several loose screws. She manipulates every man she meets. At the end of the movie, even FBI detectives are more than happy not to open an investigation on her crimes, just because she is a beautiful blonde and they believe everything she said.<br/><br/>Amy's plotting is given away much too soon in the movie, so we spend two very long hours just following around the demented blonde while Nick gets in big trouble, only for Amy to resurface and deciding to spend the rest of her life with the husband she wanted to see executed.<br/><br/>Does it make much sense?

I cared far more for Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens, who were unquestionably side players. Neil Patrick Harris was just a plot device to get -SPOILER- Amy to return home and reveal that she was alive.<br/><br/>Sure, Amy Dunne is a sociopath for the ages, but she's a terribly draw character.

As an actor, unless he's portraying a cigar store Indian, Ben Affleck should stick to directing....which he's pretty good at. Rosamund Pike was good but it is not an Oscar winning performance.

The twists and turns are totally unexpected. The timing and cadence of this movie is precise. It never felt like a screen play written on a software program telling these artist when and where to make shifts/changes.<br/><br/>There is no area in the movie (acting/directing/settings) that stands out to break your attention (speed bumps); so you are totally immersed in the movie.

For example, people in a relationship do get to know and anticipate what to do or say to get the other person to reveal a little of what they are thinking (their agenda).<br/><br/>For men who have gone through a traumatizing relationship; this movie can be therapeutic, and women can substitute the man being the wife. I identified completely with the husband at the end that until she's done with me; I had better take my chances with her in the same house than to have her out their plotting against me. Also, there is no telling how many land mines she has laid out for me or for how long. Once she leaves I could be dealing with situations that blow up in my face for years after she's gone.

","Does anyone, anywhere genuinely believe that Gone Girl is representing reality? It's completely over the top in terms of it's plot and what the characters do. I won't spoil it, but it's hardly reflective of someone making a false allegation. People simply don't do what the characters do, and I'd question anyone's grip on reality if they thought it was feasible. It's completely bizarre that what is effectively nothing more than a classy thriller is being deemed to making any comment on rape or domestic violence, and even more so to personally condemn the actors for being in it. I could perhaps get on board if criticisms of the book or film were made in a context of how Hollywood portrays rape or violence against women (and am sure there are criticisms to be made), but this direct personal attack on those involved in the film based on something that no one has claimed seems misguided at best. Awful Overrated (as well as HOUSE OF CARDS)."

","'Gone Girl' begins with a married man, Nick, returning to his suburban home to find an open door, broken furniture, blood spatters and his wife Amy missing. Within a couple of days, Nick's account of an idyllic marriage starts falling apart, and the local police begin to suspect he's a wife-killer. Ominous clues are discovered, while a tabloid talk-show host ramps up public hysteria with gossipy revelations supplied by one of Amy's neighborhood pals. Director Fincher encourages his audience to join this vilification of Nick as flashbacks portray the couple's troubled relationship from entries in Amy's diary.<br/><br/>Although the film possesses a few innovative ideas, it ends up a trashy melodrama. The big revelation arrives far too early, and the last third of 'Gone Girl' becomes increasingly far-fetched as any residual tension evaporates. The characters remain resolutely shallow, so there's little reason to care what happens to them as the tale starts drowning in a morass of plot-holes - and by the time it reaches its conclusion, an intriguing mystery has been completely transformed into farce."

"Kmark1293","9","28","60","3 October 2014"," Another hit for Fincher
","Gone Girl was one of my most anticipated movies of 2014 and surely, this latest effort in Fincher's career did not disappoint. This gripping drama follows Nick Dunne as a husband who's wife went missing and the case is on to find out what really happened. Based off the novel of the same name, the screenplay written by the book's author, Gillian Flynn, is a well executed script for a big screen drama.<br/><br/>Speaking of writing, Gone Girl utilizes the usual cliques you would expect from a typical drama and twists them around in directions one might not see coming. The script for this movie is excellent and well worth the possibility of an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay. The dialogue feels very natural and compelling, the structure for the story is solid all-around, and the pacing flows very smoothly despite the lengthy run-time. Overall, the movie has a fantastic script that will keep you engaged throughout the story.<br/><br/>The performances for the most part are fairly solid across the board. Even though I'm not a big fan of Ben Affleck as an actor, I do believe that he puts on a great performance as Nick Dunne. Tyler Perry also puts on a surprisingly great performance and I would like to see him be in more dramatic roles outside of Madea. However, the real big standout is Rosamund Pike whose excellent performance as Amy Dunne takes the main spotlight. As for Neil Patrick Harris, well, he isn't bad, but lets just say he's just good and not great like the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also one of the film's strongest assets and David Fincher certainly knows how to set up a shot. They're steady and smooth from scene to scene in order to give you a clear shot of the characters at hand. Most of the editing is properly well-done; although a few transitions during certain scenes could have been executed more smoothly. The score is also great and Trent Reznor, once again, showcases his musical talents with the music choices being used for each scene.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Gone Girl is one of David Fincher's best works to date and its one of the better movies to come out in 2014. An excellent script, great performances, and solid visuals makes Gone Girl guaranteed to be worth your time and money. I highly recommend that you go out and see this great movie and I going to give it an 8 out of 10."

Not to dwell but the ending was so disappointing that it reminded me of an old low budget horror movie from the 80s that leaves an opening at the end for a sequel that would end up even more underwhelming than the original. I am not recommending that anyone skip this movie, just cut it off around the 2 hr 20 min mark and make up your own ending. ANYTHING would be better than the ending that played out.

","I usually have to watch Fincher movies a few times before I can formulate my thoughts. His movies are jam packed with information, either verbally or non-verbally or as part of the scene or in the background. He demands your full attention. Yes, even Alien 3 was wonderfully gothic.<br/><br/>Let's start with Amy. She comes from a wealthy background. Her mother was the writer of a series of books called ""Amazing Amy"" for which Amy is purportedly the inspiration.<br/><br/>Her husband is Nick, a lowbrow failed writer from the Midwest.<br/><br/>It is insinuated that Amy has a history of being a fake, lying etc. because she's not as Amazing as Amazing Amy and if she's the role model for Amazing Amy, then why isn't she amazing?<br/><br/>They've been married five years, they both lose their jobs in the Great Recession of 2008 and move back to the Midwest (in this case, Missouri Ozark land).<br/><br/>I'll let others comment on the plot, but needless say ""Gone"" is in the title. The case goes nationwide because of the Amazing Amy celebrity angle and a Nancy Grace-ish TV journalist. In desperation, Nick hires a celebrity lawyer who specializes in defending his clients on TV.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, we realize these two winners actually deserve each other - neither one is a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Since the audience already knew she faked her death and Nick was framed, what is the point of the story? <br/><br/>I believe the point of the story is that it takes a lot of lies to keep a marriage going. Marriage makes you an unreliable narrator."

","Amy and Nick Dunne are young, stylish and charming. The immaculate dream couple? It seems so, at least on the face of it. But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous façade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he's trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"", based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. ""Gone Girl"" is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: ""This case is about what people think of you.""<br/><br/>Amy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It's the point where ""Gone Girl"" becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn't a thriller anymore, it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I've never seen anything like it, and I can't praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You'll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She's the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" might be Fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier. If that's not awesome, I don't know what is."

","There are what some will call spoilers contained herein, although I consider it next to impossible to spoil this roadkill turkey.<br/><br/>They had all the advantages. Money, good actors. Ben Affleck being slightly less wooden than usual. Suspense. A good musical score. And still, they made a turkey.<br/><br/>First, in any good whodunit, you need to be emotionally invested in the hero, even if it turns out ""hedoneit."" I couldn't get behind Affleck, no matter how hard I tried. He exudes no warmth and generally seems to be such a self- absorbed slime-ball, it's really hard to care if he gets framed for a crime.<br/><br/>His wife is portrayed as a closet self-absorbed sociopath. After planning a meticulous frame for Affleck, she plans on killing herself, one thing a person like she is would never do. But then, she changes her mind at almost the last moment and decides to live on. This, from a woman who has been living for her master plan for months. Totally unbelievable.<br/><br/>Finally, her plan is on the cusp of succeeding. What happens? This woman, who can come up with a detailed, flawless plan to get hubby blamed for her nonexistent murder, and who later proves she is as capable of murder as a black widow spider, herself, allows all her money to get stolen by two rednecks with the combined IQ of a pint of potato salad. And does nothing to retaliate.<br/><br/>She is then forced to go to her first boyfriend for help, after spurning him for years following false claims about him, too. He softly, gently, abducts and virtually imprisons her. Suddenly, we have a totally new bad movie. As if the first one wasn't bad enough.<br/><br/>Then she runs him through the vegomatic (it slices, it dices) and it becomes a THIRD bad movie, a Slasher movie, with enough gore to satisfy Quentin Tarantino. By this point, I was looking hopefully at my watch, but the movie runs too long, anyway. It takes a long time to roll three bad movies into one.<br/><br/>I haven't touched on all the plot holes. I figure others have done well enough by them.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, it was the story and script that I consider awful. I can only explain the high rating by guessing Affleck or the studio have a large staff. Or perhaps ""wrasslin"" and American Bachelor Idol Survivor wasn't on that week, and people desperate for entertainment who had never seen a proper mystery movie chose to rate this one.<br/><br/>It's pretty much out of the theaters. If you really insist on wasting this much of your life, wait until it show up on cable.<br/><br/>Or, better yet, rent ""Laura"" or ""The Maltese Falcon."""

Neil Patrick Harris was great as always. <br/><br/>2)Fincher did his best despite a terrible plot and bad editing.<br/><br/>Had this movie ended with Affleck getting the death sentence and the wife getting captured or killed by Neil Patrick Harris and just ended instead of giving us 30 more minutes of a crazed lunatic women plotting a way to undo her original plot that she was murdered by her husband, then you would have a great movie here with a great dark ending.<br/><br/>This movie though has a women plotting the death of her husband by framing him for a murder that clearly we knew he did not commit. The guy was a drunken loser from the start of the movie after all. Murderers don't play xbox - drink at a bar the day he commits murder, is corgile to his nosy neighbor, ups a life insurance months before a murder from 1m to 1.2m, not to mention go on a spending spree and hide all the items in my sisters woodshed, etc...<br/><br/>There was no mystery that he was guilty - sorry people - maybe the book had a mystery here, but not in the movie!<br/><br/>He was clearly innocent and acted that way. We knew it unless your head was in the sand!<br/><br/>Then halfway through we found out he was innocent by seeing her and finding out how crazy she is, which validated 100% of what he said.<br/><br/>No mystery there either. <br/><br/>The only thriller aspect was, how was he going to get out of being accused of her murder!<br/><br/>This would have been good if he did get framed for murder and convicted, then I would say bravo to a smart lead female character!<br/><br/>BUT<br/><br/>She fell apart when she did her road trip of hate towards her husband by getting caught up in the media and his appeals to her!

How do you undo your own murder that she planned for months or years?<br/><br/>YOU DON'T!

Really - He takes her back????????<br/><br/>WORST MOST UNREALISTIC ENDING IN A SERIOUS MOVIE EVER!!!!<br/><br/>He takes her back!!!!!<br/><br/>Is this a best selling book for Americans today - which I am, but am afraid of how easily duped we can be!<br/><br/>Again, - had he died by the death penalty - and she got trapped by her stalker, then you have a great ending, but a just wait and see how dumb these two people are taking each other back into their lives ending is 1 and a billion - and reality TV at it's worst!<br/><br/>I know a lot of you people who liked the ending love this kind of nonsense endings that only happen to 1 and a billion and is on all those dumb TV show drama's, but that is not for me! <br/><br/>Sorry!<br/><br/>1 last thing - she leaves a clue to the woodshed where he had all kinds of expensive stuff hidden in, but never opens it or uses it? Why would a guy who murders his wife do that? Why????? Why spend them into more debt and bump your insurance by a simple 200k, to prove that you are a murderer? Who does that?<br/><br/>The wife reads books on the perfect crime - and she comes up with leaving clues that incriminates herself more then him! <br/><br/>Sorry for the rant, this movie sucked and the people who liked it are off the wall with tabloid bs!<br/><br/>A note for Fincher lovers - The Sixth Sense was a classic by M Knight Shamalan - but really - they are different movies to follow - so let's take this piece of crap Gone Girl and let it Get GONE!!!!"
"streamofstars","8","26","56","2 October 2014"," David Fincher's latest masterpiece
","David Fincher has delivered once again. His latest masterpiece, Gone Girl, is an uneasy thriller based on the novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn, (who also wrote the screenplay for the film). I won't go over too much of the plot here, but the basic premise is about married couple Nick and Amy Dunne (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike). One day Amy goes missing and Nick is the prime suspect. But all is not what it appears to be. The less I say the better regarding the events that unfold.<br/><br/>The film is very much a character driven piece – the many layers of the characters' personalities being revealed slowly and purposefully, and as the movie goes along you grow more and more curious and intrigued by what has happened and what will happen.<br/><br/>There are solid performances from all involved. Ben Affleck in one of his best roles ever, gives a strong and studied performance. Rosamund Pike is absolutely stunning, and deserves an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast including Kim Dickens, Carrie Coon, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris are all fantastic.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing are perfect, the production design slick. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, marking their third collaboration with Fincher, is chilling.<br/><br/>David Fincher is one of the most creative and innovative directors of our time, and although Gone Girl is not my favourite Fincher film, he never fails to bring to the screen a unique and stylish cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing on the big screen, Gone Girl is dark, beautiful, terrifying, tense and at times humorous. It's a film you'll be talking about for days afterwards."

However when Amy vanishes without a trace to her whereabouts, police and residents deduce that Nick has done away with Amy, but the truth is far stranger than elaborate fiction. <br/><br/>Affleck is in top form as Nick, a man who had it all: a beautiful home, a bar run by his smart mouth sister (Carrie Coon) and the ultimate trophy wife, but when evidence points to him having possibly murdered Amy the viewer begins to despise him as his dirty little secrets begin to surface. <br/><br/>As the manipulative and scheming Amy, Rosamund Pike gives a bravado performance that has netted her an Oscar nod for Best Actress. She is the seemingly perfect wife, but as her web unravels we learn there is more to Amy than a wealthy woman with a gorgeous facade. <br/><br/>Under the direction of Fincher, the atmosphere is dark and brooding, full of foreboding as we step into the mess of Amy and Nick's five year marriage.

Evidently it is based on a novel, so the director should have known what a load of bullshit he was dealing with from the onset. The movie begins as a police procedural complete with the ""victim"" voicing over flashback scenes showing the married couple's progression from young lovers to boring married people. The first 45 minutes play out like one of those Lifetime movies where it is obvious to everyone (even dumb males) that all men are assholes and deserve every bit of misfortune that comes their way. Around the 1 hour mark, the story takes a remarkably sharp turn and it seemed as though there was hope for it being a good movie. Instead, the movie devolves into a steaming pile of bullshit. Let's put it this way: I have seen soap operas with more realistic plot-lines.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck leads a cast that tries its best to trudge through the ridiculous screenplay. There are a few good scenes, but they are as hard to find as an honest man in Washington D.C.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of that one person who comes over to your house for a party, makes everyone uncomfortable, then stays way past his/her welcome.

It might be, to some critics, an arty movie but from the reaction (same as ours) of the crowd when the movie ended....a let down. A prelude to a part 2 or 3, similar to Revenge series, which was far better. This movie was so dark, I thought the cinema must have poor equipment. Acting was good, no doubt about it....plot was good but, boy, did it get bogged down in the last 40 minutes! For me, the lawyer, Tanner Bolt, summed it up for me and from the reaction in the cinema, the rest of the audience, when he said to Affleck that he and his wife are the two most f....d up people he'd ever met. Go watch The Judge instead....it is hopefully better"

","Love love loved this movie. Read the novel by Gillian Flynn and was amazed by how sick and twisted the story line was I could not stop talking about it and the fact the movie was coming out shortly after. Let me start out by saying the book to screen adaption was SPOT ON. The movie did not leave out a lot of information from out of the books which normally is the case. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike were the ideal couple I had pictured from the novel, their performances couldn't have been done better by anyone else. Very happy with the casting. Kept my attention the whole time, and could not wait for that twist. It was everything I had imagined. Very impressed with this movie. One of my favorites most definitely. Go see this and watch it 100 times more after that if you love the kind of movies that f#$% with your mind."

","David Fincher has done it again! And on a whole new level. Gone Girl is a masterpiece which includes everything you would expect from a Fincher film, mainly the overall visual image of the film is classically Fincher (beautiful, stunning & cool). <br/><br/>Gone Girl plays with the viewer, from start to finish you don't know what to expect next, there is no moment of relief where you feel safe that nothing significant is going to happen, real edge of your seat stuff. The two main characters (Ben Afleck & Rosamund Pike) steal and throw away your allegiance more times then you can count, the film makes you want to choose a side and sympathise with a specific individual, however it is almost impossible to do so. You will: hate, love, feel sorry for and be surprised by both lead characters many many times throughout. (I would also like to add that Neil Patrick Harris gives an amazing performance, the best acting I've ever seen him do)<br/><br/>It is like no other film I've ever seen before, and to top it off I cannot find any aspect of the film that I didn't think was perfect.

Being true to his style, Finchi- Noir does it again in theaters, delivering with a dark picture and a haunting sound, one of the most complex and sociopathic marriages the history of cinema has ever seen. In 149 minutes, we have the opportunity to be part of the investigation of a crime with a ton of faces, filled with several decisions to make and with two sides to choose from.

I venture to guess that they're rationalizing the film in whole to be as good as certain segments; probably from subconscious fear of suffering the same letdown that the more objective viewers (i.e., myself) are, meaning they just CANNOT--DO NOT--WILL NOT--believe this movie could go from bad to good to great to bad to just plain terrible effing lousy so fast.

","(DISCLAIMER - This review contains potential spoilers. However, if you've read the book or watched the movie, read on!)<br/><br/>David Fincher's GONE GIRL is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece!<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne, the likable asshole so well, to the point where it made me uncomfortable to like him. His actions and reactions in the film are ingeniously timed, wonderfully realized, and real in every way. Rosamund Pike, however, is the true standout. She absolutely steals the show as Amy Dunne, the psychotic wife. Her portrayal of the sociopath is so cool, calm, and collected - it comes off as much more realistic when she does break down and go ballistic. Even when you know her motives, she keeps you guessing the WHOLE time. Desi Collings is creepily and wonderfully brought to life by Neil Patrick Harris. Carrie Coon is awesome as Margo Dunne, the unglued sister of Nick who has a front row seat to all the action. Tyler Perry is another hilarious standout performance as Tanner Bolt, defensive attorney for Nick. Also worth mentioning is a star performance by Kim Dickens as Detective Boney.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully rendered on screen. The lighting, color palette, and cinematography are all wonderfully beautiful.<br/><br/>The screenplay, written by the author of the book upon which this movie is based, sizzles with wit, snappy dialogue, and narration that feels real and conversational.<br/><br/>The music is so perfect for the situations it's put in. One of the best uses is towards the end, when Amy seduces Desi into sex and then kills him. The music pulsates and pounds, and the whole time they have sex, you are totally on edge. However, when the deed is done, and she kills Desi and completes sex with him as he bleeds to death, the music crescendos and the terror is fresh. Even though you knew something was not right, the music prepared you for it and elevated the scene. <br/><br/>There is literally nothing they could have done better for this movie. It's dark and twisted, macabre and humorous, sexy and violent - everything a modern thriller should be. <br/><br/>10/10 - Would Highly Recommend"

One day Amy mysteriously disappears, all attention is on Nick as his reactions to the disappearing of his wife are distant and unsettling. <br/><br/>After Nick is almost proved guilty, it is revealed that Amy planted all of the evidence in an attempt to get revenge on her husband. We were all on her side at this point. Amy's diary revealed that Nick had beaten and sexually abused her as well as used all of her savings on senseless buys. And then the film completely lost me.<br/><br/>Amy reveals she faked the entire thing. Nick was not an abuser. It is further understood Amy has a history of making false rape accusations, and more. The film makes you sympathize with Nick, as he has become a victim of a psychopathic wife. However, Nick still remains an incredibly unlikeable character who was taking advantage of a 20-year-old.<br/><br/>Amy then returns to her dissatisfied husband. At this point, I had completely given up on the film and was just waiting to see Nick leave his psychopathic wife. Of course that won't happen, instead the film ends with Nick being trapped with Amy after she confesses that she stole his sperm and impregnated herself. <br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" had great potential, but its plot twists ruined the film. The acting was decent, but the direction completely blurred the message, if there even was a message. At times, even the actors looked like they couldn't believe how terrible the film was.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Gone Girl"" was unsatisfying and deeply disturbing, but not in a good way.

","Nick Dunne(Ben Affleck) returns home from ""The Bar"", a local pub owned by him and his sister, to find his wife Amy Elliot Dunne(Rossamund Pike) missing. As police investigation looks further into the case, Amy's disappearance becomes a country-wide issue when disturbing evidence begins to point towards her husband Nick. As more evidence rises against him, this once ""perfect"" man is now being seen as a disturbed sociopath as everyone asks him the ultimate question: Did you kill your wife?<br/><br/>In probably one of the most disturbing movies of tbe year, Gone Girl explores the definition of ""marriage"" and what leads to a corrupted one. Nick and Amy are seen as the perfect couple, picture-perfect and rich. However, this quickly changes. In the matter of 5 years, Nick and Amy become incompetent of maintaining this marriage as we see Nick unravel as an evil, lecherous man through Amy's eyes and thought. <br/><br/>Most people seem to judge the performances in this film, especially Ben Affleck's as Nick, but in my opinion, he did an amazing job of picturing Nick. His evasiveness towards Amy's disappearance, his naivety towards everything and most of all his arrogance/ignorance towards Amy. While I don't want to completely spoil Amy's character, I will say this: She is one of the most well crafted, and deceiving sociopaths ever created in film or literature. Her horrifying interpretation of revenge and marriage is disturbing yet fascinating at the same time. <br/><br/>While Gone Girl is most definitely not for everyone, it is truly an amazing film. It is dark, incredibly well acted, a faithful adaptation, and most of all, it try does deliver. Lifetime movie? I think not.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Remember when a movie was considered good because it made you feel something? What has happened as of late? I don't understand why this movie has gotten so much praise. I had been looking forward to seeing this since I first saw the trailer. The preview made it seem like a deep psychological thriller with similarities to Gone, Baby, Gone. Boy was I wrong. It was a cheap mystery which wasn't even suspenseful because the answer is revealed in the middle of the movie. I can't stand the lead actress. She is so wooden. I didn't feel whatever great love they were trying to portray in the beginning of their relationship. I didn't like the way their relationship fell apart with very little visual explanation. They said it fell apart because of a, b and c but there was only one scene when she kind of got a tiny bit bitchy about him playing video games. That was supposed to show the deep hatred that developed between them? It was more interesting and believable when I thought he may have actually been abusive. Then it's revealed later on that he actually wanted desperately to have a baby with her after he had already started an affair with a student? OK...<br/><br/>I won't go into all the other super obvious holes in the plot because many other reviewers have already pointed them all out. It seems like the story outside of her plot only evolved to make her plot possible. Like they were making it up as they went along. I didn't care a bit about any of the characters. There wasn't enough character development for that. I didn't even care about the creepy twin sister who seemed to have no life outside of what was happening with her brother. When the big reveal happens at the end, I wished his sister had just killed him herself to put him out of his misery. And don't get me started on Neil Patrick Harris in his role. That was a terrible choice. Was he or wasn't he actually a stalker? I still don't know.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 4 because it wasn't completely terrible. I was somewhat entertained. I just didn't feel a damn thing about it and when it was over, I had wished I had chosen to watch a TV show on Netflix instead of wasting 2 hours and 5 bucks renting it on Amazon. It was just blah."

","The institution of marriage, being a foundation of civilization since the dawn of man, has adapted to subsequent eras but, in some aspects, not necessarily improved. Problems between men and women abound regardless of the type of their relationship, resulting in various commentaries and insights as to possible solutions, either temporary or permanent. Yet, the central question remains: can two people, often complete strangers when initially meeting, remain faithful to one another and build enough trust to establish a meaningful and fulfilling relationship? There have been several notable examples but, as time seems to reveal, knowing more may result in understanding less. <br/><br/>At last, we have a cinematic representation of the perilous ups and downs of the journey from courtship to romantic climax to marital pitfalls, all within the context of an increasingly cynical social construct. Certainly, the subject of strained marriages is nothing new to the movies, but David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel goes deeper, bleaker and more harrowing than any other film of its kind. Fatal Attraction was a childish affair compared to the Dunnes.<br/><br/>As the film opens, with a rapid and nervously jumpy energy, Fincher gives a masterclass on how to establish mood in a thriller. Every scene is impactful, every shot built to further the tension and tighten the air. The conclusion seems fairly certain, and Fincher wants us to want that conventional denouement. After all, wouldn't that be easier and safer to digest than anything else? <br/><br/>Yet, Fincher refuses to gratify our simplistic expectations. Flynn, in adapting her own novel, tightens up the pace and slightly alters the ending to create a remarkably paced and exquisitely fashioned narrative, but it is Fincher's trademark cool, detached visual style complete with complex shadows and hints of blue and gray that put the finishing touch on this experience. One simply cannot look away from this film. At the halfway point, the 'reveal' utilized deflates any and all expectations we may have had, only to overwhelm us with endless questions as to how, what and why. The rest of the film covers those inquiries, yet still retains a level of ambiguity and forlornness. We continue to watch because it is in our interest as thriller-fans to do so, but on a subconscious level, there is the knowledge that conventionality is out of the question.<br/><br/>Fincher's stylistic, sometimes smug, modus operandi is exemplified through his extraordinary ability to cast perfectly. Long understood as an overtly-handsome, sometimes aloof actor, Ben Affleck carries this film thanks to the control and forced exactness of Fincher's directing. His aloofness, as several critics have noted, is utilized here to the greatest effect, causing the character of Nick Dunne to remain an enigma and a sympathetic man simultaneously. Very few actors could pull this off, but Affleck makes it look easy, using his broad, muscular body structure, puppy-dog eyes and down-turned smile to keep everyone guessing as to his true motive. <br/><br/>Motive is more crucial here than in most thrillers. Flynn's story questions the deepest expectations and assumptions we make about other people, particularly those we think we would like to spend a significant portion of our life with. Affleck can reflect this as can Rosamund Pike, whose Siamese eyes, creamy skin and sultry voice give nothing away about herself, keeping our guesses constant throughout. Early scenes between Nick and Amy, showing their attempts to win each other over, can only truly be understood in light of the entire film, an aspect of Flynn's novel Fincher exploits particularly well. If nothing is as it seems, what are we supposed to presume could or will happen? <br/><br/>As the authorities track the clues as to the whereabouts of Amy Dunne and Nick's involvement, the notion of the simplest answer being best arises. This is frequently a logical error, yet on a certain level that may be the best method of approach. Applying this train of thought to the director, it has been argued that nearly all of David Fincher's films have been an attempt for him to overcome the frustrating and creatively-retarding experience on his first feature, Alien 3. While remaining a simple critical tool to find thematic relations amongst an otherwise diverse career, this notion is tempting to grasp. If there is any truth to it, it may be that Fincher has finally gotten the quality of clout needed to be able to make exactly what he envisions. He has often said he usually gets about 70% of his vision on screen, the rest being compromised out. Somehow, this film feels uncompromising. It is exceedingly dark, foreboding in its attitude not just towards marriage but humanity in general. Questions will abound, but answers often remain just out of reach."

My understanding is the person that wrote the book stuck straight to here story in the screenplay and that reminds me why I read so few books. This is not ""Oscar worthy"" in any fashion.

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.9/5 stars<br/><br/>Suspense, social commentary, a breakout performance from its leading lady, and a seriously twisted outlook - ""Gone Girl"" is one killer movie. It's also a pitch-black satire of modern marriage, and one of the most unsettling films of the year: The premise is flat-out creepy. Make sure you're game for that before you see it.<br/><br/>Directed by David Fincher and based upon the global bestseller by Gillian Flynn, ""Gone Girl"" unearths the secrets at the heart of a modern marriage: On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his beautiful wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police and growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits, and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? But there's more to this darkly twisted scenario than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Fincher and Flynn (adapting the screenplay from her own eponymous book) have fun playing with both our expectations and our sympathies. As they peel away layers of their story, a feeling of dread grows; it's like pulling moldy leaves from an artichoke that is rotting from the inside out. With the close-knit psychological ambiance, the film paints American middle class as a blood-curdling, emotional danger zone. It's a testament to David Fincher's skill as a filmmaker that he makes something as complex as ""Gone Girl"" feel so effortless yet riddled with palpable suspense and spellbinding twists.<br/><br/>Couching its commentary in a propulsive pulp tale, ""Gone Girl"" is a genre triumph - at once scary and deceptively sly. Dark, clever, twisted, and stylish, this riveting thriller plays to director David Fincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of its female lead, Rosamund Pike."

The husband is clearly not as enthralled with his wife as he was when he proposed. The wife, who is aware of this, has become a psychopath and will do anything to damage her husband.<br/><br/>The biggest and most ridiculous flaw in the film is that the wife, among other things, has decided to kill herself so that her husband will be accused of murder and, she hopes, get the death penalty.

Yet when she returns home he not only doesn't try to have her arrested for framing him for murder (and also for obviously having just framed a second ex-boyfriend for rape before slitting his throat), but he actually decides to continue to sleep in the same house as this psycopath!!<br/><br/>Never before have I seen a movie insult my intelligence to the extent this movie did.

","There is not a thing I did not like about this film. I watched it winter 2014 at Avenue Mall's Cineplexx in Osijek during its release date in a Croatian European Union part. This is, according to my opinion, Ben Affleck's acting of a lifetime. I was astonished by Rosamund Pike's marvelous acting as well. The plot was greatly interpreted by David Fincher even greater than he did in a 1997 The Game film starring Michael Douglas. I adored the scenery in the film and the overall atmosphere was spooky in a rather good way. I will never forget the posh scenery in and around a stone house with a wine cellar and Rosamund Pike's throat cutting."
"zkonedog","7","3","4","1 March 2017"," Captures Most Of The Book's Bizarre Mystery
","Its a little tough for me to watch/review ""Gone Girl"" seeing as how I had already read the book. For a plot that relies heavily on surprise and misdirection, I already knew what was going to happen, and that obviously makes it a different viewing experience. I was very impressed, however, by how the film was able to capture the basic essence of the Gillian Flynn novel (maybe it helped that Flynn wrote the screenplay herself!).<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Gone Girl"" tells the story of Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). One day, Nick comes home and finds his home a crime scene and his wife gone. Lead investigator Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) immediately suspects Nick, whose Ivy League nature and shadowy past make him seem like a viable candidate for the crime. Despite initial support from sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and Amy's parents (played by David Clennon & Lisa Banes), the case against Nick seems to keep getting worse and worse. Could he really have killed his wife?<br/><br/>This movie excels in a number of different areas. Flynn is able to seamlessly move the plot from book to screen (no easy task) while still retaining its creepy nature and haunting themes. The casting is also spot-on. Affleck is playing practically the role he was born for (good-looking suave guy who may just be a complete slimeball) and Pike is similarly perfect in her own way. I can see why this one was nominated for a number of Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Of course, probably the hallmark of ""Gone Girl"" is that besides spinning a great mystery, it also provides some subtle (or not-so-subtle) commentary on the institution of marriage. I wish I could say more, but to do so would be the ruin the surprises for those who haven't seen it yet. For lovers or young newlyweds watching this movie, I can easily see it producing either deep conversation or very awkward moments.<br/><br/>Why not a five-star rating? Well, my exact ranking would be 4.5 stars. I have to go the other direction, however, primarily because I HAVE read the book previously. If there is one thing that doesn't transfer over it is a little bit of the deep commentary on relationships in general. ""Gone Girl"" is a psychological thriller, so some of that is probably better examined in the slower pace of the novel. While reading the book, I was completely sucked in and entranced. Most of that carried over into this film, but not necessarily ALL of it.<br/><br/>Of course, I can easily see someone who doesn't know the plot ranking this a five-star effort all the way. It manages to tell an individual mystery filled with over-arching themes about relationships and marriage. A truly haunting tale."

Maybe because of that, but i don't think that he is present good Nick Dunne as a character. On the other side is Rosamun Pike who is very beautiful women, and she is a way better than Affleck in this movie in my opinion. Movie has one nomination for Oscar, and that is for Rosamund Pike as a leading role, and she could won that if you ask me. She was great. I've felt hers emotions even that is hers lies.

Furthermore, it seems logical to satisfy both adapting to the times and practical needs. Even so, Fincher still remains one of my favorite live directors. But it's fairly common that early movies (in most cases), are the best. To maintain quality over time it's beyond the reach of most.

","Ben Affleck has a few compelling, convincing scenes where his boyish innocence and modest charm are exploited to considerable effect, as though daring me to believe anything coming out of his mouth. Rosamund Pike's performance is much more ineffectual and troubling; Miss Pike is clearly just as new to and unfamiliar with the character she's playing as we are. Rather than eliciting profound wonder at the impossibly fickle and treacherous mystery that is the scorned female psyche, Pike's portrayal only manages to provoke some mild ire and a lot of disbelief. I simply couldn't tolerate what that scheming spouse--as well as the rest of this dumb movie--was demanding of my patience. Too much, man.<br/><br/>The production values are sufficiently high that its appearance and soundtrack are both fairly seductive. I was drawn in more by the luxury of their lives than through the lead characters' personalities. Almost right from the start I wasn't buying what this disingenuous and manipulative film was emphatically, desperately selling.<br/><br/>I was initially interested, mildly, with how this lumbering, plodding schlock fest would resolve itself only because I quickly became aware that it would require a tremendously skillful and tactful twist to bestow any sort of honor upon itself, but no, it merely continues to lamely drone on and on, wallowing in its own inflated sense of importance. It's a clunky, corny, spastic, tone deaf, silly sham of a cinematic experience. If you're entertained or even amused by this overly clever, self fascinated triviality then that says some pretty unappealing things about you. Perhaps you enjoy being cynically conned and openly mocked? Me, not so much. <br/><br/>Sitting through this too-ridiculous-by-a-half stunt of a film is more daunting than actually being married to the cunning manipulative psychopath into which Rosamund Pike's stoic anti-hero methodically morphs. ""You're delusional!"" Ben Affleck's outwitted, out maneuvered husband accuses his crafty spouse, as though the thought hadn't already occurred to us. He complains that their relationship has become something very bad, something very nasty--I dunno exactly, I stopped paying much attention by that point--and she replies so mechanically ""That's marriage."" Wow, hysterical. Or not. Who knows, or cares. Not me."

"Jeevsie77","4","18","41","6 October 2014"," Can't get behind Gone Girl (SPOILERS)
","First of all, let me say, I am fan of David Fincher. I like his films a lot. But I cannot get behind Gone Girl. <br/><br/>No, I have not read the book, and I don't care. Movies are free-standing, and it is not their job to be an addendum or a companion to the source material. The film should work on its own. If it doesn't, it only has its makers to blame. <br/><br/>This film has a too many flaws to ignore. <br/><br/>First, the beginning setup back story was pretty bad. I understand all the flashback stuff of Nick and Amy when they first met and started dating is important to the story. I am just saying that it was bad. Some of the dialog was so stupid, I wanted to laugh out loud in the theater. If the dialog was taken verbatim from the book, well, its the director's job to see that in film form it doesn't work. And for me, it did NOT work. It was just so contrived and unbelievable as to be  well  dumb. That is the only word for it - dumb. And this back story, in the form of flashbacks, litters the first third of the film. <br/><br/>But the film finally starts gaining steam, overcoming the cookie-cutter mundanity of the first act. Amy's framing of Nick is being revealed. Nick is now being looked at hard by the police. The physical evidence is starting to pile up. Yet they still have no body to charge him with murder. Nick must run to a fancy lawyer. He is being slayed in the media. Perhaps that is the strongest part of this film  how the public is so impressionable and so deceived by the media. Most people will believe almost anything they are told on TV or read on the Internet and become overly emotionally involved. It's pretty disgusting. We obviously have seen that numerous times in the past 5 years or so. <br/><br/>So, it's inevitable  at some point Amy is going to be found alive or she is going to come home. You just know that is coming. And come home she does, after murdering poor Desi Collings and framing him for her abduction. <br/><br/>So you think the movie is going to end soon. Nope. What we are lead to believe is building up to some awesome, climactic ending slowly drips to disappointing dud. And no, I don't care if this was how the book was written, and when you read the book, ""it's awesome."" This is a film, and it has to work on it's own, as a film. To me, it didn't. <br/><br/>Look, I don't mind unresolved, unconventional endings. I am fan of art films, so this is not some plebeian movie-goer here complaining about how the ending ""sucked bad, bro."" But it just didn't work in this case. It was not THAT type of film for the entire runtime. You can't just tack on some awkward ending and accept the audience to accept it, when the rest of the film was trying to be something else. To be blunt, the ending was just awful. If Gone Girl was not based on a book, I would have assumed that they didn't know how to end it in the writing process, so they just tacked on some awful ending that was thought up in a production meeting or something like that. It was that level of bad. <br/><br/>And speaking of awkward. The score just didn't work for me. It seemed like Fincher once again teamed up with Reznor and Ross because he uses him on all his films now. The score was good on it's own, but it seemed out of place in this piece to me. It made the whole thing, cinematography included, seemed forced and out of place. <br/><br/>Affleck was okay. The best acting in the film came from the female cop, the twin sister, and of course Rosamund Pike, who played her character to perfection, even if a lot of her dialog was contrived and unnecessary. <br/><br/>Anyway, I am sure a lot of people will disagree, but but that is how I see it."
"kschwiz","5","23","55","3 October 2014"," Overrated, simply boring to a party of two.
","Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but my wife and I both agreed this movie was overrated. Sure, Fincher is a good director, and fans of the book should like the movie. But the story is dull, and the development is dull, and the whole thing from top to bottom is dull. The movie demands you be intrigued because the plot starts interestingly enough, which is kind of a shame considering how it plays out, but the intrigue is still there when the film stops rolling. Not in a good way though.<br/><br/>I will say this movie developed very similarly to Shutter Island. If you liked that one, you should like this movie. They aren't similar in any regard plot-wise, just how they build suspension and kind of mellow out with a pretty predictable twist or two. Everyone is saying this movie has so many plot twists that you don't see coming? OK maybe the world has gotten really dumb, but the plot twists aren't really twists in my opinion, they are more like changes of direction and not disconcerting to a viewer. If I am driving and I come upon a twist in the road it's pretty freaky; if I have to suddenly come to a stop sign and take a right instead of go straight, I don't freak out at all, just say ""well shoot, not what I was expecting, but at least I was prepared."" That may be a terrible analogy, but I hope you get the point. Nothing in this movie should freak a normal human being out.<br/><br/>Overall I'm surprised so many like this movie thus far, so I guess I have to recommend watching it and making up your own mind. But for me and my wife personally, and I love Fincher movies, this was totally a waste of time for both of us.<br/><br/>Only like if you agree with me after you've seen the movie. A difference of opinion makes the world go round."
"ClaytonDavis","7","29","73","26 September 2014"," David Fincher crafts a meticulous picture with a bravura performance from Rosamund Pike...
","Calculated, meticulous, and completely engaging, David Fincher tackles one of his freshest and stylish films of his career with the adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel ""Gone Girl."" Intelligently structured by novelist Flynn herself, the film features a mannered turn by Academy Award winner Ben Affleck while the absolute success of the picture is indebted to the lavish and grandiose performance of Rosamund Pike. <br/><br/>If you are unaware with the story, stay clear of any plot spoilers as possible. Obviously I always respect such a demand. Simply put, the film tells the story of Amy Dunne (Pike) who disappears from her home on the day of her fifth wedding anniversary to her husband Nick (Affleck).<br/><br/>We have to applaud Gillian Flynn, a novelist turned screenwriter that composes a tense and mystery story that evokes a fascinating social commentary on marriage and media. A taut thriller, some of which may find bloated, but still satisfying by credits end. There are quibbles you can find in certain character motivations or certain events that lead to our ultimate resolution but it's not enough to ruin the experience. Flynn launches herself in the Oscar race for Best Adapted Screenplay with a very good chance of standing on stage this year.<br/><br/>On one hand we have Ben Affleck, an actor of considerable talent that showcases another notch in his belt for his career. Reserved and orchestrated with impressive restraint, Affleck keeps the audience on the edge of their seats with audible suspicion. We've seen him in movies like ""Hollywoodland"" and ""Argo,"" both of which brought him great acclaim. This will likely be one that will follow suit.<br/><br/>Unfortunately must admit that I discovered the beautiful Rosamund Pike in Lone Scherfig's ""An Education"" over five years ago. Since then, I've only gotten glimpses in features like ""Made in Dagenham"" and ""Jack Reacher."" A career topping turn as evolved in her newest work as Amy Dunne in ""Gone Girl."" I don't think I've seen a more complex female character that allows an actress to go places we haven't seen in quite some time. Pike is a revelation, an actress that should run the gauntlet for every Best Actress award in 2014. She's passionate, intense, and damn near impenetrable, taking risks that pay off for every single movie moment she's involved in. I absolutely loved her.<br/><br/>You can't deny that meticulous and craftsman genius that is embedded within director David Fincher. ""The Social Network"" and ""Se7en"" have been prime examples of how to tell a well executed story. Stylistically, ""Gone Girl"" offers nothing amazingly new for his repertoire. Director of Photography Jeff Cronenweth uses his same techniques that have made him one of the most exciting cinematographers of today. The real technical highlight is the score of Oscar-winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Balanced, unsettling, and musically tense, the duo develop another stunning score for the year.<br/><br/>The supporting cast all have high points, most notably the spunky Carrie Coon of HBO's ""The Leftovers."" Her quirk and ferocity stand up as an unforgettable highlight. Tyler Perry gives the world a terrific example of life outside ""Madea"" and by God, I want some more. He steals many of his scenes shared with his co-stars. Neil Patrick Harris also delivers in his brief amount of screen time, one that will channel a new generation's Anthony Perkins. Kim Dickens, Casey Wilson, Patrick Fugit, and ESPECIALLY Missi Pyle make their marks accordingly. Don't be surprised to see the Screen Actors Guild cite this for Best Cast Ensemble.<br/><br/>As a vehicle for awards players, the big chances will stand for Screenplay and Best Actress, both of which are win-worthy. In some ways, I feel Fincher has crafted his equivalent to Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" and obviously that worked out for very well for the overdue director. This is something that audiences will eat up, talk about at their water coolers, and probably revisit for years to come. It's hard to imagine how an awards member will see it but it will definitely appeal to many out there.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is an undeniable winner. Haunting, unpredictable, and completely unforgettable, Fincher's film stands tall as one of the best things to be produced this year. Their might be similarities to ""Prisoners,"" maybe even ""Psycho,"" but ""Gone Girl"" has enough going for itself to stand on its own."

","Gone Girl begins posing itself as a basic crime drama taking place in a seemingly grounded world that deals with real life situations. The movie does have the promise throughout its smaller first act before all the answers were revealed, but once it shifts to its next move, the story becomes undeniably ridiculous. People, at first, might find it pretty exasperating as it flies away its realistic sense, but once you notice some sophistication towards its mind-bending twists, you can somehow forget bragging about its absurdity and just stay on how the ride would ever turn out. That is how these types of movies work anyway, though Gone Girl constructed it with genuine surprises thus results as a preposterous, yet a thought-provoking thriller.<br/><br/>Put the ""unbelievable"" complains to the side, you can see the commentaries all over the place. It is not generally about the investigation for the missing wife, it's more of an exploration to the marriage of the couple, observing that sometimes even at the most intimate relationships could not see the true colors of an individual. Much of the characters may have push the limits of their humanity, but it does help giving effect at bringing fear to their actions and behavior. While that point is palpably terrifying, the amusing side of this mystery is where the social satire sparks. The publicity's involvement to the case is obviously poking fun at the ones who only intervenes to seek public attention; the media often exposing, even distorting real life tragedy for the sake of entertainment, while the straight up people out there are still scratching their heads. The film just extends every darkness the story would show.<br/><br/>The story does have its silliness, but David Fincher never lets the central case feel like a joke. There is some strange humor to found in some areas, but most of the time, the direction convinces you that wherever this mystery is going, it is something real serious and possibly twisted that people would still keep thinking about it at the post viewing. The score of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross also helps living up to its uneasy tone. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are both pretty good in their roles.Affleck may not be everyone's favorite actor, but here he makes the audience really root for his character, while Pike clearly gives herself a spellbinding turn. The rest of the cast remains quite entertaining.<br/><br/>Gone Girl comes from simplicity to pure insanity, and that usually troubles to crime/mystery films, but this is one of those exceptions. It doesn't bother negating its enigmatic turns, instead it brings depth to it. Other than the fact that it has thematic connections to social naivety and mass media, the benefit mostly goes to its direction which manifests a colder atmosphere and an interesting rhythm that makes the audience tag along throughout, even when the story takes things too far. That is basically describing the usual style of David Fincher, and that is also the same way of saying the director's achievement triumphs yet again."

From then on it became a plane crash, boat sinking and a train crash all at the same time. If that is how the book was written then the author needs to quit his day job. There are so many threads left undone or unanswered for it is hard for me to remember them all. If she had been struck by the 'old' boyfriend then where was her head injury. It would have had to be one hell of a gash to have produced the amount of blood she staged. If was attacked and abducted then why was the glass table overturned and not the pictures. How did she withdraw so much money and have no trace of it in the bank records. What happened to the video records from the boat house! If she planned on killing him why did she stage the rape. Why did the hospital send her home still covered in blood. Who the hell is the real father of the baby? I am not familiar with any clinic that will take your walk in urine for a pregnancy test.

Some of the really great classics: Richard II, Macbeth and others that due to the complexity of character, action and language have provided audiences with psychological insight and the pure artistry of English in full flow.<br/><br/>Then there is Gone Girl, of similar length and yet; it's capacity overwhelms its creators, it's ambitions are smug and most certainly self-satisfied. It is a long arduous, monotonous endurance of platitudes which are flecked with motifs which shimmer on the vapidness of contemporary life, yet are themselves of such shiny magazine superficiality they condemn the authors of the same mediocrity.<br/><br/>It is over an hour before really anything of substance occurs; it breaches the protocols of the genre and taxes the humor of the viewer who are left with the wooden-faced Affleck to carry the story, occasionally interspersed with the off-screen wife.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we are fed clichés and stereotypes on modern media, modern marriage, the asymmetry of male and female relationships all delivered with the gusto of the new college student who has just learned of these elements in adult life.<br/><br/>The entire masquerade doggedly plugs on with the stamina of oxen ploughing a field. The characters do not change, the language in the script is common and forgettable, the pacing is akin to a stopped clock and when the final credits roll, it is almost impossible not to give up praise that time is still moving and that the potential for real life may still be possible.<br/><br/>The easiest way to make this work is cut at least fifty minutes and it becomes, what is really is: not a very original domestic thriller and not very memorable. Making it long does not make it excellent, not when the basic material is so thin."

The FBI would not get involved in a case like this, the prosecution for the real murder would have been in another jurisdiction, and even if it were not, the last thing a burned prosecutor would do is let go of someone who murdered someone and tried to frame someone else.

But when I look back at his work, there is really only Fight Club, Seven and The Game, which did anything really special (for me), I liked Benjamin Button and I liked Zodiac, but nothing great. For me Fincher has to get back to what he did great at one point instead of resting on his laurels. For me this is a money making film and not great cinema that I would expect from him.

","Currently rated 8.0 on IMDb... are you kidding me? <br/><br/>This film is not THE worst I've seen, but, in all honestly, 8.0 is far, far too high a rating for what I thought was one of the lamest movies I've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>If you're going to make a movie that doesn't have a protagonist... if you just want to tell a story... at least make sure it's a good story and believable to some degree. The events in this movie are so unrealistic and played-up - things like that would NEVER happen in real life.<br/><br/>There are lots and lots of really obvious plot-holes - not a good thing in a move that's already near-unwatchable.<br/><br/>Some events in the movie are shockingly unrealistic. For example, all she does for disguise is dye her hair a slightly darker colour. Then she (with her new identity) sits with her new-found friends watching (and discussing) her own story on TV, and nobody seems to notice that the woman on TV is the same one sitting next to them, with slightly darker hair. Oh, puh-lease. If this isn't an insult to human intelligence, then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Basically, there are plenty of ""what-the-fcuk"" moments; it makes you wonder whether the people involved in the project were intending this movie for the mentally handicapped. Indeed, one HAS to be a bit ""slow"" in order to enjoy this poorly-written plot. If you're into analyzing movies, you will find this one downright insulting, I'm sure.<br/><br/>This movie can be criticized for hours - there's too much that's wrong with it, but I think I've wasted enough time watching, and then reviewing, this train-wreck of a movie, so I'll be moving on now."

Rosamund Pyke looks her normal gorgeous self when we see her. About half way through I suddenly realised, ""I'm only half way through! - This had better get better!"" Despite a few twists and turns I was constantly thinking there are so many holes in the plot that you could make up your own ending. In fact, that's what it felt like at the end. The director couldn't decide on the best ending and just pulled an idea out the hat.<br/><br/>At the end, I looked at my wife and we both commented that we couldn't understand how on earth this is rated at 8.4.

The only believable representation of reality was the whorishness of the mass media. Thrown into all this fantasy are generous portions of gratuitous sex and violence, all part of relentless manipulation of the audience.

"arminhage","4","11","24","26 October 2014"," Overrated with obvious holes in plot and very unsatisfying ending
","Too much was said about this movie so let's get to the point. 1. Granted that Amy was a troubled woman (we discover that when we find out how she framed her ex lover as being a rapist) but there was never a profound problem in her current marriage to summon such intense action. Don't forget that she officially and supposedly forever killed herself as Amy before she had to change the plan and she was not nobody but a successful writer from a rich family so if she was Amy the maid who wanted to kill Amy the maid after running away with some serious cash to re-invent herself as lats say Jane, I would buy the story. But Amy the successful writer from a rich family killing her name for a husband way inferior to her in social class, physically torturing herself, hitting herself on the cheek with hammer and to live in a cabin swarmed with bedbugs... that's just ridiculous! Nick appeared to be a good husband, actually he never wasted her wife's money as she claimed. All he did was having an affair which looked pretty normal given the state of their marriage. <br/><br/>2. VIDEO CAMERAS! We saw some scenes that she tried to play victim in front of the cameras but to make the scheme work, she had to access the records, modify them and etc, pretty much something like the ""Rising Sun"" movie which was obviously out of the scope of her ability in this movie. The movie could work beautiful without those stupid and ridiculously plotted video cameras.<br/><br/>3. Amy was recorded in the casino, a redneck couple just robbed her, a costumer in casino almost recognized her... so many traces left behind could easily lead to and expose her.<br/><br/>4. The ending were the worst. My guess is that in original script, she was supposed to get caught but David Fincher decided to give it an intellectual ending and as a result, the script was hastily edited and of course some holes in the plot left behind. Probably he wished to aim for Oscars with this move which I hope he never wins ans he greatly ruined a could be great movie."

Where was Amy Dunne being held before the time of the security tapes at the lake house of Desi Collins and wouldn't this time gap arouse the slightest suspicion? And why would the Secret Service agents Tanner Bolt employed not even think to follow Desi Collins when Nick Dunne already has approached him suspecting involvement? Then, how about the press? Yes we all hate them but you notice how most journalists refer to a person a suspect, or a person of interest. If you think this is an accident, they have lawyers too and owners with big pockets that would rather not lose slander suits. So we have a movie weighted toward an ending, deliberately bleak, clearly unjust and for what? For entertainment?

I can not say that David Flincher has not done an incredible job as always and of course hats off to the actors and actresses, they were all amazing. But the reviews actually took my expectations sky high, that it practically fell from heaven right to hell when I walked in to the theater. I must say, it started off interesting, but probably 10 minutes in to the movie, I could conclude pretty much the rest of the story, and then it became dull. Maybe it is unpredictable to a lot of people, but those who watch a lot of horror and thrillers and might I say have a sick mind, it is very much predictable.

"camilovelandiamusic","2","20","51","15 October 2014"," What an unbelievable disappointment
","***SPOILER ALERT*** I'm a big IMDb guy, and I try to religiously watch anything that's over an 8.0 rating. When I saw this movie had higher ratings than ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", which I enjoyed, I didn't hesitate to go see it. <br/><br/>I will say that the movie has an interesting plot, it really draws you in, and the acting and the cast are great. This movie builds SO much tension and caused so many emotions, that I could not wait to see the how it would all resolve....<br/><br/>There's one huge problem, and this is where it enters the realm of ""a matter of taste"". I'm very picky with open endings, but to me, a good open ending still gives some kind of closure to the film. In all the movies with open endings that I consider good, there's always a big event at the end that leads to the open ending and you are left to interpret if the following untold event is either A or B. <br/><br/>For example, in ""Inception"", the open ending leaves you wondering whether: A. It's a dream, B. It's not a dream. In ""Prisoners"" with Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, the open ending leaves it to your interpretation whether the father is found or not at the very end.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about ""Gone Girl"" movie. I believe writers have to be very careful with what they write and how it may be absorbed by the viewer/reader. In my opinion, the ending to ""Gone Girl"" was just plain disrespectful to the audience. It's a big F YOU. Why? ?<br/><br/>The movie is over two hours, and it goes into the plot almost immediately, meaning almost the entire movie you're concerned for the wife until you figure out what she's doing, then you begin to really hate her. Then when she comes home, you REALLY hate her. And at this point, I was still really into the movie, I thought to myself ""Wow.. this is all building to be have insane resolution""... and when you least expect it... Ending credits.<br/><br/>REALLY?!?!?!<br/><br/>They feed you absolutely no juice to assume what will happen next, except that maybe they will continue to live as they did towards the end... which is completely a blasphemous ending to such a great storyline.<br/><br/>Bottom line, the first 3/4's of the movie, I couldn't wait to recommend this movie to all my friends... after the ending, I wish I wouldn't have seen a single minute of this movie. It wasn't even about the money I paid to see it, but it just made me angry that a writer can play with your emotions like that and then just end the movie without any leads to what may have happened.... Just a big F U to me, that's how I took it."
"pona","5","10","22","10 October 2014"," Loved the book; the movie, not so much...
","I loved, loved Gone Girl and have enjoyed all of Flynn's works. She has an insight into the human condition that is so accurate and disturbing which makes her writing addictive. Sadly, Flynn's screenplay- adaptation of her own novel falls flat. Although she retained the plot and most of the detail the crafty manipulation of the novel was gone. <br/><br/>Amy was supposed to be this fascinating multi-faceted enigma of a person that you were horrified to find yourself rooting for. In the movie she's this generation's Glenn Close or Rebecca DeMornay, another crazy woman scorned set upon murder.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike was OK as ""evil"" Amy, if not a bit robotic, but her narration and performance as innocent Amy was all wrong. From the instant the first diary flashback started, you just knew she was full of it. Her Cool Girl rant, one of the book's highlights, is supposed to hit hard because up until that point Amy was a Cool Girl, not this evil, calculating creature. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck was fine as a smarmy Nick, but there was too much of him. He's not charismatic enough to carry a whole film. It should have been a story about the messed up things that Nick and Amy did to each other, a warped game of one upman-ship, not the story of ""The Bad Thing That Amy Did To Nick.""<br/><br/>Except for Nail Patrick Harris, I think the supporting cast was solid. He just didn't make Desi as fearsome as he should have been. I also expected more from Fincher's direction, who helmed the ingenious ""Fight Club."" This was little better than a Lifetime movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I was disappointed by the Gone Girl. Cliché as it is, but the book was so much better."

","One thing I can count on from David Fincher - he's consistent. Consistently great - as a director. From Fight Club to Social Network, no one can quite mix social commentary with a streak of dark humor quite like Fincher. And somehow, he can keep you on the edge of your seat - even if you know the outcome. With Gone Girl, he has done it again, and, if you haven't read the book by Gillian Flynn, do yourself a favor and don't spoil this one - because it's worth it to go into it with as little knowledge as possible. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible in this review.<br/><br/>We start off with Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) heading out for the day to hang out at The Bar (yes - wickedly original name) that he owns with his sister, Margo (Carrie Coon). It seems like today, the fifth anniversary to his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) he would rather forget. Seems things are a bit rocky at the Dunne household and even since moving from New York to Missouri to care for his (now-deceased) ailing mother, the relationship has soured a bit from the heady, happy days when they were both employed and hadn't fallen into such a rut.<br/><br/>Things go from bad to worse when Nick returns home to find his door open, Amy gone and a broken table. Enter Detective Rhonda Boney (Amy Dickens) a by-the-books cop who wastes no time in ascertaining the situation. Nick is fully cooperative, even as things start to shine a light on him. Soon enough he is hounded by the media non-stop, finds Amy's parents (David Clennon and Lisa Banes) turning against him - along with public sentiment, as secrets are uncovered and he learns some disturbing information about his wife's past. Needless to say, there is a much deeper plot afoot - one long in the making that will have lasting implications on the lives of the people involved.<br/><br/>Gone Girl isn't just about the characters, even though they are greet. Affleck stated that he studied many real life crime cases to play the role of Nick Dunne - especially Scott Peterson - and he nails the part. And Pike is even better as Amy - just when you think you know her character, the film throws in a completely new angle and, needless to say, it gets better with every twist. But the supporting characters are great - even Tyler Perry, a man I thought would forever be ingrained in my mind as ""that dude who dresses up to play Madea"" is good in his role as a hotshot lawyer known for defending husbands in trouble. Look for Missi Pyle as dead ringer for witch hunt queen Nancy Grace as well as Sela Ward as a top network interviewer (ala Diane Sawyer).<br/><br/>The media plays just a big a role in this film as the characters - and that is where Fincher takes his social commentary. I know - I watch CNN every morning and if there is one thing the media is great at - is jumping the gun. How many times has a person gone from victim to villain or vice versa? Remember how we treated the ""Olympic bomber"" Richard Jewell? If not - his case is a prime example of how quickly a life can be ruined by media speculation. The media here is always present - TVs are always on in the background - a smile and a selfie become damning evidence and talking heads and online comments spiral out of control. It is fascination and disquieting just how effective the film is at portraying the media.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the story is riveting, although you are sure to see some of the twists in advance, watching how it plays out is a great way to spend the time. The ending may be a bit abrupt, but essentially if gives you an open-ended way to end the story - in your mind, and it can play out in so many different ways. The movie is long, but it moves at a brisk pace. There isn't much outright humor (aside from a few well-placed lines) but the underlying tone is there, dark as it might be.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is one of the better movies of the year, and once again I have Fincher to thank."

","Gone Girl [2014] is a drama/mystery/thriller (directed by David Fincher) which follows Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) as the disappearance of his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) creates massive national media coverage to decipher whether he's guilty or innocent. <br/><br/>No spoilers. The movie trailer gives nothing away. So rest assured the mystery stays intact as you press play. As the story unfolds and more details are revealed concerning their tumultuous relationship, the more you'll switch from one side to the other. It's in the subtleties at first, then the big reveals. We are first the news audience, knowing only what is shown on the surface. Fincher slowly feeds us behind the scenes knowledge and creates an uncomfortably close for comfort intimacy with the characters. <br/><br/>Great casting. Rosamund Pike gives a highly captivating and haunting performance as the missing wife, Amy Dunne. A performance so solid it has earned her a Golden Globe nomination. Let's hope she wins it, because it would be richly deserved. Tyler Perry (yes, that very one) appears in a minor but visibly valuable role, as Tanner Bolt (Nick Dunne's attorney). Perry provides the comedy relief in what is a tense and disturbing film. Neil Patrick Harris plays Desi Collings, an old boyfriend of Amy, whom is painstakingly pivotal to the morbid goings-on in Gone Girl. Side note: Desi lives in divinely beautiful house. <br/><br/>Impressive original score. Now to tie in the acting, story, directing, is the wonderfully composed score by Atticus Ross and NIN band member Trent Reznor. It is the perfect accompaniment to the morbidly mysterious tale. <br/><br/>It's a heavy watch. No doubt a thick and foreboding cloud of deep thought will linger above your head after the film ends. It stays with you awhile. A shocking, intriguing, morbidly engrossing ride for the whole one hundred and forty nine minutes."

They started by making you think that the husband had something to do with the wife's disappearance, then it was revealed that the wife framed her husband. They should have just finished the story by having him get revenge on her, but instead, they get some ex- lover involved to take the blame for everything and get killed too. The husband and wife live happily ever after at the end of the movie! How could he even live in the same house with such an evil manipulative psychotic murdering bitch?? How stupid are the police and detectives in this movie? I could go on and on, but you can read the other bad reviews to see how ridiculous the plot and entire movie actually is.

","Gone Girl took 10 minutes to make me forget I was in a theatre. The characters are personalities oozing with depth, and the film reveals all of their details as it progresses, adding more and new significance to the overall story and to the events that happen without making them look unrealistic. While it is certainly a thriller that shows bombastic acts (for a non-action-oriented film) it never demands the audience to believe something they would normally not without giving enough background and logic to the events that ensue. The cinematography works perfectly with Reznor's and Ross's soundtrack. An Ambient score that resembles Nine Inch Nails' Ghosts I–IV. They're gloomy, elegant, and jump between relaxing and disturbing without giving up their dark nature. There was not a single weak performance, everyone is genuine and credible with constantly development that always made me feel interested in these characters. My only complaints may be that Pike's voice sounded a bit over the top in a particular scene in a restaurant. She is speaking with a distinctive tone, then Affleck comes in and she says ""it's you."" With the exact same tone that didn't feel natural. Another thing is that there's another scene that exposes one main plot point to the viewer, and while it was necessary to be explained, the way it was edited seemed like it was trying too hard to impress me. Other than that this is a gripping, beautiful, thoughtful and fascinating film from David Fincher."

"FilmMuscle","10","12","28","5 October 2014"," A Haunting Look At Marriage and Media Culture
","It's a scary world out there. We see it through three-second snippets of a serene neighborhood in Missouri as each credit quickly fades with every shot. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) calmly exits his house and takes a trip to the bar he co-owns. After a dispirited talk with his twin sister, Margo (Carrie Coon), revealing how frankly exhausted he is from his wife's personality, Nick returns home to find his wife missing and the glass coffee table shattered. In between the present scenes when we see Nick publicly transform from a sympathized husband in the media to an abhorred one—suspected of cold murder—the story introduces us to Amy (Rosamund Pike). <br/><br/>Pike's Amy Dunne immediately has our support and understanding—a wife of unimaginable, elegant beauty. She's intelligent and classy, carrying a fond taste for the sophisticated—the arts. What makes her even more mesmerizing is the fact that these types of rich female characters are a saddening rarity. Oftentimes, actresses are reserved for the tired role of a ditsy romantic interest that has absolutely no self-purpose or motivation. Right from the start, Amy makes us fall in love with her; the amount of dignity, (admittedly) inner arrogance, and wit she possesses is particularly refreshing. She narrates her sentiments through a daily diary, tracing her marriage's evolution from the ""lovey-dovey"" stage to the inevitable phase of irritation five years later.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the marriage has taken a turn for the worst. Goosebumps start to form on my arms as I clutch the jacket on my lap harder. Nick begins to display a frightening temper as Amy becomes concerned with their future (and eventually her life) in this loveless and fading marriage that has taken form. Everything about her—her delicate skin, the heartbreaking look in her eyes, her perpetual state of fear—reveals Amy's true vulnerability, which makes me that much more concerned for her as well. What have you done, Nick? The media circus is outside his house every day of the week—incessantly flashing cameras and begging for interviews. The hot media frenzy has found a new victim in this tragic couple. A haunting score in its creepy mellowness— occasional rhythmically blood-pumping with the resounding bass, and sometimes purely heartrending—from frequent David Fincher collaborators, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, adds that final stamp to Fincher's staple atmosphere-setting.<br/><br/>Affleck gives a surprisingly impressive performance (as well as unsurprising since Fincher always gets the absolute best out of his actors whether or not the audience is skeptical about them going in— Jesse Eisenberg and Rooney Mara are perfect examples). He has a manner of innocence and ostensible normality about him (unlike the typical characteristics of a psychopath, he's not meticulous or perfectly composed) but yet keeps us doubting as he continually makes the wrong decisions.<br/><br/>Moreover, the way this film is edited amazes me—it enthralls you and somehow creates a slow-burn of a thriller with terrific pacing. The juxtaposition between the characters' current activities as a sequence anxiously unravels is astonishing and consequently creates sheer suspense and many gasps from the audience. The two-and-a-half-hour runtime is essential in regards to the exceptional character development/characterization, which ceaselessly continues to contradict our impressions of and sympathies for its characters.<br/><br/>Not only does Fincher's latest masterpiece paint a bleak portrait of marriage—the constant denial of your relationship's issues, the expectations of standard marriage and the notion of living up to that— but also showcases the disheartening, malign, and corrupt nature of our media culture. Every individual can live or die based on public perception—one's portrayal on the usually sensationalized, exaggerated outlet that composes the news stations and interview sessions. Unfortunately, society impatiently jumps to conclusions, logically flawed/irrational as they are, expecting the black-and-white dramatics of a fictional narrative.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is unrelentingly complex when it comes down to its meaty characters, topical dark subject matter, and overall plot. Its utter brilliance is also proved by the fact that it will undoubtedly stir lengthy conversations. Following the unforgettably terrifying and audacious climax—especially the very final shot—I stay in my seat, not moving an inch, as the credits roll. The packed theater is also unusually still and silent for those brief seconds. There have been few times when I was this eager to have a full spoiler discussion—when I had this much of a craving to go in for a second viewing."

As if someone had strived to synthesize Silence of the Lambs with an old fashioned Hitchcock thriller (Vertigo, anyone?) and the results were unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>Not just a crime thriller, but also a marital drama, something of a horror pic and there's an ongoing (ultimately repetitive, and annoying) parallel story about local newsmongers framing events, putting sensationalist spin on the disappearance/unsolved crime and of course all kinds of assumptions about gender roles and marital abuse. About 60 percent of screen-time is dedicated to stock procedural scenes of police and journalist types mulling through clues, interview accounts, photos and literally bags of trash to get details on missing kids author Amy Dunne.<br/><br/>This film is TRASHY - every other scene is packed with sex, foul language and gratuitous crime drama details, somehow the whole affair seems palatable due to the mature, nuanced dialogue and the ever present 'realism' via hand held shots, underexposed color and suburban drabness.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the film is dedicated to a realist aesthetic, but ultimately, the movie just doesn't know how to end itself - I won't spoil any details, but clearly Fincher and co. thought Gone Girl's antagonist was just too interesting for justice, which is what the audience actually wants. <br/><br/>Basically I don't recommend this film as essential viewing. It goes for two and half hours, and after sitting through extensive plot twists and character reveals concludes in an incomprehensible ending, leaving you wondering how you ever bought into the films absurd premise and muddy plot motivations. Gone Girl is a character driven movie with an ending that sucks."

","I'm one of the people who read the book. But I read the book after the first trailer for this movie came out. So as I was reading, I literally imagined Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike and other actors from the movie in my mind. Upon finding out that David Fincher was the director behind this adaptation, I was sure the movie was in good hands. I'm not going to review the book, but I have to say it was incredible. I know that movie adaptations deviate from the book, but as I watched the movie begin, with that distinct ominous Fincher feel, I knew this would do more than the book justice.<br/><br/>-Plot- Nick Dunne is a writer who lost his job, as is his wife Amy Dunne. With Amy's money, Nick opens a bar in his home town alongside his twin sister Margo. Things seem to be going well for the trio, until one day Amy has mysteriously gone missing. There is a mess in the living room that the cops conclude was made to make it all look like a fake altercation had occurred. Among other things, Nick Dunne doesn't seem to look too concerned for his missing wife. There is also a diary left by Amy that states her fear of her husband leading up to her disappearance. All fingers point to Nick. Nick however claims his innocence while he solves the treasure hunt from his missing wife left behind for him on their anniversary. He learns of people from Amys past who have a say in the matter as well. Time begins running out. Not everything is what it seems. Did Nick kill his wife? <br/><br/>First off, let me say that David Fincher and the gang have really captured the tone of the book perfectly. The cinematographer did an amazing job with the look of the film. Each camera angle looks like a modern piece of art depicting the world in its true light. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is even better than their score for The Social Network in my opinion. It all feels eerie and atmospheric. Perfect for the story and setting. The screenplay was done by the author herself, which means that no fans of the book should complain when she basically wrote the film too! If I had read the book before the movie cast was revealed, I probably wouldn't agree with the choice of Ben Affleck as the lead. But I'm glad that wasn't the case. Ben really dives deep into this role. He was just how I pictured Nick being while reading. A big man, with a somewhat blank face and jerk smile and cleft chin. There is a scene from the book that was perfectly adapted in which Nick is approached by a woman who sneaks a selfie of herself with him smiling politely, but he quickly realized what the photo would do to his image and he tries to persuade her to delete it. It was a great simple scene among many that showcased Bens good acting for the part. Rosamund Pike also played Amy well. Her ghastly tone when narrating her diary, her innocent tone when talking to anyone in the movie, her hidden evil tone toward the end, all done well. The supporting cast was great as well, but I'll admit that the actor who plays Gilpin was not suited for the role as much as the rest of the characters and actors. The biggest acting surprise in the movie is Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt, Nicks lawyer. He was so serious and believable. I almost forgot I was watching the same man who made all those horrible Madia movies. Neil Patrick Harris as Desi Collings, the mysterious and creepy ex boyfriend of Amy, was also a good serious turn for the actor. Though I knew the ending and exactly what was going to happen, I still felt like I didn't know what was next in each scene. That's how good this movie was made. There are certain scenes that still lurk in my mind. The movie is disturbing in a clever way just as it should be. It is a great movie about the current sign of the times. A movie that perfectly showcases the countries obsession with missing cases. How the country believes almost anything a newscast will say. How the country gets distracted with murder trials too easily and almost always ignores facts. This is a movie about modern marriage as well. Don't forget how the movie parodies the horrible Nancy Grace, which I loved! The twist ending is in tact and the movie really deserves it's R rating. This was one of the best suspense movies of the decade. I'm not going to tell you that you must read the book, because this was such a great adaptation. If you aren't a reader, I'm proud to say this movie did the book justice either way. If you do like reading, then I suggest reading the book before or after watching the movie. The movie is a great companion piece! David Fincher has made another modern masterpiece thriller. Expect lots of praise from this, and lots of hate. Most of the hate will come from the people who hate movies that get hyped and praised though. I expect this movie to do well! I can't wait for the Blu Ray!"

","My wife and I managed to endure about half of this utter drivel before turning it off. If what Affleck does is called acting then my pet hamster is Einstein. I logged on here out of curiosity to see how the movie ended and am now thankful that I had the good sense to turn this tripe off early. The detective strolling into Affleck's house with one hand gloved and a cup of coffee in the other whilst chatting to Affleck in what should be a sealed off crime scene was laughable. She and Affleck stroll around the crime scene house chatting away about random nonsense and occasionally the detective whacks a crime sticker on something that might be evidence that she happens to see. How anybody in this dreck got nominated for an Oscar is a mystery?...but perhaps not given the utter nonsense coming out of Hollywood over the last few years. One of the worst ever. I'd pay good money not to see it."

"parleon-thedon","10","6","12","21 January 2015"," Gone Girl - Review
","Gone Girl is a very dark mystery film. It has all of the elements of a who done it story. However, this film has a twist. The film has a big twist; when the twist happens the film switches gears. The film is about two and a half hours long, but that doesn't matter. When I watch the film, I feel like time fly's, and I'm left wanting more... that's a good thing. The film is extremely fast paced so you're going to have to keep up. I truly believe that this film deserves at least three viewings for someone to really enjoy it. If you watch this movie again and again, then you'll pick up on things that you didn't know were there. The score to this amazing film is eerie and also haunting. I feel like the music really blends in well with the story and scenes being played out on screen. The performances in this film are a mixed bag. I feel like Ben Affleck does his job, but he doesn't give a Oscar worthy performance. I Also feel that all of the other actors in the film only did their jobs. However, Rosamund Pike knocks it out of the park. I'm glad Rosamund is nominated for a Academy Award. In my personal opinion, Rosamund Pike out acts everyone in this movie. This is Rosamund Pike's movie. Rosamund is a rising star. I hope she continues to get roles as juicy as her role in Gone Girl. The film is full of twist and turns and I don't think you're ever going to guess what happens next. This isn't your typical who done it movie. This isn't your typical mystery thriller. In my personal opinion... this is director David Fincher's best work since Seven. If you really want to be entertained, if you really want to be on the edge of your seat, and if you really want to watch a film that will shock you, then I highly recommend Gone Girl for anyone who likes to be surprised."

","um not gonna talk pretty much about the movie so to cut it short i'll list briefly the reasons why i hated this movie and why i think it's way overrated:<br/><br/>1-the acting was awful except for rosamund pike,the acting was horrible to the extent that i thought that either they intentionally act so weird and awful because of something i'll figure out later in the movie or they actually acting awful<br/><br/>2-the movie was so boring that i kinda wanted to stop watching it halfway through<br/><br/>3-the ending was horrible how he eventually decided to let go and live with her after all what she's done to him and how is he gonna feel secured and safe on his life and the life of his upcoming child with this psychopath,in addition to this he and the police could so easily investigate the whole thing and find out easily that she's a criminal cuz there are many clues on that like what he said to the police officer how did she managed to get a hold of a box cutter if he had her tied up the whole time!?..they could easily prove that she's guilty and easily figure out about whether she's lying or not and where has she gone at this period but instead of this logical ending he decided to move on and live his life with her enduring the risk he will face the rest of his life without trying to prove that she's a criminal and take a custody anyways i guess i said i don't wanna talk that much about the movie but it turns out that i couldn't stand not to say how awful this movie was."
"machielg","5","6","12","31 October 2014"," Lacking credibility
","I found it hard to figure out the message of this movie. There is a plot twist at some point in the movie but it wasn't really the shock that it should have been. More an 'ah okay, so that's what happened' experience. The contrast between the real Nick and the evil Nick portrayed by his wife is not very stark and often it's unclear which Nick you've been looking at.<br/><br/>The main issue is the motivation of Amy. Her parents were quite distant and demanding but also not the monsters that you would assume produce such a screwed up daughter. They were quite credible in their sadness when Amy went missing. This makes Amy's behavior feel quite random. Her act of killing an ex boyfriend seemed unnecessary and even the characters in the movie didn't believe her story.<br/><br/>The movie did manage to convey a 'what lies beneath' feeling. If you want to feel bad about life and marriage you need to watch this movie. If you want a gripping story, read the book."

I firmly believe Gone Girl inspired the likes of Girl on the Train to be made, another great book in its own right, but Gone Girl showed that a mystery could be made into a movie that would pack out cinemas.<br/><br/>I read the book and loved it, I loved the film too, I thought the characterisations were superb, so my words are based purely on the film.<br/><br/>You'd think they're the couple that had everything, she's successful, beautiful, wealthy, charismatic, the perfect wife. He's handsome, funny, with a jaw line you'd kill for, but not all is at it seems.<br/><br/>The plot is awesome, the misdirection is excellent, an hour in, and you realise that what you thought was happening isn't necessarily so.<br/><br/>Terrific, great music, well acted, humorous, it's a cracker. 9/10"
"Gin-ster","7","4","7","23 February 2015"," Well done and all that but highly unsatisfying
","This movie was very well done in terms of acting by all parties concerned, and the story was very creative - it was a ""non-Hollywoodish"" film in that the characters are not likable, and SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER - it doesn't resolve in a way that you can say ""justice is served"" so it is the antithesis of a Hollywood movie (or TV show). I kept making a mental comparison to Criminal Minds in which you can count on easy resolutions, a clear path from A to Z (or A to B more likely), and the bad guys getting caught. That type of crime story may be fun to fill 42 minutes with, but one can easily recognize how empty it is.<br/><br/>But in Gone Girl, the opposite was true; it was complicated, it was hard to figure out what would happen next, it was full of surprises, the acting was not one-dimensional, and to many people's annoyance (including mine), justice was not only served; in fact, injustice was ""heartily rewarded."" My husband and I talked a lot about the movie afterward trying to pinpoint why we both disliked it. The main thing, I think, was that after investing 2 and a half hours we both went away with a ""sour taste."" That is largely because of the ending - SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER - which not only didn't resolve, which I can appreciate, but which did not make sense in the larger context of the film. Long story short (SPOILER) when Affleck's character decided to live with his returned wife after she had shown herself to be a dangerous psychopath who had, earlier, specifically tried to destroy his life, I could not understand why he decided to make a go of it anyway. He hadn't shown himself to be madly in love with her, so that didn't seem to be a motive; and the threat she hurled (he'd be publicly reviled if he left her) was much lesser of a threat than being around a creator of diabolical plots who he knew had destroyed several others and tried to destroy him as well. Having that having over one's head would seem intolerable.<br/><br/>So, I simply could not understand how that fit and it was a disappointment after enduring so much time spent wondering how things would go for these generally unlikable individuals caught up in an admittedly intriguing story.<br/><br/>I give the film a lot of credit for the creativity of the writers and acting skill of the participants, but in the end had to admit it was a largely unenjoyable experience."

","I'm surprised at the viewer reviews of this movie. Every review I've seen for pages has been either a rating of 1 or a rating of 10 and I'm amazed that what I considered a pretty mundane film is evoking such impassioned opinions. The storyline of a wife framing her husband for her murder is a tale that has been told many times before (and often told much better, imo). The plot was far-fetched with plenty of holes, as many reviewers have pointed out however, although I wasn't ""on the edge of my seat"", I was reasonably entertained. The antagonist was definitely despicable and I was rooting for Ben Affleck's flawed, yet good, guy and his twin sister. All-in-all, I would sum it up as unremarkable - worth watching on video on a rainy night when you just want to enjoy it for what it is without thinking too hard. If this movie deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 (or for that matter 10 out of 10) what do we have left for the truly awful (or truly masterful) movies?"
"Catharina_Sweden","2","4","7","14 February 2015"," Substanceless
","I do not understand the hype with this movie. I thought it was quite interesting as long as one did not know what had happened to the missing wife: that is about to half the movie. But after that it was only long, boring and muddled, and the ending was just odd. Not at all psychologically believable. <br/><br/>It had no depth, no message, no substance. This can be okay once in awhile, if you instead get something thrilling: adventure, mystery, romance, horror, atmosphere, some good scares that make you jump, exciting characters, humour, witty dialogue... But this movie had none of that. The only thing that was good was the photo, and the fact that you could see that they had had a lavish budget."
"MimRajabi","6","4","7","9 February 2015"," Amazing Girl
","It's good to see a novel writer makes his own version of screenplay. Gillian Flynn did it well, and David Fincher directed it well. The film is somehow different in a good way. Normally in the mystery movies, the viewer don't get very close and beyond. We saw a murder or missing first, then the process of solving the puzzle and the caught or run of the murderer and c'est tout. But this is not the whole theory of Gone Girl. It's not even its principal idea. It goes beyond a simple missing or murder. It is like the creators want to show you a big house, but at first they pretend it is a big room, not a house. The point is the film starts when we find who really is in charge and what really is going on. The innocence and loveliness change their meaning during the movie but amazing Amy is always amazing, though at the beginning for awakening of our sympathies and at the end for her capabilities and skills in doing what that you specially don't expect from a so crazy stupid happy girl that Amy looks alike.<br/><br/>Gone Girl wants us to look from a different point of view. Maybe a cheater husband is not so bad after all, maybe the FBIs aren't better than local detectives, and at last, maybe when we see two very and perfectly happy couple, we should ask ourselves how happy and perfect two real couple could be. This is the principal idea of this movie and however we saw that in other good old ones, but I think the Flynn/Fincher version is completely worth a try."
"deelicious31","8","4","7","6 February 2015"," Settle down lads, it's just a movie
","I really enjoyed this movie, in a world where there is a never-ending splurge of comic book films, it is nice to something with a bit more bite. I said I had to defend it, it was getting some slack, I have read some of the negative reviews and I feel they are completely missing the point of the story. The ""gaping holes in the plot line"" so many refer to, are people being extremely pedantic. It doesn't matter why these things occurred , or how for that matter, the main protagonist was a psychopath who orchestrated her own murder. You know at the end of the film that the detective KNOWS she is lying about her story but no one is going to look into it anymore. She gets away with it because she is going to have the husbands baby so he is choosing to stay with her. It's fiction! <br/><br/>Let's just answer some of these holes 1. The book, the husband found the book, thought it was incriminating, went away from his house (which was being searched) and tried to burn the diary but was interrupted by the police. She never said the other guy did that. 2. There aren't always witnesses so cars, people leaving, etc., can go unnoticed all the time- what time did your neighbours leave this morning? Haven't a notion! The neighbour was old, maybe he came out a specific time everyday. 3. Who says there no further investigation? The FBI were looking into it, yeah I did wonder about the cameras in the lake house but meh feck it, it's fiction, it's her word against the other guy and he's dead. They could have been in his other house that doesn't have cameras.<br/><br/>The only discrepancy that bothered me was how she went from a definite beer-bellied size 12 to an 8, in a seriously short space of time. It would have been good if they'd delved into the relationship she had with Desi a bit more.<br/><br/>All in all, a good watchable movie."
"prahladagarwal","8","4","7","28 January 2015"," An unfamiliar suspense thriller!
","The argument over the best suspense thriller director in recent times ends with David Fincher. After successfully directing The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo, Fincher presents another unpredictable thriller, Gone Girl (also adapted from a book with the same name). Gone Girl starts with a cozy pace gradually getting the audience interested with a story based on disappearance of Amy (inspiration to Amazing Amy series). Amy's husband falls into the suspect list as their bad marriage relationship emerges. As the movie progress the captivated audience is made to believe in something absolutely defying added with an even more dubious ending. Fincher intermixes tense relationship with violence to create a spectacular mystery. The show stealer performance by Rosamund Pike is notable and justifies her character beautifully.

But do have the time to clean up the huge blood pool, that supposedly happened when Amy was kidnapped.

","Affleck plays Nick Dunne whose wife goes missing. When treasure hunt-like envelopes with 'clue x' written on it appear, the viewer knows the disappearing was staged. Oddly enough, the movie then continues as like the viewer doesn't know this. It makes no sense.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is Fincher's weakest effort to date. Nothing in the film connects to that which was intended to be displayed. The actors don't fit the characters, much like the synthetic dialog, and way too many scenes lack the proper build-up, feeling like they belonged in a completely different movie. Every character in the film comes across as a one-dimensional product of someone's limited imagination rather than an actual person. Yet the sloppy way the implausible, immature storyline is sold as credible, is surely the movie's biggest flaw. Our hearts go out to the family members of Suspension of Disbelief. May it rest in peace.<br/><br/>The scenario would perhaps fit a Coen brother's movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and where the absurdity can be put to use as a form of comedy. As it stands, the lacking source material just contrasts too much with Fincher's superior directional skills and cinematographic wizardry, not to mention Reznor's outstanding soundtrack.

They favor incredible (literally) twists of plot, innocent people being persecuted by bad people, who in the end turn out to be good, and the good people bad, or vice versa, or whatever. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie. I'm just sorry I paid 10 bucks to see it in a theater. I could have waited a few years and seen it on TV. At 3 am."

","I used to trust IMDb ratings; but after watching this train-wreck of a film that has somehow inexplicably garnered an 8.3 rating (WTF??!!), I am of a mind to not look at them too much anymore because it seems the majority of reviewers are way too easily pleased these days. <br/><br/>Truly, this movie was super bad. I hated the two main characters right from the git-go; the dialogue of their first boy-meets-girl meeting was sickening, and the inane chat between brother and sister in the bar, also at the start of the movie, was just plain smarty-pants irksome. <br/><br/>So within the first 30 minutes I was already impatient with how things were going. And then it just got worse - and worse. But it has such a high rating, I told myself - surely I should hang in there for some improvement. Alas, there was NONE. Improbability abounds and leaves one simply incredulous at the high ratings given by others. In my opinion, this movie blows large. Hated it."
"dmuel","4","5","10","4 March 2015"," shoddy character development
","Let me start by saying the film held my interest for most of the movie. It becomes a mystery we want to solve when the protagonist's wife disappears and his own innocence is called into question. At its core the film posed a basic but intriguing mystery as to the disappearance; viewers certainly wanted to know what happened to the Gone Girl, whether or not the husband was involved and, if not, who or what was the culprit in the unfortunate incident. <br/><br/>But the story began to break down, became less plausible, as the nature of the wife was slowly revealed over the second half of the movie. This began to deconstruct the image that the husband's memory poses of her in the first part of the film, making the entire first half of the movie, somehow, false or misconstrued. The protagonist- husband's judgement is called into question, and the viewer him or herself must begin to wonder what had genuinely transpired. This may sound intriguing as a story, but there are certain aspects of the wife's character that should have been visible to the husband, or to anyone else who spent time with her at work or at school, and apparently this never happened. The husband is kind of a slightly-above-average common guy; he has to be above-average to marry a PhD from an ivy- league school. The problem is: ruthless, amoral sociopaths have distinctive features to their personality, particularly those who would manipulate, lie, use sex and even murder to achieve their goals. The distinguishing personality feature of the sociopath, (once called ""psychopath""), is superficiality. In other words there is no true intimacy in the usual sense of the word. Establishing meaningful, long-term relationships is not the forte of the sociopath. (Think of Ray Liotta's character in Goodfellas. Yes, he has a wife and children, but he is unfaithful to her during their entire relationship, until the deluded wife finally comes to her senses). <br/><br/>Most people eventually become aware of this superficiality, of the lying and manipulation that forms the essence of the sociopathic personality. Yet in this film the unsuspecting husband seems oblivious to the dominant personality trait of his wife. In the narrative describing their path to marriage at the start of the movie, the viewer is led to believe the relationship is almost ideal, and satisfying to both husband and wife. The later revelations at first make Ben Affleck's character seem a little dull, or even insensitive, but we have no reason to assume this to be true from the first half of the movie's narrative. The final, compensatory attempt to fill-in this blank comes when it is reveled that the husband had a girlfriend, that he has lost any sense of true intimacy with his wife. But it is a little late and the screen-writer cheats the viewer with this information, all in the effort to make plausible the film's final revelation. <br/><br/>Regardless of the the quasi-references to feminism, or to the struggle in boy-girl relationships for power and control, the film is actually a kind of cheap set-up for a completely unexpected outcome, and leaves the viewer wondering what, if anything, the movie really wanted to say. Or, what, if anything, the film can contribute to better understanding human relations. Not much, I think."

","This is a thriller/mystery movie that has quite a lot of cool twist and turns and shock value. Sure, there are some plot holes and certain areas that just doesn't make much sense.

David Fincher is a great director and I was impressed with his movie ""Zodiac"" which this has a similar vibe going for. Except with more immersive elements and less detective aspects going for it.

","Was looking forward to this film, had read positive reviews, etc. Very disappointed after seeing this film. I admit it's not completely horrible, but definitely not in the same category as other top rated films on this site. This is not an 8 or 9 IMO. Story and acting reaches a comedic level, where at one point during the film I thought I was watching a satirical dark comedy. Definitely a watchable film, but not close to deserving the hype and attention it received. Rosamund Pike was certainly memorable and in my opinion gave a much better performance than Patricia Arquette in Boyhood, but again at times I found the story downright laughable and implausible."

In comparison to his movie ""game"" in which every minute something utterly extraordinary was happening and it kept the audience in extreme suspense, this one was mostly just fillers. Ben Afleck was just himself (he didn't need to do any acting here), while some of the cast were actually not bad so at least something to watch. All in all, not what I expected.

Even the choice of openly gay in non-cinema life Neil Patrick Harris as an obsessed former suitor underscores the satire. Like what you see? According to the filmmakers they're you.<br/><br/>Those who rant and rail about the lapses in logic, nuances of plot, and motivation miss the point.

"alindsay-al","9","3","5","8 September 2015"," A fantastic thriller that always interests you
","I have been really looking forward to seeing gone girl and I finally have and I must say that this is a fantastic film. The premise of this film sees a husband come home one day to find his wife missing and as the evidence piles up the question becomes did nick dunne kill his wife?. Ben affleck is one of the best directors in Hollywood today there is no doubt, but his acting sometimes gets overlooked because he was fantastic in this film. You see this damaged figure who is clearly upset about his situation but it makes you curious about him. He really is a complex character in this film and makes me even more excited to see him as batman. Now every performance in this film is great but this is truly the Rosamund pike show and is the best thing she has ever done. She was superb in this movie because you really got to see her character develop and learn stuff about her. She wasn't your simple damsel she has a real edge about her that I loved. Tyler Perry's plays afflecks lawyer and this is the best thing I've ever seen him in too. He was funny and likable but also a serious character that you liked. Neil Patrick Harris is good in this movie because he plays a really different role in this film then usual. He was nice when he needed to be and creepy when he needed to be. I also liked the character of afflecks sister who added allot to the film as well. I loved the mystery element to the story as you follow the investigation with the characters and the twists and turns that follow it. However, there is a twist about half way through the movie that took away allot of the tension for me and also I thought the ending was a little weak. The script was fantastic with the characters all having real serious moments blended with really good humour to make them feel like real people. The style of the film is great, it looks beautiful and the tone really works. I also loved the use of flashbacks to expand on the story in this film. Overall gone girl is a fantastic movie that if you like these types of films it is a must see."

","English is not my mother tongue, please excuse any errors on my part.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is my favorite movie of this year. It is a good thriller and it is perfect in almost every possible way. I really love the female character played by Rosamund Pike. She really convinced me that she is an evil incarnate. I also love Ben Affleck and Neil Patrick's performance. This movie get me to think about the true meaning of marriage. Do you really think you know about the person who sleep beside you every night? Obviously Nick Dunne of this movie don't know all about his wife like he thinks he does. I believe they really love each other at the first several years of their marriage. But as the sweetness and passion of love wear off, they begin to realize that the person they married is not the person they used to love anymore. Amy think Nick is lazy and Nick find Amy to be mean and boring. But Nick still thinks that they can go on with their life even when there is no love between him and Amy. He is terribly wrong. After Amy finds out that he is having an affair with another woman, she become furiously angry and come up with a evil plan to fake her death and frame Nick for it. She thinks Nick deserves to go to prison for being dishonest to her. Nick, on the other hand has no idea what is waiting for him when he wakes up on their anniversary. when he come home later that day to find his wife missing, he is confused and reports Amy's disappearance to the local authority. The police come and he is very cooperative at first. But when all the evidences point to him, he finally realized that he is being framed. In my own perspective, though Nick is the victim, I think neither of them is innocent. Their irresponsible and selfish behaviors killed Desi Collings and wasted a lot police resources which could be put into good use. The ending was really shocking. I can't believe Nick still decides to live with Amy after everything. A lot of people think it is unrealistic, but I think it is also irony. It's just a movie, it doesn't have to be like real life all the time. I think the movie is just trying to tell us that in real life there are a lot of couples like Nick and Amy who go on with their marriage even when it is just full of unhappiness, dishonesty and resent.<br/><br/>Once again, I apologize for any mistakes in my English."

"bcnewell88","5","3","5","24 July 2015"," A terrible rendition of a good book
","After reading the book, I am sorely disappointed with this movie. It left and changed so many events, which left a very poorly told story.<br/><br/>In the book, we start off with a good view of Nick, we follow him around, so of course know he didn't commit the crime. Later the book leaves the reader confused, thinking, 'maybe he did do it?' We aren't getting the full story here. Instead we are left short transitions, where the movie pretty much tells us we have to feel a certain way. Nick doesn't seem apologetic at all, he smiles weirdly, not because of a possible complex upbringing (maybe he didn't do it), but are we getting the full story (maybe he did do it). In the movie he just looks like a jerk. He obviously did it. This was a result of the many omissions left out for the movie.<br/><br/>Nick's relationship with his dad was an important aspect left completely out. Instead of learning Nick's backstory, his childhood, the way he was raised, the reason why he doesn't want to act a certain way, but where his upbringing still influenced him heavily. We only see in the movie that his dad once got out of the care facility randomly.<br/><br/>We also miss the many things explained in the book that make Amy tick. In the movie we are told she plans things perfectly, but we get an unrealistic situation; a partly burned, diary in the front of an easily opened heater, planted as evidence; this is opposite of the novel, where Amy hides it in the old complex furnace, something Nick would have never been able to do, because he's not very handy. Meanwhile she changed the passcode so that Nick would be recorded as getting into the house at some point. Nick instead starts playing games with Amy. He figures she is framing him eventually, and he starts playing mind games back. He does interviews where he plays to her heartstrings. Things that were well thought out in the book aren't in the movie.<br/><br/>In the novel we learn a lot about Amy at first, eventually to have our entire world shaken more. Amy isn't really Amy. Her diary was a flat out lie, but the Amy that we know really is just one of a series of characters played throughout her lifetime.<br/><br/>But the most disappointing thing left out, was the weird and awkward feeling left at the end of the novel.<br/><br/>The movie undermines the relation that the reader/viewer thought Nick and Amy had at first, how going through the anniversary search made Nick really, truly, fall back in love, and as the reader followed Nick around, we were certain he didn't do it. He fell in love like the old days written in Amy's diary. Meanwhile, despite Amy framing him, hating him for all he's worth, Amy starts to fall back in love again. She falls in love so much, and realizes that with Nick, even though she was playing a part, she was free to be whoever she wanted to be. This was opposite of her situation she found herself in. She finally decides to go back.<br/><br/>Most disappointingly though is the overall theme the reader can get from the book. At the end of the novel the reader felt weird-- Amy knew Nick so well, that she was able to frame him perfectly because he played into her hands. Meanwhile, Nick seems like the only one that was able to play Amy's game. He did it so well, that he actually brought her back. In the end it strangely feels like they are truly meant for each other; in the most crazy way possible. That feeling was majorly lacking at the end of the movie."

","I had heard SO much about this film. It lived up to it's buzz. The movie is clever, funny, suspenseful, erotic, and heartbreaking at times. Rosamund Pike deserves all the reviews that she received for this film. She chews up the scenery. While Ben Affleck is often miscast in films, he is perfect here. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed him in a film. The second and third acts really give him material to sink his teeth in. The movie had so many twists and turns, which I love in movies. Gone Girl is one of the best movies I have seen recently. David Fincher takes you on a ride that will stay with you long after the credits end."
"robsta23","9","3","5","25 June 2015"," Not One of Fincher's BEST, But Still Very Good
","I'm not exactly sure what to think of David Fincher as a director. Two of his movies I thought had poor endings the first time I saw them: Fight Club and The Social Network. On second viewing I loved Fight Club, kind of giving the ending a pass, and liked Social Network the second time I gave it a chance, still unsure of the ending. Now after viewing these movies a number of times I understand the significance of these endings, but do not believe they are great resolutions. For Gone Girl, the ending left me amazed and creeped out how the Rosamund Pike character won, but it doesn't make perfect sense that she got away with murder.<br/><br/>I think some of the writing towards the beginning of the film is a little strange; I'm not sure exactly what it is, but there's something ""off"" about it. This isn't really important in the grand scheme of things, but you know how Amy's life is improved upon through her parents' book series ""Amazing Amy?"" 1) Why would a book series about such a perfect girl be so popular, and 2) What kind of parents do that? As Nick states: a**holes do that.<br/><br/>The dialogue before they REALLY get into the investigation of Amy's disappearance is highly based in riddles, which are included when Nick and Amy flirt in flashback sequences. I mean I get that both of them are writers, but do they really need to be that smart all the time when they talk?<br/><br/>Let me stray from negative criticism to say the sequence which reveals the twist of the movie is among the great sequences which Fincher has directed. In this ""montage"" of sorts, the music is on- point, Amy's internal thoughts revealed in voice-over is haunting as hell, and the editing is simply perfect.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of this film is the performance Rosamund Pike gives by playing Amy - one of the most maniacal psychopaths I have ever seen on film. I am so glad she got an Oscar nomination for this film since she made me hate Amy so much - it's impressive when actors can get you to feel extremity of any emotion towards their character.<br/><br/>Flaws in her not getting caught? There were cameras all over the house of the Neil Patrick Harris character that he said were recording all the time. I get that Amy fakes getting raped for the camera cleverly by biting the man's tongue and pulling down his pants so it looks like he is cleaning up after that as he exits. And I get that she poses for a camera like she was tormented. But what about the rest of the cameras in the house? Are we to believe they are only covering the perimeter of the house? Also, I forget why they can't get Nick to wear a wire around Amy - she prevents it once by talking in the shower, but is she going to be on guard the rest of her life? Highly unlikely.<br/><br/>The fact that they make it very hard to determine whether Nick murdered Amy or not before the huge twist in the film is brilliant, making the end of act 1 and most of act 2 very strong, though the film has a weak opening and a flawed - but extremely creepy - ending. The mystery aspect and Pike's performance make this a very strong film, but it could have been improved if some content was cut and the film was more of a character study."
"arussell23","10","3","5","21 June 2015"," 'Gone Girl' works as a intriguing mystery with outstanding performances from Affleck and Pike
","""You two are the most f*cked up people I've ever met and I deal with f*cked up people for a living.""<br/><br/>While shopping with my mother at Walmart, I decided I wanted to get a few books. So, I looked through the books, and I found the one book that interested me: Gone Girl. So, I got the book and began reading it over a week during school and outside of school. I was enthralled, because it was a mystery story that I never expected. So, shortly after I finished the book, I watched the film. I watched it late at night, and didn't really pay attention to half of it. I recently decided to rewatch it since it was on HBO, and I'm now ready to do a full review of the film. So, let's dive into the mystery everybody was enthralled by.<br/><br/>Gone Girl follows a man who comes home to a crime scene and gets involved headfirst in a investigation involving the disappearance of his wife, and his life soon turns into a roller-coaster ride from hell.<br/><br/>It's kind of hard to talk about this film without spoiling it, because it's such an intense and complicated film, that if you really want to do it justice, you need to talk about the film intensely. I'll try my best.<br/><br/>One of the best things about the film is definitely the acting. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike really carry this movie straight through to the end, and give very realistic performances that do help ground this crazy ass film in reality. I'm very much shocked that Rosamund Pike was robbed of the Oscar, because she truly deserved it, for reasons I won't spoil. Tyler Perry was a riot as Tanner Bolt, the lawyer who reluctantly agrees to represent Affleck's character. He was serious in some scenes, and in others, delivered some of the best lines in the film. Carrie Coon did a good job as Go, Nick Dunne (Affleck)'s twin sister, and she truly portrayed the sister stuck in the middle of this strange case. The only cast member I was unsure about, and still am, is Neil Patrick Harris. It was weird to me that such an openly gay person was portraying a straight man. I mean, no offense to him being gay, I am myself, but it just seemed rather odd and took me out of the movie a bit. Aside from that, his performance was okay.<br/><br/>The music by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor is amazing. I listened to it on it's own and it still held up just as well. My favorite track from the OST is probably Empty Places, and it's reprise, because it just conveys the feelings Nick is feeling during the film. The cinematography in this film... just damn. The scenes all look really cold and empty, which is, I suppose, what you're supposed to feel in a film like this, and it works so well against the dark story unfolding before our eyes.<br/><br/>The screenplay, written by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the novel, is basically the same as the novel, however the ending has been changed a bit. It's not a bad change or anything, in fact, on the first watch-through, I hadn't really noticed the ending had been tampered with. It still works just as well as it did in the novel though. The film editing is great too. The timestamps, like what they did in the novel, work very well on film, and I'm glad. That was one of the things that I was wondering how they would do it, going in.<br/><br/>My problem with the film stems from the third act. The third act is a bit over-the-top and a bit too unbelievable at times. It's still a fantastic finale, and I do really enjoy it, it's just that I could feel a bit of a step down when we reached the ending. Also, and this is kind of a spoiler, so I'll put a spoiler tag on this. When Amy does her monologue and talks about the cool girl, in the novel, we've seen her be a 'cool girl,' but in the film, that is barely shown and doesn't really help sell the image that Amy is trying to put on us.<br/><br/>Overall, however, Gone Girl is an achievement in filmmaking. The acting, cinematography, music, editing, and screenplay are all on point. While the third act does delve into the insane, Amy's 'cool girl' thing isn't explained as well, and Neil Patrick Harris was miscast (in my opinion), the film still holds up remarkably well and is a intriguing thriller that is a great addition to David Fincher's line of works.<br/><br/>9/10 | Grade: A-"

","I'm not overly surprised (as people like to hate on things, especially online) but I do feel for those who rated the movie 1/10. That rating seems a tad extreme as it certainly deserves more than that. I've never really understood why some viewers seem so fixated on realism. It is Hollywood for goodness sakes. Does everything need to make perfect logical sense? Does life itself make logical sense? If you look for reasons to hate on a movie you will surely find it. Without question there are some things in the movie that don't add up but why not focus on all that the movie offers? <br/><br/>I knew nothing about the movie going in and I did not expect Amy to be alive. Throughout the entire movie I was continually surprised at the extent she would go to maintain her... insanity! The horrific scene that anyone who watched the movie will know what I'm referring to haunted me for days afterwards. So too did the idea that a sweet and innocent ""Amazing Amy"" could engage in such callous actions and decisions. What haunts me still is psychopaths like that exist!! Terrifying.<br/><br/>Movie had a long running time but I was captivated from the get go and didn't notice. Not knowing anything about a movie helps in that regard. It was unique, chilling, and certainly entertaining! I hope people don't see the negative reviews and as a result avoid the movie."

","Just watched this film tonight on DVD. I was looking forward to it as I heard so much about it and being up for awards. What are they so excited about? I found it a horrible movie. Falling asleep in first half of it and then could not believe it when she was found alive. From then on I couldn't stand any one in the film save Neil Patrick Harris and female detective.<br/><br/>The female lead was awful and so was her acting. I was hoping she'd get put away where she belonged. Ben Affleck did okay but not his type of film. I felt he wasn't given a decent script and spent most of the film in a sort of trance. His character was so weak when you thought he'd drop the dame fast. But she controls him and I hated that. No one in this film has any redeeming quality at all. But maybe Harris. Big mistake for Ben to do this. No one else in film any good. Sorry. It really made me sick."

"nicolechan916","9","7","17","3 November 2014"," A very intriguing plot with superb acting and editing.
","Even by watching the trailer you get a sense of suspense and this can be felt throughout the whole film. It was brilliantly made and edited. One thing I did not like though, was the numerous black screens. Probably it added to the atmosphere of the film but the cut-offs really bothered me. Also from the trailer, you get a sense of intrigue and want to find out more. Let me warn you, the reviews might tell you that this is not a normal film, but it will far exceed your expectations. This was crazy.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure if I liked it all that much, and might be a bit mind-blown at the moment, but I do have to admit regardless that this film was incredible. The way it managed to manipulate the audience's views and feelings at times was exquisite. Not many films are able to do that. Plus it's such a (I was going to say psychotic which wasn't what I was going for, but somehow fits the film) psychological film. I've always wanted to watch more of those, for example Inception, Now You See Me, which are both favourites of mine. But this was almost too psychological. Too much so that after the film everyone in the cinema was silent. Take it as a good or bad sign but it certainly was an accomplishment.<br/><br/>The acting as well was superb. Ben Affleck played his part really well making the audience wonder if he really did kill his wife or believe that he did not. But the real master in this was Rosamund Pike. It's really surprising how the trailer shows almost nothing of the movie, but that's a good thing. Anyway, Pike was beyond brilliant and I certainly will view her differently now. I would spoil it if I revealed more. Neil Patrick Harris was pretty creepy in this too though I don't know why. His character doesn't seem like such a bad person.<br/><br/>One thing that I do have to say, is that they have a bit too much sex scenes going on. OK, I know I'm not a fan of R-rated stuff (violence, swearing, sexual scenes) but there was too much in this, and I'm not even sure if some were necessary. I admit one or two of them is crucial in telling the story and making more of an impact but do we really need so many?<br/><br/>In conclusion, whenever I think of this film both my hands go up to the sides of my head and extend forward with my fingers spread in a gesture that implies being mind-blown.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","Yes, this is a David Fincher movie; there are no fake emotions He really loves those stories, the stories where he can demonstrate how sick the human being is. I'm dazzled with the scenario, I really am! I always enjoyed what he picks - even though he wasn't the scenarist of course - But he always finds the suitable match for his movies. There is no happy ending, this is for others -- that's what I imagine him to say every time I watch his movies. The plot is breath taking, the movie is about 2h and a half for god's sake, and I didn't feel it at all. I wanted it to continue I believe this is one of the most brilliant screenplays of the year 2014, a lot of things were set carefully, and with an artistic eye, Especially for the main thing in it, the dialog. David Fincher, well! This is not his best movie of course; I felt like he missed some crucial points in some scenes, something was missing as a final touch, some rubbish from the acting staff that he's responsible of, only minor not that big, it was great though as a general work! Didn't affect the story at all. Rosamund Pike played it well, a lot of changes in one movie, and yet! She kept it balanced, I would easily say that she could've got the best actress of the year, she was evil, lover, kind and sweet, and she was Amy the American babe girl. I wouldn't say the same about Ben Affleck, but he definitely was good, what a lot of people don't understand, is that his role made him look like that, his role dictated to be calm and not very emotional and reactive, that's why. The human being has a messed up mind, either you like it or not, this movie is a reminder of that, and the ending was marvelous and explained this point very well, there is no such innocence, it is what it is"

At some points it did, but during the whole movie we were all thinking that this movie was a waste of time.

"RbDeraj","7","4","8","6 February 2015"," ""Basic Instinct"" or ""Fatal Attraction"" For a New Era
","Gone Girl seems to me like a ""Basic Instinct"" or ""Fatal Attraction"" for a new era. It has the same psychopathic woman using situations to keep a man under her thumb of control and also to get away with the evil she has done. It does slightly stray from this in the fact that she is committing these awful acts against her husband. To make things even more complicated, she seems justified in the beginning with her plan because of her husband's infidelity. The real story is revealed throughout so you know what is going on, but you never really know what the outcome could be.<br/><br/>One of the problems I saw was that much of the plot working out the way it did relied on the presence of poor police work and our main character withholding information from the authorities about his wife. It ends with a cliffhanger, them staying together not knowing what they will do to each other. But why? In the end why is he still afraid to expose her? What control does she have over him? He feels responsible for their child? A good response there would be to prove the atrocities that she has done and get the child out of her reach.<br/><br/>David Fincher is an excellent director as we have seen many times before and it is always nice to see an author adapt their own book for the screen. Gillian Flynn wrote an intense and all around screwed up story that is sure to mess with peoples emotions and moral responses. The acting was reasonable and even though the seriousness of the matters at hand, I found it surprisingly funny which was one of its strongest points in my opinion. In the end I thought it was a descent thriller about something we have kind of already seen before but it's not really what it is all cracked up to be."

Gone Girl is utterly disappointing and is nothing like his previous work.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck does okay, I think from the anguish on his face at times he understood that it was a lemon.

","I gave this film five because the acting was really good. I liked the plot twists. I am not a fan of Ben affleck (except for the brilliant dogma performance) but in this he played an unlikeable prat and he played it well. None of the characters were particularly likable and i found the casting of the twin sister odd as they looked nothing alike and she looks about ten years younger than him (i looked because it bugged me and she is actually nine years younger so this is really poor casting). I was getting infuriated by the old slipping out of the back doors without anyone noticing, i mean, really, twenty news trucks out the front door and not one thinks to sit out back, come on people! What really stuck the knife in for me was the ending. I was engrossed in the plot and then it just ended. Literally. Ended. No resolution. No conclusion. If you like everything tied up in a neat old bow then do not watch as you will be disappointed. I am one of those people so this ruined the film for me. Maybe alternate endings could be filmed so we can choose the one we like best....interesting thought no?!"

","A dark psycho drama with good acting and some good dialog.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, the clues point to a well planned and well executed plot. The viewer is led to believe that Ben Affleck is facing an uphill battle when all the prepared pieces fall in place. However, when the plan unravels due to an unexpected incident, a new plan must be hatched and that is where the movie starts unraveling as well.<br/><br/>The cover-up plan and its execution left me almost insulted with many inconsistencies and unrealistic portrayal of characters that just did not fit. The ending left me asking many questions. This may have been the intent but it really did not work for me. The cover-up scheme was so flawed that any detective would have easily noted the clues.

","I'd been wanting to see it with great expectation, since I'd heard good critics and I think,or thought, Fincher was an interesting director. Seven and Fight Club were good, intense, demonstrations of this, and of Fincher's mastering of the genre.<br/><br/>I should have second guessed, since he also made incredibly boring films like Benjamin Button and video collections of the most distasteful musicians.<br/><br/>On to the movie. The first hour is like an episode of CSI, in fact, I think it actually is. The case is therefore obvious and what bothers me most is that these people underestimate the audience and don't even bother to check the story they're telling. Unlike CSI, this movie is like 2.30hs long, which is completely unnecessary, but Fincher seems to think, like many others, that length equals quality, or at least Oscar consideration.<br/><br/>And when you think: OK, we're only in the middle of the movie, this might get better (because you can't think that they've made such a fuss over this mediocre film), then it gets worse.<br/><br/>Someone commented that there was a twist but it lasted like 10 minutes and then it just flat-lined, that's exact. After the fleeting twist there's another boring drama hour, that adds a super flaw to the film: improbability. In the suspense genre, the use of clues, the credibility of the script, is everything.<br/><br/>This movie is full of loose ends and the plot just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I say, the only remarkable thing in the film is the casting, Rosamund Pike is right for the part, Neil Patrick Harris does a great supporting role and Ben Affleck has the perfect dumb face for the lead."

"Michael Kenmore","4","5","11","3 January 2015"," Intriguing, well-paced mystery thriller that reveals itself to be Basic Instinct 2.0
","I'll cut my typically long review style short to the center of the complaint common among the bad reviews: Gone Girl had been undermined and demolished by the ludicrous plot twists in the last half hour, which un-do the premise and set-up, that incurred a bitter disappointment in me as though the viewer has been toyed with in the last minutes.<br/><br/>Yes, Gone Girl has some gaping plot holes visible in the last half hour, so gaping it caused a vexed, infuriatingly frustrated disbelief in me. The way it happened in the movie doesn't work in the real life, because forensics police investigation is painfully thorough with improvements and reforms following the botched LAPD investigation of the double homicide that could pinpoint O.J. Simpson's culpability.<br/><br/>Good attributes of the movies are good acting across the board -- even the actor Ben Affleck whom I loathe; moody atmosphere with the spectacular cinematography, set-up with the slowly-unfolding plotting (until the last half hour), and the compellingly written and paced mystery thriller aura that is rare in modern movies.<br/><br/>However -- it pains me to say this, knowing David Fincher's prodigious talent but never expected him to bungle so bad as agreeing to film Gillian Flynn's screenplay adaptation -- the last half hour became too much to bear with inane twists and turns that devolve the entire movie to the equivalent of Basic Instinct 2.0, updated and revised for the 21st century. <br/><br/>Gone Girl lays out the standard work in that the plot lures in steady motion, hooks with suspense and intrigue, only to bait with the inane and illogical twists that would be laughable if it were not infuriating for some analytical viewers knowing the basics of detective and forensic investigation.<br/><br/>Like the absurdist spectacle Basic Instinct as the predecessor, with its problematic and ludicrous plotting and idiotic Hollywood logic, the seasoned and learned detectives, agents and forensic/behavioral scientists will have a field day ridiculing Gone Girl pointing out inconsistencies, impossible placements, procedurally oblivious and offensively stereotypical characterization (e.g., trusting idiot detective and the group of idiot FBI agents in one scene), glaringly obvious clues, and behavioral science holes.<br/><br/>To think David Fincher accepted this movie project to direct, ignoring its astounding plot holes among other vexing crises delineated above, is disappointing in view of his somewhat stellar filmography. It's apparent Mr. Fincher badly needed a directing job instead of marooning in boredom at home so he jumped into Gone Girl project with haste without measurably judging the script and even the novel, by the same author, to discern it's agreeably ludicrous for his liking so he could have turned it down and pick another project that's not just as ridiculous.<br/><br/>David needs to be discretionary in choosing the scripts, now that he directed what could be his worst movie since either Alien 3 (not his fault given the history of studio interference, but shows his amazing visual and nascent film directing talent) or Fight Club (unrestrainedly self-indulgent, mean-spirited and ludicrously perplexing). Panic Room is arguably Fincher's weakest film, not to mention illogical, fake and pretentious. Ultimately, it comes down to the screenplay that could correspond with the director's strengths or frail due to indecision, confusion and laziness. <br/><br/>Gone Girl is certainly an embarrassing misfire, as the meandering and inanely twisted last half hour effectively destroyed the good portion of the entire set-up that dissipated the mysterious aura with the reach and conclusion that are so ludicrous the audience is flummoxed with vexed contention, being insulted to a degree as if the movie expects to be plausible.<br/><br/>The movie is entirely implausible made by the ill will (mocking the audience) of the last half hour, which reflects Gillian Flynn's attitude that tries to pull the trick off the sleeve in a homage to Alfred Hitchcock and Brian De Palma, but comes off as rather inept, not to mention impossible.<br/><br/>Indeed, to reiterate, Gone Girl is a spiritual successor to the semi-classic erotic noir mystery thriller Basic Instinct (disregarding the sequel said to be an abysmal failure), given the similarity of the plot line with Michael Douglas character substituted as the husband and Sharon Stone character as the disappeared wife. <br/><br/>Not a whole lot of original, either. And it should never have been made into the movie; leave the novel unadapted as a Basic Instinct ripoff which it is. <br/><br/>Dave, try again and choose scripts wisely. Your choice of Gone Girl with its chasm-wide plot holes is unbecoming your body of script literate-quality work and even your literacy intelligence. Excellent visual flair, always, but juvenile high school story that gets a C minus.<br/><br/>** of 4"

Maybe you don't have a face Ben and you are wearing a wooden mask instead. The thing is, you can't act to save your life.

Not even CSI? Not even Murder she wrote?? No one cared about the plot holes? But let's say the crime story was the way to deliver the ""message"". What to say about the dialogues? Do real ppl talk like this? I was pinching myself during the whole first date sequence. Like a cheap love novel. Awful!

"derzu_uzala","4","5","11","10 November 2014"," Where has David Fincher's talent gone....?
","Gone Girl is a well-crafted movie, well-shot, well-played, and... and I guess that's it. It's also quite long, rather dull despite its pretense to be a thriller. All of it is, in the end, quite hackneyed - all the characters are stereotypes rather than actual people, and it's hard to care of way or another what's going to happen next. The fault lies mainly with the scenario (I haven't read the novel the movie is adapted from). The whole story is supposed to be about ambiguity: whose fault is it when a marriage spiral downwards? Are we dealing with a disappearance, a murder, or something else? Can a normal-looking person be evil? This is the type of stories Patricia Highsmith, amongst others, made a living out of: just think of ""The talented Mr. Ripley"". But Gone Girl is just flat: the problem is not so much that the two main characters are not likable - they are much worse: they are not believable. And most secondary parts: family, police, media... are also caricatures, something created to fit the story purposes rather than how actual people behave in actual life. This is the stuff that makes acceptable TV shows on rainy evenings. It's not good enough when you sit for two hours and a half in a movie theater."

The story gradually just gets more and more ridiculous to the point where you just think why am I still putting myself through this. Plus the plot lines just full of holes. For one Afflek calls the police before even checking with anyone else where his wife might be and then they launch a press release and a statewide manhunt inside a week of her ""vanishing"" he THEN calls her parents to see if she's with them.. Ok he does a really crud job pretending he's sad she's dissappeared but then they were looking to get a divorce so that could be allowed. Moving on we find out that his wife has staged her death to frame him so he gets lethal injection just becuase they had a few marital problems, then runs away only to get busted, meet her ex, slit his throat pretend she was raped and then return back to Affleck somehow insemminating herself with his semen when she didn't want kids!!!!!

","Always curious to see how a director will bring a wonderfully written novel to life- and Gone Girl asked a lot, but Fincher aced it. <br/><br/>The cast is absolutely brilliant. Every single person played their roles well, but main props go to Rosemund. There really couldn't have been a stronger lead actor. Ben held his own too. Major plus for the soundtrack and Rezner as well. <br/><br/>My only critique has to do with ""Amy's descovery interview"" scene. It's unreasonable that they would leave blood all over her and talk to her/send her home that way. I'm not a cop just seems like... no. Other than that directional choice- everything is brilliant."

","Im not much for thrillers, but this movie was so well written and the casting was awesome that i must say it's great. Ben Affleck is quite good, and Rosamund Pike is great.

"miloresetti","8","2","3","22 March 2017"," Misunderstood
","I've read a lot of user reviews of this movie which give it a score of one out of ten and sight numerous plot holes as the reason. I believe that all these people are mistaken in their assessment. The point is, the fact that the story that Amy Dunne tells the police when she finally comes back is full of holes is intentional. The crime scene at the start of the movie was meant to be poor. The whole way through the film, Nick Dunne feels like he's going crazy because it seems no one else can see these holes. <br/><br/>I think it's meant to be a striking commentary on how the mass media and mob mentality can molded to believe any story regardless of the facts present. Nick even says at one point: 'They disliked me, they liked me. They hated me and now they love me.' That line sets the tone of the thinking of the people and the story being constructed by the media. <br/><br/>It's a very well made movie. I've always enjoyed David Fincher's work but I'm sad to say I think many people missed the point of this movie."

Some issues were brought up in an interesting way, heroes are quite ambiguous, supportive characters are fine, the story is a bestseller, the director is a master - the film is good and well-made.<br/><br/>I especially liked the soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross - which created the perfect mood for the story and became my personal source of inspiration."

"svanlijnden","7","2","3","12 January 2016"," Gone over the top...
","Gone Girl director David Fincher is no stranger to twisty tales that are heavy on the moral ambiguity. (Also see: Se7en, The Game and Fight Club.) His latest movie is two-thirds of a thriller that is successfully tense, though you are likely to figure out where the story is headed before it arrives there. The last third of the film however, makes things convoluted, exits reality and ends up somewhere silly. By the time the credits roll at the end of the overlong journey, your eyes are likely to be rolling in disbelief.<br/><br/>When Nick (Ben Affleck) comes home to find his home empty with signs of a struggle, he alerts the police and a manhunt starts to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). Soon suspicion turns towards Nick, and he finds himself being scrutinized by both the police and the media. Where is Amy? Did he kill her? As the story progress, new revelations surface and the viewer's expectations get toyed with.<br/><br/>The movie is well-shot and well-acted overall, though subletly goes out the window near the finish line. Affleck is kind of a blank for the first half of the movie, but this works well for the intrigue as you can project your suspicions on him, like the media do within the film. An interesting angle here is the examination of how the media manipulate public perception in a high-profile crime.<br/><br/>For the screenplay, author Gillian Flynn adapted her own bestselling novel. Word spread that the ending of the book didn't match the ending of the film, which upset readers. But after some research online, it seems that actually the endings match pretty closely. And it is indeed a satisfying ending, it's just a shame that the film takes such an over-the-top route to get there.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Gone Girl by now, despite all the hype surrounding it when it came out and if you somehow avoided spoiling the ending for yourself online, it is still entertaining enough to experience. Get settled in though, as the journey takes an unnecessarily long two and a half hours. The movie is too goofy to be especially memorable, but apparently Affleck's endowment can be spotted for half a second if you pause at just the right moment during a shower scene. So we'll always have that.<br/><br/>More reviews: @PopCultJunk / popcultjunk.com"

","Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home to find that his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) has gone missing. Due to the circumstances surrounding Amy's disappearance and due to the media circus that her disappearance has created - there are other factors that influence both the police, the public and the media into believing that Amy isn't missing at all and that Nick may have something to do with his wife's disappearance. But what has actually happened to Amy? <br/><br/>At nearly 2 and a half hours in length one worry I had with Gone Girl is that I might have found parts of the film a little bit boring. Thankfully, pacing is one of the things that is actually good about Gone Girl - perhaps this is because Gillian Flynn penned the screenplay which she adapted from her own book. The lead up to Amy's disappearance is also relatively satisfactory - character development for Nick and Amy was solid and Flynn did enough here to get me involved with both the characters and the story.<br/><br/>Gone Girl has a seedy murky atmosphere to it which actually complements the material really well. David Fincher is once again more than competent in his directorial duties. The performances from the cast are all reasonably good - I've never been a big fan of Affleck as an actor (I've personally always felt that he's better as a Director), but he's actually reasonably good here. Rosamund Pike is a great actress and doesn't disappoint here (even though she's portraying a troubled and rather complex character). Neil Patrick Harris is wasted in a small role where he's only really used as a plot device.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is where the picture is at its strongest and I have to admit that it did hold my interest. It did seem to present itself as a bit of a heavy-handed morality play at times, but at least it had something to say. Sadly the second half is much weaker and is filled with plot turns that are either predictable or downright bizarre. Suspension of disbelief is also going to be a big influence on how much you'll enjoy this picture - it features a missing woman that no-one seems to be looking for and that no-one seems to recognise - despite the fact that her face is plastered all over the news more or less continuously.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is by no means a bad film and is perfectly watchable, but I'm surprised that a film that's mostly predictable, at times lacks logic, and at times requires possibly too much suspension of belief is proudly sitting comfortably within IMDb Top 250 list. It's actually its rather flattering status that annoys me more than anything else."
"nlkleve","9","2","3","28 June 2015"," 150 Minutes of Tension and Intrigue
","The impact of the social commentary in this movie doesn't really hit one until the next day after seeing this film. While watching it, one is so tied up in the characters and labyrinthine plot that it is easy to overlook the examinations into the role of the media in our world (not to mention the roles of marriage, lawyers, public opinion and the legal system).<br/><br/>Some have compared this movie favorably, and well, to Hitchcock's best works. Whereas Hitchcock tended to direct movies that moved towards ""just"" endings for their characters, this story is really not about justice. This story is about presenting complex, life-like characters in an extraordinary situation and then coming to a logical conclusion based upon those characters. Life isn't always just... or maybe it is in this case. I don't know.<br/><br/>At 150 minutes long, it is obvious that David Fincher is taking his time with the material. The slow, even pacing is very important to the film as so much is happening in it and it needs to be absorbed by the viewer. The movie's stately progression is also necessary in order to present all the important players as 'real people'. The characters, some of whom are rather bizarre, never seem forced. I was never once bored throughout the duration although I finally had to break down and go pee with 10 minutes left in the movie. (Note to Self: Empty bladder before watching this movie and do not drink soda during it.) Is is a spoiler to say that the 'missing wife' in the story is not dead? I hope not as this plot twist is offered up rather early in the movie. But by the point of this revelation, a juggernaut of events has been started that seems impossible to resolve. These events are fueled by lust, greed, loyalties forged and broken, media judgment, public hysteria and police officers misguidedly trying to do their best to figure out the whole mess.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly good... well, even excellent... but going into individual performances would make this a long review indeed.<br/><br/>To some up: This is a movie in which to immerse yourself. Get comfortable before you watch it and let it take you on its journey. It will stay in the back of your mind and you will ponder parts of it for a long time after you have watched it."
"oagawin","Null","2","3","23 January 2015"," Something Wicked This Way Comes
","Every once in a while Director David Fincher resurrects and creates an instant classic that's quite hard to pass by. This year, he reawakens to adapt a bestselling thriller that made it in the charts in 2012 and delivers a film that drives home a point.<br/><br/>Based on Gillian Flynn's thriller novel, GONE GIRL (2014) unearths the secrets at the heart of a modern marriage. On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his beautiful wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife?<br/><br/>The circumstances were convenient, absurd, and arguably stupid, that at some point you scratch your head and think differently. But knowing that Fincher is behind all these, we faithfully submit to such irrationality and let ourselves get swayed, believing that we are in good hands. With a perfect cast and intelligent direction, GONE explores the duality in all of us and wonderfully presents the argument: that even in the most absurd of things, our willing suspension of disbelief is slowly killing our most prized common sense. That in our generation of uncensored social media, sensationalized programming, down to the smallest of gossips, we all embrace and fight for a truth as fabricated by just one.<br/><br/>It is a film worth seeing. With a villain, soooo evil, I doubt if you'd be able to sleep at night without thinking how we can be so cruel."

","I have seen many mystery-thriller movies and i wasn't expecting anything new. But this movie has something different to offer. Most of the movies end up in culprit getting caught or something bad happens with them. The best(for viewer(got something new to watch))/worst(for Nick Dunne) part is that even after knowing everything he had to live with her. At some point, i was expecting Greta recognizing Amy. Acting wise, I felt the character played by Rosamund Pike was a little monotonous. Character of Ben Affleck was OK. The storyline of the movie is very captivating. Well,the plot and its presentation keeps viewer tied to the movie. The changing public perception of the protagonist is remarkable. I would like to see more of these type of movies..."
"JMT-Studios","10","8","21","9 October 2014"," You never disappoint me Fincher
","So Gone Girl is directed by the amazing David Fincher and essentially centers on a man named Nick (Ben Affleck) who comes home to see that a table in his living room is destroyed and his wife has gone missing. Honestly if I said anything else besides that I might spoil something because this movie had an amazing marketing team. I went into this movie expecting it to be sort of a who-done-it type of movie but what I got was so much grander. This movie is utterly messed up and I loved every second of it.<br/><br/>We've got a lot to talk about so lets get going. First off, the acting in this movie is great. All around great. Rosamund Pike gives what should be an Oscar nominated performance. A lot of the movie is told through flashbacks of things she wrote in her journal and it's so engaging and I just wanted to figure out everything I could about her and the people she surrounded herself with. One crazy thing, at least to me, was that whenever Ben Affleck was on screen I never saw him as Ben Affleck, I really did see this character he was playing. He wasn't this strapping, good looking guy. He honestly looked like he gained weight for the role to look like the average suburban guy. I just couldn't see an actor the whole time and that is worth commending. One of the huge surprises was Tyler Perry, dude where has this Tyler Perry been all these years?? I want more of this because he was great! Same with Neil Patrick Harris, he's a great actor and deserves good roles.<br/><br/>David Fincher's direction in this movie is on point. Every second of this movie looks amazing on a technical level. Each shot has this depressing filter on it that compliments the tone of the movie perfectly. David Fincher always knows how to make his movies look exactly right but he also always makes sure that every shot is the perfect one to use and I can see it done for this movie. Something I love about this movie is it's portrayal of the media when it comes to cases like these and how they constantly try to get the public to agree with everything they say even if what they're saying is completely wrong. To be honest this movie had me believing the media in it for a good majority of the run time until things began to add up about half way through the movie. But I won't dive into that because I'm keeping this review spoiler free.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about this movie is it's ability to keep me guessing. Is this character going to do this and is this character going to kill this character? For the full 2 1/2 hours I never lost interest and for a movie to be that long, along with the fact that 99% of the movie is just talking, and still keep me totally invested is pretty great. It also helps that the movie was so great to look at.<br/><br/>I could gush over this movie all day and night. David Fincher has crafted another amazing film and I can't wait to get this movie on Blu- Ray in a few months.<br/><br/>I give Gone Girl a solid 10/10 and recommend anyone who is a fan of David Fincher's other films to go see this as soon as you can."

The plot points keeps the audience at the edge of the seat on the expectation of the dissolving of the case. <br/><br/>Fearless acting, smart pace, astonishing visuals and a intriguing theme.

"chantal-ashford","10","8","21","8 October 2014"," Gone Girl is the FILM of the year. (unless another can be better)
","This film is phenomenal. If you have read the book, you would understand why this film was going to be just like the best-selling novel of 2012. It was suspenseful, absorbing and kept you thinking on what would happen next? But the big question was: <br/><br/>Who killed Amy Dunne? <br/><br/>Gone Girl starts on the day of Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth anniversary, but things goes awry when Amy becomes missing. No one knows where she is or where she would run off to, but the looks of a struggle in the Dunne's residence points fingers to the number one suspect: her clueless husband Nick. <br/><br/>The movie twists and turns, transitioning from the highs and lows in Amy's diary to the first day, two days, four days and so on of her disappearance. It'll have you on the edge of your seat, guessing on what you think what happened to her, but I bet all the answers were wrong. <br/><br/>It was amazing and to make it even better, the author Gillian Flynn was the mastermind behind the screenplay. She brought her own baby to life and made it into this cinematic WTF fest until the very end. It has you wanting to know more about these two characters. You don't know who you can trust until you see the biggest WTF twist in the movie. As if you think the twists in this film is over, you're wrong. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck was amazing as Nick Dunne, the strange behavior of a man, trying to understand what happened to his wife, but all his secrets comes to light as well in all of this frenzy that became his life. This is the best I have seen Affleck in a while. <br/><br/>Rosamund Pike.... I have seen this woman in several movies, but this film. The way she portrayed Amy Dunne, the beautiful, All-American wife, was ridiculously amazing. She has you in the palm of your hand, believing every single word she gives until she lets you slip between her fingers. I am happy to see her go as far as she did in this film. I can definitely see Oscar buzz in her direction. <br/><br/>David Fincher did it once again with this film. He puts in the place, and it makes you feel like you're there, taking every step he did with this film. Everything was done beautifully. <br/><br/>The ending was a little bit of a let down, but this film is the FILM of the year. I don't know if Fincher can do it again... Or maybe he can."

(R)<br/><br/>When his ""amazing"" wife (Pike) disappears, aloof husband Affleck is suspected of murder, unleashing a media firestorm that captivates the community and nation at large, but truly not all is what it seems. Ice cold yet blistered in scorch marks, director Fincher does what he does best: an elegantly stylish, meticulously-crafted thriller that looks phenomenal, frame after frame, serving every dark impulse and lunatic intent, paired well with an unnerving score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that provides false reassurance. Gillian Flynn's adaptation of her own best-seller is a hysterical dark comedy, serpentine mystery, trashy potboiler, and sinister study of sociopathy all rolled into one; can't withstand much scrutiny, but many of those plot holes (particularly toward the end) actually serve the satirical calculations of its macabre delight. Every role is perfectly cast (yes, even Perry), with Affleck and Pike delivering exactly what's needed for their unforgettable lead roles, so very deserving of each other despite not belonging within 500 yards of one another--to be a fly on the wall... Calmly torpedoes any politically correct notion of misogyny, misandry, militant feminism, revenge fantasy, etc., but is still bound to upset those who demand rectitude in their lurid fiction, which makes it all the more ingeniously unsettling.<br/><br/>89/100"

","You know that ""Cradle of Love"" video by Billy Idol? ""Janie's Got a Gun?"" by Aerosmith? ""Vogue"" by Madonna? All David Fincher, made before he got the chance to make Alien 3. We'll forgive him that - and the fact that he had to work on Jermaine Stewart's video for ""We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off.""<br/><br/>After all, you kind of have to like a guy who has said, ""I think people are perverts. I've maintained that. That's the foundation of my career.""<br/><br/>Between Zodiac, Seven, Fight Club and The Social Network, most of Fincher's work is the kind of stuff that ends up on a poster in dorm rooms. That's not a bad thing - he's the dark side of popular film. He's also behind the Netfilx show Mindhunter.<br/><br/>The real issue I have with him is Gone Girl.<br/><br/>It's not his fault.<br/><br/>I've had to endure Gillian Flynn's work in all manner of media. Sharp Objects ran our TV for most of 2018. And Gone Girl? This movie gets played in our house at least once a week.<br/><br/>I hated this movie the first time I saw it. And by now, my reaction is the kind of numb ennui that a naked Ben Affleck feels just before you marvel that this movie is brave enough to share a shot of his meat.<br/><br/>Mr. Affleck and his appendage appear in the movie as writing teacher Nick Dunne, whose wife - the inspiration for a popular series of children's books called Amazing Amy - has gone missing on their fifth anniversary. All signs point to the fact that he was an abusive husband and had her killed.<br/><br/>The reason for that conclusion is that he doesn't seem to care. Perhaps if you had lived with Amy (Rosamund Pike), you may feel the same way. Sure, it started off hooking up at a party and were soon engaged, but after they both lost their jobs and moved to Missouri, Nick got lazy and started cheating on Amy (with Emily Ratajkowski, she of the nudity in the ""Blurred Lines"" video).<br/><br/>The twist is that Amy is still alive and has framed Nick for murder. She's planned each step so well, stealing urine from a pregnant neighbor, using her blood to create evidence that she was hurt and then planting a diary and a multitude of purchases that look like things Nick had bought for himself. Of course, she didn't expect some backward yokels to steal her money or that she'd have to hook up with her old stalker, played by Neil Patrick Harris.<br/><br/>So who is wrong? Nick for giving up on their marriage? Or Amy for the things she'd done to so many men in the past? How about both of them? How about some sympathy for me having to watch this movie nearly two thousand times?<br/><br/>But hey - Tyler Perry is pretty good in it, right?<br/><br/>Also: David Fincher shot 500 hundred hours of footage for this movie. 500 hours. Just imagine that."

","Acclaimed director David Fincher presents a tense thriller adapted from Gillian Flynn's (screenplay is by Flynn herself) best selling novel of the same name - the story of a marriage gone bad... bad... BAD... a super-twisted & knotty BAD !! This movie explores the vulnerabilities, helplessness, frustration and the sheer desperation of being tied down in a doomed marriage.<br/><br/>Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) are writers who have lost their jobs in the recession and are forced to relocate from New York to small town Missouri on account of Nick's mother who is diagnosed with fatal cancer and Nick's new job as a teacher in a local college. On the day of their fifth marriage anniversary, Nick, on returning home, finds Amy missing. There are also signs of struggle. Nick alerts the cops who begin an investigation that is bathed in the spotlights of a 24*7 news media melee, given the fact that Amy was a minor celebrity. As the hunt for a missing person transmutes into a murder investigation, skeletons start tumbling out of what was once considered a ""forever after"" fairy tale marriage and the needle of suspicion, slowly, but surely, turns towards Nick.<br/><br/>What are the problems that caused these die-hard, hot-for-each-other romantics to fall out ? And, how bad is the fall-out ? Is it so frustrating and are they so desperate to kill for it ? The movie narrates all this and more in a plot that presents one twist after another which leads the viewer to believe one way only to trump them in the very next scene in deceit with their feelings oscillating between Nick and Amy with each unravelling of the knots. I refrain from detailing any further of the story which would be providing spoilers that would spoil the viewer's experience.<br/><br/>Marriage is HARD WORK. It is a continuing exercise in mutual understanding which sustains and nurtures the seeds of mutual attraction which are supposed to sprout into an everlasting and deepening bond with strong roots. A continuing work in progress to build and reinforce compatibility through mutual care, trust and most importantly, communication. But, many, if not most, marriages trap the couple as hapless prisoners in an humdrum existence constructed on the ashes of their hyper-expectant beginnings that are divorced from their real selves. While one may never know the veracity of the adage of marriages being forged in heaven, there are more than ample proofs that once the frills & thrills of initial courtship fade off, deficits in mutual compatibility and communication could well render the marriage as a living hell with no escape.<br/><br/>Nick & Amy Elliott Dunne traverse the entire spectrum of a marriage from its blissful beginnings to banal existence and onto fatal desperation in all of five years. While the rifts start appearing when the reality of depression, retrenchments and financial issues start to bite in, are they the cause or merely symptoms of some deeper fissures ? Despite seven years - two years of courtship and five years of being married - of knowing each other, how well do they know and understand each other ? What and how deep are their feelings for each other ? Do they know each other at all ? Or, are they just familiar with the exterior personality that each wants to present the other ?<br/><br/>David Fincher has crafted a nail biting non-linear thriller which while being centered on an intriguing whodunit murder mystery also transcends the genre to explore the murky waters of modern marriages as well as that maddening phenomenon of our days called 24*7 news media. He pries open the Nick & Amy's layer by lifeless layer to pull out the diseased underside hiding behind the picture perfect exteriors. He also presents a commentary on the all pervasive sensation hungry news media which thrives on tabloid-isation of any news with scant regard to issues of privacy or even decency. News anchors - a la Arnab - preside over daily news shows which are stage managed kangaroo courts dishing out near vigilante justice based on insinuations and innuendos.<br/><br/>Fincher's masterly skills are in crafting a film that strikes a fine balance in blending a first rate thriller with a nuanced study on the growing morass of modern marriages which are staged on flimsy foundations which end up spawning disenchanted couples and a growing number of divorces and dysfunctional families, societal hypocrisy, sensation seeking news media and an industry of attorneys who survive on familial discord. In examining the life of Nick & Amy, Fincher holds a mirror to our own relationships forcing the views to reflect upon them.<br/><br/>
Ben Affleck is absolutely stunning as Nick Dunne, sporting a role with several shades of grey which requires him to be a consummate romantic to completely outwitted husband caught in the quagmire. But, it is Rosamund Pike who aces the tricky role of ""Amazing"" Amy showcasing with equal ease, romance, charisma, glamour and chilling malice. She is chameleon like in moving from being vulnerable to venomous to calculating to crowd pleasing to much more effortlessly. She is sure to earn several Best Actress nominations for this titular role and may also win a few. The spot-on supporting cast consisting of Neil Patrick Harris as a creepy jilted ex stalking Amy, Tyler Perry as an attorney specialising in defending husbands accused of murdering their wife, Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister who is only support and Kim Dickens as the homicide detective are effective. The background score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross provides an accentuating texture to the proceedings.<br/><br/>A slick, superlative and layered thriller that is a disturbing, yet, edge-of-the-seat entertainer that gets under your skin and makes you squirm. The following lines that open and close the movie are likely to resonate within the viewer long after they have finished watched it.<br/><br/>""What are you thinking? What are you feeling?
What have we done to each other? What will we do?"""
"educallejero","9","1","1","27 October 2019"," Disgusting great movie
","The acting is superb (especially from Rosamund Pike), the story awesome and twisted and thrilling, and the dialogue, while not that realistic, it is quite beautiful. Poetic? Maybe. I love it. Also, the characters are really complex. I was engaged by all their stories and lives.<br/><br/>But, I was disgusted by how they approached this story. It reverses the reality and turns our sympathy towards the other side, begging us to understand how unfair this stories usually go in real life. And that's just perverse, knowing (as the creators all should) how big the problem really is, how difficult is to fight back to make it better, and how rare is the occasion were the problem wasn't more than an scam/lie from one side to victimize itself.<br/><br/>But even in disgust, I can't deny how good the movie was."
"Tony-Alexander125","7","1","1","23 October 2019"," Enjoyable
","Just re-watched this movie and found it to be on the second viewing even more enjoyable. Nope, to me, this movie isn't as good as Finchers other offerings. Yet, t does rise above so much more of the other more dull features of recent movies in this genre."
"conceptjunkie421","9","1","1","6 October 2019"," Comes close to the book's brilliance--and that's a big compliment.
","They were never going to pull off the *exact* same feeling and depth of the book, as many narrative devices used in the book are impossible to translate to film. What David Fincher and Gillian Flynn came up with, however, is a close second.<br/><br/>The story of Nick and Amy Dunne could not have found a better director or cast. Then they had Gillian Flynn, the original author, pen the screenplay. Boom. Yes. That's how it needed to be done. All aces so far.<br/><br/>Much of the plot's aspects and details were included, even if they are rearranged and adjusted for the film's benefit. The most satisfying survivor of the transition is the now infamous Cool Girl speech played over THE pivotal moment in the story--possibly the part in the film that gets the closest to the thrill of the novel.<br/><br/>Where there thematic arguments, points, and plot developments missing? Of course. Did I miss them? Of course. There were a couple of huge things missing that changes the DNA of the story a little too much, rendering it less gut-punching than the book. I'd tell you what they are, but in the world of Gone Girl almost *everything* is a spoiler.<br/><br/>A vital element of the book is just how relentlessly thorough it is--the narrative doesn't stop until every single point is made with brutal accuracy. So in contrast, a movie version will inevitably feel truncated, or like a ""best of"" montage. That's why I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading the book first, waiting a few weeks, and then watching the movie. That will be the most satisfying way to experience this insane, razor-sharp story.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this should have been a mini-series. But what they managed in a 2 1/2 hour film was remarkable."
"VS132","10","1","1","29 September 2019"," ""Alas, I Have Returned""
","Gone Girl is a PHENOMENAL film. Everything, and I mean everything stands out from the setting, the tone, cinematography, tight writing, and dynamic performances from Ben Affleck & Rosamund Pike. How, and tell me how did this woman not win the Oscar for how she was able to outsmart everyone. This has to be some of David Fincher's best directorial choices since Seven, I totally second guessed myself with its many jaw-dropping twists. Not to spoil, but they do nearly reflect modern society's take on being morally ambiguous. This film is a true work of art and gives me hope for other great ones like it for years to come."
"questl-18592","7","1","1","11 September 2019"," Gone Girl
","For all those that look at Ben Affleck and still see him in the red spandex from Daredevil or detect the stench of Gigli lingering on him, give this one a try.<br/><br/>The plot in this is pretty straight forward and if you can overlook some of the conveniences that almost always accompany a film like this then you're in for a solid suspense piece. But even if none of that works for you, the message this film has about our tendency to shoot first and ask questions later when it comes to character assassination is as relevant now as it's ever been.<br/><br/>How about great acting? Affleck is stupendous. His ability to demonstrate a range of emotions while sprinkling in the occasional dry, hilarious witticism is perfectly done here. Neil Patrick Harris is spot on and so effectively defies his Barney-type performance to become something serious and even creepy is wonderful. And Tyler Perry, ladies and gentlemen! I've only known him from the Madea movie trailers, which are so not for me, but his limited role in this is spectacular, would love to see him like this in more movies.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch and worth the conversations it elicits afterward."
"Emily_Baines","7","1","1","7 September 2019"," A movie for today
","Although this movie was released in 2014, it should be remembered today with all those #metoo floating in the social media. Even if this movie can tell us about the nasty side of psychopathy or the terrifying side-effects of being in the spotlight, what I loved most was that finally woman was not the heroine of the story.
Usually, the woman is the victim which will regain her power and show off that she was right from the early beginning of the movie. Let's take The Girl on the Train or even Return to Sender with the same Rosamund Pike on the lead-role. In both movies, men are the bad guys with no good sides. And women always win no matter that sometimes there may be some of their fault in the consequences. However, firstly, this movie evolves as something similar to the films mentioned, evolves as a thypical thriller about a woman who fooled a bad husband, on the other hand, soon the character of a woman-role gets a chance to fully develop. And we see that the actions have consequences. And it is a rule for everybody, not only for men. And if this is not enough, finally the psychopath is not so charming as in American Psycho or The Clockwork Orange. All of the uncomfortable moments are presented here as well. Thank you so much for this!
What to mention about a script that fully catches the viewer's attention and a natural acting. Yeah, it is a long and great movie to spend the day with and not to forget within the upcoming months."

","If you've read the book and you watch this movie, you'll be disappointed. I loved the book; thrilling and exciting. However the movie was a let down from my side. I understand why this movie has high ratings but the book was by far better than the movie. If you haven't read the book, the movie is worth a watch."
"freelancedancepants","6","1","1","1 February 2019"," Great premise, weak characters.
","Gone Girl is broken up into two parts, as the twist of the story happens right in the middle. Having never seen that before, It's hard to deny that I was very engaged and interested to see the story flip in on itself. What I found most impressive was the way the film radically changed my perception of it's characters several times through my first watch.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I do think this film is held back by some seriously lack luster performances. It shines in it's ability to tell you just enough to be invested in the protagonist, whilst saving his flaws for fascinating reveals. However, Ben Afflecks relaxed schlub is highly forgettable and fails to deliver any convincing emotion, and Rosamund Pikes blank faced sociopath is equally uninspired.<br/><br/>Overall, Gone Girl offers an interesting plot ripe for inspiration. However, the characters were either written or performed in a way that they themselves were not as interesting as the things that were happening around them. If you find a story more important than compelling performance, I would highly recommend Gone Girl."
"szeall","8","1","1","13 January 2019"," A shocking and clever ride.
","I can see how some may pick fault in the story, but the 1/10 star reviews are just ridiculous. Go and watch literally any film you've never seen before on Netflix or Prime Now and there you will find a true 1/10.<br/><br/>Anyway, Gone Girl provides for a suspenseful and clever (even if some don't appreciate it) twist on a classic tale, wife disappears and the husband looks to fit the bill, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Some describe Affleck as very wooden, but he is playing the actual character very well. The plot genuinely took turns I did not see coming, and though the ending may be decisive it is a very symbolic and smart ending based on the twists and turns that arise. Especially taking the opening line and the ending line and putting them together.<br/><br/>Gone Girl allows for the support roles to shine, a story to be told with genuine turns you will not be coming and it certainly delivers on the intrigue. Give it a watch, you'll enjoy the ride."
"mechastasis_64","7","1","1","7 January 2019"," Good rithm bad conclusion
","I found it entertaining. It is the story of how men can also be manipulated by their women. About men and women as antagonists, that is so fashionable.
The ending disappointed me at first, but then I found myself thinking that maybe it's about how the woman can extort the man to leave him captive in an unhappy marriage, a look that is almost untreated in this century marked by a strongly feminist point of view ."
"ayush-06521","8","1","1","17 December 2018"," It's the kind of films you start disbelieving in the idea of marriage from.
","The film is absolutely gripping from the first scene. The raw and chilling look of the wife makes us want to see the layers of her character. And the husband is also very well sketched in his flawed relationship to his twin. Interestingly confusing at first whether or not he is the murderer, but soon resolves that question and takes the story forward. The transformations of look of the wife is spectacular. Acting- A grade. Plotting of murder-amazing. Characters- believable, even the wife is relateable inspite her actions. What she wanted is what people want from each other in today's relationships. Marriage is compromising self to get the love of the partner, and wanting the other to be as they like, it's this relateable theme which grabs the attention on a deeper level.
No matter the compromises, things do get beneficial at the end. Oh! What a sarcasm on the face of people from the fine storyteller!"
"cliffwilliams01","9","1","1","27 November 2018"," One huge plot hole
","I really love this twisted movie. The performances are excellent, and nobody today can touch subject matter such as this like David Fincher.
Having said that the story, contains at least one huge plot hole. She is supposed to be pregnant when she disappears, yet when she is at the hospital after her return, nobody thinks to run tests to make sure the baby is ok. This would have started unraveling her story because she was never pregnant to that point. Also did the FBI do no investigating at the crime scene at all ?"
"smithpaulusmc","8","1","1","30 September 2018"," ""What have we done to each other? What will we do?""
","Gone Girl is an epic case study on the darkest parts of human relationships and marriage. The concept alone left me fearful of everything I cannot control. Rosamund Pike is terrifying while Ben Affleck is cluelessly spectacular. Amy Dunne (Pike) plays out like an evil breed of Annie Wilkes (Misery) and Holly Golightly (Breakfast at Tiffany's). Nick Dunne is a blank and lacking in personality. Yet, for Affleck, the character works. Nick easily becomes the victim of his own stupidity and his wife's cruelty. <br/><br/>The only qualm I have with Gone Girl is the length. Director David Fincher previously adopted a five act structure for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and does the same in his newest flick. While the five act structure allows potent character development, the story has moments that drag. Still, I realize that if the story had been edited and shortened, it would have felt rushed and insincere. <br/><br/>The visuals are crisp and clean. The RED Dragon that bore the majority of filming does wonders in the common low light environments. In terms of color grading, nothing is overdone. The colors seem true to real life all while highlighting important reds, golds, and whites.
If you haven't seen Gone Girl, you are doing yourself a disservice. When you are ready to watch it, turn off your phone and get a babysitter for the kids. You don't want to miss a second of this wild ride."
"atlasmb","8","1","1","9 July 2018"," A Cleverly Written Mystery
","Ben Affleck is Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike is Amy Dunne in this story that is a mystery at times, a thriller at others. I love the way that the film's exposition leads the viewer to one conclusion, then another that is contrary to the first, then another. Eventually, the film becomes a commentary on public opinion and the media, even as it explores the complexities of an unusual marriage.<br/><br/>The action starts with the disappearance of Amy, but the story evolves quickly. I have read other reviews that decry an abundance of plot holes, but I find most of them to be misunderstandings of the story. Others can be easily explained with some creative thinking. As a whole, the story is cleverly written.<br/><br/>This film deserves its high score. The performances are strong, even in their moments of restraint. Rosamund Pike has cited Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct"" as an influence and it is noticeable in her sometimes measured manner. Ben Affleck, at times, reminds one of the prototypical Hitchcockian hero-victim.<br/><br/>The Reznor and Ross soundtrack is atmospheric, giving the film a suspenseful, unresolved feeling."

","I actually watched the film before reading the book, and have since become an avid Gillian Flynn fan and love both, Dark Places and, Sharp Objects, the latter of which I am extremely excited about seeing as a series.
Back to the film...<br/><br/>What starts off as a fairly normal missing persons thriller, quickly becomes something that you least expect. It is extremely faithful to the book, which I always approve of and very little was even left out. Ben Affleck is fantastic and whatever you may have thought/think about him as a person, do not let that cloud your judgement when watching, Gone Girl, as he is really is believable. However it is Rosamund Pike who steals the show as the missing wife. She is just outstanding, really fantastic. There is enough sex, detective work, subplots, good dialogue etc to interest fans of the different components of a thriller, but for me the overall story line is just so perfect that I wonder if it truly ever could have failed as a film.<br/><br/>I am currently waiting for my two next favorite books to make it to screen, What Happened to Michael by N F Paupe, who has the equal power of deception and intrigue that Flynn does and , The Dry, by Jane Harper, a book that will explode ( literally) on screen."
"vkap-13252","8","1","1","28 May 2018"," Wonderful story, great acting by Rosamund Pike
","This movie would be worth watching for either the story or Rosamund Pike's acting alone. With the two together, it is very compelling. 
There are parts where the movie moves a bit slower and the unfolding of story through flashbacks does at times feel a bit cumbersome. But those can be forgiven for the brilliance of the idea and how the lead character is portrayed by Pike."

This is a compelling thriller based on the novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn. Gone Girl- the book was ripe for Fincher to adapt and it is easy to see why- the book is filled with unreliable narrative, red herrings and twists. Acting is amazing from the ever-reliable Ben Affleck but it is Rosamund Pike as the missing wife who steals the show.

"RossRivero99","10","1","1","13 June 2017"," A David Fincher masterpiece
","David Fincher is one of the true masters of modern cinema after more than 20 years in the film business he has proved time and time again that he hasn't lost his steam and with his latest film ""Gone Girl"" is no exception to his excellent body of work as a director. This movie isn't based on a true story but it is based on a novel by Gillian Flynn who also happened to write the screenplay for the film as well, and it is her screenplay that makes the plot during the course of the movie much trickier than the trailers may lead you to believe. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne a man whose wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) mysteriously disappears from their home on the day of their 5th wedding anniversary and Nick promptly calls the police to report his wife missing. The police officers investigating the case are Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer James Gilpin (Patrick Fugit). At first glance the house looks fine but is then promptly turned into a crime scene and Nick becomes the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance, which always happens in these types of cases. Every person in the community is doing anything and everything in their power to help find her. The evidence is very incriminating towards Nick and at the advice of his twin sister Margot (Carrie Coon) he hires a well known defense lawyer named Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry). After Bolt is hired Nick finds Amy's high-school boyfriend who is a man named Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) and asks him some serious information about his past which I will not reveal in this review. Affleck's performance is what makes this movie so much more riveting, as well as Pike's Oscar nominated work as Amy, along with Flynn's screenplay, Fincher's direction, and the score by ""Nine Inch Nails"" members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who won Oscars for Fincher's ""The Social Network"" (2010)). The film is truly great and is also one of the 10 best films of 2014."
"tiborvanveen","10","1","1","8 June 2017"," The defining of Mystery
","I'd like to start off with saying that I can understand the people that rate the movie with a 1, It's ridiculously harsh though. I think those are the people that rate a restaurant with a 1 when they see a hair in their soup. <br/><br/>That hair in this movie is a lack of realism for some. Yes, you might say that some parts leave questions about how realistic it is, but that's not what this movie is about and not what the movie should be aiming for. It's about a journey for the viewers, to see what's going to happen next, you should let yourself go and see how a story about insanity is going to unfold. The story is thrilling, even though you might have a clue what would happen in advance, you still long for more, since surprises will follow. With two main characters that try to outsmart each other until the very end of the movie.<br/><br/>Just lose yourself in the mystery that's going to unfold, as seen by the reviews, some people can and some people cannot. <br/><br/>There's my two cents."
"Schuriken","7","1","1","25 July 2015"," Now I'm never getting married. Ever.
","I really like this movie although I do understand why all the people hated it. That's because of the huge plot holes and too many mistakes included. I get it. It's not hard to read all the goofs and plot holes in the movie's description on IMDb.<br/><br/>I didn't expect it to have a Sherlock Holmes facts and detail pinpoint accuracy but all the blunders were fading away one at a time because of the very good acting. It's like the director had already identified these errors but kept going because he wanted to tell this rather unusual and gruesome story. It just had to be made one way or the other.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film at all. I wouldn't call it entertaining either, very hard to be entertained by a dark, psychotic and violent movie such as this. By violent I mean psysical and psychological violence. And I think the pcychological violence was way over the top with this one. Which is a hard thing to do these days. But the director had a lot of help from the actress who played the wife and Ben Affleck. Ben could have done a much better job but in the end he plays out his character perfectly.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend you go see it with your soon to be your wife girlfriend. If you do watch this with your girlfriend, listen carefully to what she says about this movie after it's done. If she loved it, maybe you ought to rethink a couple of things about her. Second thoughts never hurt anybody. Ha Ha Ha.<br/><br/>Jesus Christ with all the people not liking this movie because of the plot holes. It's a psychological thriller not a CSI episode. Jesus...."
"nikashvili","10","6","15","20 October 2014"," Gone Girl is one of the best adaptations ever screened with Rosamund Pike's performance of decade
","The Book has the most intrigue start, I've ever read: When I think of my wife, I always think of her head. The shape of it, to begin with"" Enough suspense to later blame Nick Dunne in disappearance of his wife, on the exact day of their 5th anniversary. But even later, Flynn gives a lot reasons to believe that a good wife, amazing Amy, loving woman became a victim of unfaithful husband. And you will partly be true. <br/><br/>It was a wise decision that Gillian herself adopted it as a screenplay, because she was the only one who could fully capture the suspense, characters and story behind the lines. She basically brought everything to the screen, tiny details, all important dialogs and presented characters as she wrote couple of years ago. Because of this precise adaptation we first meet husband and get him fully known, thinking that he is an asshole, cheater and Amy Elliott-Dunne - a smart, beautiful, charming, interesting wife. Definitely a good one. And then we start exploring Amy's character, step by step and the truth just opens up to shock us. <br/><br/>Film gives a lot to think about, but most importantly how false can things be in life, even marriage, how people can destroy you for ""nothing"" and how important job media does in it. It's a worst nightmare of so called American Dream: a perfect girl, a perfect boy = perfect life! But no. ""what are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done to each other"" - these are questions marriage is all about, just understanding and learning each other. Because if anyone thinks that people stay the same after they sign some formal papers, they are wrong - just like main characters. They both thought they married persons of their dreams: Nick was the one who ""saved"" Amy and Amy was a sweet, loving wife. When time passes, and because ""marriage is hard work"", they expose true selves and marriage stops working. And when marriage stops working, Nick makes mistakes and Amy decides that he shall not be excused. She decides to rebuild a husband she married to, the perfect man for her, the one she can control, who would admire Amazing Amy and make him feel important.<br/><br/>Both lead characters are perfectly written. He is a guy who loved her wife for who she pretended to be. And yes, I think Amy was different in the beginning and as relationship got deeper, he started to look beyond the surface of wife's character. He did not like it and never tried to make it work. Just went out and enjoyed the first tw*t he met. While Amy behaves differently - she prepares a lesson for husband, to make him perfect again, because Amy Elliott-Dunne is not one of those who lose.<br/><br/>A lot has been told about misogyny in Gone Girl. Are you kidding me, people? This is a movie, and a book, with probably the strongest female character and it's nothing but any feminist dream come true. Amy is the woman who had controlled any man in her life, who has won any battle against people who thought she was just another Cool Girl. She is smart, strong, unbeatable, capable of manipulating her husband the way she wants. The movie itself criticizes misogyny in society for victimizing women and envisioning Amy as someone who needed to be protected. I think that Gillian wrote one of the most memorable and solid women in fictional movie/book history. <br/><br/>Flynn also changed the ending in film. I think it tells technically the same story. But I kind of preferred book where Nick tells Amy: ... I feel sorry for you... because every morning you have to wake up and be you It hinted some important things: first, that they finally decided to be themselves and most probably, Nick would spent the rest of his life with Amy - and it means that she wins, forever. The movie ending, makes it a little more vague.<br/><br/>Most of book readers wanted to know how they would screen Amy's diary entry about The Cool Girls. And you know? Fincher nailed it. Amy passing these all kind of girls and being full of hate was one of the best parts of film. <br/><br/>Among other things, Gone Girl has some brilliant cinematography. Camera captures some brilliant shots, which are equally creepy as the story itself. Scene of Nick Dunne and the cat with background of camera flashes blew my mind. It helps to imagine him as a killer and as a bad guy. There are so many scenes, where camera angles can tell the whole story, you should just see it. <br/><br/>Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor once again created brilliant score. The music plays huge part here and their creepy soundtrack, especially in the beginning and end, sell spirit of the movie. Each scene has very carefully chosen music, matching with dialogs, it keeps you ears entertained but focused on the plot. <br/><br/>This film would not be anything without two brilliant lead performances. Most importantly, Rosamund Pike. She delivers performance of her career. I can not imagine anyone being so perfect portraying such complex, weird, creepy, sociopath intelligent woman, who turns out to be the strongest. Rosamund literally disappears in her character, nailing every scene, from smiles to witty dialogs. Her voice makes it all pure enjoyment. It even caused goosebumps in me. Terrifying. That's why I believe Pike is the best actress this year. Sorry all overdue veterans, but she deserves all awards. No doubt.<br/><br/>And Ben Affleck, so widely hates as an actor, is also brilliant. I know these fake smiles are almost natural, the reason he got this part, but still, he absolutely sells Nick's character. <br/><br/>Gone Girl is definitely the best film of the year, so far."

Most of the time, an adaptation of a book so widely loved is made purely for the fans, and all it does is serve justice to the people who were losing their mind over this book over the past couple of years. But now that I have seen Gone Girl, I can now understand why people were going crazy. This story and the way its is filmed is undoubtedly the best we have had all year, and quite possibly the best adapted film ever made.<br/><br/>Having not read the book, I was completely shocked when it was revealed that Amy was still alive and it was she who staged the entire crime scene. It is the twists such as these that had me wanting more of Gone Girl, cringing and impatiently waiting to see what the next oblique turn it will take. I have never been so shocked, disgusted, and overall emotionally invested in a film as much as I was with Gone Girl.<br/><br/>As I have been staying, the story and screenplay are flawless. But what really steals the show of the film is the presentation. Ben Affleck gives the performance of his career in his character which is sometimes despicable, sometimes empathetic. However, it is Rosamund Pike who acts as the stand out role. From being a scared vulnerable housewife to a manipulative murderous psycho, Pike delves deep into the persona of the Amazing Amy and mesmerizes in every sense of the way through very word she speaks and every move she makes. I will be shocked if both of them do not receive an Oscar nod, and even more so is Pike does not take home the gold.<br/><br/>But what really is the most impressive aspect of this film to me is the work done by the great David Fincher. Every shot in the film is so meticulously crafted and cared for that sets up the dark mysterious tone of the film. The cinematography gives an overall dreadful atmosphere which sets you on edge, leading to the climax of the film. You guessed it, the part in which Amy kills NPH's character. This scene may be one of the most expertly staged shot I have ever seen, it sneaks up on you out of no where and it made my jaw drop. I will never get the image of Amy stabbing him out of no where and bathing in his blood out of my head. <br/><br/>There is no higher praise I could give this film. The statements it has on the media and marriage are so unique, and make your evaluate the success of our century. A movie has never made me think so much about how much I know the people I love. And with the presentation and acting of the film, it all adds up to be a flawless piece of cinema history.<br/><br/>Grade: A+ / 100"
"Hello_Im_David","9","8","22","4 October 2014"," You Don't Know What You've Got Till It's...
","A lot of people might describe Gone Girl as a roller coaster ride. One of those movies that is in constant flux causing your stomach to tie up in knots. But it's really more of a maze. It's dark and brooding and sometimes it changes suddenly and unexpectedly, and sometimes we get lost, but the more lost we get the better. In the movie Amazing Amy Elliot Dunne has gone missing from her small town suburban Missouri home and the search to find her alive or dead begins a thrilling odyssey, where lives are ruined and each clue births a new mystery to be solved. <br/><br/>But despite it's entertaining, ever shifting, half mystery half thriller angle, this is all just a cover for what the film is really about. The truth is, the only person we'll ever really know in our lives is ourselves. When we look into someone else's eyes there is no way of knowing what calculating clockwork might lay beyond. Even someone we love, someone we've grown up or grown old with, can become a total stranger. This is what the real heart of the movie is about: the ever changing masks we choose to wear. Because in truth we're all actors and we're always tailoring our performances to the audiences present. In the movie, Nick plays the part of the gallant boyfriend turned perfect husband, while Amy plays the part of the cool girlfriend turned wife. <br/><br/>And after Amy disappears the focus becomes Nick's performance. How is he acting? Is he smiling at a time like this? Why doesn't he seem more concerned? His sister reminds him that he should look a little disheveled so that it appears he's had a long sleepless night while worrying for his lost wife. He's coached by lawyer Tanner Bolt to play the part of the f*ck up husband begging for forgiveness. All the while Amy plays the part of the abused housewife, the quintessential missing upper middle class white lady. And by the movie's end the characters will shed their old masks and don new ones, even more gruesome and terrifying than before. No one is really interested in the truth (except perhaps Nick, to a certain extent) and there is no justice. But how can there be justice in a world that is stained by the mainstream media and the Nancy Graces of the world, who act as judges of abstract character traits rather than anything concrete. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are quite honestly astounding in their performances. As the movie starts both actors seem to be wooden, robotic and inauthentic. But as the movie progresses we start to see the humans behind the facade, the true characters of Amy and Nick, if only for small fractions at a time before they sink back into their roles be it the witty writer, the poor woman from New Orleans, or the loving couple with a fresh start. And David Fincher is able to adeptly guide us along this labyrinth, keeping us on the edge of our seats and never challenging us to sit back and turn our brains off as the gears click. Aided by meticulous editing, beautiful silver coated cinematography and an often mellow, entrancing score, we're pulled into this dark saga that's less about finding the girl that's gone missing, but rather discovering the souls of these melancholy people trapped in some kind of awful twilight. But as Fincher takes us deeper into this mystery, as he uncovers mask after mask trying to reach something real we become resigned to the fact that we all have something to hide. It's not just Nick. There's a little bit of villain inside all of us, and we just have to keep covering it up, because god forbid anyone see us for what we truly are."
"petarmatic","5","12","37","4 October 2014"," Relatively disappointing!
","I have to say that I was disappointed with this film. Plot is not realistic at all. It is well disconnected from real life. I really think that at least eighty per cent of this plot would not happen in real life. When such disconnection happens in a film then it becomes big disappointment for me.<br/><br/>I also have to say that I was not very impressed with acting, although some actors with minor roles did a very good job. For example, a couple that robbed main female character of her money. Also a female police officer is an exotic character with her coffee mug.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I will quickly tend to forget this film! I apologize to the people who liked this film so much, but I did not. I mean there were some good parts, like when she was on the run, in that white trash house mingling with that couple, but otherwise not really that interesting or fresh."
"kimthurston2004-839-560726","2","5","12","9 April 2015"," It's no wonder that people who liked Birdman would like this.
","Over the top story, over the top ""southern"" accents (in mid-west Missouri), over the top reaction to the missing 30 year old woman (you would think it was the Lindburg baby), its hard to like this movie. The only thing the director did get right was the media witch hunt, that was pretty much right on. They should have turned this into a movie about media manipulation of the ""news"" and the ""trial by media"" that has become the latest rage, it would have made more sense. It also seems like they were trying to compete with Scarface for the movie using F*** the most. The director must have figured that using f*** every other word would make a bad movie better....it didn't."
"purrlgurrl","5","5","12","4 November 2014"," Read the book . . . disappointed
","The theme of the book is how we often hide our true selves and role play in the beginning of a relationship in order to attract and hold onto a partner. Then, when we can no longer maintain the facade, our real selves emerge and things can go bad. In this case, things don't just go bad, they go totally off the rails. This theme, which explains both main characters in the book, isn't emphasized as forcefully in the film.<br/><br/>Fincher made the mistake of believing his audiences are comprised entirely of those who read the book. Those who haven't can get left behind, especially in the Amazing Amy subplot, which is not fleshed out. <br/><br/>Rosamund Pike is the cast standout as Amy, the wife gone missing. Missi Pyle is a close second as a Nancy Grace-like cable news commentator who's seen only on TV screens in many scenes. Nevertheless, she steals every scene she's in. Ben Affleck is capable as the husband under suspicion in his wife's disappearance. But, it's awfully tough to buy Neil Patrick Harris in his role as a slightly creepy, obsessed former suitor. <br/><br/>Being honest about how well I felt the book was brought to the screen, I can't give Gone Girl a high rating. Fincher did a creditable job, but this is not his best work."
"celinech11","8","5","12","28 October 2014"," Gone Girl
","Directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, The social network,Â…), Gone Girl is an adaptation from a novel written by Gillian Flinch. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Rike (Nick and Amy Dunne) are the leading roles and they give an outstanding performance that really helps taking the film to the next level.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a gripping thriller that constantly surprises you by its fantastic plot. It is the story of Nick and Amy Dunne, they form the perfect couple but on their fifth anniversary Amy goes missing. Nick, disoriented, finds himself caught in the middle of a mediatic storm and a police investigation. Slowly we understand that this couple is nothing like what it seems to be. The plots gets darker and darker as David Flinch makes the autopsy of his characters. The film changes tone as we go through the appearances and discover the truth about what really happened. The media play an important role in the movie, Nick is constantly followed by horde of journalist. They talk about his story on the television and the journalists don't hesitate to judge and to take sides in order to attract audience. David Flincher clearly denounces the lack of moral judgment of the press. (Witty,) the story makes a dark critic of the American society in general, denouncing the importance people give to appearances.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film is a very good thriller with a unique style, griping and dark but not too heavy. David Flincher really keeps us on tenterhooks, with an exceptional plot that can't seem to stop thickening. His two main characters are fascinating and he describes them in a way that make them hard to forget. Sometimes the film can get a bit excessive but I would still strongly recommend you to go and see it for yourself!"
"Dhruvsingh","4","10","30","2 November 2014"," Really?
","This movie is pretentious and lame in its glory defining genre called mystery/thriller.<br/><br/>As a fan of the man named David Fincher who gave us Seven,Zodiac,and Social network. And because of his earlier movies which raised a higher standard and Creative scales,he came close to a complete blunder on this flick(will not even mention it as a movie).<br/><br/>He fall into the pitfall of the unifying theory of life that you cant have creative vision all the time. Equally surprised by the ratings,reviews and public reaction about this film but its understandable that eventually the product is sell out to us in the package. If you watch Seven which marked the process of Film-making and set a standard where the specific genre(mystery/thriller) will be judged into those horizons. Its pity and surprised me that why Fincher didn't embody his previous work if he was that motivated by this script. The Screenplay which lacks substance and thrills. It was expected that the line of work will definitely come into the lonesome lives of this couple and then built a psychological drama around it. Really?<br/><br/>The loopholes and the flaws can be commonly understandable, if one pay attention in the criminal investigation showed in the movie,so i will not go through in details <br/><br/>the conclusion is- This work of Fincher disappointed me."
"sonnier-dallas","2","7","19","26 November 2014"," Worst plot in the world.
","I understand it's a movie, but everything Amy did in the movie as far as framing her husband would've been caught in reality. I watch a lot of investigation discovery. Of course Hollywood & reality don't sync; but if you think some intelligent writer that obviously has a personality disorder, dissociative disorder, scoipathic/psychopathic issues would just be claimed as a missing person you're an idiot. This movie also shouldn't be listed as ""mystery"" because she explains exactly what she is doing in the middle of the movie. I think it was poorly scripted, and could've ended better. Just saying, if your out and about looking to watch a movie in theaters. Fury > Gone Girl."

"nico-153","2","4","9","24 August 2015"," Seriously?!? Sitcom acting, poor directing and an incredibly weak story.
","A very high rating on IMDb. An Oscar nomination. Directed by the great David Fincher. What could possibly go wrong? Well, actually an awful lot! The film sometimes looks to be directed by a Hitchcock wannabe. In several scenes there was a poor attempt to copy the master's style. The worst one was where the blood flows away in the shower. But was there also a very poor attempt (and quickly abandoned) to copy the wonderful weird female police officer in Fargo by Frances McDormand? David Fincher? Really? What was the matter with him?<br/><br/>Was this film written by the same writers as Desperate Housewives? As far as I could tell it had a similar atmosphere and an attempt was made to recreate the same darkish style and madness. But what do I know? I never followed that sitcom, only saw a few scenes. The acting was stiff and mediocre at best. So there was not much pleasure to watch the film in this department either.<br/><br/>And then the enormous quantity of goofs. Other contributors wrote a lot about them and I think they were right. The goofs were really irritating and numerous. Among the worst:<br/><br/><ul><li>Somebody losing such a large quantity of blood and not really being weakened by it?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Clear evidence found in the shed in the form of a note that was never sent to the police and that was later also never mentioned anymore? - A murder suspect released on bail so easily? Would he really get bail? A murder suspect who does not even have any money to pay his bail with?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Somebody turning up covered in blood, very quickly examined in a hospital, immediately very informally questioned by a huge group of police officers and immediately sent home, while all the time still covered in blood? Yeah, right.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A murder committed in a house covered with cameras and the video coverage was never looked at? It would be extremely unlikely that the video coverage would back up the story without any questions asked. For instance why she ended up voluntarily in the house while after she was supposed to have been abducted? Where she claimed to have been tied up which would never have been recorded or even indicated on video?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Then all of a sudden the woman is pregnant after a highly incredible artificial insemination subplot? A bit very extremely unlikely! And this crazy turn would convince her husband to stay with her? Yeah, right.</li></ul><br/><br/>This film was not worth watching. Imo it certainly is not worth all the IMDb praise or rating. It was just a poor waste of time. And then it also ended with a huge and very unlikely cliff-hanger! So this rubbish can be followed up by even more rubbish?"

","Disturbing, unsettling, implausible. The first hour or so wasn't terrible, then the rest of the movie got progressively worse, and the plot holes more gaping, until the film mercifully concluded, but without any ""moral of the story."" I am genuinely saddened by the high marks given to this film, and I fear that the entertainment industry will give us lots more like it. The acting and direction were the only aspects of it that I could even consider worthwhile, but they weren't nearly enough. This film making IMDb's Top 250 (or Top 1000, for that matter) is a travesty. I can only guess that the ""plot twists"" were what appealed to those who liked it...I would strongly suggest that these folks go watch some Hitchcock films. This movie is garbage, needlessly violent, and lacking in characters worth caring about or even trying to sympathize with. (Sorry to end a sentence with a preposition, I'm struggling to come up with the requisite ""10 lines of text"" demanded by IMDb for a movie that has already sucked hours out of my life.)"

Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne was amazing but OMG Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne a.k.a GONE GIRL was brilliant, excellent and marvelous, I will only say this that she has the every right to win the Academy.<br/><br/>Since this is an adaption to Gillian Flynn's book which she also writes the screenplay which I think was very clever from Fincher to choose Gillian for this job and she excellently done it, the movie is very much to the book and everything goes as I hoped.

"brchthethird","9","4","9","19 January 2015"," A cynical, 21st Century look at love and marriage
","David Fincher is one of my favorite directors, and for good reason. He's able to take ordinary or middling source material and spin gold out of it. Such is the case with his latest film, GONE GIRL. GONE GIRL is the story of Nick and Amy Dunne, a seemingly happy married couple who live in a Missouri suburb. However, Nick's life turns into a living hell on the morning of their fifth anniversary when he comes home to find his wife missing, and eventually a suspect in her disappearance. In case there are people who haven't seen the film (or read the book), I'll stop here to avoid going into spoiler territory. The film, for me, is a success in every category. David Fincher has yet again created a visually rich and technically superb film that is beautifully shot. The performances were also incredible, from a perfectly cast Ben Affleck as Nick to Rosamund Pike as his wife, Amazing Amy. In fact, Rosamund Pike is a revelation in this film and, in my opinion, gives the second best female performance of 2014 (first place going to Essie Davis for THE BABADOOK). She does an excellent job at portraying a manipulative, conniving woman and Ben Affleck was perfect as her affable husband. It should go without saying that this film does not paint a pretty picture of marriage, and in fact is downright cynical towards it. In a more general sense, it takes a look at the facades we put up for others and the degree to which we attempt to influence other peoples' perception of ourselves. How much is truthful, and how much is a lie? To a lesser degree, the film also examines the way in which popular media affects public perception. This is portrayed in the film by a Nancy Grace stand-in, Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle). And, believe it or not, Tyler Perry is great as Tanner Bolt, the lawyer that Nick hires to prepare his case, and also helps him do some image rehabilitation. Overall, I loved the film's acerbic wit and satirical edge, not to mention that the story takes a number of twists and turns that you won't see coming. This is one of my favorite films from last year, and I highly recommend seeing it."

"sddavis63","2","3","6","20 August 2018"," A Half Decent Cast Offer Bad Performances In An Awful Movie
","The cast of ""Gone Girl"" is half decent. The leads are relatively big names - Ben Affleck as Nick and Rosamund Pike as Amy (not the biggest, but certainly known.) The supporting cast wouldn't cause me to swoon, but they're decent enough (people like Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens and Neil Patrick Harris are in this.) But regardless of the so-called ""critical consensus"" (which seems to be very positive) you don't have to get very far into this to discover that you have a half decent cast in what's at best a third-rate movie.<br/><br/>I thought the performances by and large (from everyone) were awful. It's as if this half decent cast realized from the start that they were starring in one dog of a movie. The story had some potential. As it starts Amy and Nick are a seemingly happy young couple on top of the world, with money and in love. But things don't work out well for them, they lose their jobs and they have to move from New York City to Missouri to care for Nick's elderly parents and everything about their life unravels. Ultimately - and here's where the whole thing (which wasn't that good to start) falls apart - Amy fakes her own death, and manages to frame Nick for her murder. Nick isn't a good guy - in fact there's not a single character in this movie who's really likeable or sympathetic, except possibly Det. Boney (Dickens) - and once his wife is ""killed"" he becomes the immediate prime suspect (more by the tabloid media than by Boney, who's never entirely convinced about what's happening.) He gets portrayed as a sociopath, but it's really Amy who's the crazy sociopath. The first hour or so of the movie deals with Nick being hounded by the police and media. Then comes the twist - Amy is alive and hiding out, and we get flashbacks now to see how she set the whole thing up. Then another plot twist as Amy's hiding out crashes and burns; then another plot twist with the ex-boyfriend she seeks refuge from; then another plot twist as she returns home. It's not interesting - it's more mind-numbing. It goes on way, way, way too long. Once you get to the third or fourth plot twist you're wondering ""good God - how long can this go on?"" And it goes on far too long. Actually once we're into the story that follows the last plot twist I actually found myself chuckling at times (especially at discovering that the police and hospital have sent Amy back home after she resurfaces, still covered in blood - they could't clean her up?) I wasn't chuckling because it was funny - but because it was just so bad. To me, it seems as if to really like this movie you have to be one of those pathetic ""professional victim"" men, who think women and the world are all out to get them. This will certainly feed their paranoia. (2/10)"

Neither of the main characters have redeeming traits nor are they at all relate-able. For the first half of the movie, I loved hating Afleck's character. He's misogynistic, heavy drinker, hits his wife, having an affair while his wife is gone, etc. Then comes the twist and we find out that his wife is a sociopath who is in the process of framing her husband (Afleck) for her murder while she runs off to go commit suicide. I still didn't like Afleck's character but he became slightly more sympathetic now that he's framed as the victim. So the second half of the movie I loved hating Rosamund Pike's character (the wife). By that time, I realized that the only likable characters were the lead detective, the DA, and the sister. All side characters. I won't go into all the plot holes, but banana-83's review covered all the ones I saw. However all of this is forgivable if it wasn't for the ending.<br/><br/>The Ugly: The ending.

I thought we might lead back to some trauma she had as a child, but no, that's never fleshed out, she's a generic monster. Her parents just kind of disappear. The male lead's no better.<br/><br/>The plot has many, many holes, enough to drive a semi-truck through. Like many modern movies, it's bloated up to 2 1/2 hours what could have been told in 1:45. Because of the positive reviews, I was waiting for something clever to happen, some twist, but it was predictable from the beginning.<br/><br/>A black hole and waste of time. The fact it's gotten such great reviews from professional journalists may be an indication of how terrible US movies have become. Compared to the latest superhero movie maybe it looks great.

I guess I just suspected this film to be an utter cliché - oops: ""the husband did it! Oh wait: plot twist, it was actually ... insert least obvious suspect ..."" - kidnapping movie. Well, it wasn't. <br/><br/>The first plot twist I still guessed. The film was hinting that way, whilst still trying to point in the husbands direction. They did that splendidly, but I was already suspecting this wasn't going to be ""that kind of film"". What did surprise me, was that they uncovered the plot so soon. After that the plot went completely unpredictable (for me). At the end, they might have overdone it - I didn't need those extra features of ""ONE DAY ... HOME"" etc. That last half hour was pure dark humour, and eventually ... I liked that too. But it wasn't completely necessary.<br/><br/>Because of the intense plot twists, the duration of the film was okay. Great, because I wasn't waiting for a 2,5 hour long kidnapping cliché. This combined with excellent cinematography, a very nice soundtrack and adequate - yet mediocre - acting produced 2,5 hours of highly entertaining cinema.<br/><br/>8*"

","I watched 'Gone Girl' a while after the initial hype died down and I found it to be thoroughly entertaining. As far as a mystery thriller - the way the storyline is developed and the acting performances give it a real heavyweight quality. Rosamund Pike gives an incredibly terrifying performance and the most memorable scenes between her and the superbly creepy Neil Patrick Harris are highly effective. Up until that point there is an undertone of dark humour reverberating throughout the movie and a slowly churning fear that begins to accelerate and turns to an almost delayed reaction shock fear that hits you when you realize how chillingly convincing Pike's performance is. Ben Affleck plays his part with almost equal aplomb and gives his portrayal an unexpected depth and emotion. This is also the first time I encountered the charismatic Tyler Perry and look forward to watching him again. Finch has created a semi undefinable movie mixed with brooding dark humour, chilling moments of shock and foggy mystery. The ending was not what I expected. But as in life - things never always work out the way we wish them to. Definitely a movie you could go back to again and again."

The movie revolves around the mysterious disappearance of Amy (Rosamund Pike) on the fifth anniversary of her marriage to Nick (Ben Affleck). Affleck gives an excellent performance in the form of Nick Dunne who tries to prove his innocence from the very moment the spotlight of suspicion falls on him and at the same time tries to hide his infidelity which will make him an even larger suspect in the investigation. The first hour of the movie is pretty standard for any movie with the same idea, following a simple ""who did it"" plot line.<br/><br/>After an hour while hiding his suspicious activities from the police Nick finds out that he has become the scapegoat of a brilliant fake murder orchestrated by Amy herself to try and convict Nick. Pike manages to give the best performance of her career by portraying Amy Dunne, an outstanding, terrifying, sociopath with an elaborate scheme who will destroy all boundaries of sanctity to get her husband the death sentence for allegedly killing her, his pregnant wife. <br/><br/>David Fincher shows us once again that he is unmatched in making mystery thrillers, like his previously directed Fight Club, Zodiac and Se7en, movies which strike the perfect balance between reality and disturbing fantasy with gripping storytelling. <br/><br/>The movie makes you question every obvious story guessing scenario which you play out in your head based on the facts with perfectly timed plot twists and subtly highlights the possible horrendous reality of an unfulfilling marriage."
"tonyhurleypro","3","3","6","31 July 2015"," David Fincher what happened?
","David Fincher is without doubt one of my favorite directors working today. Fight Club and Seven are two of my favorite movies. The Facebook movie was very good as well. Gone Girl is a complete waste of his talents. Other than a great score by NIN Trent Reznor and some well directed sequences, the movie falls completely flat. This story has more holes in it than a slice of swiss cheese and makes absolutely no sense. The ending will tick you off and the unbelievable motives and actions from the characters will not ring true to life. After doing some research on the book which I have yet to read, I found out the author of the book and also screenwriter for the film is a writer for Entertainment Weekly. Makes perfect sense as to why the screenplay makes absolutely zero sense. EW is garbage magazine writing at its finest. EW is made for the same type of people that have no jobs and watch Maury Povich all day. You could probably hire a group of chimps to write a better story than this monstrosity. There are to many plot holes to mention. I could write a thesis on the plot holes in this movie. The story has an interesting premise but the execution is flawed to the core. This is the type of film that Stanley Kubrick would have adapted himself during his prime and reworked the plot holes and flawed storyline into something more fluid and believable."

","I don't buy Ben Affleck as a guy from Missouri. Also, why were the cops speaking with Southern accents but not him or others? It was filmed in Rush Limbaugh's home town, which is in Southern Missouri, but Rush does not have an accent like these cops.<br/><br/>Why hire a British actress to play a rich American Harvard graduate woman? I didn't buy it at all. She didn't seem American.<br/><br/>Why was the woman a psychopath? Why did she marry a guy she had nothing in common with? I suppose the two sex scenes were satisfactory for those who like that sort of thing.<br/><br/>I feel like the characters were not developed sufficiently. We just jumped into the dissatisfaction and the weird missing thing.<br/><br/>Tyler Perry was a breath of fresh air. He fit his role and pulled it off effortlessly.<br/><br/>I also think the female detective, an unknown actress I assume, did a good job as did the other unknown who played Affleck's sister.<br/><br/>The main problem was that I didn't understand at all, what made the two main characters get together in the first place, nor what made the woman do the crazy things she did. It all just came at you with little build-up. I also can't stand random narration.<br/><br/>There is one violent scene. It's way too violent for me. Truly disturbing. I didn't rent it for that. I just wanted an interesting drama set in the Heartland. It wasn't interesting, and there was nothing Heartland about it."

","I really struggled not to rate this movie as one despite being extremely awful but then I realized I have seen a lot worse movies. Maybe the reason I wanted to rate this movie as ""One"" so bad is to offset of the mind-blowing gigantic bubble rating of 8.2!!!!!!!! To be fair to actors, they did what they were supposed to do, but with such extremely bad, no point, shallow script, there is no way this movie could be even close to being acceptable, even if the naked- covered in blood-shower scene was performed by Julia Roberts and Anthony Hopkins. I mean that could have explained the high number of views and reviews but not the rating. With such hype and high rating, chances are you will probably watch this movie however, if you are one of those who actually value their own time and try to spend it on something worthy, then this is a one you should not waste your time on."
"Malgus","5","3","6","2 March 2015"," Over-hyped lackluster silliness
","Overall Gone Girl was pretty disappointing considering the hype. The movie is definitely watchable, especially the first half, but then it takes a leap in the realm of absurdity.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent but that's a given with Fincher. The main characters are rather boring. While I can't say that Ben Affleck's and Rosamund Pike's acting is bad per se, but they both seem to lack screen presence to make themselves interesting and intriguing.<br/><br/>The main problem, at least for me, is the lack of genuine suspense. It just fails to grab your interest. Maybe it's because there have been so many movies and shows with the same theme, I don't know. Ben Affleck fails to transition from ""good guy"" to ""bad guy"" and back. He's just too bland to be either liked or disliked. When the major reveal happens (sometime in the middle), you kind of already know this was going to happen. Maybe not exactly THAT, but definitely something like that. And then it just abandons any common sense, rolls down the hill, hits a cow, and ends with a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>I'd say that whether you enjoy this movie will depend on your expectations. If you expect something really clever, don't bother. On the other hand, if you watch it with an empty head and forget about things like logic, you might be entertained... unless you fall asleep. And oh yes, seeing Ben Affleck's junk may cause nightmares, so beware."

I think I guessed the twist within 5 minutes and wasted an inordinate amount of time to find out I was right and this was p*sh. <br/><br/>From the pouring red wine on her pants to cry rape, being released from hospital after murdering a man without giving any full explanation and the fact the husband who she tried to frame wheeled her back into the house with the aid of the FBI who all of a sudden were powerless but knew she was guilty . . . . It was an insult to intelligence.<br/><br/>A few shocking scenes that failed to shock really do not make up for the couple of hours I've lost from my life."
"mrbobke","2","3","6","22 February 2015"," Im still angry...
","I knew very little about this movie going in, other than it had good reviews and a solid cast. However, I felt almost immediately that there was something amiss, that this was going to be one of those soulless Hollywood movies that is so transparently commercial and sloppy that I almost feel like even the director was saying to himself ""This is pretty weak stuff, but the masses will still eat it"". Its formulaic drivel for the lowest common denominator. Just have a look at the list of goofs to see how many holes there were in this numb-nut of a movie.<br/><br/>I know this sounds arrogant, and Im sorry for that, but what are you people smoking on here that you would give this anything but a panning? Can you really say with any honesty that:<br/><br/>1. You cared in the slightest about any of the one-dimensional characters? <br/><br/>2. the way the media was portrayed was realistic in the slightest? <br/><br/>3. it was believable that all these locals would spontaneously band together to pray for someone who was completely out of view in the community up to that point?<br/><br/>4. any of the acting was at all believable? Academy award nomination for the Pike robot? <br/><br/>OK, maybe the cat was convincing, but you could also tell it was medicated to the hilt to prevent it running away from such an embarrassment...<br/><br/>5. the 'semi-foreboding' music that drones on didn't get on your nerves after a while?<br/><br/>6. the whole thing didn't go on way too long, while at the same time not even giving a feeling of the passing of time in the movie itself? For example, the Pike character drops off the grid, becomes a plain girl with a black eye eating junk food, then is back being miss perfect with Doogie Howser MD all within 20 minutes?<br/><br/>I could go on, but I need to go watch some paint dry now to get my intellect going again. IMDb needs some way to detect if people actually have a clue and add this into their rating algorithm. It would have prevented me from this lobotomization."

","You couldn't get two worse actors or performances if you tried. This movie is so flat it puts you to sleep within 25 minutes.<br/><br/>The book was pretty good, but BA has to be the worst big name actor around, and the story was dumbed down and flattened by the reading of the diary and horrible narration.<br/><br/>The role of the invasive parents was played down, as was their mind control of childhood Amy - probably the best part of the book was the using and controlling parents, hardly played in the movie.<br/><br/>The book evoked emotion, the movie and the actors did not.<br/><br/>I can not understand how this was a popular movie, and the nominations for awards are laughable. Contrast the emotions in this ""Popular"" movie to under-appreciated movies such as ""The Station Agent,"" or ""Reign Over Me"", both rated much lower but far superior movies."
"illinoisparkie","3","3","6","17 February 2015"," Disappointing
","Many other reviewers have documented the holes in the plot, so I won't bother going over those. But I do want to add a few comments:<br/><br/>1. Why do directors have to make it so hard to understand what the actors are saying? The sequences where Nick and Amy meet and get to know each other, in particular, are covered by the musical score to the point where the dialogue is lost. Maybe the director wants us to listen more intently to what is said but, if so, the technique failed, because I missed a lot of character motivation and plot points.<br/><br/>2. The whole manipulative and exploitive media angle has been used to death in a host of other movies and television. Hey, look...an actress doing a really good imitation of Nancy Grace. Likewise for the Johnnie Cochran impression by Tyler Perry. Ho hum.<br/><br/>3. Amy pulls into her driveway, stumbles out covered in blood, and collapses in Nick's arms (nice ""dip"", Amy) for the assembled multitude. When did this mystery/drama turn into a comedy?<br/><br/>I give the movie 3 stars out of 10, one for each of the actresses portraying the lead detective and Nick's sister (the only sympathetic characters in the story) and one for the Desi's vacation home in the woods (very impressive!). Otherwise, the movie was overly long and ""icky""."

","More like a list of things wrong with this film. Probably the most disappointed I've ever felt after watching a film. It's only February, but I'd be surprised if I saw a worse film this year. The amount of plot holes actually annoyed me. Amy's character wasn't at all consistent. So much doesn't make sense. You feel nothing for the characters for the most part. Some bad casting choices were made. Is that really how the case would be portrayed on television? Did Amy really think that her final plan made any sense and wouldn't be found out. She's supposed to be both intelligent and meticulous. Leaving hospital covered in blood. The cameras in the home."

","Yes this movie is stunning, thrilling and generates interest at every point of plot. The actors have done a great job depicting the deep and smooth conversation book writers use. It is absolutely delight to watch until the end, where you are starved of any concrete outcome. We may say this movie does not have a popular ending which if it had, it would have satisfied a larger audience and I would have given 10.<br/><br/>However it is still appealing if we consider that not all stories should have victorious endings and a change or surprise is good.<br/><br/>Also it can be compared to faults humans make in real life. The public image improvement shown with Nick's(Ben Affleck) character is comparable to what we see in today's media dominated world.<br/><br/>Very few movies have bound me so well to the story as this movie. I have not read the novel and only know the storyline of the movie."

","I hated the book. In the end, it became decrepit but at the beginning, it was evident that the person who made it desperately wanted to seem erudite. Well, a billion purchases by other people later...<br/><br/>This film is not poorly made, but it's built on a castle of pap (i.e. the book) and as such, it's not translated badly. Where Fincher succeeds, is about halfway through the film, where a specter comes into play; that scene's good. The rest of the semi-good bits (i.e. cinematography, photo, glossy scenes, soundtrack) are there as well, but I loathed Affleck's acting and I didn't really care about any of the actors. I tried not to dislike the film; I went in with an open heard.<br/><br/>This is a crock of pap. Go see George Sluizer's ""The Vanishing"" instead."

The acting in this film was so incredibly dreadful that it allowed me to only waste ten minutes of my time, instead of the two or so hours the film is. That fact alone is probably the only upside. Listen to the people who know what they are talking about when they say not to waste your time.Airheads made this popular; And if you choose to be a waste of human intelligence go ahead and watch this film and rate it up. You are only adding to the downfall of commendable cinema. It's not like that matters. <br/><br/>Those of you who appreciate films for all the facets that they should be appreciated for, please encourage everyone to try and live to a higher standard.

","It's possible that it's just not for me or maybe I came with too much expectations but I still believe that it's not a good movie and even worse as a book. I love watching movies and I love reading and mostly I can enjoy anything even if it's not great, however this time it was pure torment. I'll try to explain why I think it's bad. Personally I really don't care about plot holes (not only in this movie but ever); the writer is allowed his creative freedom and I am willing to suspend my disbelief indefinitely. Yet, the problem here is how the movie is perceived, if people expect to watch a suspense movie then the really major plot holes are hard to swallow. A detective story needs some kind of logical progression otherwise it's a fantasy and this movie was advertised as a detective story so I understand the viewers discontent from that standpoint. But let us assume that it's not a suspense/detective story/thriller and the plot holes are there to further enrich the idea of the absurdity of our existence. So it's a psychological drama or a dark satire or whatever you want to call it. In that case it has two possible main subjects: the exploration of the dark side of relationships or the idea of false perceptions and multiple layers of the truth. There is nothing new about these subjects, but there are really no new subjects, there are only new and provoking ways to explore a subject. This film fails to provide them. First of all, the whole story of their meeting and their courtship is painfully banal and boring. After a while I tried to convince myself that it's a satire of all this romantic movies where the cool guy meets the incredibly cool girl and they instantly connect. But a satire demands to be a piercing and sharp entertainment, if it's as boring as the original then it's pointless. The movie also never truly explores the human nature. It does suggest that nothing is as it seems and that everyone has an alter ego but accomplishes it barely on a Hallmark movie level. No one of the characters evokes any emotion from the viewer; either dislike, affection or attachment of any sort. They just drift from scene to scene as they try to illustrate that marriage is complex at best and people generally are dreadful creatures. Oh, and they also try to shock us once in a while with sliced throats during sex and anal relations with wine bottles. These scenes evoked nothing in me but pure revulsion. In fact, I wouldn't have cared if the movie ended with a mass murder and suicide, with no survivals except for the cat. I really loved the cat. I think I identify with the cat. Similar to the cat, I also felt like I am randomly placed into weird scenes while I am trying to make any sense, whilst all I feel is apathy."

","I am a huge fan of Fincher's work and would I was engrossed in this story until I started tallying all the moments in the plot that defies all logic and plausible story telling. I am capable of suspending disbelief for the sake of a good story with unexpected twists but the twist in this story comes so early that the viewer can spend the next hour pulling apart everything that is wrong AND everything that goes wrong with the plot from that point on. My first signs that the movie was in trouble were when a nation wide search is conducted a missing woman wouldn't consider a better make over? Maybe black hair? just an idea. As for killing her rich stalker ? This is where the story goes from OK to ridiculous. Camera footage in the house ,alibi, the diary?.. it felt like the last 30 mins was supposed to be 1.5hrs and they shortened the movie and expected us to just assume that checks were done by the FBI etc. A sign of good story is where you read IMDb goofs and go ""hey I didn't notice that "" not finding yourself constantly saying to yourself ""hey...that would NEVER happen"". The acting was good but this film would have been a lot better if it gave you a greater reason to hate the husband to justify an elaborate escape other than ""oh..I'm a sociopath""and it ended with his arrest and her driving into the sunset. Disappointed"
"theblackscythe","10","6","16","14 October 2014"," Probably the best film of the year. A masterpiece.
","I must point out here that I have not read the original source novel, also I will be extremely careful to avoid any spoilers as this film MUST NOT be spoiled. Aside from that, I feel totally confident in declaring this as the best film I have seen all year. Fincher has crafted one of the all time great thrillers, and has done so in an aggressive and brutal fashion. Although its premature to call it a career best, its fair to say that this film deserves to be in contention for that honor at least.<br/><br/>Firstly, the acting is stellar. I demand an Oscar for Rosamund Pike, for giving the best performance I have seen all year. I will not describe why it is so remarkable, as it is a clue to some of the film's reveals, however you will be shocked suffice to say. Affleck is perfectly cast and works well, playing to his strengths and probably giving the performance of his career. In the supporting cast, Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens are great and I hope they receive more work in the future, possibly even some high profile starring roles. However, better still is Tyler Perry, delivering a shockingly hilarious and fitting performance, showcasing impeccable comic timing and oozing personality in every scene. The film has a cast for the ages, everybody works well and every scene raises the bar further into the stratosphere.<br/><br/>The screenplay is excellent, written by the writer of the book (Gillian Flynn) and containing all the delicacy and detail of a great novel. However with enough of an adaptation to feel naturalistic, its not 2 and half hours of having a novel read out to you, as it easily could have been. It gives the actors all the space and material to show their skill and presence on screen and has a twisted plot line worthy of Fincher.<br/><br/>The cinematography is wonderful. It is shot with the detail and precision of a master, a title which Fincher has more than earned by this stage. Well balanced lighting, a fitting palette, it truly looks perfect. The set design is also perfectly planned and well constructed, encouraging you to look for even the slightest clues in Fincher/Flynn's warped minds. <br/><br/>Overall, I implore you to watch this brutal and devilishly twisted little number from one of the best collaborations in modern cinema. If Flynn writes every Fincher film in the future, with Pike as the star, then I'd be overjoyed."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","16","1 October 2014"," Worthy Fincher
","I suspect a lot of people watching this movie, unlike me, have read the book. But to those who haven't it is very difficult to say anything about the movie without some sort of spoiler. With the spoiler warning, I'll risk this: the main plot twist is revealed halfway thought the movie, which actually makes it even more absorbing to watch! Even to those with a vague awareness of the movie, it is probably understood that the movie is about a missing wife, with all kinds of suspicious circumstantial evidences. Deeper, however, it is a study of human nature, warped psychology, love and marriage, the ""barbarous multitude"" (quoting The Bard), the manipulating media, and probably some more.<br/><br/>As my summary line suggests, this movie is worthy of David Fincher. ""Gone girl"" is not quite as dark as the auteur's earlier work such as ""Se7en"", ""Fight club"" and ""Zodiac"". There are even some rather wittily funny moments. But it is also disturbingly chilling when it chooses to be.<br/><br/>Finally, the performances of Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are Oscar-nomination worthy, especially hers. The two-and-a-half hour will be well spent if you enjoy an intelligent thriller that is absolutely masterfully shot. The film editing alone is something to behold!"
"TheMarwood","7","5","13","17 December 2014"," The unreliable narrator
","This lurid tale told from an unreliable narrator, has a solid 'did he? didn't he' hook - a man's wife goes missing and he becomes the target of public scrutiny when he becomes the prime suspect. Fincher classes up this trashy story and it's both a strength and a weakness, as he wisely never lets this become over the top sordid garbage, but also never allows this to be as fun when it wallows in its sleazy storytelling. Even still, the story is so emotionally cold and misanthropic, that there's fun aplenty from how twisted and mean Gone Girl becomes. Ben Affleck does good work, under playing his role, while convincingly carrying the weight of the stress of his bizarre situation. Tyler Perry's dialogue delivery as a high priced lawyer is sharp and witty and pulled off with his stunt casting. Rosamund Pike plays our Gone Girl who you will most likely not forget for quite some time. Gone Girl is a clever film, with an ending that falls a little too easily into place, but it's always entertaining and definitely worth recommending."
"Dr_Sagan","Null","5","13","14 December 2014"," Good thriller. Not a #250 Best, but interesting nevertheless.
","I'm always skeptical about movies that last more than 2 hours. If it's not a blockbuster kind of film, the chances are that it will be boring. I saw yesterday ""The equalizer"" with Denzel Washington (2:12 duration) and it was boring as hell.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough ""Gone Girl"" in its almost 2 and a half hours it's far from boring. I dare to say that it was really interesting until the end, and that says a lot.<br/><br/>So if you want my quick recommendation: Go see it.<br/><br/>I'm not a Ben Affleck fan but he is good in this. In my opinion he is no cut to play heroes. He is more like a regular Joe, with human weaknesses, so this role suits him. Rosamund Pike looks crazy enough, ""trapped in her own world"" so she's a good cast too. Same goes with the rest of the cast with the exception maybe of Neil Patrick Harris.<br/><br/>The direction is not boring and keep you interested through its whole length. Some randomly added flashbacks help the narration, and are not confusing as in some other films.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie is great. It's a thriller that it can go both ways (and maybe even follow a ...third option).<br/><br/>The music score is more like a music pad of electronic music (made by synthesizers and not an orchestra), and it is present all the time adding to the mystery.<br/><br/>The movie it's not only about thrills. There is some substance too. About marriages, about expectations, about the world of electronic media, about how your public image can affect your life nowadays.<br/><br/>Oh. And you get to see a glimpse of Affleck's ""average"" member (if you care, which I seriously doubt) in a shower scene, obviously made as a publicity stunt. <br/><br/>Overall: Recommended as a good solid thriller. Good, but certainly not among the 100 best of all time, like IMDb rating suggests."

","I stepped away from horror for a few hours on Saturday to see this. I wasn't particularly eager to see it, but the reviews were too good for me to skip. I must say, it's amazing. I always say that Fincher is a good director, but he's completely dependent on the material he's given. Fortunately, the material here (a novel by Gillian Flynn, with a screenplay written by her) is excellent, and Fincher paces it beautifully. Also backing it up wonderfully is another great score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The story shouldn't be gone into too much - though I knew the two major twists and still followed along with giddy enjoyment to every moment - but it opens with unhappy husband Ben Affleck discovering that his wife, Rosamund Pike, has gone missing. Evidence points heavily towards him, but he insists of his innocence. Soon the whole world seems against him. My favorite part of the film was the satire of the 24 hour news media. Missi Pyle is great as a loathsome TV news host obviously based on Nancy Grace. There are tons of excellent supporting performances, including Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, Tyler Perry (yes, he's good!), Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Fugit, Casey Wilson and Emily Ratajkowski amongst others. My second favorite film of 2014 so far and Fincher's best work ever."

Absolute terrible choice of actors overall. There was so much lack of emotion and tone that this ruined the movie alone. As a side note, the actress who played Margo did a poor job too. In the book, these characters are lively with high emotion, taking the reader on a psychological roller coaster ride. The movie almost put me to sleep.

Add a chronically peeved face throughout and you have it.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike did her best and NPH vied up there with BA for the stiffest acting job ever.<br/><br/>The script didn't help, the only believable performance was from Boney the cop who rang true.<br/><br/>The plot fell apart on far too many levels to account for here. The video cams at Desi's house only ran at convenient times, Amy's blood was not cleaned up at the hospital, etc.<br/><br/>Awful. 1/10"

","Daym! What a movie! Love the way the thrill goes on for the first hour of the movie!

Scenes should have been cut between but OVERALL it was a great movie! The thrill of finding the murderer should have gone on ! right till the end of the movie!

","I'll keep it short here, as I believe a longer review would be useless to those who've seen the movie already and too much of a spoiler for those who haven't. <br/><br/>The atmosphere, the twists, the direction of the whole movie is intriguing, catchy and suggesting a climax of events and epiphanies which could have made it a cool thriller. But all is spoiled by absolutely incredible character profiles, implausible dialogs and exchanges between characters; the role of the police through their dialogs is absurd, an offense to the dignity of the uniform (save for the main policewoman, but also here only 50% decent). The plot doesn't hold, too many pieces of both sides of the story are good enough for a kindergarten detective, not for a bright audience. Everything, all characters, all scenes, all parts of the story suffer the same pathology. The development of the profiles of the main characters throughout the movie is approximate and in no way convincing. NO SPOILER, but the ending too is... well, not an ending. And I do like ""not endings"", if they let you linger in your inner dilemmas, but here it's just.. missing! OK, you want to sell it as a way to let the audience continue analyzing and speculating about it, fine, but this is no Basic Instinct nor anything close, here we're just talking The Hunger Games I without the II, III and IV. <br/><br/>Such a disappointment."

","""Gone Girl"" is so smoothly, austerely-filmed and staged and acted, a less-seasoned moviegoer is apt to come away from it with nothing but admiration and praise (hence the many fine reviews the film has received from not only the public but also by professional movie critics). An upscale married couple in New York City hits a financial bump and ends up living with the husband's family in Missouri (in an equally beautiful home, by the way). After a few years, with the relatives dead, the couple's marriage hits a bump as well, and before long the wife is missing, their glass table is shattered and police find a mopped-up bloodbath in the kitchen. Adapting her own novel, screenwriter Gillian Flynn sets up an intriguing first-half, with the benumbed (and unfaithful) husband at first courted and then reviled by the ever-present media. But the second and third acts of the picture are where it runs into trouble, setting up plot-points and then either ignoring or stumbling over those plot-points. The final scenes (which are dragged out interminably by director David Fincher) are so static and unconvincing as to be ridiculous, mitigating his fine work in presenting this lurid tale (the picture ends up being all about presentation and little else). The central couple (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are thoroughly unlikable, detestable people--and the supporting characters, with the exception of a dry female police detective (Kim Dickens) and Affleck's twin sister (Carrie Coon), are equally appalling. There is really nothing in ""Gone Girl"" to engage our interest except for Fincher's jagged, nasty way in telling a juicy story, but here the juice leaks out early. ** from ****"
"rauh-georg","5","4","10","12 December 2014"," Very Overrated Movie That Can Only Be Enjoyed If You Suspend Common Sense and Logic
","I went into this movie with high hopes based on the various stellar reviews - but now I see myself baffled how this movie could get such good ratings.<br/><br/>The plot is illogical and doesn't make any sense. I found myself getting turned off by the movie 10 minutes in since I tried to see sense and explain what was unfolding on screen.<br/><br/>I save yourself from mentioning the numerous plot holes others already listed here in reviews. Just my own here: * No one, no police anywhere would start a missing person investigation if a person would only be missing for 24 hours. I am no cop, but I know that police is usually allowing some reasonable time before such an investigation starts.<br/><br/>* In the movie there is a media spectacle going on about missing Amy after she is missing for a day. I am still puzzled WHY they would make a media spectacle UNLESS Amy was a big-shot celebrity, royality, politician etc. I think the movie somewhere mentions she is a writer, but I was entirely turned off by this since I could simply not understand why there would be media-coverage for ""some missing person"", plus the fact (see above) that such an investigation would not start that early.<br/><br/>* What awesome planning and foresight: On the alleged ""day one of her missing"" (repeat: DAY ONE!) they already had a press conference with relatives etc. present. Not only that, on day one they already had a working website dedicated to her appearance and a 1-800 number for people to call in clues. Who should buy that? I can't. Who wrote that script? A 10 year old? * At the end she murders one of her early ex and comes home, soaked in blood. End of story. No one would ask what happens? No one would maybe doubt her story? SHE SLASHED HIS THROAT for god's sake.<br/><br/>This movie and the plot as a whole and in detail is so far from reality that I had problems enjoying the movie. Others called it rightfully a ""lifetime movie on a big budget"" - and this is exactly what it is. With the difference that some afternoon lifetime movies probably have a better and more well-thought-out plot than this.<br/><br/>Some people mention ""plot twists"" ..problem only, there were none. There were no surprising elements in that movie, in fact I was hugely disappointed when it was ""revealed"" that it was her who staged all this in the middle of the movie. From there, everything was clear. NO MYSTERY whatsoever, no exciting plot twists etc.<br/><br/>I am baffled since I know Se7ven, one of my wife's fav. movies which is 1000x more credible and mysterious...THIS is just a bad $0.50 supermarket novel script made into a movie, entirely wasted talent, a trashy movie which could have been MUCH better with a good and plausible script."
"Jared_Andrews","9","4","10","1 November 2014"," Another Fincher Masterpiece
","The movie opens with a shot of the back of his wife's head as Ben Affleck's (Nick Dunne) voice-over describes how he would like to crack open her skull to let everything inside pour out to be examined.<br/><br/>This narration perfectly sets up the rest of the movie by immediately implanting the possibility in our minds that Nick may have actually killed his wife. At dawn of July 5 (Nick and Amy's 5 year anniversary) Nick stands at the end of his driveway with a thoughtful expression containing an ambivalent combination of content and uncertainty—exactly the way we might expect a man to look if he had just killed his wife. Three minutes into the film and I am already hooked. <br/><br/>A short while later Nick drives to a bar to chat with his sister with whom he owns the bar. He orders bourbon at 10am. Clearly something is weighing heavily on his mind and clearly that something involves his wife. Through flashbacks we are introduced to Nick and Amy and their seemingly charming yet complicated relationship. A couple hours later Nick discovers broken glass and turned over furniture in the living room. His wife is gone.<br/><br/>The police arrive and run a sweep of the house and question Nick at the station. The next day the story explodes, launching a neighborhood search for the missing girl. Throughout every moment since the movie began, Nick's behavior has fueled possibility that he killed his wife. He appears aloof, distant and, frankly, unlikable. Nick cooperates and attempts to show a good face in public, but clearly many believe him to be guilty. The growing pile of evidence does nothing to erase the suspicion.<br/><br/>Media coverage of the story continues to grow. Soon day time talk shows rant about Nick and imply his guilt. One talking head even purports an ignorant and hasty diagnosis of Nick as a sociopath. Eventually Nick is forced to hire a defense attorney as he fights to prove his innocence.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is classic David Fincher filmmaking. The characters are all gritty, flawed. There are no heroes, just certain individuals who are less wicked than others. The lighting matches the morbid mood, and the only smile cracked in the entire movie is one by Nick in a foolishly taken picture with an attractive female at the search meeting. In spite of the perpetually solemn disposition of the characters, the dialogue adroitly sprinkles in just the perfect amount of dark humor to prevent audience depression. The music elevates the suspense and intensity of every crucial scene, yielding a seamless transition of the story from page to screen. Gillian Flynn should be proud.<br/><br/>While the filmmaking by Fincher and story writing by Flynn tower above all else, the acting should not be overlooked. Affleck managed to turn in a respectable performance as the glum and annoyed husband-murder suspect. Rosamund Pike was remarkable in role. I am amazed that she has not had more standout performances, but those opportunities should come rolling in after filmmakers witness her marvelous work here.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is simply spectacular. I have but one complaint. *MAJOR SPOILER ALERT* Near the end of the film, there is a scene in which Amy is laying in a hospital bed as she recounts the details of her recent rape and escape to a room full of police and hospital staff. Completely ridiculous. I could not believe it as it was happening. I could hardly bare to look at the screen. Luckily, the final scene rolled only moments later: a return to the opening. Nick is looking at the back of his wife's head, continuing his narration. Now we understand exactly how Nick came to ponder those unthinkable thoughts about his wife. *END OF SPOILER* Final verdict: 8.5 out of 10."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","7","22","4 October 2014"," Another David Fincher winner and one of the year's best
","David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"celestine-schmidt","10","5","14","27 October 2014"," Gone Girl, a really good movie !
","The movie I'm going to talk about is Gone Girl, a thriller by David Fincher. The leading actors are Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Ben and Rosamund play the characters of Nick and Amy. First they are described like if they were a perfect couple, but the spectator realize quickly that everything isn't as simple as it seems. In the search of the truth to find back Amy who's missing, you discover that anybody can fake it  I enjoy a lot this movie. Usually I am not mad about thriller movie but this one is really gripping ! The movie isn't all about the investigation. Indeed, it takes place in a small town in the United States of America and gives a real criticism of the actual society like in the scene where a women comes not for give some help with the investigation to find back Amy but just to take a selfie with the husband's missing girl and post it on Facebook ! In addition, there are a lot of flash back and you only understand the all story at the end of the movie. The end is really unexpected and well introduced in the film. That's why, I recommend this movie to everybody ! However after have seen this movie, you may have some doubts about the people who are around you. Maybe you should avoid watching this film if you're paranoid I hope you'll love this movie as much as I had :)"
"hfclement","7","5","14","20 October 2014"," I will never get married.
","David Fincher is officially my favorite director. <br/><br/>Several of his films would make it into my lists of my personal favorite movies; Fight Club, Zodiac, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Social Network, and now Gone Girl. <br/><br/>I used to say, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was the best mystery movie I've seen in I don't know how long."" That title now goes to this film. After just watching it for the second time since opening night, I believe this is Fincher's finest film. <br/><br/>One of the things that makes David Fincher such an enjoyable director is his attention to detail, it makes the littlest differences so significant and boy is this man attentive to the most minute aspect of every single shot. I don't think I saw a single continuity error. <br/><br/>Every actors performance in this film will go down to be a highlight of their career. Including Tyler Perry, who I was pleasantly shocked to see in an actual good role with equally good acting. <br/><br/>As per usual, Trent Reznor brings an absolutely stunning soundtrack to the theater, helping hand in hand with the director to make some of the most intense scenes I have ever seen. I don't remember the last time my jaw completely dropped and stayed like that for over a minute. <br/><br/>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is my #4 personal favorite movie of all time; but I am more than pleasantly surprised to say that Gone Girl is Fincher's finest and most unexpectedly exhilarating film to date. <br/><br/>What more can I say- The guy really knows how to direct a mystery thriller."

Amy (Rosamund Pike) may be convincing as a psychopath, but fails as a genius. Her plans work only because everybody around her seems to be stupid.<br/><br/>Affleck gives a neutral performance. Perry's OK; he brings welcomed change of pace and humor (however cliché it may be). Carrie Coon is good. She did the best she could with the material.<br/><br/>When I used the word misogynist, it's not because a woman is portrayed as a psychopath.

Rosamund Pike, the best thing about this movie, her beauty and great acting ability grabs your attention, the quintessential English rose. The third quarter, the movie gets going, a few twists here and there. Then all of a sudden the end credits start. I know a lot of people loved this. Not my cup of tea.

For most reviewers, that's good enough. Had it followed any of its logical conclusions to a satisfying ending I'd probably be giving Gone Girl an 8 or 9. But there's no satisfying ending, or much of an ending at all. It's hard to describe without spoiling the movie. Let's just say the writer made efforts to make sure the book (and now movie) had an original ending instead of an complete story arc or having the characters act logical.<br/><br/>My friend and I both left the movie feeling depressed and ripped off. 2.5 hours is a lot of time to invest without a complete story arc."

","It's a brilliant film and one of the most cynical films made on marriage.<br/><br/>Marriage is one of the most toughest bonds of human race. To sustain that thread despite all it's finesse and yet it's shambles, there is always an inherent fear that a small knife may cut the whole thread. Marriage is one of the finest threads that was ever made, Now to go to any extent in marriage is also possible, but does any sane marriage involve self-murder, no and I can say that's almost impossible. All married ones beware before you watch this and those anticipating marriage, think again of the one whom you are going to marry. Marriage or rather a relationship with the person we love is going to thought through after seeing this in a theater, I bet you.<br/><br/>Impossible is nothing for this director David Fincher who has made mind boggling films like FIGHT CLUB. He turns a simple story head on, adds a flavor that's so spicy that you may love it or hate but you just can't ignore it. He gives similar treatment to this film. <br/><br/>You start understanding and decoding the story, it becomes something and then after few minutes if you think you have almost sorted it out, then again it transpires into something else. It's a tough one to call and I can only say, this is mind boggling stuff. Fincher is one of the few directors who can direct the film in a way that is deeply interesting and yet there are many layers involved into it. <br/><br/>This is a very layered movie, like an onion as the layers are peeled, we seem to get to the core, but this is something more surprising, the moment we think we got it, we would have lost it. It tests the intelligence of the viewer and that's how this film has won hearts. <br/><br/>I can safely say, this is one of the very intelligent movies that has come in recent times. I have not seen much of Rosamund Pike who plays Amy Dunne in this film but she is the true protagonist who drove the story all by herself. Just her portrayal as Amy has made her one of the finest actresses of this year. The rest of the cast has done a good job too.<br/><br/>A 4/5 for a must watch film and I request this has to be seen in theaters, let the naked truth be told brutally if need be."

It has the vibe of the 1992 film and does an excellent job of keeping the viewer following the story as a bystander from the film. When events unfold the audience is lead to have the view point of those watching the story on the news. You rarely have time to think ahead as the film has so much action and information relayed in the present.<br/><br/>The film follows Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) as he discovers that his wife is missing and the resulting media attention to the disappearance. As more and more clues turn up events cause the viewer to question the husbands role in his wife's (Rosamund Pike) disappearance. <br/><br/>This story is expertly written to keep the audience on their toes throughout the entire film. David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club) directs the film to perfection. He creates an atmosphere of suspense and doubt that grips the viewer and never lets go. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry give great performances that show the versatility of their acting skills. Ben Affleck gives another top notch performance to add to the list of his recent hits while Rosamund Pike steals the show.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an intelligent thriller that views like you are reading a book make sure to add Gone Girl to your list.

It felt like it was stretched just so it could be a feature length movie.<br/><br/>I hated all the characters. No one was really good, and no one was completely evil (the wife stole the cake though). Only 3 characters I even kinda liked: The sister GO (such a dumb nickname), the lawyer guy the husband gets, because he is refreshing and funny from this dumb movie, and the female cop (she is the smartest person in the film, and she is of average intelligence) <br/><br/>There was excessive sexual and language. I understand sex is natural part of life and of story, and I get language helps with getting across emotions of characters, but it felt they were using both to hold the movie together at times, and that isn't right.<br/><br/>It was a horrible thriller. When the wife goes bye bye no one who is at ALL used to mystery and thrillers expects him to be the bad guy. Why? He is the very 1st person you think would do it! And unless they are being very very very smart and do a heck of a good story tell (and this isn't), then it won't be the first person. The entire rest of the movie is ""thriller"" and ""suspense"" in what happens between husband and wife. The husband says a few smart things in public and totally is the definition of stupid moron otherwise. The wife just is pissy or wanting to come up with ideas and plans to hide her actions as if she were 15.<br/><br/>The ending? Boring. No one wins, no ones loses...It felt like she went on a heck of a holiday for a while, killing people and just goofing off, then coming back to a loving husband. All the while the husband was a stupid jerk who seemed to make every wrong choice, and never did anything.<br/><br/>It was rather interesting and then it turned into stupid, then creepy, then stupid AND creepy, all the while being boring...what the heck?<br/><br/>PS what was with the baby thing? Did she steal his semen or something for him to live with her for 18 years? Also, why did she even want him? She hated him!<br/><br/>Whatever, I'm just glad the movie is over.

","In doing research for the character of Nick Dunne, Ben Affleck has said that he looked at men who have been accused/convicted of murdering their wives. One of the men researched was Scott Peterson. <br/><br/>The interesting part is that this film is very similar to the Scott Peterson case. Below is a list of similarities:<br/><br/>1. Nick Dunne/Scott Peterson are accused of murdering their pregnant wives. 2. Both were having extramarital affairs. 3. Both were crucified in the media by the likes of Nancy Grace/Ellen Abbott. 4. Both were accused of cleaning up a bloody murder scene in a kitchen with bleach. 5. Both were missing the day of the disappearance and their alibis put them alone near water. 6. Nick is from North Carthage, Missouri. Scott Peterson is from Modesto in Northern California. 7. Both men are excused of lacking emotion and/or empathy. 8. Amy Elliot Dunne suggests committing suicide in water weighing her body down with rocks so her corpse would eventually wash up and be found. Laci Peterson's body was found washed up and had been weighted down with cement blocks. 9. Like the character of Amy, Laci was held up on a media pedestal. She was considered the All American wife, mother, sister, daughter and friend. 10. One of the items purchased on Nick's credit card was expensive golf clubs. Scott Peterson was arrested while playing golf. 11. Both Nick and Scott's families believe in their innocence and help fund their defense. 12. Both are tried and convicted in/by the media. 13. Both are death penalty cases. 14. Both cases happen near or on national holidays. The Peterson case happened on Christmas Eve while the Dunne case was the day after the 4th of July. 15. Scott Peterson has an affair with Amber Frey. Nick Dunne with Andie Fitzgerald. Both have the initials A.F. Both are media whores. 16. Both men allow themselves to be interviewed on television and admit to an affair not to murder. ""I did not kill my wife"". 17. Ben Affleck resembles Scott Peterson in hair color, eye color, weight and height as well as casual attire that includes baseball caps. 18. The motive for murder in both cases is based on the desire of Nick and Scott's to start a new life with the mistress, Andie/Amber. This is highly suspect. 19. Scott and Laci Peterson had celebrated their 5th wedding anniversary on August 9th 2002. Nick and Amy we're celebrating their 5th anniversary as well. <br/><br/>There are so many similarities it is hard to list them all. The only question that remains is where did the idea for this story come from?"

"Screen_Blitz","8","3","7","18 February 2015"," Strong and riveting thriller with a twist
","Ben Affleck has been a great actor in recent years and I was glad to see him in this movie. Gone Girl was an intense, powerful but engaging movie that leaves you breathless at times. The movie however is not perfect or even near perfect, it has its flaws. At various points, the movie was very monotoned and moved as slow as a snail. There are also a few questions that are left unanswered, mainly dealing with the character Amy and her motives. Then there were several scenes that didn't seem relevant to the plot. On the other hand, the movie had some positive factors.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's acting was pretty great, the best of his performances I've seen since Good Will Hunting. Rosamund Pike's performance was pretty good too. However, the best aspect of the movie was not the performances but the plot twists. Around halfway through the film, you learn shocking truths about some of the characters that would make your jaw drop. If you ask me, I was caught off guard by some of these characters. I couldn't tell whether they were innocent or bad but thats the beauty of the characters.<br/><br/>Now I've never read the book so I don't know how good the book is compared to the movie. Overall, the movie is very worth watching, especially if you are a Ben Affleck fan."
"bob-rutzel-1","3","3","7","11 February 2015"," Too Drawn-out and should have stayed a book
","On the morning of his 5th wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home from his bar to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing and the house looked like that there was a struggle and there is blood that was cleaned up. He calls the Police and they sympathize for a while, but later they feel that Nick knows more than he is telling. Did he kill his wife? He claims not. <br/><br/>I suppose the book was pretty good, this movie not so much. The story had a sort of beginning, and a middle where it stayed for most of the time, too long a time; and although, we in the audience, believed that Nick had nothing to do with Amy's disappearance we couldn't help but get bored with everything as this was really dragged out. The ending is too bizarre to go into at this point. <br/><br/>As the police investigate, they find more clues to show that Nick did kill his wife, but everything is circumstantial as there is no body. The police entertain the prospect that Amy was kidnapped and still hold Nick as a person of interest. Nick hires celebrity lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) who believes Nick is completely innocent. Nick wants to tell the police that everything looks like he was set up but Tyler Perry won't allow this at the moment. <br/><br/>This movie may have had better intrigue and impact if it was much shorter. I am sure the book had erotic moments as we do see some sex scenes, but these scenes were not at all erotic. Again, maybe the book was better, this movie, not so much. Also, there is sexual language, at times, that use the C word along with other f-bombs. <br/><br/>The movie does go into what actually happened and this gets dragged out too. We keep asking when will all this come to some conclusion? Hey, we can't stay up all night with this the way it is going. We need our sleep. We come to our conclusion that this should have stayed a book. <br/><br/>When we learn everything there is to know we finally get to the ending, which, of course, is dragged out too. It is bizarre and maybe the director or writer was trying to make statements about marriage and the reasons many stay together. You can figure this out and debate it among yourselves. <br/><br/>Our conclusion: too drawn-out and should have stayed a book. The acting was okay, and the story may have had better impact if the movie was compacted so we didn't lose interest. (3/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, several times Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes."
"alex-ostime","8","3","7","1 February 2015"," Gone Girl is a 2014 American psychological thriller film directed by David Fincher
","Late to jump on the bandwagon, I only recently watched the highly talked about Gone Girl. Hollywood in keeping with trend, decided to cash in on the success of the best selling book and adapt it into a movie. This is somewhat of a hit and miss topic for Hollywood, there's a myriad of injudicious decisions to put novels on the silver screen in order to replicate its success, such as Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code' and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' by Douglas Adams. Conversely, there have been many felicitous film adaptations, from the blockbuster hits of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter to the lower budget more independent films such as American Psycho and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Despite the film garnering so much publicity prior and upon it's release, I was very much in the dark as to what the film was about. The name Gone Girl conjured up chick flick imagery in my mind, I thought it was perhaps a film about a girl finding independence and self- empowerment – how wrong I was. Gone Girl is actually a very somber film, the performance Rosamund Pike gives as a psychotic wife resolute on framing her husband really elevates the film's acclaim. Like many I was captivated by her portrayal, I thought she struck the balance between sanity and psychopathy very well, her character for me alluded to Kevin Spacey's in The Usual Suspect in how she was the devil in disguise. Though it is important not to overlook her co-star Ben Affleck's performance who was also a sound addition to the film. Affleck like a fine wine, seems to be improving as he ages, not to say that he was a particularly bad actor, but his repertoire was hardly an illustrious one. His critical acclaim as a director and performance in Argo suggest he is starting down a more revered path (i certainly hope he doesn't go astray with his role as Batman). Affleck was an appropriate choice for the role as the character he portrays mirrors his life and relationship with media in many ways. On several occasions he's been scrutinised by the public in the past and he manages to draw upon these experiences to convey into his character. One of the things that stood out for me was the film's tone and pacing. Despite being a lengthy film, for the most part of it I was constantly intrigued, each scene builds in suspense from the last leaving the viewer wondering what was going to happen. David Fincher the director, truly is a master of his craft, and dark thrillers are his forte. It seems he has a trademark for creating scenes which leave indelible marks on the viewer (take your pick from Fight Club and Se7en) and in Gone Girl he certainly swung for the fences again with one particular twisted scene. I'm talking about the scene in which Rosamund's character slits the throat of her faithful ex- boyfriend during sex. This moment came completely out of the blue for me, it was so gruesome and graphic, the cinematography and blaring intermittent fog horn sounds made for such an original scene. This scene was near the end of the film, and I was eagerly awaiting the climax, but sadly the ending of Gone Girl really fell short and somewhat detracted from the film in what could have been a masterpiece. Alas, Gone Girl doesn't claim that status but nonetheless it was still a thoroughly enjoyable film and to me certainly another one that David Fincher can add to his port folio of accomplished films."
"schmittdesign","2","3","7","18 January 2015"," Really????
","I wish I had never watched this film!!!<br/><br/>There are earlier, original scripts that, in my opinion, were a basis for this 2014 treatment of a disturbing relationship gone awry with the psychotic female lead who was paired with a male lead that was basically a bastard. <br/><br/>Actually, may I name at least two of this genre that in my opinion are far better and much more intriguing, better written, better produced and hopefully better acted. <br/><br/>Leave Her to Heaven A Place in the Sun<br/><br/>I may be a small minority with this opinion, but I am also not 8 yrs. old."
"Troy_Campbell","9","7","23","3 October 2014"," Not classic Fincher, but still astounding.
","David Fincher's resume is arguably one of the finest among those still working in Hollywood today. Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network and Zodiac are all modern masterpieces; his latest, Gone Girl, is not in that league. Yet, like Panic Room, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, even second-tiered Fincher is fantastic. His direction here is more understated than usual, the Fincher trademarks – sudden outbursts of violence, grimly lingering camera movements, misleading shots – only becoming noticeable in the final act. He wisely allows Gillian Flynn's flip-flopping narrative enough room to breathe (Flynn's script changing direction from her own best selling novel which provides the source material), the multiple perspectives and hidden meanings ensuring you never know who to side with. It's not just plot twists and turns that keep you enthralled though, Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are superb as the complicated married couple; their chemistry-turned- tension is scintillating. Affleck's career turnaround – after three astonishing directorial efforts plus impressive performances in The Town and Argo – is now complete, whilst this will hopefully be the role that finally propels Pike onto the A-list where she belongs. If there's a gripe to be had it's the final few minutes, with a downbeat and ambiguous finale not as satisfying as it could've been. But this is a minor quibble in what is otherwise a captivating, intriguing and beautifully complex motion picture."
"diand_","9","6","19","4 October 2014"," Stories, Roles, Identity
","Fincher is a competent director capable of committing himself to a script and executing it in ways that breathe craftsmanship. Cronenwerth as his cinematographer is known for delivering constant quality (Fight Club). Pike was until now an interesting, but somewhat bland actress. We have a relatively inexperienced writer (married to a lawyer). But what these and other people did here is far more than the sum of the parts; Gone Girl with its cheesy trailer will probably some years from now be considered as a classic, that type of movie where initial reception was average. To fully understand what has been done here might require multiple viewings.<br/><br/>The first main theme of the movie is the battle between word and image. Both are writers, producing stories and words. The female ""writer"" tells her story in voice-over, recreating a supposed past. She uses the spoken word, but imagines using the written word and being a successful writer with illustrated (!) books. She is the archetypical untrusted narrator, weaving stories that might or might not be true. The male writer is more and more overpowered by the image: Being constant on TV having people talk about him, photo shots with supposed fans, observation cameras, etc. This dualism between word and image is mirrored in the detectives: The female acts on words; the male one on images. Note for example that the female detective sometimes wears sunglasses to protect her from the bombardment of images. The whole movie is drained with the male-female dichotomy: marriage as lies, as projections, sex as weapon, power asymmetry.<br/><br/>Once the story is revealed the lawyer is introduced: He knows how to combine words and images in weaving a coherent story, not necessarily the truth as Nick would like to put out. The next level is about a battle for storytelling and stories: role-playing, acting and reality starts to intertwine more and more until the resolution comes. Mirroring current trends in (especially but not exclusively US) society that storytelling and misuse of rhetoric has substituted rational analysis, all enhanced by media-images being communicated: See how astounded Nick and the female detective are when in the end the truth can't be accepted as the stories are accepted as facts.<br/><br/>The female writer creates her own models and starts enacting and staging them; the robbery a piece of reality sipping through. Note also the overuse of shots with bridges, bridging the gap between image and word, between reality and story, between role and personality. It ends with questions about identity, how it is formed and what it means to develop, have or act out one.<br/><br/>There comes another layer as not only the characters in the movie, but also the audience seeing this movie fall victim to this, as also they are lured into the movie and its stories and cannot help but feel almost misused about this. It is an unnerving experience.<br/><br/>There is a trap in this kind of movies: That structure stands in the way of emotions (see for example Medem's Sex and Lucia). Not so here; Fincher is extremely competent in balancing the two. It even starts and ends with this debate (duality of the same shots): Reasoning vs. Emotion, another main theme in the movie.<br/><br/>The effects of all this are astonishing. Please see it twice."
"lesleyharris30","10","5","15","14 October 2014"," Intense and Beautifully Acted, A True Modern Day Masterpiece,
","Gone Girl is an incredible movie with an extremely well written storyline and an absolutely outstanding cast. This film is easily one of the greatest thrillers I have ever seen, some scenes are truly terrifying, mostly because all of the events in this movie could happen in real life, and the built up of suspense is magnificent. Ben Affleck does a fantastic job and this is easily a career highlight for him, and although these movies are nothing alike, it does give me new hope for him playing Batman. The best performance was without a doubt Rosamund Pike, her character easily had the best dialogue, she didn't seem like an easy character to play and she delivered her performance perfectly, she didn't hold back, she was creepy, disturbing and in a very strange way, very likable, I really hope this will change Pike's career for the better, she's shown here just how talented she really is. I think the film is formatted exactly as a thriller should be, starts off very mysterious without giving much away about the main characters and gives us more information throughout, without spoon feeding us, and the further it goes the more thrilling it gets, which is very pleasing. Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris,two actors who I would previously only associate with comedy, actually pull off genuinely great dramatic performances, I was skeptical about them starring in it but they were great, I really hope to see them in more dramas in the future, also a scene involving Harris's character, which I won't spoil, is certainly the movies highlight, a beautiful piece of film making. Beautifully filmed, unpredictable, thrilling, mysterious and filled with twists, David Fincher and everyone involved in this deserves a huge path on the back for making what I consider to be the best movie of 2014, I haven't given a film a perfect ten out of ten rating in a long time, but Gone Girl deserves it, a must see for all moviegoers. <br/><br/>Nick Dunne is suspected of killing his wife Amy after she mysteriously disappears, although several evidence in their house suggests otherwise. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Rosamund Pike"
"kconation","7","5","15","11 October 2014"," decent movie. absolutely over-hyped
","Let me start by saying this is not a terrible movie by any means. However, I am astonished by the number of people who rate this movie 10/10 and put this movie above all of David Fincher's movies. I would say Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo is equal, The Social Network better, Curious Case of Benjamin Button equal if not a little better, Fight Club equal if not better, and Seven better than this movie. <br/><br/>The cinematography of Gone Girl is undeniable good, and Ben Affleck's acting exceptionally well. However, after seeing the movie, the plot is definitely better as a book. It seems that the first half of the movie is rather suspenseful, until it's revealed that the wife is actually alive and has planned her fake death to gain revenge against her husband. From that point on, there are really on two things that can happen: The wife can reappear and Affleck's character be publicly/lawfully cleared of his wife's murder, or she disappears forever and he's sentenced to death. In this case she reappears, and then the movie wraps up in 15-20mins of the wife gaining what seems to be a rather weak upper hand in the marriage, forcing Affleck's character to stay with her even after the wrong doing (all because they're having a kid). <br/><br/>While many believe this is symbolic of today's society, the simple question is.....""How?"". Yes, marriages fail, couples are unfaithful, children are used as leverage etc., but never to this extreme and bizarre extent. The end of this movie leaves those that understand typical plot conclusions asking the question ""That's it?"", because this movie has a relatively unimpressive ending. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Rating this movie 10/10 is a joke. Expectations must be a pretty low at this stage in cinema if this movie is receiving a perfect score. I'm glad I saw this movie, if you'd like to see it obviously have at it. In hindsight I wouldn't pay to see this movie, and I'll probably never watch it again."
"knights_01","9","5","15","11 October 2014"," Do we really fully know anyone?
","Fincher is back after a three year hiatus since 'Girl With a Dragon Tattoo' and for me the wait was worth it. This time around he has adapted Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel of the same name (which I haven't read) and from all reports the movie sticks pretty close to the novel - probably due to the fact that Flynn herself wrote the screenplay.<br/><br/>The film follows the once loved up couple of Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who both lost their jobs in a recent recession and have had to move back to his hometown, where, using Amy's money Nick owns and runs a bar with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon). It is their fifth wedding anniversary and it is fair to say this is one relationship that has come to end of the road. After a call from a friendly neighbour about his cat (which he shows more affection to than his wife), Nick returns home and discovers that something is a miss - namely Amy is missing.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie revolves around the 'media' witch hunt surrounding number one suspect Nick and Nick's quest to clear his name. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) does her best to crack the case while Nick himself has the help of well known lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry). <br/><br/>The two and half hour run time seemed to fly by and the film doesn't quite follow the same path as most thrillers with some unexpected twists and turns, which is always pleasing to see, and an ending that may disappoint some cinema goers, but from what I understand stays pretty true to the book."
"Pizzaiolo","5","5","15","10 October 2014"," Spoiler: Great movie, drama and acting. Writing for the ending...
","Yes, Writing for the Ending SUCKED! My wife read the book and we went to the theater to watch the movie tonight. When I said, while walking out of the theater that I hated the ending she said she had the same reaction after reading the book. Seems to me with all the twists and turns, the ending could be that the husband could entrap her into dooming herself to a murder charge and trial, without a lot of invention and complexity.<br/><br/>I would have much preferred that to the flat and hanging ending the movie left me with. I turned to my wife and said ""There's no way the book ended this way, right?"". She said she had the same reaction but that our daughter (who gleams deeper meanings from books and ""films"") convinced her the ending was appropriate."
"vsks","8","5","15","6 October 2014"," Loved the book; loved the movie
","(No spoilers!) I was so up for the Gone Girl movie (trailer) because the book was one of my ""Best Reads of 2013."" The movie could have disappointed in so many ways, and it did not. According to the credits book author Gillian Flynn wrote the screenplay, and in the few places the movie departed from the printed page, it didn't make a big difference.<br/><br/>The acting throughout is terrific. Ben Affleck, is a natural playing everyman Nick Dunne caught in snares of lies. Rosamund Pike (An Education), amazing as Amazing Amy. In a radio interview director David Fincher said that after watching clips of so many actresses over the years, he can get a read on them and their acting tricks pretty quickly, but when he saw Pike's clips, he couldn't ""read"" her. It made him think she'd be perfect for the Gone Girl, and he was right.<br/><br/>Also liked Tyler Perry as defense lawyer Tanner Bolt and Kim Dickens (Treme's chef Janette Desautel) as Detective Rhonda Boney. (By the way, do you know your spouse's blood type?) Everybody's manipulating someone, except maybe Nick's sister Margo (Carrie Coon). The omnipresent TV talk show hosts commenting in the background are too realistically sleazy to be all that entertaining. The movie website is as Fox News might have produced it.<br/><br/>If you like a suspenseful story, you'll like the twists and turns of this one. If you haven't read the book, there'll be more surprises, but even if you have, it's an exciting tale. There remains a weak spot at the very end, but there's so much else that's laudatory, it's easy to forgive. Rotten Tomatoes critics rating: 87%; audience score 92%. A lot of the reviewers, while giving it a pat on the back with one hand seem to want to stab it in the back with the other. They give, but then they take away. Puzzling."

","The early part of this film is OK but as the 'story' unfolds it becomes a bit of a farce. The Neil Harris lake section was completely unnecessary plus it added an extra painful 15 minutes to what was already becoming a long film. The holes in the plot were at times gaping, leaving me amazed at how this got to be the case. Affleck does what Affleck do, kind of does the emotion without really portraying it with any depth. Support characters were so-so though the defence lawyer had something about him as did the lead detective, everyone else i've already forgotten about. Its a pity because this could have been a half decent film but was sadly let down by a pretty poor script, plot inconsistencies and being overly long. OK to watch on a long haul flight when you're driven to distraction with boredom otherwise i wouldn't bother. Finally the IMDb score yet again bears no relation to the actual quality of the film,. i've scored it a 4 which i think is fair, 5 at a stretch but to have a score of over 8 is just plain ridiculous."

It has a story that will keep you watching till the end. At the same time, the story is a puzzle and you want to resolve that. It's possible that you will find the key to resolve the puzzle while watching it. You will enjoy more if you don't resolve it, but still, i think the movie is worth watching if you don't mind about the strange feelings you have after seeing it.<br/><br/>In other words... I'm feeling like i have been at a great party and now waked up the next day with some headache but at the same time have stories to tell from the night before without remembering what happened at the end.

","Gone Girl was a movie I waited on watching for several years due to the extreme nature of the whole film. From the opening shot, I couldn't take my attention off the screen. It is directed with a level of professionalism and passion behind every movement, sound, word, and frame. It's an extremely unpredictable and effective thriller which had me feeling incredibly uneasy and off balance, which was a clear sign of perfect filmmaking. The cinematography was gorgeous and every shot was either stunning in terms of framing, or mind blowing in terms of the amount of work put into the particular shot. The performances were amazing, and I was consistently taken by surprise by the depth and complexity behind the tone and portrayal of every character. Gone Girl had an incredibly well written screenplay for such a rich, authentic, and captivating thriller. This movie was presented with an artistic way of going about developing characters, framing certain shots, and building extreme tension and unease. David Fincher's direction along with the immaculate screenplay and rich performances made this one of the best movies I've ever seen. Although this movie is phenomenal and very well done, it's a disturbing, graphic, and violent thriller which is not much of a surprise when you consider the past work of David Fincher. In the end, it's simply one of the best movies I've ever seen because of how it is perfectly directed, superbly acted, very well written, and extremely effective."

The same can be said for the soundtrack, particularly during the break-in scene.<br/><br/>The redemption (and extra star for the review) of the film for me is Affleck and Pike's performances.<br/><br/>Ultimately, an adaptation that does not do the source material justice."

","This movie was on TV this evening and I decided to watch it partly because it has a reputation as a decent film, and partly because there was a joke that referenced it on ""You're The Worst"" this season and I wanted to get the backstory.<br/><br/>Since it was on regular TV, it was obvious that some bits had been cut out and some dialog had been changed to get around the R rating, but I'm pretty sure I got the gist of it. And it baffles me that anyone thought this was a great movie.<br/><br/>Others have done a great job of pointing out all the plot holes here on IMDb (as I did to my wife while watching it), but not many have mentioned how over-the-top melodramatic the story and acting were (as my wife did to me several times while watching it), to the point of near self-parody.<br/><br/>Speaking of the plot holes (SPOILER ALERT), I'll just mention that my favorite is that the wife is DRENCHED in blood after killing her ""alibi"", drives all the way home that way (without calling for help), is taken to the hospital, examined by doctors, sedated, questioned by the FBI and police and taken home again...and is STILL drenched in blood, finally showering it off at home what must have been hours later. What the heck? How was that supposed to be even remotely believable?<br/><br/>But maybe, just maybe, despite all that I could have found it in my heart to give this a 5 or 6 rating (after all, it did help kill three hours of an otherwise dull evening), IF IT HAD HAD SOME KIND OF ENDING. Seriously, I was really curious about how they were going to resolve this whole thing - I expected either the husband to kill the wife or vice versa, but nope. Affleck's character decides to just live fearfully and suspiciously ever after with his psycho wife, roll credits. Wow, what an anticlimax.<br/><br/>The movie probably still deserves a 3 or 4, but I'm going with 1 just to try to bring its ridiculous 8.4 average down a bit."

Most likely, the producers, even Fincher, couldn't resist to pander to the contemporary taste of a mainstream consumer. I must say that I didn't read a book upon which the film is made, but I can't get the feeling that the ""more and more and more approach"", the aspiration to make a movie which would be unique, finally lead to completely flawed structure. The beginning is fine, and all of the goods is in that part, even with some pretentious tryouts of a Rosamund Pike character to be mysterious and special.But from the middle, movie simply loses control, looking like that there is no clear picture how to get away from over dramatization. At that part, the plot shows all of the weaknesses, bringing many childish mistakes some of the reviewers already pointed out.<br/><br/>Finally, having this movie so highly rated, in comparison wit for example Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct is just ridiculous.

Still, I think this is one of those stories that's going to stick with me. I'll find myself mulling over it in my head for a while to come."

But none the less, the writing stuck out like a sore thumb, but when I thought about the style it made sense. <br/><br/>It also proves that no matter what the situation, sometimes humans can just manipulate others by turning on the tears and conforming to generalised stereotypes and the story line highlights this along the way.<br/><br/>A must watch for all you mystery hunters out there."
"Mobithailand","9","2","4","9 April 2016"," It will leave you in the sure knowledge you had just spent two and a half, very enjoyable hours
","David Fincher, the director who brought us Fight Club, Seven, Benjamin Button and Social network has delivered another corker. This time, it is a very long, noir-ish thriller but I promise you, that it will hold your attention for its entire 149 minutes of running time. Gone Girl will leave you in the sure knowledge you had just spent two and a half, very enjoyable hours and thirsting for more.<br/><br/>I hate to admit it, (for reasons I will not go into here), but just about every film that Ben Affleck has starred in is a winner in my book. This stylish actor always acts his heart out, without ever going over the top. His quiet, understated performances beat histrionics hands down, and in Gone Girl, playing Nick, the 'wronged' husband, Affleck has done it again. Rosamund Pike, who I do not recall having seen before, plays Amy, Nick's wife who suddenly and inexplicably disappears from home on the fifth anniversary of their marriage.<br/><br/>For a very short while, you think this is going to be a formulaic 'husband does away with wife' flick, but it isn't long before you realise that you are watching something far superior that develops into a cracking, original thriller. Nick is suspected of murdering his wife, but I will not say too much more about the plot for fear of spoiling it for you. The film is about a complex marriage in which one or possibly both partners have sociopathic tendencies. It is a dark thriller, with unexpected twists and turns which will keep you enthralled and glued to your seats.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the role of the media in this movie, which turned the news of the wife's disappearance into a media circus. We were treated to the very epitome of a typical Fox News item; a brassy female presenter has already decided that the husband is a murderer. Together with her fawning 'expert legal contributors', she becomes judge and jury and turns Nick into public enemy No.1, before anyone even knows for sure whether the wife is really dead.<br/><br/>The film switches between two time periods: the present day, as the police search for the wife and Nick becomes the prime suspect; and five years earlier, when the couple first meet and we learn, by courtesy of Amy's diary, how their marriage slowly starts to fall apart.<br/><br/>The music is excellent, as is the cinematography, and the acting by a talented, supporting cast is without fault. Indeed, there are no weak links in Gone Girl – either in the production or the plot – and we are swept along in a roller coaster of surprises right up to the final curtain. Even as the story concludes, there is a final, wry twist or two to provoke us as we watch the final credits.<br/><br/>Definitely a flick worth a look-see."
"simontaylor-44498","8","2","4","3 April 2016"," Gone Girl
","Gone Girl an adaption of the stunning 2012 novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn. It chronicles the aftermath of Amy Elliot-Dunne (Pike) disappearing on her fifth wedding anniversary, and in flashback how she and Nick Dunne (Affleck) first met.<br/><br/>The casting is brilliant. Pike captures Amy's chameleon nature, while Affleck is suitably sympathetic but aloof. Carrie Coon makes Go a very likable character, while Detective Boney is handled well in Kim Dickens' hands.<br/><br/>Despite a hefty running time, Gone Girl does not have a dull second. The twisty-turny plot keeps you on the edge of your seat with the shocks played out in much the same way as the book. Altogether, it's a very faithful adaption with only some superfluous detail left out for simplicity. A treat for fans of the book is the slightly reworked ending. The only original material in the entire movie is reserved for the closing moments, giving those familiar with Flynn's original an opportunity to be left wondering what's going to happen next, one more time.<br/><br/>Although the transposition from page to screen was virtually flawless, Gone Girl loses something in movie form. The twists are slightly less sudden and shocking; the subtlety of the relationship's transformation over the years is less intricate; and the ambiguity of who to support is less pronounced. It loses some of its complexity in determining the heroes and villains, and for that reason it doesn't quite live up to the source material."

I never believed for one second Pike and Affleck. Not only do they lack any chemistry dramatically, I'm wondering if Fincher ever bothered to do second takes.

","OK. After seeing this movie Rosamund Park is not allowed to talk to me, or visit with me, or see meshe frightened the living daylights out of me. What an excellent performancetoo real and too scary. And Ben Affleck, with all his faults (uber lefty), he can always be counted on for a spot-on performance. Wellmostly. I understand that his performance in, 'Daredevil', is a bit difficult to swallow and his roles in, 'Field of Dreams' and (one of my favorites) 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' left very little to talk aboutand are very hard to find. Outside of a couple of weak showings, look at what else this guy has done. 'Argo' – spectacular; 'Armageddon' – come oncome onI know you teared up – just a bit; 'The Town' – scary maniac gone nice guyclassic. The best movie of course is, 'Dazed and Confused' – I never knew Ben Affleck could be anything other than a nice guy – was I ever wrong. Mr. Affleck played the consummate High School Jerk. The guy has chops – big chops – really big chops and boy did he show them off big time in, 'Gone Girl.' I read the book before seeing the movie (which is kind of like saying, 'Look at me, look at meI read the book and you didn't – I read the book and you didn't – nanny-nanny-poo-poo.) Wow – I am being hard myself? Nah – I always pick on narcissists like me. This movie followed the book better than any movie I have seen in the past ten or fifteen years – well done. Will people disagree with me? Of course they will silly. I disagree with me all the time. Should everyone see this movie?

"plewes-94772","9","2","4","16 June 2015"," Surprisingly funny. Killer film
","I absolutely loved Gone Girl. It's brutal, it's witty, it's hilarious, it's a pretty intense deconstruction of marriage and most of all it's fantastically acted. I've seen some people say that it was rubbish and basically funny as if it was accidental, but that really isn't the case - the wit I think is perfect. It's a silly (but very entertaining) plot and Fincher knows it.<br/><br/>The film can basically be split into two halves and two different sociopaths in Nick and Amy, with the audience sort of siding for each one across the film's breathless two and a half hours. It has plenty of thrills, a twist that you sort of see coming and a brilliant relationship between Affleck and Pike who are perfectly cast.<br/><br/>Another star of the show is Tyler Perry as a fantastically funny hotshot lawyer who has some of the standout lines of the whole. ""Our prayers have been answered, it's the miracle on the Mississippi"" - great stuff.<br/><br/>Daft but thought-provoking, funny but at times serious - definitely one of the best films of 2014."

In this movie it can be shown that women are capable of doing anything like men and are quite smart, completely afraid of Rosamund actress in the outcome of the story, I felt much desire to return me crazy so it was still in history, not really know what to say and what could happen, I thought it was an obvious film that came to surprise me that they no longer could describe or guess I could not finish the story.

"alexandercappelli","4","2","4","21 February 2015"," Disappointing third act brings the film down.
","When you break it down, Gone Girl was practically guaranteed to succeed. It has all the necessary components to be a hit film. Based on an internationally best selling novel and with David Fincher at the helm. Director of some of my favorite films including 'Fight Club', 'Seven', 'Panic Room' and the semi-biographical and surprisingly engaging, 'The Social Network', he has barely put a foot wrong in his career thus far. Ben Affleck, who is often hit and miss, pulls in a wholly believable performance. Rosamund Pike, who often appears quite stiff in her roles seems to fit perfectly with her character and her somewhat emotionless performance is perfect for this role. Add to that a wonderfully hypnotic soundtrack from Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor and you've got yourself a hit, right? Unfortunately this is not quite the case, as Gone Girl proves that it's whole is not equal to the sum of it's parts. The film begins with a suspenseful first act and an intriguing 'whodunit' feel that keeps you asking the right questions until we're introduced to some satisfying twists and turns in it's second act where things really heat up. It's by the third act though that Gone Girl begins it's steady decline in to unbelievability and fails to answer many glaring questions and plot holes that leave you with more questions than answers by the credits roll. I respect a film that encourages the audience to think and ask questions, sparking healthy post viewing debate. However, the questions I had when this film reached it's unsatisfying conclusion where not the existential, moral dilemma type questions that cause you to ponder the films deeper meaning and intricate metaphorical elements. What I was questioning was the validity of the films plot arc. I have no trouble accepting what would traditionally be an unbelievable turn of events in the real world, suspending disbelief is essential in most film viewing because we're not watching a documentary. Though when the lead character choices and actions of supporting cast do not sync with the verisimilitude of the film, one cannot help but become distanced by the implausibility of the events even when in the context of the fictional film world. There are plenty of mediocre films out there but it's particularly disappointing when one with so many strong individual elements still falls flat."
"justi00","8","2","4","17 February 2015"," Intriguing and Intense
","Gone Girl is a well cast film that can only be described as intense. It begins quickly and gets to the main plot of the film without unnecessary fluff. As the film progressed it became more complicated and almost unbelievable, however it captivated my interest. What began as a seemingly 'simple' plot line developed into what some have called ludicrous situations. Although, this did not put me off. I felt it helped to depict Amy Dunne's psychopathic and disturbing nature.<br/><br/>The story is told in flash backs and switches between the past and present day. This allowed the story to unravel in a curious manor and kept interest. There were many questions buzzing around in my head which kept me intently concentrating. Many flashbacks are told from Amy's point of view which gives another side to the tale. This allows viewers to see her motives and begin to empathise with her. I felt the music was very effective and added suspense. Scenes of horror were intensified by the sound track. <br/><br/>I was particularly impressed by the performance from Rosamund Pike. Pike began as a sweet likable character and evolved over the course of the movie to a psychopathic mad woman. She played this evolution well. She jumped between crazy irrational states and calm quickly which added to her performance and Amy Dunne's character. I liked that there were no really likable characters. This meant that I didn't side with any person and acted as a curious observer, I was not disappointed with the ending because of this. <br/><br/>Overall, this film was disturbing in many ways. It did make me react to it which I feel is a successful film. It evoked strong emotion and I was interested from start to finish. This is not a feel good family film but definitely worth a watch. Allow the film to progress into the story before passing judgement."

I'm a little surprised that Rosamund Pike is nominated for Best Actress - I didn't think her performance was that worthy - that's not to say it's bad, just not exceptional. Naturally having Ben Affleck as the lead gives this movie a lot more punch and he doesn't disappoint! Certainly deserved the hype it got. When the movie is over and you give it more thought there are a few holes in the storyline but that doesn't matter. It's meant to entertain you and that's what it does. It's not out to change your views or opinions on any subject. Sit back and enjoy it for what it is."

To be sure, the first hour is somewhat promising, but the film quickly goes off the rails the moment it begins, in explicit detail (leaving *nothing* of the story to the imagination), describing just how this apparent psychopath (hmmm...incredibly silly character arc) went about pulling off her perfect crime.<br/><br/>The entire time I viewed these sequences, I believed that they were purely Affleck's character's fantasies, or perhaps visions of a future retelling of what had happened that he'd imagined as he goes. Alas, the story, as it is told, leaves absolutely *nothing* to mystery, clearly indicating that the target audience of this *patently absurd, unintelligent, unimaginative, and tired* ""story"" was the lowest common denominator (no surprise, then, that it's currently in the top 250 (see Marvel and Nolan films for reference: the average person has no appreciation of storytelling prowess)).<br/><br/>If you're expecting something of intelligence, look elsewhere--you will be disappointed.

I had no idea how this was going to end, and neither did the writers apparently...<br/><br/>When this drama has been building up for nearly two and a half hours, you'd almost think that it would be impossible for the films ending to be bad. I was ready to accept whatever it was that was shown on screen before the end credits, however, the film doesn't end (in terms of the story). It leaves you sitting there with an underwhelming feeling. I get that there is supposed to be an underlying message behind it but it doesn't work for what Fincher set out to do. When you have all this build up throughout the film, its hard not to be disappointed with a film just cutting off without resolving anything. <br/><br/>It's really hard to give a rating for this film as I loved all of it, apart from the last minute, literally. Just before the film finished, I was thinking to myself; ""what would I rate the the film out of 10?"" And I could only think to give it an 8 or above, but then the ending happened, the damn ending! 5/10.<br/><br/>I'm not blaming David Fincher for this, the book its adapted from is obviously the culprit but I would still advise people to see it.

Suddenly appeared in front of her husband. When the police asked what was going on, his wife used super high IQ to direct the evidence of the murder that framed her husband to the predecessor.

It´s been half an hour and, in spite of all the visual that David Fincher is known for, I am really bored.

Then came the third one: the action is really slow. Yes, there is a music in the background to bring a bit of mystery but it is not working. And I believe the reason is that the story is just not interesting..

I have watched this countless times and it still blows my mind - Gone Girl takes the traditional murder mystery genre and turns it on it's head.

Darkly satirical and scintillating, Gone Girl forces us to look at the dark parts of ourselves, the validity of our relationships and societies propensity to pigeonhole women.<br/><br/>Affleck and Pike were destined to be Nick & Amy. The alternate narratives weave nicely together, with just enough left unsaid to make you question both accounts. After watching the film you are left somewhat perplexed by how searingly honest it is. The film criticises our fascination with true crime and our naivety to believe the narrative the media spins. The film also touches on hyper realism, and the over arching need for people to present themselves as someone else in order to be liked/accepted (the cool girl speech/ the dancing monkey) - very timely in a social media obsessed culture."

This movie also makes an ironic ""roast"" to the media, by showing the dirts of the actions of the media, that many times (try to) choose a scapegoat just to divide people's thoughts and bring more audience.

But this time it wasn't just Ben's natural look of good-guy befuddlement. Nothing made sense and nothing felt real!<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike has less talent to ooze menace on the screen than any beautiful actress I have ever seen. Every time she's aiming of mysterious and dangerous she comes across as hypnotized and robotic. And those are the good moments! Her performance is so poor that by the end of the picture they're reduced to soaking her in fake blood just so that they can get some kind of reaction -- any kind of reaction -- from an audience that checked out long ago. Watch a movie like LAURA (1944) starring Gene Tierney and you'll see how a beautiful actress can actually play enigmatic and mysterious without sacrificing wit, charm, credibility and humanity.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie where it's a waste of time to expect realism on any level, yet I have to say that the nasty lady detective had the worst, most grating southern accent I have ever heard. And that's even though the actual actress is from Alabama! Of course, the character's name is ""Boney."" So is that some sort of subtle hint that she's trying act like man? Or that she has a Napoleon complex?<br/><br/>So as I said, I looked up the actress, and realized I'd seen her in Sons of Anarchy -- and boy, is she much better on that show. If only Jax and the Sons could have ""crashed"" this movie! I would pay huge, huge bucks to see what Chibs and Tig would do to Ben Affleck's character, you know, like in the shower. That would be so much more rewarding than this mess!"

","Gone Girl is a thriller that has abundant flaws but also notorious qualities that eclipse any seemingly unforgiving flaws. Honestly, I truly enjoyed the movie despite the inconsistencies, plot holes, unaddressed events, absurd attitudes, etc. The movie does what a good thriller is supposed to do: keep you guessing from second one what is happening in the movie, present a complex situation in which the viewer has to evaluate the possibilities and discover along with the development of the movie twists and turns that keep the movie fresh.<br/><br/>Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) delivers a masterful performance as the calculating and manipulating estranged wife that is obsessed in imparting punishment to her husband for his neglect and adulterous behavior. She is arrogant, spiteful, impassive, highly logical, a rational genius. We travel with her this regression from being a sensitive, intrigued, hopeful, and impassioned woman to becoming a calculating maniac and it is an artistic beauty to watch. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) offers a performance that is maybe not up to par with Rosamund but adapts to the character well and gives a believable rendition. He showcases himself, despite her being the psychopath, as a dryer more taciturn and expressionless character than Amy. The fact that he does not show more emotion shackles his ability to aggrandize his performance to match Amy's.<br/><br/>Gone girl's initial dialogue is some of the most interesting frolicking and astute banter that I have seen depicted in a movie in a long time. It is smart, quick witted, astute, perspicacious, works brilliantly at capturing your attention and demonstrates the stark chemistry between the two protagonists. It is the dialogue that I like to hear in interchanges between characters. The movie shows the viewer the position of privilege that both protagonists enjoy intellectually, which successively helps us believe the manipulating behavior that both are able to devise.<br/><br/>Hey, I understand that the movie has ridiculous flaws in the plot, but the movie in my opinion presents us a proposition: Believe this story of two people that get ravaged, corrupted, disappointed by the effects of incompatibility in a relationship, and we will present you with one of the most unique stories of redemption, perseverance, and acceptance. Amy utters a dialogue that symbolizes the eidos of that couple: I have killed for you; who else can say that? You think you'd be happy with a nice Midwestern girl? No way, baby! I'm it."

Her sudden disappearance, the escalating media frenzy, and the bit by bit reveal that their marriage was anything but ideal paints Nick as the potential culprit-but there's much, much more to the story. Another mind-boggling story efficiently handled by director Fincher, this unsavory combination of murder mystery and intense psychological thriller will keep you guessing throughout, and though the plot twists may not be airtight, they're joyously manipulative and presented in skillful fashion. Affleck is a good anchor for the interminable firestorm that erupts around him, and Pike goes all-out in a tantalizingly twisted performance that will really get under your skin.

","So, the Academy award nominated movie Gone Girl was adapted from 2012 novel with the same name. This movie is about a husband whose wife goes missing. And now, rumors are going on everywhere about what happened to this girl? Where is she now? Is she a victim of some kind of abduction? Is Affleck involved in this whole thing somehow? This is without a doubt one of Ben Affleck's best performances ever. He is so perfectly fits in this role. Rosamund Pike is also excellent in this movie.
As the movie progressed, it continuously got darker and darker. It really makes you think differently about the way we view the media, about the way we view the news and about the way we make our own judgment afterwards without even knowing anything about them at all. That's something this movie shows so well; about how the news and the media can affect a situation. What I love about this movie is that there are so many hidden dark secrets of both the main characters. The story is very dark and also very rude. The various twists and turns in the movie come in a very perfect and natural way. That is a great screenplay done by Gillian Flynn. Tyler Perry was also great in this film. Neil Patrick Harris is just about okay in his role. All in all this is a flawless, well made movie, dramatically powerful and wonderfully directed."

"joemellison","9","0","0","19 March 2020"," Makes me scared of getting married
","David Fincher's immersive and intimate direction has enabled Affleck and Pike to create a truly terrifying depiction of how humans will alter their own personalities to get what they truly desire from a relationship.
Affleck's excellent performance really takes the audience on his emotional journey to hell and back, and his interactions with all of the supporting characters feel incredibly genuine, and exactly how anyone would react should they go through the same emotional trauma that he does. However, the true star of the show is Rosamund Pike. She is able to portray so much escalating hate over the course of the first half of the film, and her cunning personality really shines as she is able to manipulate those around in order to fit her ever adjusting motives as the landscape around her continues to alter in different ways.
All in all, the direction, acting and cinematography all come together in such a way that conveys a message of hate and how far someone will go to make the person who has hurt them the most suffer even more than they have. The film ends in such a crushing way it gifts the audience a new perspective on their current morality.
David Fincher continues to solidify himself as one of the undisputed best director of modern times."

Finchers directing is brilliant and the visual experience is also great, this factor allied to this intense plot make this an unforgettable experience. First time I saw this was in the year that the movie was released and I just rewatched today and it feels like it got even better.
About the movie itself I loved that the inicial scene was also the final scene. I also learned that to a lot of people that ending may seem disappointing but I completely loved it and honestly think that was the most appropriate taking in consideration the whole story. I also think that the baby wasn't the only reason that made Nick stay, my interpretation is that they are both kinda obsessed with each other but in different ways being the Amy way more extreme due to her probably being a sociopath or psychopath. But Nick can't leave her and this was pretty clear when his sister said that he wanted to stay and he kept quiet. They have a different and toxic type of love but at the end I really believe that they do love and are obsessed with each other.

","Gone Girl compared to the rest of thrillers created by the hand of David Fincher, is an uneven comparison, Gone Girl as the story progresses does not have the same captivating rhythm of Fincher films and revelations throughout history are not as consistent and surprising as its other thrillers that are made up of amazing revelations after revelation.<br/><br/>The story really is not so difficult to follow or understand, it is not a story so twisted to have to see several times to understand if you are attentive, as is the case with Fight Club.<br/><br/>Some internal logical failures of the script make the movie lose a bit of strength and emotion, however here are all the resources used by Fincher in his other films and that is why I like it so much, the atmosphere of the film is mostly uncomfortable, dark and captivating, like every good Fincher movie has a unique style full of neo noir cinema inspirations, such as Brian dePalma, Paul Verhoveen and the most obvious Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is the most unsatisfactory of the thrillers that David Fincher has made, constantly the endings of his film are surprising and suffocating, although the end of Gone Girl works, it extends so much that it seems stupid and loses strength, the last 10 minutes of the movie are an explanation of everything that has made us understand the movie, it's as if at the end of Fight Club they had interviews with Marla and The Narrator.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is suffocating most of the time, intelligent both to develop her story and to give a different and uncomfortable portrait of marriage, the best thing about this movie is that there is no hero, all the characters here are morally wrong, an essential characteristic of the thrillers."

","The film begins on the day of the fifth wedding anniversary of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike), a not-so-happily married couple who live in a small town in Missouri . On that day, Amy is discovered to be missing after a home break-in. During the investigation, there is evidence that Nick might be responsible for Amy's disappearance.<br/><br/>For the most part, ""Gone Girl"" is superb as an edge-of-your-seat thriller. This is not surprising considering the director is David Fincher who did so well with ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008) and especially with ""The Social Network"" (2010). His cast is very good. Affleck is great as the film's anchor; Pike shows superior skills in a way I won't mention here in order to avoid spoilers. The screenplay, by Gillian Flynn (based on her novel) has many fascinating twists and turns especially a plot device borrowed from the classic ""Vertigo"" (1958): bringing the audience up to speed midway through the movie.<br/><br/>While ""Gone Girl"" had the potential to be a great movie, it is sadly marred by an ending that is unsatisfying and disappointing. Fiction is allowed some distance from real life but this film takes too many liberties to the point of being far-fetched. Also, in the portrayal of the rushed presumption of guilt on men who are accused of mistreating women, the viewer is left with a biased lack of balance in this ongoing and necessary debate. - dbamateurcritic"

","To start with, I wasn't too impressed with the title, which nearly caused me to bypass the film altogether.<br/><br/>However, I decided to give it a try... particularly considering the high IMDB rating and the lack of negative reviews.<br/><br/>The slow start made me somewhat concerned that I wouldn't enjoy it and, again, I almost gave up on it. I'm glad I persevered.<br/><br/>This is the sort of movie that needs to be watched a couple or more times as, I'm sure, a lot of the finer pints will undoubtedly be missed on the first (possibly even the second or more) viewing.<br/><br/>Although very cleverly and stylishly made, I did think it was a somewhat overlong and could have been made punchier and more memorable if compacted/tightened a little... say, to maybe 1hr45 or even 2 hours.<br/><br/>As alluded to, the storyboard/script was intelligently and cleverly written although (perhaps?) a little too much so? I think even Columbo would've had trouble here.<br/><br/>At just after the 2hr mark, the blood from the throat-slashing scene was - I believe - a little too dark for arterial blood.<br/><br/>Also, the scenes in which the absconded lead is befriended by a couple of muggers (ending in her getting mugged) added no real benefit to the story whatsoever. Anyway...<br/><br/>Overall a very good, and very well made film, with an excellent central performance by Rosalind Pike.<br/><br/>I'd, ideally, rate this 7.5 but, as there are no half-stars, I'll tread carefully and opt for an 7/10.<br/><br/>Recommended."

It also represents a keen commentary on the vulturous nature of the media in situations such as the one at the core of the story, wherein public conception of both the victim and possible perpetrators is more important than actual evidence or proper investigative journalism.

","'Gone Girl' is a hard movie to review - I really don't want to give away too much, because the less you know, the better.

Certainly lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing and engaged throughout.<br/><br/>The main problem is the length - at over two & a half hours, I feel like it could have been wrapped up in a double 'Law & Order'/'CSI'-like episode (i.e. one & a half hours). Sure, it's moody and suspenseful, but it definitely drags at times. The ending is a little ridiculous, but fits with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>On the plus-side, the acting is superb, with Affleck & Pike doing the majority of the heavy lifting and truly lending gravitas to their characters. The support cast is also great - Coon as his sister, NPH as the ex-boyfriend, Perry as the lawyer and Dickens as the detective. The Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross score is again ominous and fitting, if a little bland at times."

Okay, none of my psychotic ex:es framed me for murder or rape, but the mindset, the intent, the malevolent way of thinking, that, that I have experienced. So to watch this movie wherein a women take that mindset to the edge is kind of scary, I kept thinking: that could be me. <br/><br/>Very happy because this is a great movie. I cannot believe that this is the same Affleck that plays Batman like a tired old rocking chair. Rosamund is amazing, and so are all the supporting cast. Fantastic acting, great story, great directing. This is one of the better movies I have seen that also contain several weird plots and twists. <br/><br/>The negative is that when Afflecks characters find out his wife is pregnant, he goes along with it. That felt a bit out of character and I disliked that he cave in, so the end of the movie did not fully work for me. Personally I hoped he would go postal or something, but on the other hand it could be a setup for a sequel? I was also, for some reason, annoyed by the cat. The freaking cat was everywhere, it felt like a plot devise that never happen and I fully expected something to happen with or to it, but it never did. My final complaint is that the police/FBI did not, or at least seemingly not, investigate properly. Come on! A murder that wasn't, a killed rapist by the supposed victim, weird turns, so many clues and an apparent setup and then suddenly the ""murdered"" comes back having killed a guy!? Kind of suspicious times 10, but yea, it sort of made the story... <br/><br/>Despite my complaints I give this a 9 out of 10, and I highly recommend."

It's very dark, heavy and has one of the most memorable messages of these days. Have you ever asked yourself why do people marry? if they know who they are marrying? Well, that's something this film is dealing with.<br/><br/>I have just read lots of negative comments for the film and 1. The ending is not stupid, it's real life, or what would have you done in that case?; 2. Inception was not intelligent... it is plain overrated (for me); and 3. The movie is getting really good with the messages it tries to deal with.<br/><br/>I say it is an important film for these days 'cause it dealt with a very peculiar topic that's getting bigger today: feminism. I think the movie really shows how stupid and suggestible people could be because of the sensationalism of TV notices. <br/><br/>This film gives a whole new meaning to the word ""feminism""; don't get me wrong, I believe in the equality of sexes in every aspect, but you need to accept that some women can be as wrong as any man.

","This movie had really great writing. Was anyone surprised with the amount of dark humor in the movie. Not only was it dark and twisted, but it was hilarious! Very smart and witty writing. I've seen it two and a half times in theaters already. The novel is even better. Flynn wrote the screenplay so she was able to get the right tone and dialog, but there's just more room for it in a novel.<br/><br/>I never really considered myself much of an Affleck fan before, but after Gone Girl I'd say that from now on I'll be seeing whatever he puts out. I liked The Town and Argo, and will admit he's a suitable director, but his acting wasn't anything special to me. But to me Gone Girl was an INCREDIBLE example of Affleck's acting and how he really is on a hot streak. So glad Fincher got him to do this, he's the perfect guy for the role, and if you haven't seen it yet, pleas go see it.<br/><br/>I was also blown away by Rosamund Pike. I've admired her work for a while (she was one of the best things about Die Another Day IMO) but Gone Girl was something truly special. People are murmuring about Oscar buzz for her but at the very least I think this film will catapult her to the so-called A list.<br/><br/>Upon my second viewing, it became abundantly clear that Gone Girl was a perverse Romantic Comedy, albeit a Dark Comedy. The kind of comedy only Fincher would have the cunning to pull off with a straight face. It plays like anything but upon the surface, but like Amy and Nick Dunne, there's plenty more than meets the eye."

","I was so excited this over-hyped clunker of a thriller premiered on HBO (and most happy did not pay for movie theater ticket or OnDemand). There wasn't a performance in this film that wasn't overacted or forced...I am assuming that the actors were attempting to make the connection that the female lead was portrayed in caricature in children's books, hence the wooden, almost comical performances, or caricatures, of the roles they were playing in terms of plot development. I hated the actors for knowingly portraying the characters of what could have been an engaging, enthralling story in such a fashion...it almost came off like a comic book version of the story (e.g. Sin City). The delivery of lines gave the movement of the story a rapid-fire, ""thump-thump"" pace that distracted from the overall flow of the storytelling. If you want to see an effective homage to noir done right, rent ""Basic Instinct"" and stick this mess on the shelf to collect dust with the other poor thrillers (thinking of several David Caruso bombs of the 90's)."

Mirroring the real life murders of Laci Peterson and her unborn child Conner by husband/father Scott Peterson in its set-up, Gone girl takes a turn half-way through which is a slap in the face to survivors and victims of domestic violence. This film perpetuates the narrative which abusers depend upon to control others through invalidation and gas- lighting. At its core, Gone Girl has nothing to say, nor original story to tell. By ignoring the overwhelming statistics of the number of women killed and then disappeared by their abusive spouses, Gone Girl is a significant set-back to the movement to end domestic violence. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this piece of garbage.

"balzano_receipts","10","3","8","27 January 2015"," Magnificent Thriller!
","Gone Girl is a very dark suspenseful film. It has all of the elements of a mystery story. However, this film has a major twist. When the twist happens the film switches lanes completely. The movie is almost two and a half hours long, but that doesn't even begin to capture everything. The movie was brilliantly written and directed. From the cast to the acting to the camera angles; this movie is sheer perfection. When I first watch the movie, I felt like time flew by, and nonetheless I was left wanting more... but that's an awesome thing. The movie is slow moving for the first 20 minutes so you just have to be patient but it becomes extremely fast incredibly quickly and the pace is so fast you'll have to keep up. (No bathroom breaks!) I truly believe that this movie deserves for the audience, for someone to really enjoy it, to watch it at least 2 or 3 times. If you watch this movie over and over, then you'll notice things that you didn't know were there the previous times you'd watched it. This movie is intense yet haunting. I feel like the music really creates the suspenseful image, also; it worked extremely well with the plot and acts being played out on screen. The performances in this movie are outstanding. I feel like Ben Affleck is mysterious and lustful and plays the part perfectly. I also feel that all of the other actors in the film went well above their standards. Rosamund Pike absolutely knocks it out of the ballpark. I'm ecstatic that Pike is nominated for a Academy Award. In my personal opinion, Rosamund Pike, well there's no other way to put it other than she plays an upstanding psychotic woman. This is Rosamund Pike's big break. I hope she continues with her acting career and the acting skills she portrayed in Gone Girl. The movie is full of twists and turns and I don't think you truly see what's headed your way. This isn't your typical mystery movie. This is not your average suspenseful thriller. This is by far director David Fincher's best work. If you really want entertainment, if you want to be on the edge, and if you really want to watch a film that is completely unpredictable, then I HIGHLY recommend Gone Girl for anyone who likes to be surprised."

"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","5","17","8 October 2014"," Jaw-dropping twists around every corner.
","There isn't a lot that hasn't already been said about David Fincher's latest murder-mystery Gone Girl. It only took the opening weekend for film reviews everywhere to be saturated with the buzzwords that are most certainly applicable to the film's effect and atmosphere, but not necessarily worthy of hyperbole. I haven't read Gillian Flynn's novel, I bought it a long time ago but haven't gotten round to it. I know want to read it just to get under the character's skin a little more. The film excels when its getting under the characters but moreso when it's pure chaos. It has a lot of interesting gender politics about the representation of men and women in the media, especially under rose-tinted or poo-tinted lenses. Although Fincher's portrayal of the media are quite cartoonish - especially with Missi Pyle who plays it like she would in a more radiant comedy - the absurdism is part of what the film has to say.<br/><br/>It's disturbingly accurate too; straight after coming out from the cinema, the news in our car reports on a missing girl. But it's not just a zeitgeist, the dissection of marriage and the projections that we put on each other are studied with a heated laser pointer. It's all about the masks we wear and our subsequent breaking points. There are few scenes more compelling than the unraveling ""Cool Girl"" montage, perhaps one of the finest moments of Fincher's oeuvre thus far. It's a shame that it's more or less the peak. Not to say the rest of the film doesn't have its moments, it does, but I did find much of the framing of it frustrating, mostly regarding the way the narrative stops and starts around news reports. Its opening act is pretty mild. There's an odd approach to the film where things feel a little off. Performances outside of our leads are overly rigid, outside of a strong featured supporting cast with Kim Dickens, Carrie Coon, Tyler Perry and Scoot McNairy bringing a fleeting Argo reunion.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck however, plays it loose and grounded. It's been noted that he's an ideal lead for the film, not only because you can like and dislike him simultaneously but because he's experienced public scrutiny like Nick Dunne has. Rosamund Pike is confident, elegant, calculating and cold. She truly makes you believe in the darkness of Amy Dunne but also the beacon that endears everyone to her. Fincher does a great job of balancing out the way we feel about the two of them, tipping the scales for and against at every turn. I am less enamoured with the way the film treats its third act, especially upon reflection. There feels like far too many liberties and oversights, unresolved moments prior awaiting payoff. It's in the nature of films like this, particularly Zodiac where paths are abandoned. But it also suffers a similar problem as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo where the end rushes to the finish line without digging back under the character's skin for one last look.<br/><br/>The score contributes a lot to this distance, great elsewhere but misplaced here. However, this doesn't drag the film down, it mostly confirmed the way I felt about it the whole time. The editing and cinematography are pretty terrific, but relatively understated for his work, but in a positive way that doesn't interfere with the story. Fincher has been made a big deal out of recently for his meticulous nature, and I agree, The Social Network demonstrates his ability remarkably especially lately. Perhaps I had my expectations for his work too high but I just found Gone Girl a little clumsy at times. Maybe I scrutinised it too hard, the way people scrutinise Nick. I just feel like Fincher is holding himself to a lower standard than he has the potential for. Anyway, it's a very good thriller with some jaw-dropping moments, not quite the great one people want to call it now but it certainly has a lot to say.<br/><br/>7/10"

I found it very hard to feel biased towards either of the main characters, which I think was intended.

Being polite, kind and nice to people, getting married, having children, and bringing up children.....These all are the female figure in most countries.

So it's understandable why, when it appears that Amy has been murdered in their home, Nick would be the prime suspect.<br/><br/>In David Fincher's Gone Girl, the mystery appear to be not whodunit but rather why they did it and what the endgame really is. It's a little long (143 minutes) and has at least one too many denouements; just when you believe you have a vague handle on how things might go, the movie pivots elsewhere. Now, I'm one of those people who likes to find someone in the movie who has a strong personality, not necessarily a good guy but at least someone with whom I may be able to sympathize (to some degree) or to whom I can relate. I didn't find that to be the case in this film. Let me put it this way - Nick is an arrogant, self-pitying jerk, and Amy is a delusional sociopath. With no rooting interest and no discernible satisfying ending, watching the movie was a tedious experience.<br/><br/>Nick is questioned by Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens), and a missing-persons report is immediately followed. Nick's not sure whether his wife has friends, or what her blood type is, or what she does during the day, all of which cast doubt on his innocence. A press conference is held. A hotline is set up. A midnight vigil is held. All standard operating procedure for a missing-persons case that's less than a day old. But with a real lack of other suspects or motives, the court of public opinion shortly turns against Nick. He's no longer the grieving husband (and son-in-law) but the conniving gold digger with all the necessary reasons for orchestrating his wife's demise. Plus, he has this attitude that oscillates between smug and defensive.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie seems rather inert; the audience ping pongs between believing Nick is a villain. There are multiple reasons that indicate he's not all that innocent, although the bottom line is that he's just not a nice guy, and that's reason enough for the cable-TV crowd. After the police turn on Nick as well, a Nancy Grace impressionist (Missi Pyle) calls for his head. Nick turns to high-powered attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), who advises him to appear on the show of an Oprah Winfrey copycat (Sela Ward). Affleck, through Nick, then turns in his best acting job while pretending to show contrition and humility on the television show.<br/><br/>Gone Girl first asks us to imagine that Nick is blameless, planting the idea that the attack was staged, and then asks us to believe that Amy is just an innocent naif who's on the run from an abusive husband, and then asks us to pity Nick, and then Amy, and so on. The entire movie, although based on a book by Gillian Flynn (who also wrote the screenplay), feels like a Lifetime movie that is itself ripped from tabloid headlines.<br/><br/>We do finally get Amy's side of the story, but her situation and intention aren't terribly compelling. She's a meticulous planner, to the point where, in voice-over, she explains in minute detail every step in her scheme. The amount of organization is to be admired - except that later in the movie, she makes a mistake that would have been easily prevented by even a modicum of advance thinking. I found it hard to believe that someone who had gone to such great lengths to achieve her goal would be undone so effortlessly. The entire movie, although based on a book by Gillian Flynn (who also wrote the screenplay), feels like a Lifetime movie that is itself ripped from tabloid headlines.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has played so many arrogant, smug, condescending jerks in his career that it's hard to imagine him as a vulnerable, mild-mannered guy. In the hands of a more capable actor, the role of Nick Dunne may have become much more nuanced, but instead we get a colorless, stereotypical performance by one of Hollywood's top leading men. It's a true shame, because he's surrounded by excellent performances - particularly by Carrie Coon, who plays his acerbic sister Margo, and Dickens. Both women turn make their characters layered, thoughtful, and ultimately intriguing. This contrasts sharply with Affleck's dismissive, distant style.<br/><br/>This normally would be the kind of movie I'd love. The premise asks the question of what has happened to Amy Dunne. A mystery is afoot! But this mystery is solved within the first third of the movie, and the remainder of the film is endless filler. We're teased several times in the final third that this could finally be it, the ending. But it's not. It never is. Even the ending isn't an ending. According to reports, Flynn changed the ending of the script so that readers of the book wouldn't know what was coming. I'm not sure that ploy works, because there is no finale to speak of. There is no twist, just a longer piece of twine."

","(Note that this review will be specifically spoiler free!) <br/><br/>One of the year's most anticipated films, David Fincher's Gone Girl doesn't disappoint delivering a stylish and sophisticated cinematic punch to the guts.<br/><br/>Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) arrives home on the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to find the door open, signs of disarray inside the house and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) ""gone"". Amy is the real life incarnation of ""Amazing Amy"" – the fictional children's character of books authored by her parents (played well by David Clennon and Lisa Banes), and so is something of a minor celebrity. As such, her disappearance generates an intense media frenzy and suspicion quickly falls on the hapless husband Nick, who can seem to do nothing right in terms of self-implication.<br/><br/>Speaking from the pages of her own diary, Amy describes a marriage that appears to be far less idyllic than it appears to the Missouri neighbourhood in which she lives, adding further fuel to the fire.<br/><br/>To say more (all of the above is within the trailer) would be wrong. Just to say that It is a roller-coaster of a script, by Gillian Flynn from her own novel, and delivers a suitable number of twists and turns.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is excellent in the role of Nick, but the acting star of the show for me is former Bond girl Rosamund Pike as the flashback-featured Amy: a stunningly good performance and I would be surprised if this doesn't end up with an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>David Fincher clearly brings out the best in his actors, with Neil Patrick Harris (TV child star of ""Doogie Howser"") playing a creepy part extremely well, Tyler Perry highly entertaining as Nick's legal beagle, Carrie Coon excellent in a film debut as Margot, Nick's supportive sister, and Kim Dickens (""Hollow Man"", ""The Blind Side"") riveting as the detective investigating the case. Also outstanding, in a couple of notable ways as well as the acting, is British-born Emily Ratajkowski. A brilliant ensemble cast that work extremely well together.<br/><br/>Key contributors to the film are Fincher's usual soundtrack team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", ""The Social Network""), who deliver a genuinely spooky and highly effective soundtrack that again I would suggest is well into Oscar nomination territory.<br/><br/>Whilst I have some quibbles with the overall story (it is easy to pick holes in it as the lights come up) I can't readily fault the film it is another Fincher classic and I suspect that this film will feature large at the Oscars in February. Note that (after my recent rant about the ""15"" certificate awarded to ""The Equalizer"") the film earns its ""18"" certificate for a combination of sex, language and violence. The film is genuinely disturbing in places.<br/><br/>One of the most enthralling and well executed films of the year so far.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com.

That's the first question.<br/><br/>The second question is, why have thousands of people rated this movie so highly?<br/><br/>I guess they're suckers for punishment.

Err, no. It's still afternoon outside. If she has gone, it looks like barely 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Another thing is the cops investigation is just so fake. Cops aren't real and neither are the performances. Ben Affleck is as stiff as a corpse. And I'm sorry but Rosamund Pike is no better. She walks about the place with this constant smug expression on her face. So annoying.<br/><br/>All in all I couldn't give two figs about the characters or the plot. The movie is too long.

","Well... this one is really very bad. The book is highly readable and interesting and so I decided to see the movie because I was sure that David Fincher will make a true masterpiece of it, but this is not the case. Sad!<br/><br/>I tried to watch the movie with an open mind trying not to compare it with the book I've read recently but well I couldn't... The movie should feel like a complete mess to people who haven't read the book - just throwing random and inconsistent scenes at them, nonsense! At least so it felt to my wife. Awful!!!<br/><br/>The only thing that pleased me was acting of Ben Affleck, Carrie Coon was a nice surprise, Neil Patrick Harris did a good job, too. On the other hand most of the cast was a total disappointment, like Tyler Perry playing Tanner Bolt and David Clennon as Amy's dad... that was a disaster...<br/><br/>Conclusion: Read the book - it's truly fantastic and entertaining, skip the movie at all costs :)"

","Tense from frame one and always unpredictable, this film is the living proof of David Fincher's mastery at directing, as he takes us through this journey with utter confidence.<br/><br/>I had a great experience with this movie, it was really amazingly entertaining and scary at the same time to see how the events unfolded, but most importantly I wanted to see how they went down. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole duration because I simply could not wait to know how things would go down. As I was watching it, I realized simply how good David Fincher is. When the police enter Nick's house for the first time there is a scene where they start discussing particulars and it was stunning to see how Fincher managed to create tension in that situation with just a few details. By the way, performances across the board are great. Even Tyler Perry is great! I have been a big critic of Ben Afleck as an actor in the past, but here he gives what might be the best performance of his career, he plays the part perfectly and the point that proves it is the fact that you don't notice it. What can I say of Rosamund Pike's performance that hasn't been said before? She totally transforms and the by the end of the movie I was creep-ed and terrified by just her face, great work! Fincher is one of my favourite directors, I love every one of his movies and even like Alien3. But, with the exception of Zodiac, which is his favourite of mine, I have never jumped up and down for his movies, I really love them but they just don't make it up to a 9 for me. I can't put my finger on why, but I'll just say that they don't make me leave the theater shaking.<br/><br/>I still love this movie as much as all of his others, it is a clear fit in his filmography and I recommend for everyone to see it and have a blast at watching perfect filmaking."
"krzysiektom","8","3","9","28 October 2014"," good and thought provoking
","It is a well made and intelligent film for adults, bleak and pessimistic in its outlook on people, women in particular. Maybe it went too far in the depiction of a failed marriage and of two people who fail to live up to mutual expectations. There are countless marriages that do not work but usually people just divorce, they do not turn out to be cynical psychopaths, even if they hate each other. But then we would not have a best-selling book and a film. What I liked is that Fincher is not afraid to ask whether marriage is basically a trap for two people pressured by the society and religion to stay together at all costs. The film is rather mysogynistic, it dislikes people. The women come off as even worse than men, usually stronger and more manipulative. The only character which is pleasant and not dumb at the same time is the female detective. Her police partner is well meaning but dull and stupid, the lawyer played by Perry is smart but cynical. Nick's sister, played by the attractive Carrie Coon, would be nice if it weren't for the signs that she is in love with her brother (in a non-sisterly manner) and psychologically hung-up on him. The film also undermines the myth that a child is always a blessing for a marriage, here the child allows Amy to trap Nick in their unhappy and twisted marriage. The production values are high as in all Fincher films and Trent Reznor's music is excellent - minimalistic and not overbearing but always stressing the point."
"jacob-m-ford97","8","3","9","26 October 2014"," Twists your mind.
","Whenever I write these reviews on a movie I've just seen, I always get myself in the mood again by listening to the film's soundtrack as I write. As I sit here right now and the eerie sound of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score envelops me, I feel unlike myself. I feel not like a person I know. Not like a person at all. It's an unspeakable feeling, one that can only be put into words poorly as I have done. This sensation (which it is a sensation) is just a taste of what this entire movie does to you. Because this isn't a movie that you go and watch, this is a movie where you sit down and become Play-Dough in the hands of the filmmakers. And what they mold you into in the end - well, it's beyond description. <br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is about a wealthy middle-aged man named Nick Dunne, and his wife Amy. Nick returns home from visiting his sister Margo one day to find Amy missing, with signs of a struggle in the living room. Nick, along with Amy's incredibly wealthy parents, begin a search to find where she has disappeared to, as we slowly discover who is responsible for what has happened to Amy Dunne.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" stars Ben Affleck as Nick and Rosamund Pike as Amy. I have never been fond of Affleck's acting ability and was no more impressed here. Affleck is a good filmmaker, his movies typically turn out well, but I always come away feeling he was the weak point, whether his role was behind or in front of the camera. Rosamund Pike on the other hand was outstanding in this film. Pike has had a bit of an interesting Hollywood story. It has always seemed she was one step away from stardom, but never quite in the spotlight. In my opinion, that is the perfect position for an actor to be in. She has the name to get those larger roles, but the unfamiliarity to get into those parts and make them significantly more believable. That scenario worked perfectly here, and the role of Amy is one of the best female performances I've seen all year. Making up the unlikely supporting cast are Neil Patrick Harris, Carri Coon, Missi Pyle, Kim Dickens, Emily Ratajkowski, and Tyler Perry.<br/><br/>David Fincher is the main man responsible for this film, a director with quite a rap sheet. With credits like ""The Social Network,"" ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" ""Fight Club,"" and ""Se7en,"" it is easy to fathom that this is a film that messes with your mind. I have always had a little personal hate for movies of that kind, not because I think it somehow makes a bad movie, but just because I'm too proud to admit that I was so manipulated. And boy did that happen here. In this two and a half hour movie, I had my beliefs about these characters and the story and I could give concrete defenses for them. Fast forward ten minutes and I have completely flipped sides. After watching this movie, I am confident I would make a lousy politician. <br/><br/>I still don't know how much I like this movie. I've always felt the best films are the ones that create strong characters who by the end of the two hours you know like your best friend. That didn't happen with this movie. The reason it didn't happen is because you were constantly being tricked into believing different things. I didn't like that, but it is undeniable that I completely fell for it. These filmmakers didn't make me believe what I wanted to believe, but they made me believe something. And then they took that, made me doubt it, and then made me believe something else. This film didn't fit the main quota that I'll give for a ""good movie,"" but that wasn't what they were trying to do. They were aiming for something completely different, and they succeeded perfectly.<br/><br/>I always try to keep an open mind with movies, but I often fail. I am positive that there are a lot of people out there, and can even think of a few, who would love this movie. I didn't like the movie, but I loved that these filmmakers are so good at what they do. So as I walked out of the theater, I was wondering if the female worker who handed me my ticket was indeed female, or if David Fincher had tricked me into believing that too.<br/><br/>I give ""Gone Girl"" an 8.0/10."

Dark satire of sorts. If you will.<br/><br/>Previous 1/10 reviews I found good were the ones pointing to the numerous plot errors, I'll just add to a few previous points:
* She bought that cheap car for her disappearance with cash to avoid a transaction trail, you'd assume she'd further already have fake IDs/licences/car registered in a phony name, etc. in order to avoid being traced - further assuming her fake alias(es) would check out when scrutinized
* The monitor camera for the sex/murder scene could be either turned off or there was no camera for that angle/bedroom
* You might assume she could have deleted any camera recordings that disprove kidnapping and abuse - if she had access
* The Neil Patrick Harris character wouldn't have an alibi for the duration of the ""kidnapping"" and 'Amy' wouldn't be recognized by anyone when they were seen together, even that guy who remarked she looked familiar and none of the neighbours noticed her leaving the house alone during the ""kidnapping"" (most unlikely)<br/><br/>(Might give this a rewatch in case some details are wrong, in that case an edit will follow)<br/><br/>Movie suspension of disbelief fanfare and then some. She'd be caught and convicted, hands down. But hey, Ben Affleck's character ended up with those sweet deals in the end, pointed out by his top priced lawyer.<br/><br/>So it's all good?<br/><br/>Implausible plot especially towards the end qualify for a 1/10 on its own.

","David Fincher's Gone Girl is a complex thriller full of twists and turns. Did he, didn't he, is she, isn't she? But then it deepens into something less predictable and altogether more surprising. <br/><br/>Husband Ben Affleck gradually falls under suspicion of murder after his wife, Roasmund Pike, disappears. His responses and behaviour seem unexpected and that's all the media needs to both determine the crime and judge him guilty. His wife is portrayed as a perfect spouse while his character is subjected to ritual innuendo and suspicion.<br/><br/>In fact, their relationship is far more complex, and much more disturbing, than we realise. Exploring the machinations of their marriage creates a compelling narrative as we begin to question what really happened, and who is guilty. The story suddenly answers our questions part way though and the narrative takes an even darker turn leaving us with something altogether more surprising.<br/><br/>It's a film partly about image and perception. About how the media create a fiction to suit their own ends, which are happily and hungrily consumed by the public. It's also about the image we choose to present of ourselves, and the fictions we create individually.<br/><br/>The two leads are exemplary. Affleck convinces as an ambivalent husband, and ensures that we question everything we see, until the film decides to provide the answers. Pike is a revelation in a complex role.<br/><br/>It might be a vaguely preposterous story, but it's so well crafted in every sense that it probably won't matter. It'll glue you to your seat for the duration. Only afterwards might you consider the likelihood of such a tale."

"brando647","8","2","5","11 September 2015"," Scathing Commentary on Power of the News Media; an Excellent Thriller
","David Fincher is, in my opinion, one of the most talented directors in modern Hollywood. I'm almost certain the man could tackle any project and create gold; for the record, I forgive him for ALIEN 3that was ruined by the studio, not him. GONE GIRL is what happens when Fincher dips his toe in the genre of Lifetime movies. Not surprisingly, it's way better than it probably should be. I was raised in a predominantly female household so I am very familiar with Lifetime and its brand of ""entertainment"", and I can't stand it. When I first read the premise of Fincher's GONE GIRL, I wasn't thrilled (it sounded sogeneric) but I was more than willing to give him a chance. He did not disappoint. GONE GIRL is the story of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) Dunne. We're guided through the beginning of their happy relationship and follow up through their marriage and eventual hardship during the economic recession. Things in the Dunne household seem shaky at best when the unthinkable occurs. Amy goes missing one morning, on the day of their fifth anniversary. There's evidence of a struggle and fears turn to those of kidnapping. The town rallies around Nick as the investigation becomes a national spectacle, but the media isn't being too friendly with Nick's, almost eerily calm, demeanor and secrets come to light that paint him in a horrible light. As the story unfolds in Fincher's creative fashion, we will learn: did Nick Dunne murder his wife?<br/><br/>Even if the premise sounded depressingly generic, there was never a doubt that GONE GIRL would be a fantastically produced project. The cinematography, the music, the editingit's all got Fincher and crews' usual brand of excellence. The creative cutting and the structuring of the story into two very different halves is a fantastic bit of audience manipulation. We spend the first hour or so of the movie observing from one perspective as the investigation begins and the conservative fear-mongering news media (epitomized by Missi Pyle's Nancy Grace-esque Ellen Abbot) demonizes his every move. The evidence piles up and it becomes easier and easier to believe Nick might've killed his wife. Then the movie takes a drastic swing in the other direction. The truth about Amy's disappearance is way more twisted than Nick could've imagined. It all boils down the fact that Nick and Amy are one of the most messed up couples you'll ever meet. The flashbacks paint them in the usual light of your average struggling couple and GONE GIRL removes the sheen to reveal the insanity behind the scenes. The movie is an excellent piece of work and another success under Fincher's direction, even if it doesn't achieve the level of his greats (e.g. THE SOCIAL NETWORK, SE7EN, etc.). All of the elements come together to create a tense movie that grabs hold of you because you can't wait to see how it's all resolved in the end, and the pitch perfect casting makes it all the better.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck gets a lot of hate and I never quite understood it. He's done some garbage but most in Hollywood have. He's also done a lot of great stuff, both behind and in front of the camera. He's excellent in GONE GIRL. He's already got a vibe that makes him come across as kind of arrogant and aloof; it plays into the character of Nick as one of his major flaws that contributes to the public's growing mistrust of him. I was somewhat familiar with Rosamund Pike, primarily from DIE ANOTHER DAY (I won't hold that against her) and her supporting role in Edgar Wright's THE WORLDS END. She is 100% awesome in GONE GIRL. Amy is an incredibly complex character (for reasons I won't spoil here) and Pike handles it flawlessly. She's sympathetic, intelligent, beautiful, and, when he true nature begins to surface, she's terrifying. As the key characters in this movie, Affleck and Pike and perfectly cast. The supporting cast is equally powerful with Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon standing out. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry both play against type to outstanding results; Harris as a skeevy, rich former flame of Amy's that hasn't quite let go of the past, and Perry as a hot-shot New York lawyer who's earned a reputation representing husbands with their head on the chopping block. GONE GIRL is a character-driven movie and the cast is at their best to keep the movie, at a whopping 2.5 hours, moving at a break-neck pace. Easy recommend as one of the better movies of 2014, and I can't wait to see Fincher's next."

","David Fincher works wonders with a seemingly-difficult literary adaptation once again. Here he keeps us impaled on the hook through a twisting, thrashing, contorting murder mystery where nothing, not even the victim, is remotely as it seems. It's a great ride, one which delights in misleading the viewer into endless amounts of incorrect assumptions, while also managing to spotlight several timely, pertinent thoughts about the excesses of a 24-hour news cycle and the public's gullible yearning for their next big chance to cast shame upon a pariah. Gone Girl is effective, dramatic, gripping and entrancing for most of its duration, but does overstay its welcome and begin to unravel in the last twenty minutes. With most of the answers already on the table, it's strange that the film lingers for so long after the fact, neurotically toying with its own plot holes and giving its audience time to do the same. That's not enough to completely undo all of the good that had come before, of course, but it's plenty to cast a little doubt."

","Gone Girl is perhaps one of the darkest, most suspenseful and shocking movies I've ever seen. It's well directed with a creative, unique style. The actors, while some I personally despise, are working on all cylinders to give us engaging characters that feel real and flawed. The story is one of the best I've seen, so much of starts off one way, but near the first hour mark it's quickly turned on it's head. It's one of the best films of it's breed, always coming up with a new way to surprise and shock you, the audience, in ways once thought unimaginable or impossible.<br/><br/>But, at it's heart, I have to say that this is one of the few movies I have a bright, burning hatred for. I'll get into it soon, but bottom line is that the movie is great. I wouldn't have thought it came from a book, but the only difference is that the book had more moments then the movie, so all different connections end there. <br/><br/>So, if I'm giving this movie all of this praise, why do I hate it? Well, most of it resides in the character of Amy Dunce. Heaven above do I hate this character! She's a mentally broken, brutally manipulative, horrible waste of human scum. I know, that sounds really harsh, but if you saw the film already, and you WILL see this film, trust me on that, you can see where I've drawn such a passion to despise. Amy is one of the few characters, from any kind of outlet of media, that I personally Loathe. And after watching the film, I'm sure you will too.<br/><br/>Another big problem with the film happens after the big twist that Amy's ""Diary"" is actually forged and all lies. However, even after the hour mark where that twist takes place, she still goes out and tells everyone these lies. And guess what? Everyone still believes it. It's almost as if the entire town is run by idiots and treaded upon by such. I don't know, it just undermines the audience in my opinion. I swear, there were moments where I just wanted to yell out ""She's Lying You Stupid Bloody Idiots"" for the entire land of suburbia to hear.<br/><br/>There are other minor things here and there that I can only call 'Minor Gripes', like some of the promiscuous sex scenes look rather tame and laughably fake(The sex scene in James Cameron's 'Avatar' looked less fake.) and some characters felt rather useless or just there to make a kind of conflict, like FemiNazi Ellen Abbot, who's obviously a parody of Nancy Grace. Interesting additions, but not exactly used to it's fullest potential like how every other actor is. <br/><br/>After the hour mark, it also seems like the film wants to make this shift in genre from a pure, psychological thriller, into a sort of drama with thriller themes thrown in there. It feels like two different movies are playing now, and that the whole twist was going to be the ending of the first film and they hoped to make a sequel out of it. But then the director was scarred to make that kind of leap of faith, so he just stitched the two drafts together while the second was halfway done, and the rest was just filled in by a guy who wanted to throw in as many shocking moments as possible.<br/><br/>Near the 2nd hour mark, the film takes a far more gruesome turn, as Amy's full psychotic nature is unleashed. You could probably put the soundtrack to Silent Hill 2 to this scene and you couldn't make it any less fitting. We see Amy trying to frame Neil Patrick Harris for attempted rape (COUGH*BULLCRAP*COUGH), Slit his throat with a box cutter while they try to have sexual intercourse, Even a scene where she sodomizes her self with a wine bottle. Yeah, let all those colorful images sit in your brain.<br/><br/>Now, after all of this, all of those painful, disgusting moments, everything you went through just watching Ben Affleck's character go through hell and back, what happens at the end? Does Nick reveal the insane wife to being...well, insane? Does he let her go so she can go to a mental institute? Do they even try and file a divorce?<br/><br/>HELL NO! You want to know what happens? Amy and Nick go take a shower, while she's covered in blood mind you, and then she reveals that she used his iced sperm to impregnate herself, forcing him to stay with her. Fade to the intro scene, Fade to black, End Scene, Roll Credits.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a very good movie, and I really can't stress it enough. Everything it get's right it get's very right. The story is very engaging, and you can't ever look away, in case you'll miss a good piece of evidence in the character's story. It's writing is impeccable, it's characters are well rounded, even the ones I hate, and the whole film's atmosphere is incredible. However, everything about Amy's character is mentally scarring, some characters feel underutilized, and by GOD that ending was horrible. I never felt more angry and hateful towards a movie like this, and still applaud it for it's amazing merits.<br/><br/>Final Results: 4 Stars- A-Ranking"
"dyllon_jeng","7","2","5","18 July 2015"," Not as great or terrible as both sides are making it out to be
","I feel obligated to make this review because I feel a lot of the negative reviews may be unjustifiably push people away from watching this film. Yes, this movie has flaws but it definitely does not deserve a 1-star rating. <br/><br/>The main complaint I've seen in most of the negative reviews is regarding the abundance of plot holes that the movie has. I would say the only plot hole that really bothers me is how stupid the law enforcement is, but the others that many are claiming to be plot holes are just parts of the story that aren't clearly explained. <br/><br/>One part of the film that sort of bothers me though is the scene where Amy (Rosamund Pike) begins to explain how she executed her plan to frame Nick (Ben Affleck) for her murder. It's basically like she just began explaining to the audience for the sake of exposition (which of course is necessary). The script just has a voice-over to conveniently but lazily explain to the viewer what has happened. <br/><br/>My last complaint is that the script at time was a bit cheesy and unbelievable. And that's it. There are definitely other movies that are much worse than this, with more plot holes, with terrible scripts, etc.<br/><br/>The acting is fine, all of the performances were good, especially Pike's portrayal of a psychopathic wife. The story is pretty interesting (in my opinion) and keeps you hooked onto what's going to happen next. I think the best thing about this film is how it develops the two characters, Nick and Amy. At first, you're led to sympathize for Amy and hate Nick. Then halfway through the story, it begins to compel you to completely switch sides (almost like a character twist if there's such a thing). <br/><br/>In conclusion, Gone Girl is not the best movie but definitely not the worst, and it is an enjoyable watch."

","Shaken, Engrossed, Appalled, Disturbed, Marvelled and Amazed, these are some of the adjectives that I felt during the course of this movie. Wow! What a masterpiece of acting by Rosamund Pike. I haven't seen a better display bod female domination. She is evil, sharp, strong and pursuasive, all at the same time. I could not stop applauding myself on her subtle grey gestures. She planned a perfect plot in this movie effortlessly and had the others gasping for their breathes!! The whole movie revolves around her and never for even a second does she disappoints. The former bond girl could not have done anything better in her role.<br/><br/>A superb thriller that does not loses momentum for the entire length. Fasten your seat belts and get ready for a 'perfect murder' or is it?!"
"hnt_dnl","10","2","5","21 June 2015"," Brilliant, twisted satire!
","David Fincher might now be on my short list of directors where I can name at least 3 films that I consider brilliant! The first is 1997's ""The Game"", an early effort of Fincher's that I think many forget about. The second is 2010's 'The Social Network', which should have won Best Picture that year. And now there's this excellent offering GONE GIRL (2014), which in my opinion has more than lived up to the hype and acclaim. In fact, I dare say that 'Gone Girl' was shamelessly overlooked at the Oscars. <br/><br/>'Gone Girl' stars Ben Affleck in arguably the best performance of his career thus far. Affleck plays Nick Dunne, a failed writer forced to move from New York back to his small Missouri hometown due to financial trouble coupled with his mother's health problems. Accompanied by Nick is his wife Amy (brilliantly essayed by Rosamund Pike in a well-deserved Best Actress nominated performance). Financial woes cause Nick and Amy to have a very strained marriage. Amy gets money from her wealthy parents in order for Nick to buy a local bar that is co-run by Nick and his twin sister Margo (pitch perfect performance by Carrie Coon). Very early in the film, Nick discovers their home ransacked and Amy missing and calls the cops. The lead investigator is Det. Rhonda Boney (excellently played by Kim Dickens) and her partner is Off. Jim Gilpin (cheekily played by Patrick Fugit of 'Almost Famous' fame). Boney implores Nick to contact Amy's uppercrust parents (fine performances by David Clennon and Lisa Banes) from New York to fly down to Missouri. The cops and family set up a headquarters and the search for Amy begins.<br/><br/>Of course Nick is soon the main suspect in the investigation and it's not long before he must enlist the aid of media-loving defense lawyer Tanner Bolt (played with flair and confidence by Tyler Perry). The investigation into Amy's disappearance jumpstarts the film's storytelling structure, which involves many flashbacks of Amy and Nick's encounters both pre and during marriage. The segues between past and present are done in a seamless way that I found refreshing. Not the traditional, obvious way of nonlinear storytelling. And Pike's superb narration of Amy's thoughts are a huge component of these flashbacks. A key figure that emerges during the case is Amy's high school sweetheart Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris in a strong, convincing turn). <br/><br/>When I saw the trailers for this film, I expected it to be yet another twisty murder mystery with suspect after suspect and a cliché resolution. But it was far from that. In actuality, 'Gone Girl' is a stunning satirical swipe at marriage, male-female relationships (whether romantic, familial, or platonic), and the brainwashed society that we unfortunately all live in due to media manipulation. It not only takes a general jab at high-profile national cases like the Scott Peterson, Casey Anthony, and O.J. Simpson scandal-mysteries, but also works as an indictment on the stereotypical humdrum institution that is married life. 'Gone Girl' looks at the how and why everything went wrong. We never get that as casual observers of the biased reporting from network ""news"". This film shows us!<br/><br/>The media part comes into play in the form of two key characters: a ""Nancy Grace"" style national news anchor Ellen Abbott (wonderfully played by Missi Pyle) and an ""Oprah/Barbara Walters"" style network interviewer Sharon Scheiber (solidly played by Sela Ward), both women who of course spin the story from Amy's point of view and try to paint Nick in an unflattering light as a cheating, abusive husband. The cheating part involves Andie Fitzgerald (hilariously played by Emily Ratajkowski), a 20-year old local college girl, one of Nick's students, that he is having an affair with. Another strong female character, Greta, is played with unapologetic sex appeal by Lola Kirke. I can't remember the last time that a film was filled with so many spot-on, perfectly cast female characters! And each of them have distinct enough personality to make them unique and interesting in their own way. <br/><br/>The sharp, witty screenplay was adapted from the book, both penned by Gillian Flynn, who was robbed of a Best Screenplay nod. Fincher's direction is brilliant, another glaring oversight. The movie is 2.5 hours long and there's not a dull moment to be had watching it. That accomplishment alone deserves recognition by the Academy! Affleck is rock solid as the film's protagonist and I like how he sheds his clean, glamorous, hero image to play a rather put-upon, ineffectual, loser-ish, yet sympathetic character. I usually have a hard time believing such a recognizable, star actor in such an unflattering, low-key role, but Affleck pulled it off. Perry and Harris delivered strong, convincing performances as well. I would also say that both Coon and Dickens were robbed of Supporting Actress nods. At least Pike got a nomination for Best Actress and based off of her incredible work in this film, I'd say the Academy gave the Oscar to the wrong person yet again!"
"Hopnut","1","2","5","6 May 2015"," It's all been said..
","Not a lot I can add to most of the 1 star reviews already posted.<br/><br/>Am staggered that people give this pap anything more than a 1 star, let alone a 5 star review!<br/><br/>My wife had read the Gillian Flynn book, and told me it was a good story, and so we were looking forward to watching the film.<br/><br/>The first two thirds of this film were actually quite good. I wanted to know more, but once into the home straight, it all unravelled and became this totally unbelievable load of old tosh, leaving more questions than answers... and the only answers were all head shakingly thin. <br/><br/>I cannot remember ever watching a film with more plot holes.<br/><br/>I was simply left feeling a great big fat 'As if'.<br/><br/>Woeful, woeful pap. What puzzles me, is how do films like this ever get made?"
"Mustang92","5","2","5","18 March 2015"," Enormously Flawed Storyline
","I didn't hate this film as so many others have. But as pointed out by many, the plot holes are major... however, let's start with the PREMISE, which is deeply flawed.<br/><br/>A woman is going to fake her own death, goes to all the trouble of drawing a pint or two of blood from herself, among many other actions. BUT, her writing treasure hunt clues?? Why would anyone write treasure hunt clues -- that she knows and intends for the police to find? This is a flashing billboard saying ""I'm alive""! Not only that, the police could test for her fingerprints on the paper; even at one point, the detective takes one of the envelopes from Affleck gingerly with 2 fingers, indicating the ""delicacy"" of potential prints. Yet the police NEVER comment upon whether the wife's prints (or anyone's prints) are on the notes. If the wife's prints are on the notes, then the wife is gone but alive somewhere. Follow the logic?<br/><br/>And there is no way that a man (Affleck) who wants to kill his wife, is going to write treasure hunt clues -- that then indicate his wife is alive -- yet continue to incriminate himself by WHERE they are placed. NO one would do this. Therefore, the logical deduction is that the wife is alive. And all the police have to do is test for prints on those notes -- which they never do as it's never brought up. If they did, the movie would be over 5 minutes after it started.<br/><br/>All the other massive plot holes seem to be covered pretty were in other reviews here.<br/><br/>One other thing: I also cannot buy that because the wife sees her husband on TV pleading for her to come home and that he loves her, that this is ENOUGH motivation for her to actually commit a very gruesome murder herself. This is not logical or believable on any reasonable level. Particularly when she did *nothing* to stop or fight back just 20 minutes earlier to the people who robbed her of money stash -- that was providing her with the ability to carry out this whole scheme. Asking us to believe she's been ""pushed"" or motivated to slashing a person's throat - - even if she is crazy -- this simply was not believable. It would have been more believable for her to knife her robbers 20 minutes earlier.<br/><br/>I did like a number of the actors, and much of the dialogue. Just wish it had been a better storyline overall. As talented as the director is, I am a bit surprised Fincher accepted/agreed to this script."
"vijayprasanna2896","7","2","5","16 February 2015"," an incredible roller-coaster of suspense and thrill that leaves you begging for more
","Once again David Fincher has nailed his talent as a director. Through Gone Girl he has set himself a level apart. A truly astounding movie with a chilling plot that leaves you dubious about your marriage. Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and Carrie Coon pull off one of the best performances I have seen this year. Tyler perry is also great though he could have had more screen space. I didn't quite get the role of Neil Patrick Harris but still doesn't get in the way of the experience. This is a movie isn't as great as Seven but still noteworthy in David Fincher's Filmography.<br/><br/>Conclusion : Truly a must watch. I experienced real suspense,dread and the thrill only a few can offer.Now Gone Girl is in that list."
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","8","2","5","6 February 2015"," I enjoyed it, but the ending nearly ruined it
","For its first hour, it is a well done murder mystery: did Nick Dunn kill his seemingly angelic wife? All signs seem to point to him, perhaps even a bit too much.<br/><br/>In its second hour, it successfully changes to, basically, a chilling portrait of this evil bitch plotting to frame her husband for her own murder. So far, so good.<br/><br/>But in the final 20 minutes, the story awkwardly, unsuccessfully switches gears again, and becomes a satire, giving us no resolution to the story, and expects us to ignore several gaping plot holes. We, the audience, were taking the story mostly seriously, but then we find out we were not supposed to, apparently, which makes the entire two and a half hour ordeal seem pointless."
"TxMike","Null","2","5","24 January 2015"," Based on the book, did he or did he not kill his wife?
","We saw this highly anticipated movie on DVD at home. I was a bit hesitant at its almost 2 1/2 hours running time but it never seemed overly long.<br/><br/>However when it was over it didn't quite feel genuine, even in the context of a fictional story. Something about the final scenes just didn't seem worth the long story that I had just watched. <br/><br/>The basic premise is straightforward, a man comes home and his wife of 5 or so years isn't there and a glass-top table is overturned and broken, but it doesn't appear to be a burglary. His wife isn't home and he is unable to locate her so he calls police. They find evidence that leads them to believe there was a struggle and a pool of blood on the kitchen floor had been cleaned up. <br/><br/>They begin to suspect the husband who initially cooperates with police but then hires a top-notch lawyer once it seems he is becoming the prime suspect. <br/><br/>The man and the woman are both very flawed people. We find out about half-way into the movie exactly what happened, and the second half of the movie is to understand the ""why"" and to see how things are resolved.<br/><br/>In spite of the ongoing criticism of Ben Affleck, he is a fine actor and he is good here as Nick Dunne, the out-of-work author who also co-owns a local bar with his twin sister in this Missouri community (filmed in Cape Girardeau) on the banks of the Mississippi River. His wife is Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne.<br/><br/>There are events and scenes that make you think but overall it didn't ring very true for me. Still it is an entertaining movie and I enjoyed it, but perhaps not as much as many fans.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Nick is devious, he has a very young 20-ish mistress on the side, but he is not a dangerous person. Amy is the crazy one, we see she had difficult issues previously with men, falsifying abuse reports. She suspects Nick is going to want a divorce and instead she plans to frame him with murder, her own murder, so before she disappears with a lot of cash and an untraceable car she creates a crime scene with her own blood, then cleans it up sloppily on purpose. She leaves a diary, and she tells us she will drown herself. But somewhere along the line she changes her mind, goes to see an old boyfriend, slashes his throat and kills him during sex, shows up back home with no apparent explanation but pregnant. So Nick appears to suck it up and stay with the crazy wife because they are going to have a baby."
"a-bognar93","5","2","5","21 January 2015"," Doesn't feel real
","SPOILERS !!!!<br/><br/>Other then the major plot twists not the most exciting movie and i am not particularly flawed by the idea behind it either.<br/><br/>My main concern is how the movie is trying to present the characters at least up until some point as a normal couple, although it is obviously not the case. Obviously it's not just that everything was fine and then they just stopped trying and caring for the other one at some point, but instead none of them actually cared about each other...ever.<br/><br/>And that is my main point, both of the characters are representing classic cases of sociopaths, in terms of they never actually show real signs of caring about anyone, instead it highlighted through the movie multiple times how they are using other people, including each other to reach their goals. It is especially true for Amy but the main thing, that is the catalyst to the action is how Nick is one of the many man who Amy dealt with for not being a caring person (and obviously not only a rightful punishment but really just part of Amy's nature), he obviously has an affair but doesn't seem to show truthful love towards that girl either, in the conclusion he stays with Amy not because of love but because of common need, and also very often does same type of things to his sister as well.<br/><br/>However even as we see perfect example of sociopaths they still don't fit the picture, first none of them really seem to pursue additional goals in life such as career and on top of that the chances of 2 sociopaths being a couple is quiet unlikely really.<br/><br/>Honestly there were some good and not-so-good acting and generally the plot as i mentioned had exciting parts, but the story was just so off that i can't say i want to watch it again."
"santoscorp","8","2","5","20 January 2015"," Well, we have our first clue.
","There is nothing more exiting than a plot twist in the middle of a movie. But what if it shifts emphasis on it as a key element? A variety of elements are going to be necessary in order for this to work. First, a Gillian Flynn's bestseller book and a screenplay written by herself will be needed. And second, a changeable director capable of adapting to different script situations. Due to his constant changes in filmmaking techniques, David Fincher proved to be the ideal leader to direct this project.<br/><br/>When the world of filmmaking opened its gates to me, one of the first rules I was taught was that music should not be included throughout the film, because it could affect the quality of performance of the actors. After seeing Gone Girl and David Fincher, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross in action, I believe that such theory could not be more wrong. The original score of the plot twisted thriller Gone Girl is one of the main attraction in this film, owing to its usage across almost every scene. This particular technique helped to keep the audience attention over the entire film. (In contrast to his movie SE7EN, where many scenes without music can be found). After watching the movie you will feel tempted to download the entire soundtrack. (""Like Home"" highly recommended).<br/><br/>Other particular element spotted here was the improved performance of Ben Affleck and refined style of Rosamund Pike. The first one left his cocky pretentious acting style aside in order to achieve a pragmatic human character, while the second one provided us a variety of accents that could fairly be described as convincing.<br/><br/>An old technique in the acting world says ""If you want to look like a psycho, don't blink and stare at the others"". No doubt this method worked for Rosamund, but what she did was absolutely well prepared, adding head movements and staring at the precise moment. Although she was not awarded for best actress in the Golden Globes awards, I consider her performance as the best of the season.<br/><br/>Gone Girl combines both daily life and fictitious events to give birth to a sick, brilliant and addictive film, where you can easily identify yourself with any character (Or want to be as one of them). Cheers to everyone, especially to David Fincher, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and of course to Gillian Flynn, the first step towards achieving a successful film is having an exceptional screenplay."
"tedicaprio","8","2","5","19 January 2015"," Rosamund Pike is Great!
","Rosamund Pike is Gone Girl. Despite the fact that the first quarter of the movie is commanded by Ben Affleck, she steals the show afterwards by being able to ""shape-shift"" into many things while being consistent about how to portray a real psychopath in-depth. The movie itself is, according to my boyfriend, mainly about perception, which I agree. At first, I felt I could relate to the character of Amy, then I found myself suspicious about the seeds of psychopath in me, which then I thought it was normal at some degree because I grew significant distance from Amy when she started to really stand out. Overall, I learn that you cannot assume anything without communicating with the object of your assumption. I also learn that you cannot make the slightest flaw in your acting, or else someone else will steal the show, like what happens to Ben Affleck in this movie."

","I won't list all the lousy plot holes this movie was embroiled in, but if you're looking for a suspense thriller like Mystic River or Prisoners, then stay away from this wreck.<br/><br/>The entire story is logically impossible, a woman faking her own murder sparks an entire man hunt, she later pops up after her plan goes awry yet the police don't charge her for false and misleading information. Instead they still treat her like a victim.<br/><br/>The police are all pretty stupid, the entire unit is taken on a roller coaster ride of lies, and fabricated fairy tales and yet they all seem to be wrapped.<br/><br/>The dumbest scene was her faking her pregnancy by apparently siphoning water from a toilet after a pregnant lady had urinated. How can a hospital not tell the amount of dilution in the urine?.<br/><br/>this film is full of bottom-shelf bullshit, illogical plans and unrealistic events."
"ironhorse_iv","9","4","14","16 October 2014"," Amazing Amy has gone it! Gone Girl has gone to great lengths to make a really good thriller.
","Ben Affleck's new Chasing Amy is a great 'who-Dunne-it' thriller! It's one of the better films, I saw this year. There's something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold. The film tells the story of a man, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) whom returns home on the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to find out, that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. What follows is a mystery full of twist and turns that would leave you, breathless. Director David Fincher and author Gillian Flynn really makes that connection. Amazing use of unreliable narration, plot twists, satire humor and suspense. While, the movie may looks like a Lifetime Movie of the week on the surface, the movie is way smarten written. It really go depth into exploring the psychology and the dynamic of a long term relationship. You really get the dark side of marriage through the use of lying, deceit, manipulation, and dissatisfaction. Not only that, but I love how much the movie really parody the media coverage of murder crimes such as HLN's Nancy Grace. Nancy Grace is known to jump the gun at times, when there is a high case victim allegation. A good example of these are the 2006's Duke Lacrosse case and the defamation of innocent suspect Richard Ricci in the 2002 Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case. She really often blames suspects for their crimes, with little to no prove of them, committing it. You really get the sense of defamation, and dishonesty that comes with being put in a media frenzy where suspicions are running wild. You really can see how Nick Dunne's awkward behavior could be interpreted as characteristic of a sociopath. This is Ben Affleck's best work in a long time. Still, the best acting is in the movie is indeed Rosamund Pike. She is just insidious throughout the movie. Very creepy performance. She will probably be in the 2014 Best Actress Oscar contender for sure. The supporting cast is a hit and miss. Normally awful characters actors like Tyler Perry & Missi Pyle are just god-awful, but in this movie for some reason, they gave their best acting to date. They were very entertaining. At the same time, other semi good actors seem a bit disappointing like Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex-lover Desi Collings & Kim Dickens as Detective Rhonda Boney. Harris looks and sounds more awkward than creepy. Very unlike his character in the novel. Harris even admits that his scenes were some of the hardest things he's ever shot. For Kim Dickens, she sounds more like a country bumpkin than a smart detective. Nick and Margo's parents aren't given nearly as much focus in the film. Adding the misogynist father would be a little boost to the plot. Once again, very unlike the character from the book. How Faithful Is David Fincher's Gone Girl to the novel? Without spoiling too much of the movie and book, the whole third act is new, but still have the same character arch. Author Gillian Flynn whom help with the screenplay, wrote a new esoteric happy ending for the film. It's by far, a better ending than the book. I really didn't like the whole memoirs idea from the book, anyways. There were a few missing characters and clues from the book, that wasn't in the film, but for the most part, those things weren't really needed. The movie is more brutal in the violence than the book. The whole sex scene remind me of 1991's Basic Instinct at times. I love the symbolism of the movie/book. Gone Girl is a story about puppet shows. Somebody is pulling the strings on the other, forcing their hands. Punch and Judy dolls are used throughout the film. Another one worth notice, is the board games in the beginning of the film. Mastermind & Life are used as background props as Nick talks about his anniversary to his sister, Margo (Carrie Coon). I love how the 'Amazing Amy' children books are foreshadowing the events to come. You really see how truth and illusion are woven into the fabric of the plot. You don't know, what's real and what's not about Amy's past. It also show, how foolish people are to only look at complex things in a simple one-dimensional childhood black & white matter. I love the word play within Amy's romantic treasure hunt for their fifth anniversary that has double meaning. It seems like romantic charming quest, but like everything else related to Amy: it's two-sided. One side is sweet and charming, while the other is insidious and vengeful. Amy is a wolf in sheep's clothing to the worst degree. I love the whole 'Cool Girl' speech. The Cool Girl speech has divided feminists over whether Amy is making a good point about women not changing themselves to fit the ideals of men or whether she's just condemning women who don't fit her ideal of what is proper behavior. Some critics might view the film as misogynist or misandrist. I have to say the movie is both. Both main characters are not good people. So, in every way, both shouldn't be viewed as a hero figure. What I love about this movie is how much, it change the genre. Here, instead of the psycho ruining the perfect wife's life, the perfect wife is the psycho. There were some things that the movie could had work on, better. It could had work on, more on the idea of how economy affairs marriage. I rarely see it in the film. Another would be fixing a few loose ends of the script as some of the prep ups seem kinda unrealistic. The movie is beautiful shot. The Eerie electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross sound a bit generic. It's a disappointment that it doesn't stand out. Overall: A well-made film that would end up as 2014 Oscar Contenders for sure. A must watch."
"DarkoPaligoric","8","4","14","15 October 2014"," Just great
","Maybe I'm overreacting but I really mean it. This movie was great in every way possible. Usually when people talk about this movie they go on about the plot of the story and even though it came as a surprise, there are other ways of talking about this movie.<br/><br/>First half is pretty basic story vise, main character finds his home violated and his wife missing. In that first half we get two view points, view-point of main protagonist Nick and the detective investigating this case. So as the detective is going deeper into the case, reading chapters from missing Amy's journal, we start suspecting Nick more and more but one can easily see that something is wrong about that picture which is presented to us. And that's as much of the plot that you're gonna get from me. <br/><br/>Everyone was doing his/hers job perfectly, not attracting attention to their work. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was perfect, for most of the running time i didn't really notice it that much, you'd notice it at just the right moments for just the good amount. Where a lot of people would try to use music to manipulate your mood. This was atmospheric at just the right amount.<br/><br/>Camera movement/angles are perfect, again a lot of people try to be showoffy with the camera moves/long takes/weird angles, but here everything serves only a story telling purpose. Like most of Finchers films, you could turn off the audio and still get what is going on because it's perfectly orchestrated. Also, the color palate is very fitting given the overall theme of the movie. <br/><br/>Performances range from good to GREAT. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck has been in some really good movies over the years but his acting chops were never exceptional. Here he shines like never before, and maybe it's because the role just fits him personally. For good amount of the time he plays a man who's imploding, with only few bursts of anger. Even though we, the audiences, were manipulated to hate him in the first half I kind of liked the guy, but will be the first one to say that he's an A-hole. A lot of people didn't like him but to me he's just your normal guy who you can find in your neighborhood. Given the overall them of the movie I'd say that pretty much all of his actions are right fitting and that most of the people judging him would probably act the same way (since I don't want to go into spoilers, I will leave it at this). <br/><br/>Rosamund Pike is THE STAR of this film, giving the performance of her career and I would be disappointed if there isn't a lot of Oscar buzz around it (but I also wouldn't be surprised if they ignore it because the Academy was never about honoring the very best). A lot of people are judging her character and her motivations for some of her choices but one thing that people tend to forget is that movies are not the exact representation of life,they're the illusion of reality. And also, we're taking about a sick mind that doesn't have a real 'I' because all of the media scrutiny she was exposed to. So her perception of morally right and wrong is different from everyone else's. But I can get people not buying into character motivations.<br/><br/>This is going over the edge and then some in sole purpose of making us learn something about our selves, in this case about how we're only mammals who are for majority of the time just an echo... How we're all putting on masks of what we find is the perfect self, and what happens when you get into route and start taking things for granted... But also giving a great commentary on mass media and again proving the point that people as a mass group are stupid, panicky animals. Given this theme the movies ending and choices characters made are perfectly fitting and is only logical. I haven't read the book, and I don't really want to because this did the job for me and the author wrote the screenplay so I know it's what was intended in the first place.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting Neil Patrick Harris's and Tyler Perry's performances too, but I wouldn't say they're anything other than good.<br/><br/>If there is a misstep it's that only after the twist happened, the detective started raising some questions as far as the Nick's innocence or the lack of it, there was no indication of it before. But she was judgmental from the very beginning about everything so I'll let it slide. <br/><br/>And in one of the sex scenes, which was very disturbing to say the least, penetration happened while Pike still had he underwear on... And yet few scenes later we get a way more exposing shoot of her in the bathtub. This movie was obviously not interested in censoring stuff so why? I guess MPAA would've slapped it with an NC-17, so I guess this is for the better, I was surprised to get this much into just an R and be so commercial. I'm loving that Fincher is getting this much attention and that a quality film making is third week at the top of the box office figures. Go see it, now!"
"thediggens","9","4","14","14 October 2014"," A chilling and highly contemporary thriller
","David Fincher is rightly regarded as a darling of modern cinema, and he continues this with his fantastic adaptation of Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. The novel was a best seller for months, and a piercing look at relationships in the 21st century, and the troubles of marriage. Of course, it does this with larger than life characters and a twist filled dark mystery, but its commentary is notable.<br/><br/>Gone Girl focuses on the disappearance of Rosemund Pike's Amy Dunne, wife of the Prime Suspect Nick Dunne, played by Ben Affleck. The potential kidnapping/murder is interspersed with flashbacks to the formation of their happy relationship, and its slow breakdown via Amy's diary entries. To say much more about the plot would be to spoil a modern soon-to-be classic of the genre, and it's certainly a film that benefits from the viewer knowing as little as possible.<br/><br/>With such a necessary limit on discussion of the plot specifics, one can suffice to say that the orderly becomes disorderly, nothing is as it seems, and the progress of the film, particularly its third act, is unexpected. But along the way the film takes aim at much of societies more recent ills. The media frenzy, the 'expert opinions', the social lynching, are all shown to be superficial and contradictory. Yet, they are also acknowledged as powerful and damning. The criticism of falsehood is less aimed at the media, and more of its followers.<br/><br/>Indeed, falsehood is arguably the central theme of the film, and no more so does it tackle this than in relationships. Nick and Amy's relationship over the course of the two and a half hours of the film is put under our intense scrutiny, and they acknowledge the inherent falsehoods that were intentionally present. Along the way there are legitimate criticisms, such as the aspiration of the so-called 'cool girl' male desire. The criticisms strike at society today, and once again Fincher has captured an aspect of society in a time capsule. Relationships in the early 21st century are accurately captured here, albeit occasionally taken to their extremes.<br/><br/>In terms of the cast, this is a a film that focuses on its leads, and Ben Afflect delivers one of his best performances here, ironically placed in a character who struggles to portray genuine emotions. Rosamund Pike however steals the show as Amy, an ex-writer who is buried under an inferiority to her parent's fictionalised version of herself (in children's books called 'Amazing Amy'). The supporting cast is impressive, including a truly creepy turn from Neil Patrick Harris, and Carrie Coon as Nick's rock of a twin sister.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay is penned by the novel's author, and while I haven't read the novel, most accounts are that it is an excellent adaption. The script is where most of the ideas really shine, and it crafts somewhere between a thriller teetering on a constant knife edge and one of the blackest comedies in recent memory. Certainly there was a surprising amount of laughter in the cinema.<br/><br/>David Fincher is once again a commanding presence behind the screen, and in that sense it's similar to his previous work. It's dark, it's brooding, and it tackles contemporary society (see The Social Network, Fight Club). Fincher often appears at his most comfortable in the thriller territory, and Gone Girl is no exception. Once again the score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, making their third film collaboration, and the music's sense of false happiness is true to the film.<br/><br/>The film definitely has the flavour of Fincher's later, more sophisticated nuance- as in Zodiac & The Social Network- rather than the rampant kinetic excess of earlier films (e.g. Se7en, Fight Club). If one must criticise, the end segment winds down awkwardly, and by comparison the film fails to capture the dialogue or tension of some of Fincher's previous work.<br/><br/>It is unlikely that this is Fincher's best, though that's partly because of his consistent high quality. This is a director whose generally worst regarded film of the last decade was an Academy Award darling. Gone Girl is a masterful film that proves his quality."
"jaemiewaters","10","4","14","14 October 2014"," Gone Girl is Oscar worthy
","Gone Girl is Oscar worthy. It was a thriller throughout. It was just a great movie. If you like thrillers then you will love Gone Girl. Gone Girl has been the best movie I have seen all year so far. It is one of those movies where if you don't pay attention to it you will not understand what is going on next.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a movie that everyone will want to go see. Now parents this movie is rated R for strong sexual content and some other stuff, but it is very good. I recommend this movie for anyone who liked the book. It is one amazing movie. This movie will most likely win Oscars because it was just a great movie. I hope this review was helpful"
"diac228","9","4","14","8 October 2014"," The Hitchcock is Strong in This One
","Gone Girl starts off with in an unsettling fashion, even throwing the opening credits quicker than normal. This makes the audience a little uneasy as the story begins.<br/><br/>And the audience will remain uneasy and struggling to catch up for the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is polarizing, intense, extremely jaded, and quite manipulating. David Fincher's fingerprints are all over the adaptation of the best-selling novel that alters the tone of the book to adjust better to the cinematic medium. From the direction to the spellbinding and haunting musical score, Gone Girl hits all the right notes, does an excellent job maintaining the tense mystery without becoming predictable, and leads an all-star cast (Even Tyler Perry was bearable) surrounded by talent in the art, cinematography, and production department.<br/><br/>What starts off as a simple tale of a quiet mysterious husband (Ben Affleck) worried about the disappearance of his wife (Rosamund Pike in a pure Give Me My Oscar performance) turns into a darkly stylish thriller with twists, turns, unexpected surprises, intrigue, and slick commentary on American marriage and the American media's mannerisms surrounding the news and the people involved in it. Similar to Social Network, it presents an interesting character and sociological portrayal while mixing in an exhilarating story to propel the movie forward.<br/><br/>Andthen we go in a very different direction for the final act.<br/><br/>In a style similar to Hitchcock's also-polarizing Vertigo, Gone Girl consists of two parts: the mystery and the consequences of the mystery once the conclusion has been unveiled. This makes Gone Girl practically two different movies that might be equal in tone but splits into seemingly opposite roads. While the film is 150 minutes long, the climax of the original conflict actually arrives much much sooner than the norm—just like Vertigo. And just like Vertigo, it's slightly tough to appreciate the unveiling of the wild card when there is still so much poker left.<br/><br/>The best way to describe Gone Girl without revealing any of the surprises and revelations is this: Gone Girl's first two acts are like a dark roller coaster you've never ridden before; full of turns and inversions that you will enjoy and consistently anticipate and request more of. The final act of Gone Girl is like a good roller coaster you've ridden before; where you can appreciate the thrills, appreciate the details, but at the same time make you wish you could be surprised more.<br/><br/>And----like Vertigo----if the movie had played out the mystery and the conflict a bit longer then the payoff would have been much grander. The timing of the payoff is extremely important in movies like this, it can make a movie like Fight Club and The Usual Suspects, or it can totally shatter a movie like Lucky Number Slevin (Oh, you don't remember this one? Of course you don't). Not to say Gone Girl loses too much momentum once the movie takes a jarring shift, but that second roller coaster ends quite abruptly, leaving you with a satisfied feeling with a side of emptiness.<br/><br/>But hey, there is a good chance that Fincher's intention was to never let you find your footing during the grim adventure. There is a good chance that Fincher had spent a good deal preparing a beautiful cinematic present without even considering topping it with a nice bow. Because at the end of the day, whatever timing and tonal shift issues the Gillian Flynn script presented, it was eradicated by the high value of the overall film. It is unique, it is breathtaking, and it will devour your thoughts long after the movie is over—if it wasn't any good, would I even spend so much time trying to figure out how to judge this flick? <br/><br/>Good movies are enjoyable, great movies linger in your consensus. Like the thickest of peanut butter gluing to the roof of your mouth, Gone Girl will meander in your thoughts as you continuously struggle to soak in all the grim, all the insanity, and all the sheer hurricane of subtle tension you had just witnessed.<br/><br/>If only it had less Vertigo."
"bridg-x","8","4","14","6 October 2014"," A refreshing thriller of a film
","A story about a man who comes home to his wife missing to then being made a prime suspect for her murder could make a predictable and forgettable film or an intriguing and refreshing film that is Gone Girl. David Fincher's thriller is easily one of the best we have seen this year. The film is visually stunning where Fincher's dedication to detail can be seen even as the opening credits role with the perfect sync of the shots and score settling you into a mysterious and edgy setting. <br/><br/>Expect nominations for screenplay as the dialogue is excellent. Being the author of the original bestseller herself, Gillian Flynn is the most obvious and perfect candidate for the screenplay. Something unfortunately we do not see enough of in films based off of books. The dialogue was in no way boring and every character was relevant and someone of meaning to the story.<br/><br/>I had honestly never heard of Rosamund Pike before this film. I briefly remember her delivering an average performance in Jack Reacher, but I had no idea what she would bring to this film. It's safe to say she greatly exceeded my expectations. Easily a nomination worthy performance as she forces the audience to love 'Amazing Amy' to then profoundly despise her. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck again putting another stamp on his soaring turn around of a career. A character one could easily over do, Affleck keeps a turn down and humble approach to his performance making Nick Dunne a realistic and very relate-able character. <br/><br/>Tyler Perry a great comedic relief for this intense thriller of a film. His presence brings great light and shade.<br/><br/>With such an intense and vigorous relationship between Nick and Amy it was really nice that the film showed a lot of the brother-sister relationship between Nick Dunne and Margo Dunne. Carrie Coon also another great comedic relief to the film, another realistic portrayal. Another aspect Fincher managed to accomplish was the balance of intensity and humor within this rather dark story. There always needs to be a break in the intensity and drama not simply for entertainment but to also make the story realistic as no one can be as seriously driven and dramatic all the time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I have to say that the character of Amy Dunne's high school stalker Desi played by Neil Patrick Harris looks to be a miscast. The man has amazing talents, however just wasn't believable to be this creepy and almost disturbing character in such an intense film. It just didn't seem to work and is one of my negatives for this film.<br/><br/>Another negative that really bothered me was the ending. This film is almost 3 hours long, and while at any point it doesn't slow down or become uninteresting, the ending could of been cut shorter. You could guess that the film would most likely end in an abrupt way and the films conclusion or ""aftermath"" continuously kept delivering those moments for it to then continue on. While doing this it just kept you reaching for that carrot and by the end you still hadn't got it. It does however do still leave you questioning not just the ending but the themes and message within the film. Very much so a thought provoking story. <br/><br/>Overall Gone Girl is a refreshing and enticing film that is one worth seeing. It's very hard to overcome the difficult prospect of ""reinventing"" the mystery/crime/thriller genre with the film keeping you guessing through and even beyond exiting the theater. The plots twists and turns were very well done and not at all predictable."
"gunnslinger1981","6","7","31","4 October 2014"," The better half and the not so better half
","Gone Girl is a truly great film half of the time. The problem with Gone Girl is that its also a truly bad film half of the time. But does the better half prevail? <br/><br/>For starters, its a gorgeous movie to look at. Would we expect anything less from the mind of David Fincher focused through the lens of Jeff Cronenweth? Its pretty much a given that a Fincher film will unwrap itself as cinematic candy. On the aural spectrum, Fincher films are equally as satisfying. The semi-recent union of Fincher and NIN front-man Trent Reznor, along with his producing partner Atticus Ross, have crafted a continuity of impeccable style over Fincher's last few efforts.<br/><br/>There's no denying that Fincher has etched his place atop his generation's Mt. Rushmore of cinematic style. Where Fincher failed to impress me this time, however, was with his sense of pacing. Gone Girl is a film which relies heavily on the convention of flashback, and the execution in and out of these flashbacks was repeatedly fumbled. The conventional ways in and out of a flashback are to cut, fade, or dissolve (never the cheesy dreamy dissolve though; that's no good). The method Fincher has chosen to employ here is the fade, but for some inexplicable reason he seems to have made a deliberate decision to clip these transitions unnecessarily short, executing them at nearly double their usual speed. The result of this is that important moments of resonance are lost on the audience. <br/><br/>A key example is when Amy's diary narration accompanies the moment where she crawls into bed, terrified of her husband, and she says the line, ""This man may actually kill me"". This is perhaps the most crucial line of dialogue in the entire film. Its actually the line that ended the trailer with a dramatic punch. But in the film, this punch is lost because the line is immediately followed by a quick fade that rushes us away from the tension of the moment. If ever there was a place for a slow-burning fade-out, this would be it.<br/><br/>This may seem like nitpicking to some, but I would challenge any contention wholeheartedly because what these clipped fades ultimately do is deprive the audience of an opportunity to segue from one emotional tonality to another. The transitions in Gone Girl are jarring, but not in any kind of provocative way. Instead, they are abrupt, and dare I say, even amateur. In the 2009 documentary This Is It, there's a scene in which Michael Jackson explains the importance of ""letting it sizzle"", of holding a dramatic pause to maximize its effect on an audience. In Gone Girl, David Fincher forgot to ""let it sizzle"".<br/><br/>There's a lot of buzz surrounding Rosamund Pike's performance in this film, and deservedly so. For the majority of the film she is truly a force of nature. She plays a sociopath so effectively that I for one will never be able to view her in another film without recalling this one. I'll always be wary that she is hiding something sinister inside that pretty little head of hers. Her counterpart, Mr. Affleck, is less impressive with his performance, yet its still an appropriate one for the majority of the film. Its appropriate because his character is essentially ineffective in every sense. Ineffective at gaining our trust, ineffective at drawing our sympathy, and ineffective at duping us into liking him (unlike Amy, who for all her evil character flaws is still irresistibly charismatic). <br/><br/>The casting of Affleck seems to be very deliberate choice by Fincher. Despite the thousands of ""Team Ben"" fans that undoubtedly exist, a large majority of the population still seem to dislike him passionately. I'm reminded of Kubrick's decision to cast Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the film Eyes Wide Shut. They were a couple whom people could sense were putting up a facade, and that translated beautifully into the film. Likewise, Affleck's un-likability, however unjustified, is in perfect harmony with the character of Nick Dunne.<br/><br/>In my above praise of the two leads I included the statement ""for the majority of the film."" The reason why is because despite how pitch perfect these performances were at times, they were equally as dreadful and unconvincing at others. Most notably, and ironically perhaps, when they had to actually perform their scenes together! <br/><br/>The series of ""falling in love"" flashbacks that comprise the first act feature some of the most melodramatic, feigned, and stilted performances I've seen all year. The chemistry between the characters is implied, but its never actually palpable between the two leads. Rosamund Pike, who delivers an Oscar worthy performance for most of this movie, is absolutely terrible during these opening scenes. Her line delivery is overly deliberate and artificial. Instead of talking to another human being she speaks as if she's providing the seductive narration in a Cialis commercial.<br/><br/>Affleck, on the other hand, can't seem to pull off his scripted charm with any real conviction. He's supposed to be the man who rescues Amy ""from all this awesomeness"". Instead, he behaves like a cardboard cut-out and flashes about as much personality as a glass of water. He's merely hitting his marks in these scenes, and it shows.<br/><br/>On balance, the gorgeous cinematography, rich score, and mostly strong performances throughout can't save this film, for this one seems to contradict itself at every turn. The strengths of the film quickly turn into its weaknesses, and for every clever plot twist there is an equally unforgivable face-palm moment (why the hell is Amy still covered in the blood of her captor when she returns home from the hospital?!??).<br/><br/>In the end, Gone Girl is a case in which the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. And when I say parts, no, I'm not factoring Ben's shower rod into the discussion ; )"
"fmonty-1","6","7","31","3 October 2014"," Overrated
","Went to see Gone Girl today and thought it was well below par for a Fincher Film. The acting is OK, though nothing special. The film is well shot, but with little of Fincher's usual flair. There is all this talk about Rosamund Pike's performance being exceptional, but for me the stand out performances in this film belonged to Kim Dickens as Detective Boney and Carrie Coon as Nick's sister, both of which were very believable and overshadowed the leads. I think the main problem is it seems like Fincher has adopted a more mainstream style to his cinematography and made the feel a bit to glossy and well, normal. I haven't read the book, but did hear that the ending had been changed, lets hope he shot the original ending for any special edition as the one in the final cut was a real let down. Lets hope he returns to form and comes up with films as good as his first few movies...<br/><br/>Overall not a bad film at all, just not a very good one either. Shame."

Did he or didn't he? <br/><br/>Very good movie. The story is interesting and always keeps you guessing. It's long (2 and 1/2 hours) and slow but I was never bored. The acting is great. Affleck and Pike are both incredible in their roles. There's strong support by Carrie Coon (as Margo, Nick's sister), Kim Dickens (as a police detective) and Tyler Perry (as a lawyer). The only acting debit is from Neil Patrick Harris who's terrible. The only problem is the ending. It's TERRIBLE! It doesn't really end--it just stops leaving plenty of unresolved questions and plot lines. That really hurts the film as a whole. Still I recommend it.<br/><br/>BTW there is no full frontal shot of Affleck. He appears to be totally nude in one scene but nothing is shown. You get a brief side glimpse and that's it."

","I give it a 7 for the first two hours then a 3 for the last half hour. Are we supposed to believe that the brilliant Harvard grad girl throws her entire meticulously constructed plan out the window after her loot gets stolen? It just lost the great flow it had after that and became another good start, bad ending film despite great acting and directing. It would have been better if her plans to see her husband in jail were delayed but fulfilled and then she shows up to witness his execution and the detective spots her and stops it, sort of like 'Black Widow' with Debra Winger, which was a much better film. Also, why didn't the conversation with the ex-boyfriend who was wrongly accused of rape amount to anything? It should have been the police interviewing those people, not the husband. Nice try, but lots of problems with the ending. Also if the husband was such a dolt, how could he give such a brilliant interview on the talk show? Totally inconsistent."
"mjgabriel83","9","4","15","6 October 2014"," Fincher and Co. deliver once again...Brilliant
","Bringing Gone Girl to the big screen is a balancing act that only David Fincher could handle. Those familiar with the book, which starts out as a portrait of a seemingly perfect marriage and quickly turns into a literary trip down the Autobahn, will not be disappointed. Fincher, working from a script adapted by Gillian Flynn, weaves through every twist and turn with ease, helped along the way by a beautiful, yet subtle score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The end result, a two and a half hour ticking time bomb dropped in your lap that you can't wait to explode. Once again, Fincher delivers a dark, twisted vision that is a perfect mix of all of his films, rolled tightly into one violent little package. <br/><br/>Gone Girl is the story of a decaying marriage, told through flashbacks, diary entries and interrogation rooms, where nothing is what it seems. Fincher, one of the most meticulous directors around, perfectly carves out each act like an ice sculpture, and then runs a chainsaw right through the center when you least expect it. Even reading the book and knowing what happens, I still sat there in shock at those ""holy sh*t"" moments. I can only imagine how it feels to see these scenes unravel for the first time. <br/><br/>The ""Benaissance"" is in full swing with Affleck as Nick Dunne, a role that no other actor in Hollywood could've done better. The entire casting is perfect, and it almost seems like Gillian Flynn wrote the book with these actors in mind. Nick's twin sister, Margo Dunne, is played by the Leftover's Carrie Coon, who continues her red hot year. Tyler Perry as hot shot lawyer Tanner Bolt was my only question mark going in, but he shut me right up. Neil Patrick Harris is as creepy as ever as Desi Collings, and even the underrated Scoot Mcnairy shines in his single scene as a boyfriend from Amy's past. But without question, the true star of this movie is Rosamund Pike, who is nothing short of ""amazing"", as Amy Elliot-Dunne. Amy is a) the titular character from a series of successful children's books, b) the loving, ""cool girl"" wife, c) a crazy bitch, or d) all, and none, of the above? Either way, she absolutely shines, especially in the major moments of the second and third acts. <br/><br/>Gone Girl paces itself brilliantly, and the way Fincher and Co. depict the twists is a thing of beauty. Everyone involved with this movie seems like a lock come award season, although the subject matter might be a bit much for some voters. Regardless, this is easily one of the best movies of the year so far, and it's sure to stick with you for days after viewing it. Gone Girl fires on all cylinders, even though it has one of the more depressing endings in recent memory. Just like anything Fincher touches, this is a must see, and in my opinion, it very well might be his best work to date. <br/><br/>For more reviews, check out EnterTheMindOfMadness.tumblr.com"

Too bad for the producers that I have relatives in Missouri and I went to college in Indiana.<br/><br/>What's crazy is that you really have to move far afield from Missouri to find an accent that was present in the movie. If they had used actors from Cape Girardeau, MO (where some of the filming was done, apparently), they would have gotten something closer to Kentucky than Huntsville, AL (the birthplace of Kim Dickens, who plays one of the main characters).<br/><br/>And yes, this really should be important.

Even though I knew what was going to happen it still had my heart racing. The style, pacing and direction is spot on from David Fincher and the cast are all fantastic.

"sohansurag","8","3","10","5 November 2014"," Marriage Material!
","I'd started reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl a few months back and a few chapters in, I thought to myself ""Know what? I'd give Fincher a chance with this one and then I'll finish reading!"" Since then I'd been patiently waiting for Gone Girl's release. I was excited what with Fincher being one of my favorite directors. The previews didn't tell much but still had that eerie touch to it that kept me waiting. Finally, yesterday I got to watch Gone Girl and without further ado I'd like to add that it was without doubt one of the best movies I'd seen this year.<br/><br/>Nick Dunne and Amy Dunne, upon losing their jobs and going bankrupt, relocates to Missouri and on the morning of their 5th anniversary, Amy goes missing. Investigation ensues and all eyes, including the media's, rests upon Nick who has no clue what happened to Amy. As the movie progresses all odds are against Nick and it becomes a crime drama thriller, a whodunnit putting all suspicion on Nick. Has he killed her or not? Nick also unravels some stuff about his wife. Gone Girl goes back and forth from the investigation and the media circus to flashback scenes where Amy narrates her fears about being with her husband. What's pretty obvious is that the victim is not who you think she is and throughout the movie you are trying to find out what's off with the whole scenario and at times you will find yourself perplexed as to who you should be rooting for, Nick or Amy.<br/><br/>I have always adored David Fincher's movies be it the ill-received Alien 3 or Se7en. Of course most of the his films are adapted from original source materials but on celluloid he does know how to deliver an intellectually supreme thriller. David Fincher plays all the cards right here and Gone Girl makes for an immersive, tense and compelling crime drama thriller. You yourself adorn the detective's cape and try to figure things for yourself but Fincher makes sure that you don't reach the conclusion that easily as he constantly throws twists and turns at you that glues you to your seats.<br/><br/>There's not one performance that could be looked down upon and along with Fincher's solid direction it all comes to a fine full circle. I remember seeing Rosamund Pike as a ravishing bond girl in Die Another Day and in many more mediocre roles from Doom to Wrath Of The Titans etc. Who would have thought she would deliver a performance that makes you go all dumbfounded. She went from vulnerable to intimidating to manipulative to sheer conniving. I'd say the best part about Gone Girl would be her. I'll just put this here, I am not a Ben Affleck fan and I was one among the many who cringed at the news that he was going to be the next Batman. I love his direction, I love his writing but I just don't like to see him screen. But its time to put all that out of the way. Affleck is solid here and gives one of his career-best performances and I am one step closer to tolerate seeing him on screen. Carrie Coon plays Margo, Nick's twin sister and she was adorably cute and her scenes with her brother were some of the best ones. Supporting cast also includes Tyler Perry, a celebrity lawyer who charges his clients a $100,000 as retainer fee and he does his part just fine. I am not used to watching Tyler Perry movies (thanks Madea), but some of the jovial moments were well done. Initially, I thought Neil Patrick Harris was an odd choice for a David Fincher movie but he gave an impeccable performance as well. Media also plays a major role in the movie and it almost plays like a character even manipulating you at times.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is beautifully shot. It looked as if the whole of Missouri looked mourning in Amy's missing and it takes a more warm tone during the films third act. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score is indeed an icing on the cake goes perfectly sync with the spellbinding visuals. Fincher's own The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was banned in India due to its graphic rape scene and I was skeptic if Gone Girl, with its domestic violence scenes, would walk down the same alley. I thank the censor board for being sensible and not doing so and also zooming in on the non nude parts than chopping off entire scenes made much more sense.<br/><br/>Mark my words, this movie is gonna test your bladders and you will feel like keeping it in so do go for this movie with an empty bladder and don't even think of that maxi size Pepsi at the counter. You wouldn't want to miss anything. Its close to 3 hours and the only times I looked at my watch was due to my impatient bladder than due to getting bored. Its that much engrossing.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a bit about marriage and what all can go worse in a marriage. Its a bit superficial, yes, but Fincher grounds the movie in a believable reality that it doesn't really matter. This isn't Finchers Magnum opus in fact it doesn't even come close to it, ie Fight Club. Nonetheless he manages to build a cohesive and immensely immersive Crime Drama that plays with your wits till end. Can't recommend this more!"

","Watching David Fincher's deliriously tantalizing whodunit ""Gone Girl,"" a melodrama about a troubled married couple wrestling with compatibility issues, reminded me of the film classic ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946) co-starring Lana Turner and John Garfield. Turner and Garfield played illicit lovers who arranged the murder of Lana's elderly husband so Garfield and she could indulge their lust. Eventually, each had second thoughts, and murder reared its ugly head. In ""Gone Girl,"" Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike experience somewhat similar woes. They are cast as a husband and wife who have lost their jobs and find their marriage unraveling with ugly ramifications. They embark on a nerve-racking odyssey through Hell with more outlandish things happening to them than you can possibly imagine—unless you've read the novel. ""Gone Girl"" constitutes another Hollywood adaptation of a runaway bestseller. Happily, for a change, director David Fincher hired bestselling author Gilliam Flynn to adapt her own work. Yes, I've perused Flynn's masterpiece, and she has exercised good taste and judgment in modifying her compulsive page-turner for the screen. Basically, this Twentieth Century Fox film release is about as faithful as any movie can be to its source material. Minor changes occur, and some characters have been eliminated. Nevertheless, nothing substantial has been altered. In other words, if you loved the novel, you won't hate what Fincher and Flynn have done with it. As much as I enjoyed ""Gone Girl,"" I'll concede the novel is slightly better than the film. Principally, Flynn cannot translate to the screen the depths of Amy's subversive thoughts. Meantime, Fincher has done an admirable job of orchestrating the 'he said; she said' shenanigans of husband and wife. Mind you, ""Gone Girl"" qualifies as more than just a spine-tingling exercise in suspense and tension where the authorities believe the husband is the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance. This movie succeeds on multiple levels as Fincher and Flynn skewer gender politics, scandal-mongering television news personalities, marriage dynamics, and essentially society in general.<br/><br/>Nick (Ben Affleck of ""Argo"") and Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike of ""Die Another Day"") are a sophisticated New York couple who lost their jobs as a result of the recession. When his mother is diagnosed with cancer, Nick persuades Amy to forsake her elegant brownstone in New York City, and they relocate to his North Carthage, Missouri, hometown. Amy buys Nick a tavern called 'The Bar' with her trust fund to keep him busy, and Nick's twin sister Margo Dunne (Broadway actress Carrie Coon) helps manage it. Meantime, Nick and Amy's marriage steadily erodes as trust issues and power dynamics exert a toll on it. A life-long city dweller, Amy feels miserably out of place in a small town in the middle of Heartland America with too little to occupy her imagination. She doesn't adapt as well to this dire change of scenery as her husband. As the morning of their fifth anniversary dawns, Nick leaves Amy at home and cruises into town to check up on his sister at the bar. No sooner has Nick gotten there and swapped shots with Margo than a neighbor calls Nick and informs him that his front door is standing mysteriously wide open. Rushing home, Nick finds pieces of furniture either smashed or overturned in the living room. Amy is nowhere in sight. Nick alerts the authorities. North Carthage Police Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickins of TV's ""Lost"") and Officer Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit of ""Almost Famous"") comb the premises and collect clues. Later, the North Carthage crime scene crew uncovers evidence of a huge blood puddle in the kitchen that had been sloppily mopped up. Repeatedly, Nick swears his innocence, but things spiral hopelessly out of control. He learns from the police that Amy was pregnant. Ultimately, in an act of sheer desperation, Nick hires celebrity lawyer, Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry of ""Alex Cross""), to defend him. Worst, the jealous college girl with whom Nick was having an affair exposes their adultery on prime-time television. Although the detectives have amassed an abundance of evidence implicating Nick, Boney and Gilpin have no luck finding Amy's body.<br/><br/>You could watch ""Gone Girl"" a dozen times and come away with something memorable each time. Fincher has fashioned a tense thriller just as immaculate and flawless as his best movies, including ""Fight Club,"" ""The Game,"" ""The Social Network,"" and ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Affleck is at the top of his game as the gullible husband with something to conceal, while Pike deserves an Oscar for the many faces that she forges as Nick's long, lost Amy. Neal Patrick Harris displays his chameleon ability to play a cross-section of characters. He emerges as one of Amy's warped lovers who once stalked her. Clocking in at virtually two hours and half, ""Gone Girl"" defies expectations—unless you're conversant with the novel. Just when you think you've got everything figured out, Fincher and Flynn twist another loop into their Gordian knot of a narrative. The effect is similar to being spun around about every half-hour and gaping at the experience. Beware, ""Gone Girl"" boasts a blood-soaked murder scene that is rather graphic, but this thriller remains extremely literate. Anybody who abhors HLN 'victim's rights' advocate Nancy Grace is going to appreciate the pompous character of Ellen Abbott who goes after Nick's scalp after Amy vanishes. Tyler Perry plays it straight as Nick's high-profile attorney Tanner Bolt who coaches him throughout the ordeal. In one scene, Tanner prepares his client for an important television interview. Each time Nick answers a question with either an inappropriate tone or expression, Tanner bombards him with jelly beans. Anybody who has ever complained about Ben Affleck's smug pretty boy persona will love this scene. As much as I would love to divulge some of the juicier scenes in ""Gone Girl,"" I cannot without spoiling the outcome. If you love husband and wife murder movies or murder melodramas altogether, ""Gone Girl"" shouldn't disappoint you."

","Gone Girl is the latest addition to David Fincher's long filmography as a director of suspense and mystery. This particular film focuses far more on relationship dynamics than any other of his films of the same genre, and does a much better job with it than his movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button did. Fincher has always been a master of camera and editing, but with Gone Girl, he proves he has truly mastered direction of the actors, and is in total command of everything on the screen.<br/><br/>From the get-go, Gone Girl poses its driving questions: what happened to Amy Dunne, and was her husband Nick Dunne involved? Ben Affleck is very convincing as both an everyday suburban man and as the possible kidnapper of his wife. The film toys with the audience's emotions and sense of direction with its unreliable narrators: both Nick and Amy. We get the sense he's a good guy, but there's enough reason to doubt. Supporting him is his sister Margo, played by Carrie Coon in a spectacularly nuanced and overshadowed performance. She is helping Nick every step of the way; that is until she develops doubts of her own. Is Nick Dunne responsible for what happened to Amy?<br/><br/>Our answer is handed to us on a silver platter in the middle of the film, a move that at first I thought was poor writing on Gillian Flynn's part. As the story continued though, I realized that this was necessary, because the story is not over, and the movie poses even more questions on the audience and soon you have no idea where the film will take you. It's a fun and terrifying ride all the way through.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is supported by great performances by Rosamund Pike, who deserves an Oscar nomination for displaying an amazing range of character; Neil Patrick Harris, in possibly the most shadowy performance of his career; Kim Dickens as the head detective of the investigation; and Tyler Perry, who provides great comic relief in an otherwise dark and twisted film.<br/><br/>As always, David Fincher's film features great cinematography (Fincher keeps his movie cinematic and distant by staying on a tripod and only moving in close when necessary), fantastic lighting to manipulate how we feel about the characters in certain scenes, and efficient editing (although in moments it doesn't linger where it should, some scenes end too abruptly).<br/><br/>The ending might leave some frustrated, as it leaves with us more questions, but by the end, it doesn't matter: David Fincher has shown us in terrifying glory what people are capable of doing to each other, and doesn't try to make us feel comfortable or safe for a second. I left the theater feeling disturbed. And I wouldn't have had it any other way.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","David Fincher is one of the two directors which can blow your mind ,and the other one is Christopher Nolan. Gone Girl is directed by the Mastermind behind movies like Fight Club,Se7en,The Social Network,Zodiac -- David Fincher -- He just completely blew my mind. Another classic from the ACE Director Fincher. If you think Gillian Flynn's Book is good then you are definitely gonna love this movie. Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as Amy Elliot Dunne ,as husband-wife, is a Mystery thriller with some amazing twist and turns that takes place with these couple and how the world & media reacts to them. Movies also goes deep into the thinking of a psychopath and his victim. Fincher directed the movie Perfectly, literally. Star of the movie is - Rosamund Pike - phew!! that girl just nailed the role of a lifetime, an amazing find by Fincher with a perfect role. Ben Affleck is good too but his character is not too expressing, so it was okay. Just 3 hrs ago i thought no movie can outdo the Fight Club, well that thought just got changed. MUST MUST WATCH!!!"

","I had read a strong review of Gone Girl in a newspaper at the release, then saw it corroborated with IMDb ""10"" reviews during the first week of release. I should have gone back to read more recent IMDb reviews before seeing it yesterday...which might have saved me from seeing it at all.<br/><br/>The production is excellent, the acting is strong, but the actors are stuck with what is a disaster of an ending. The key to the whole story is the state of Amy's mind, and I can't tell if we have witnessed her sinking into sociopathy or if she was always a psychopath. The demise of Neil Patrick Harris is unbelievable which pretty much makes the wrap up unbelievable. I sense Detective Boney sees through Amy's manipulation, but we are left to believe the detective is finished investigating. <br/><br/>I walked out seriously conflicted over what could have been an outstanding movie."

"z-a-pliskin","9","3","11","27 October 2014"," A taut, nuanced psychological thriller which demands the audience play detective.
","I'm going to start by saying, I absolutely love how this movie is polarising people. Just browsing IMDb quickly you get a sense that people either love it and totally understood the tone, or hate it and understood some of the tone but maybe not all. In my opinion of course. This is often the sign of a great film, better to be loved or hated than merely tolerated. <br/><br/>I got it. I really really enjoyed this. I watched it due to there being a fairly poor selection of other movies to stack it against that were showing in my area, and going in with no assumptions or expectations I was nearly blown away, and about halfway through realised it might be one of those movies I watch several times throughout the course of my life. <br/><br/>It's a lot of a things - another strong psychological study of sociopathy, a fairly well aimed critique of the tarnished sanctity of marriage (translation: marriage in this day and age is kind of a BS idea), an excellent use of the unreliable narrator plot device and in my opinion Fincher's best film since Fight Club. Yes, there are a few contrived coincidences and moments where the reality is heightened and stretched, but just remember - what if it's the character's recollection that has done this? Adds another level to the film and aids suspension of disbelief - it's the CHARACTER's bad storytelling, the film is intelligent and self-aware enough to allow this. <br/><br/>Most of all, I love that it's a prescient social commentary, subtly exploring how the power of the media has increased with soap-opera style histrionics and truth warped beyond recognition, something deconstructed throughout and bluntly summarised when Nick and smarmy half-wit reporter Ellen speak before the reunion interview and he gives her a piece of his mind (I'm trying to avoid putting in spoilers hence the vagueness). Two awkward moments - the smile and the photo - and the whole country is willing to crucify him as a hot-tempered, sociopathic cad and deify his missing wife, the blameless and pure golden girl, America's gorgeous sweetheart, the real life inspiration for popular children's character Amazing Amy - the fairytale effect as it applies to the news in real life, and the equally damaging effects of social media when used for the same ends. <br/><br/>The film is also smart enough to make the whole world and cast gray, rather than fairytale black and white, so almost any viewpoint postulated throughout could be a possibility. Maybe some of the wild speculations about the main characters in the film's version of news reporting could be correct... for example, Nick's relationship with Margo, is it a standard sibling thing or is there something unsavoury beneath? It's up to you to decide when and where the characters are being truthful, and if/when they are being misunderstood. If at all. It literally is one of those movies that could be interpreted a different way each time you watch it, your allegiances changed by the perspective you watch it in at the time, by subtle clues you may only just have noticed. <br/><br/>I could write pages on this, I really could. I need to see it again to remember all the little nuances that lurk within, the masterful touches that make this more than a cheesy TV movie with a higher budget. Affleck can act, something I'd forgotten as it's been a while since Good Will Hunting, and Pike plays one of the best femme fatales since Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction or that other one in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle - for me she is to movie females what Hannibal Lecter is to movie males, a cold and calculating psychotic who uses emotions like pieces in a chess game, for whom the satisfaction is creating a puzzle/trap and watching with glee as everyone stumbles into it like rats in a maze looking for the cheese. The audience is complicit in this - we have to run around looking for clues, playing detective, deciding whose truth is closest to the actual series of events. <br/><br/>Anyway, my TL;DR is the text I sent a friend of mine to summarise: If you haven't already seen Gone Girl, I'd highly recommend it. Dark, intelligent psychological thriller with some mystery elements and a careful helping of social commentary. Arguably Fincher's best work since Fight Club."
"LloydBayer","9","3","11","20 October 2014"," Gone Girl is a dark and cynical thriller that throws a wicked spin into the bells and whistles of modern-day marriage.
","Deliciously dark and wickedly funny, Gone Girl is a multi-layered potboiler that is every bit entertaining and compelling as it is disturbing and shocking. As both a crime drama and psychological thriller, nothing can prepare you for the whiplashing twists and turns that propels the story towards a rewarding and explosive finale, followed by ebbing shockwaves that will leave you in afterthought even after the end credits.<br/><br/>While there are several avenues of praise for this well-made crime caper, top credit goes to director David Fincher for what has to be his finest hour in the art of macabre storytelling. Adapted for the screen by Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name, a large part of that art stems from the systematic crafting of a story that is intended to deceive the audience into thinking exactly what the narrator wants you to think. Perception, derived from illusion, forms the backbone of this story, including how we first relate to lead characters Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his beautiful wife Amy Elliott-Dunne (Rosamund Pike). They live in Missouri after losing their jobs as writers in recession hit New York City. On the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick returns home from a bar he co-owns with twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) only to find a shattered coffee table and his wife missing. First on the scene is Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) who doesn't find Nick's answers very convincing. In fact, the more Nick is scrutinized the more he appears to be hiding something and within hours the media and Amy's friends and relatives are out for his blood. With Amy's disappearance becoming headline news, speculation rises and Nick becomes the prime suspect. Making matters worse, Nick doesn't appear to be worried about his wife's disappearance either.<br/><br/>Readers of the book will be happy to note that Flynn has also scripted the screenplay. In the wrong hands this film could have turned out pointless and vague – an undesirable yet unforeseeable byproduct of author-director mismatch. With Gone Girl, it's hard to poke fun or fault when the screenplay is adapted by the same person who wrote the source material. If anything, the script is fine tuned for the screen and matched only by the skill of the director, who just happens to be master twister Fincher himself. It's a perfect writer-director union as Fincher is not new to manipulating the audience into believing what they are seeing. That being said, the key words here are 'union' and 'manipulation', which turns out to be the flesh and blood of the story. On the outer layer this film might seem like a whodunit murder mystery, but at the core it is a comically dark social commentary about love and hate and the thin line in between. Before bringing that pot to a boil, Fincher employs a linear narration by allowing the mystery to unravel in real time alongside flashbacks that show how perfect Nick and Amy are when they first meet, to just how incompatible they become before the latter goes missing. Then there's the manipulation. It's not just about the Dunnes or spouse versus spouse or the disintegration of marriage as a spiritual institution. By the time we get into the thick of it, Flynn's commentary manifests into a trudging dark horse tethered to the manipulation of truth and justice, before galloping towards a pound-for-pound revenge finale.<br/><br/>Despite clocking at just under 150 minutes, this is a film not to be missed. Even with an absorbing story and the director's skill in telling that story, Gone Girl wouldn't have turned out half as good as it is without the stellar performances of all involved, including supporting roles from Tyler Perry as Nick's defense lawyer and Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's creepy ex-boyfriend. But come awards season 2015, Gone Girl could be in the spotlight for no other reason than Pike's sensational role that illustrates the idiom 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'. That alone should have a majority of viewers echoing the sentiment – W.T.F!"

","The main plot twist, which could only be a surprise to those who haven't read the book, is very predictable, but some of the later twists are neatly executed, although often credulity-stretching. The ending is nicely unpredictable and brings a pleasing sense of Just Desserts.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck makes a good fist of Mr Nice-Guy who may not be such a nice guy, but the movie belongs to Ms Pike. Her threatened wife is definitely not from the school of Doris Day in MIDNIGHT LACE; the echoes are rather more of Glenn Close in FATAL ATTRACTION or JAGGED EDGE, two movies to which this film owes a hefty debt. <br/><br/>The sex-and-violence quotient is fairly high, but I'm surprised the film didn't sneak below its 18 rating. Leavened with some humour, particularly targeting the media vultures who descend on the family house in outlandish numbers, this is at heart just a spiced-up version of the earlier screen melodramas (THE LADY VANISHES!!) which must have inspired the author. Hokum, quality hokum even, well scripted and stylishly directed, but not quite as ""classy"" as WHAT LIES BENEATH, another of the movies that I found myself remembering while I sat through this."

"dashoost","1","2","6","5 September 2018"," Gone Girl starring Ben Affleck: Worst movie of the new millenium
","It has been nearly 4 years since I painfully watched this nightmare of a film in a theater with a couple of friends who unlike me, sort of liked the raunchy and mysterious vibe Fincher created here. Really, I tend to think it was because they spent a good chunk of their hard earned, hard to come by moolah on a dismal cinematic experience. I have noticed lately, bad movies tend to give moviegoers a rather jaded feeling when they are faced with the reality of giving away that hard earned money for a mostly negative experience. The eventuality of it all happens when someone else they know, friends or acquaintances, find out they saw a new release and then ask them ""how was it?"" The painful answer that is given must mask the true reveal of being duped by Hollywood. Go ahead and lie about how you really feel about the flick, even if that means you will give someone else the thumbs up to go ahead waste 2 precious hours they will never get back in their life. Hey! if you don't like it too bad buddy, I did, or at least that's what I told you anyway. Technically, I didn't waste my money if I say I liked a movie, unlike you who is admitting you gave your money away. Unfortunately, misery does love company.<br/><br/>I have chosen to reflect on this film Gone Girl nearly 4 years later because I truly haven't ever felt like I did when I left the theater that night that I saw it. I recently stumbled onto a review of this movie on YouTube and my feelings have been excavated and I feel like coming here to express them for everyone and anyone who wants to read about them.<br/><br/>I can try to avoid re-iterating much of what I have read during some of the 1 star reviews already posted throughout this page so I will try and focus to what has stuck with me over the course of the last 4 years. I can clearly remember how angry and depressed I felt afterwards, lets just say I felt dejected by this movie. I could think of nothing positive or redeeming about it either back then or now. I mean what was the damn point of it all? Was Fincher trying to test the intelligence quotient of his audience by releasing a movie that had almost no point? Did he or the studio really think people were semi-retarded enough to go along with the mind-numbing stupidity that was occurring on the screen? <br/><br/>One question that has lingered around in my head is why did she kill have to NPH like that? Why did they have to sink to such a level of depravity by filming a man getting his throat slashed while climaxing? Afterwards, when she appears all covered in blood after so much time and money was wasted on her disappearance, why did no one really think to investigate her story? The line of questioning scene by the authorities while she was still drenched in blood was quite possibly the worst moments I've ever seen captured on film. I mean not in a B-movie MST3K kind of worst moment, but actually I feel like that scene is the closest I've ever come to feeling the pain of burning in hell. Of course the movie studio and filmmakers totally pull down their pants and moon the audience at the end by asking the viewers to accept that Ben Affleck's character is just going to accept it all and take it in stride. He will willingly go back with this disturbed, psychotic, schizoid woman. It's all OK that she killed her ex-boyfriend in cold blood but c'mon, love somehow conquers all, right? Even logic and simple basic reasoning according to those who were involved in peddling this garbage."

She decided to kill the ex, make it look like he kidnapped and raped her, and goes home one day. But Nick and the cops are suspicious of her tale.

And, what we get is this annoying back and forth frenzy between the paparazzi and the merciless media, which is exploited in a way that I've found to be disgusting, especially that of news anchor Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle).<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike plays a pretty good role in the villainous Amy, who showed no qualms and mercy in getting what she wants. There is some really good suspense in thinking how far Amy was going to hide her indiscretions before Nick was going to catch up to her. However, Ben's Nick role seemed so wooden and clueless that it made it seem he couldn't find his way our of a paper bag at certain points. He was not engaged or emotionally attached to the role, which made the movie drag. And, Neil Patrick Harris was completely out of place in the movie playing the filthy rich and spoiled Desi Collings (enough of the lavish vacation home already).<br/><br/>The plot goes at a steady momentum - not fast or slow.

"Hawkensian","9","2","6","20 February 2015"," Gone Girl is a dark, suspenseful and brilliantly twisty thriller with a sharp satirical edge
","I saw Gone Girl back during its theatrical release and I had so many good things to say about it that it became a hard article to write – it's easier to severely criticise something than to steep it in praise. The film really felt like an event, the widespread advertising had roused the interest of many people I knew. The trailer had certainly roused mine, it was an 18 certificate domestic thriller that really compelled me to wonder 'Did Nick Dunne kill his wife?' - I was sure that David Fincher would answer the mystery with his trademark style and vigour.<br/><br/>Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' haunting track 'What Have We Done To Each Other?' filled the huge and completely empty auditorium as I walked into it, immediately creating the film's rivetingly dark, aberrant tone. The instrumental continued during the film's opening, which I expected to be another of Fincher's elaborate introduction sequences, but was actually far more understated. Dunne's suburban Missouri neighbourhood is captured in a slick, foreboding manner by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, who has collaborated with Fincher on Fight Club, The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br/><br/>The film's first hour is riddled with a very ominous ambiguity. With his insouciant, equable manner, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) appears to be a likable protagonist who is taking his shocking situation perhaps too much in his stride. As new details emerge from the case, however, we begin to wonder whether Nick's nonchalance is a manifestation of a callous, sociopathic mind.<br/><br/>There's not much more I can really say about either character or narrative development, as the film has a great twist. It is perhaps a spoiler to even say that, so I will stop. I was pleased to find that the film is just as good second time round, especially if you're watching it with someone who hasn't seen it, you can experience the film's twists and turns vicariously.<br/><br/>In addition to its excellent plotting is a sharp satirical edge; Gone Girl's satire on the media is far more cutting and resonant than anything in the dull, self-satisfied and heavy-handed Network (1976). Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle) - the brassy, brash presenter of a Fox News inspired current affairs programme - doesn't wonder about Nick's curiously relaxed behaviour, she declares with absolute certainty that Dunne is a sociopath who has murdered his wife. Abbott obnoxiously raises her voice as she shamelessly peddles bias and hatred to masses of people, inviting 'experts' to falsely corroborate her toxic claims. As the film progresses we see the extent of Abbott and her programme's fickleness and yellow journalism.<br/><br/>As the media circus that literally surrounds Nick gets increasingly hysterical and dangerous, the threat of mob violence seems only moments away until Nick recruits Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), an affable and brilliant lawyer. Bolt's relish for challenging situations and unwavering confidence is very comforting for both Nick's and the audience's nerves - Perry gives a great performance as the amusing, quick-witted executive.<br/><br/>To support Cronenweth's attractive photography and the wide, cinematic 2.35:1 format is the aforementioned excellent score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The score is a collection of electronic ambient music that ranges from the peaceful with Sugarstorm and Like Home to the dark and disturbing with What Have We Done To Each Other? and Consummation, which is a sound straight from hell.<br/><br/>Reznor and Ross are very adroit at creating music that perfectly fits and enhances each scene. Reznor gave an interesting insight into the collaborative methods between Ross, Fincher and himself in an interview with Hit Fix –<br/><br/>""We made the decision to make music we felt belonged in that world, not for scenes, not for characters. We absorbed the script, we thought about the space it was in, the feelings involved, then spent a few weeks composing music from an impressionistic point of view, subconsciously almost, to run by David to ask 'Hey, does it feel like it's in the right world?''<br/><br/>This approach was 'right on the money', inspiring Fincher which in turn further inspired Ross and Reznor.<br/><br/>The Academy is routinely criticised for omitting quality films from their nominations and commending works that don't deserve it. I think this year's greatest insult is a Best Picture nod for the comparatively insipid American Sniper over this delightfully warped psychological thriller. They nominated Rosamund Pike for Best Actress at least, but I can't discuss her show-stealing performance here.<br/><br/>93%<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

","Granted, I'm behind on finishing-up my 2014 watch-list, and I still have ""Interstellar"", ""Birdman"", ""American Sniper"", ""Whiplash""(late edit new#1) and ""Nighcrawler"" on my watchlist, so there is still a lot of sorting- out to do in terms of my 2014 top 25 list. BUT, for now, ""Gone Girl"" is at the top.<br/><br/>That's out of about 50 viewed films from last year.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is an absolute immersion into a great murder mystery. The plot seems to be ever-evolving, and the whole thing is bolstered by some fantastic performances from a great cast. The six largest roles(Affleck, Pike, Harris, Perry, Coon, and Dickens) are deftly handled. Tyler Perry is probably the best surprise here, but everyone is good.<br/><br/>The film has pitch-perfect pacing. It doesn't wait too long to get into the main plot, and most of the character-development is done via flashbacks, and just enough is used to both give us some background, but not tell us too much about the 'character' of these characters. Most of that comes late in the film, and that's good because it helps the audience reserve judgement.<br/><br/>Trent Reznor's music is toned way down from say ""Social Network"", but I think that's appropriate for a film where the plot is the main course.<br/><br/>The entire movie is ""less fancy"" than FIncher's previous work, but it's right up there with everything else. On my ratings I have it a smidge below ""The Game""(#2 of 1997), about even with ""Social Network""(#2 film for 2010), ""Seven""(#2 of 1995) and ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" (#2 film for 2011),.. it's a touch better than ""Zodiac""(my #5 film of 2007) and ""Fight Club""(#9 for 1999)... it's a lot better than ""Curious Case"" and ""Panic Room"", neither of which made my top 25.<br/><br/>This film throws out some pretty big twists in the last half-hour. It couldn't have ended any other way, but the ending is certainly one aspect that might detach this film from it's audience as we really want to see what happens next - but isn't that a trademark of many great films?<br/><br/>I highly recommend this. I went-in with some pretty high expectations and it did NOT disappoint.<br/><br/>The three others I watched it with concurred..very...good...movie. Albeit less re-watchable than some of his other works - if for no other reason than the genre. I'd still like to watch it again though.<br/><br/>88/100<br/><br/>It could have used just a touch more scoring, and perhaps a bit more of Fugit and Dickens' cop scenes to further explore that side of things, but overall, it's very good, and it will certainly hold onto a top 5 spot for 2014. Can it hold onto the top spot? Dunno, we'll see."

All clues point to the aloof husband as a missing wife cast is investigated. The whole town helps to figure out the whereabouts of Kate. I was hoping for more aha moments but it became so far fetched it disappointed me. I must give it credit for being an extraordinary tale and it had me guessing all throughout. Ben Afleck did a superb job in a part that seemed made for him and Ms. Rosemund Pike did a great USA accent. Three out of the four stages of this movie is great."
"j-penkair","8","2","6","2 February 2015"," Human Is Horror
","I am a fan of horror films, but this drama / thriller manages to be scarier and more horrifying than the branded horror ones. It reveals how brutal and violent some people can become, while some others try to be moral and sane. I have this effect almost in every one of David Fincher's films, especially ""Seven"", ""The Game"", ""Zodiac"". He digs into the dark side of human heart, and found. I believe Fincher use a few selected unusual individuals as a platform to tell his stories, but it somehow feels a lot more universal than that. He makes us feel that these dark sides are all over and not at all unusual. Look at the character of Amy. Hers is not what one would easily come across. But we feel most natural to see her roaming around and planning her next sick moves. This is David Fincher's gift. He tells someone's story, and it becomes everyone's story. I am not native to the US, so I can't critique on how realistic it is as an American story. I saw some bashing at this film, perhaps to get its rating down a notch or two. But it feels real and around for me. An article is recently released on how and why Americans are so attracted at killing themselves. There is a linkage between the article's thesis and this film's plot line. A very free society has its weakness: it is so free a weak soul can feel so unattached and get blown away by just a breeze. In fact, I had been in the US for a few years, and start to understand how ordinary and un-winnable it feels to be an average American. The country has achieved a great success as a society, millions still yearn to go there, and yet it keeps pushing people for more and more. Is this by way of explaining random shootings, school killings, and serial killings in the US? If so, ""Gone Girl"" should be renamed as ""All Gone"" or ""Almost Gone"" to be appropriate."
"RyanCamplin","8","2","6","2 February 2015"," One of the best thrillers in years.
","Gone girl is an excellent thriller with so many twists. It keeps you guessing through the entire film, I thought it was a little slow on the uptake, but as the film goes on, you realise it really needed that slow start to help build up the image of the perfect life slowly falling to pieces. The quality of acting is brilliant, especially Rosamund Pike. The only exception being Missi Pyle as Ellen Abbott who I thought was awful, I cringed every time she was on screen. But don't let that ruin the film for you. I must admit, the ending lets the film down a little bit. After sitting through a two and a half hour film, you want an eventful end, something that makes it feel worthwhile. Unfortunately, it just kinda finishes... it's an interesting but largely unsatisfying end. I would have rated this film a 9 if the ending had have been more satisfying. Overall, one of the best thrillers in years, needs to be watched."
"Qwillprojects","7","2","6","2 February 2015"," Gone Girl...who came back
","Gone Girl was advertised as the suspense thriller of the year! Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. The only way to break this down is to break it apart, as the film began it wasn't long before I knew what the plot was (about when Nick arrived home to his missing wife and a staged break in). I said to myself ""oh the wife did it, she's setting him up"", the reason this was evident was because there were no other characters of importance introduced in the film it was only logical. Nonetheless, as I watched this plot unfold with Nick trying to stay one step ahead of the police, who desperately want to pin the murder/disappearance of Amy on him. About halfway in, a little over an hour Amy's ingenious plan is revealed about how she goes about framing Nick to get him put in jail. Now Pause right there, at this point the movie could have ended and been a very solid film. But there was still an hour and 20 minutes left, where we go to see a string of what I would call pointless short films attempting to tie into the first half of the movie. There was no real Need for Tyler Perry's character, he did not add or subtract from the film. Rosamund Pike stepped out of her typical supporting female role to command your attention in this performance. Understanding this was an adaptation from the book, there are things that the book can elaborate on that film cant, or shouldn't for that matter. In this case David Fincher should have found a better way to execute the third act."

","The movie starts out as the story of a couple, and it evolved a lot, in a complex manner, but predictable(at least to me). The acting was very good, the plot was also realistic, what people should really get from this movie is that not everything they see on TV is true, and that appearances are deceptive, good and evil are concepts we shouldn't be hypocrite about or take for granted just because some other people tell us what the definition of those two words are, and I believe this movie has done a marvelous job of questioning our 21st Western society's moral dogma, more than offering us with an interesting story. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to all people, except minors, because of it's violent scenes."
"nurit-horak","2","2","6","21 January 2015"," lacks credibility in it's portrayal of women characters
","""Gone girl"" is a dramatic film (2014) directed by David Fincher (""The Social Network"")with Ben Affleck. The film follows the story of Nick and the disappearance of his wife Amy. Amy and Nick are presented from their early days as a couple, through the bumps in their relationship and up to the film dramatic conclusion. In the film are three main female characters: Amy, Margo (Nick's sister) and Rhonda the detective (Kim Dickens). The three portray a spectrum of female representations from the most problematic one (Amy) to the most positive (Detective Rhonda). Amy is seemingly the perfect woman. She begins her life as a daughter to parents who write about every experience she has as a child in a successful book series called Amazing Amy. Although the success of the books allows Amy financial freedom it also interferes with the relationship between her and her parents, since it is clear that Amy could never be so perfect as the character her parents have created. On the other hand it seems that in her relationships with men Amy tries to be ""amazing"" as possible or at least in the relationship with Nick as the film describes a sequence of events that mimic a romantic comedy with no connection to reality. Unfortunately this lack of credibility also appears in the rest of the events of the movie. <br/><br/>The two other leading women characters in the movie are less interesting than Amy. Margo, Nick's sister and best friend, serves as a backbone as she supports all her brother actions. Margo is supposed to be Nick's twin sister but while Nick is portrayed by Ben Affleck, the actress who plays Margo is nine years younger than Ben in real life and that gap is clearly visible on screen. I found it very annoying. It is not clear why it was necessary to categorize the brother and sister as twins. this example also shows the problem of age difference in Hollywood where young actresses often portray a much older women and men play younger men, and that of course has implications on the way viewers see the way a woman should look like in those ages. The third and more positive is Rhonda the detective. In fact she is portrayed in such a good manner that there is no particular meaning for her being a woman and it was possible to cast for her role a man instead with no apparent transformations in the film. She is very professional, tough, honest and serious at her work (much more than all those around her). I would not recommend the film for anyone who sees herself as a feminist, because it is very problematic toward women. I can not specify without spoilers but I'll just say that what no movie has done since ""Fatal Attraction"" with Glenn Close (1987) this movie dares and by doing so jeopardize so many years of feminism."
"jergschmidt","2","2","6","14 January 2015"," Annoying
","Filmed in an annoying green color, the actors, especially Rosamund Pike acts rigid and boring. Not much room for enthusiasm here. The story is OK, the ending is, lets say, different. The movie is intended to be different in photography and style, but it just doesn't work; it feels rigid and foisted. With another director the movie would be quiet interesting; the story is fascinating. But the acting is somewhat rigid and uninspiring, up to a point where it starts to annoy you. And the green color doesn't help! Ben Affleck is not the most skillful actor, and certainly a better director than he is an actor. I think he could have done a much better job making this movie."
"gradyharp","6","2","6","8 January 2015"," 'My God, this place literally smells like feces.'
","Gillian Flynn wrote the best selling novel and then adapted his own success to the screen. David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en, The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Panic Room, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, etc) directs this twisted tale of hate and anger and passion and deceit and obsession and the minds of sociopaths, and out comes a film being considered for an Oscar. Wow, are we all really into this?<br/><br/>On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck, chubby and out of shape) reports that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police (a very well cast Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit et al) and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? Nick's sister Margo (Carrie Coon, excellent) is supportive and grounded, Nick's lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry, never better), Amy's previous lover Desi (Neil Patrick Harris), and a television interviewer Sharon Schieber (Sela Ward) and other actors who can't be mentioned because doing so would give the plot away make this very long and sick film work. <br/><br/>So, very superb acting from everyone involved, careful direction that makes sure the audience is able to witness all the disgusting twists and turns of this warped story make it obvious why this is an Oscar contender. As a story it is a profoundly sad commentary on marriage, the paparazzi, gossip, television news casting, and our current hunger for sick stories that fail to resolve anything. Watch it at your own risk – and with an antiemetic handy."
"D_Dijkstra","6","2","6","15 November 2014"," Not worth your money if you've read the book.
","If you know how the book ends, I would not recommend that you spend money to watch this film. The book is much more complex and layered than the film, while the film has a relatively simple narrative which strongly simplifies, while nothing much is added to the original story except for a parade of explanations. I believe that the central plot twist, which is clear enough from the first shot, is explained a total of six times. Are there really people out there who need something explained to them six times in the space of half an hour? Also, the role of product placement in this film is a further indicator that the people who made this film believe that you are an idiot. One of the first lines of dialogue between Nick and Amy goes something like 'I see you're drinking some delicious Belgian wheat beer'. Then, a bottle of Hoegaarden takes up half the screen for some time. After this ridiculous display, it takes around half an hour to feel remotely sympathetic towards the leading characters. If I heard someone talking about Belgian wheat beer in such a manner, I would punch them in the head. Later, in someone else's fridge, there's your bottle of Hoegaarden again. Not to mention the first few minutes of the film, which are basically an advertisement for Volvo, and the brand name SONY that appears on screen every ten minutes. I imagine that this movie is quite good if you have not read the book which I strongly recommend, and if you can get past the fact that you are being force-fed advertisements throughout. I should also mention that Neil Patrick Harris is a bad actor."
"LouisGur","9","4","17","3 October 2014"," The best thriller I've seen in a long time.
","It's finally time for another David Fincher movie. I've always loved that director due to many reasons. He makes fantastic thrillers in a way that only he can do. Last time, he did a remake of the Swedish movie The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which I personally thought was really good. Even better than the Swedish version. So now it's time to see if Fincher can turn another best selling book into an amazing thriller, and yes he can.<br/><br/>To keep it short and not spoil anything, Gone Girl is a movie about Nick Dunne (played superbly by Ben Affleck) who's wife disappears one day. After a short time, many suspects that Nick might not be innocent. Throughout the movie the story gets more and more exciting, and I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. The movie had a lot of twists and was never predictable. What's even better is that the movie barely included violence. But Fincher does something to make this two and a half our long film very exciting.<br/><br/>To begin with, all the actors did a very good job. I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck, but he was really good in Gone Girl. Just like Neil Patrick Harris and Rosamund Pike. They did a lot to this film. Secondly, the story is very good. The plot might be something you've heard before, but it develops really well throughout the movie. The soundtrack also helped the film a lot, it was a great. And of course I can't forget to mention the superb directing by David Fincher <br/><br/>Overall, Gone Girl is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. It might not win an Oscar for best picture, but it sure has enough potential to get nominated. I had high expectations for the film, and the didn't disappoint me. Gone Girl is a strong 9/10.<br/><br/>PS: It was nice to see Patrick Fugit back on the big screen, I haven't seen him since Almost Famous. Although he didn't have a lot of lines, he still did a pretty good job."
"stickbob123","10","4","17","2 October 2014"," You Won't Soon Forget ""Gone Girl""
","At first glance this might look like just another who-dun-it mystery thriller with a star-studded cast, but this film stands out proudly from the rest in that typically clichéd genre. The mystery unravels slowly and meticulously, forcing the audience to spend time with characters that they can rarely be sure of. Sympathies shift uneasily from one character to another and from time to time, everyone on-screen seems repulsive, but it's impossible to look away. <br/><br/>It plays out like Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" or Clouzot's ""Diabolique."" Like these two films, it starts with a catchy little plot that lets you ease into the world of the film as you prepare to watch a fun little mystery, but then it plunges into depths that you never could have expected. The first hour could have been pulled out into a full-length movie, but it's not content to stop there--it drags its audience into some dark, twisted places, but it never stops being completely immersive and exciting. It pulls all of that off through some subtly beautiful cinematography (as can be expected from Fincher and Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer), and very quiet, but intense performances. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike both do an incredible job at giving the audience brief glimpses at powerful, but buried emotions.<br/><br/>Maybe not the best date movie ever made, but most certainly one of the most effective mysteries of the last few years--""Gone Girl"" delivers like you can't believe. My advice is to stop reading reviews and just go experience it for yourself."

Affleck's performance is campy at best as he trudges around looking like a deer in headlights for most of the movie. The movie also has a ridiculous and completely unbelievable ending. What is the director trying to say? For 90% of the movie the story was realistic but the end? Please.

Gone Girl is able to take the plot of its movie which is tragic as is and spiral it out of control to the point of no return for the characters. The performances were all fantastic and Rosamund Pike was very well deserving of her nomination for best actress. Sadly the reason this doesn't fall under the category of a Perfect Movie for me is because of Neil Patrick-Harris' performance, whenever he was on screen I was taken out of the movie a bit, he should stick to comedies.

","First time I watched Gone Girl, I was like, Wow! What a mystery! Performances, drama, the screenplay... all perfectly put together. (SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>We've sure seen plenty of male psychopaths, serial killers, pedophiles and rapists (inspired by real life characters). But here's this pretty woman, petite, a successful author, a celebrity of sorts! Who could imagine her to be a serial killer? Killer of boy friends and partners. And she has many methods of killing up her sleeve, apart from knifing.<br/><br/>I watched it a second time yesterday, after a gap of probably 3 years. Something struck me while watching Gone Girl this time. A strong underlying narrative was palpable. A narrative that was very familiar to me, personally familiar. That which is created to cover up a public secret.<br/><br/>In the words of Michael Taussig, a Public Secret is that which is generally known, but cannot be articulated...not being able to say anything is like testimony to its power.<br/><br/>That women are not believed or trusted when they report domestic violence, sexual assault or rape, is a public secret. As opposed to this, the popular narrative seeks to project women as liars, indulging in scheming and cheating, who would not desist from assaulting themselves for framing someone (usually completely innocent) out of lust, jealousy, greed or vengeance.<br/><br/>That's precisely the perception created by the film.<br/><br/>The female protagonist's character has been modelled on that of a psychopathic paranoid criminal personality (someone in need of psychiatric treatment).<br/><br/>However, instead of projecting her as such, she is projected as an intelligent and successful modern woman loved and admired by one and all. She is, yet she is not the psychopath who would go to jail in the end. She is one of many. She is one of us.<br/><br/>Surely she is a split personality. As opposed to the charismatic public persona of hers, her private persona is made of secrets, lies and crime. She's over-ambitious, manipulative and very cleverly abuses the laws meant to protect women. Completely black, no shades of grey.<br/><br/>In the first half, she is a role model for all women of her age and time and in the second half she is a woman who has falsely and wrongly trapped at least 3 men, including her husband; she has framed them in serious criminal offences with meticulous planning and flawless execution. Though most of these offences are committed by her herself, including murder. She gets the better of everyone, the police, lawyer, media, neighbours, her parents, the boyfriends and her husband. No one's a match for her criminal mind.<br/><br/>What do you get when you put these two sides of her personality together? That women who are intelligent, smart and successful are capable of feigning being raped and assaulted and will do so if dissatisfied with their husbands or partners, for any reason. Beware ! Watch out for these women ! In parties, at workplace, anywhere and everywhere.<br/><br/>The husband, on the other hand, is a charming, good looking, handsome guy, who makes some mistakes, acknowledges them and apologises for the same. To become likeable again, from the most hated man in the country. He's been deceived and trapped by his own wife. He's neither all black, nor all white. He's human, he's normal.<br/><br/>The last boyfriend before her marriage is another innocent guy who's only fault was that he wanted to step back a little. He's prosecuted for rape, pleads guilty and is serving his time. He cannot get a decent accommodation or job because he's listed on the sex offenders register. All this when the sex was completely consensual, in fact she was the one who was desperate for it.<br/><br/>The boyfriend from school guy, is so gullible, that he gets trapped twice and pays with his life the second time.<br/><br/>Well ! By this time my head is full of all the rape investigations and court trials I've witnessed or read the files or books about. Where the typical story is acquittal, because the raped woman was lying, cheating, concocting stories and creating all those injuries and false documents. It was like Amy just got out of a court file and enacted the courtroom version of her in the film, along with all the other characters.<br/><br/>Was Amy's story told from Amy's perspective? Or did Amy find herself under a Male Gaze ?<br/><br/>As audience, would we able to discern the standpoint of Amy or would that remain a public secret ? Would the audience know what not to know ? Even if they do, would they be obliged to act and think as if they don't know what cannot be known ?"

The other part of me thought there's no way a person would be okay with that and just live with it and not try to do something about it. on second viewing I loved it. I thought it was a perfect ending that made perfect sense for the story leading up to it and summed up the characters perfectly. the third time... now i think the ending is pretty genius and possibly the most unexpected outcome anyone could have thought of.<br/><br/>But seriously, she kept his sperm?!?! so crazy.

"asocialis","5","1","2","25 April 2019"," Too long, about spouse distrust!
","This is one more movie about psychopath, but this time it is woman. And a bit of one man maybe. Love problems, marriage, being a liar, distrust, disappointment, society, crime, suspects, complicated stuff. It teaches us to be more aware of who we fall in love with and who we marry. It is too long, and story is a bit unfinished, it doesn't end clearly, and more likely returns to beginning. If you like drama you should watch this. But if you are looking for thriller, action, crime, you may disappointed by this movie, as it is filled with too much talk and drama. You know, the boring slow useless stuff. For such unclear story, it should definitely lasted at least as twice as shorter than it really is. I liked the topic, that is relationships and psychopaths, and in that such things are reality. This film is reality. There are emotions like hope, trust, hate, anger, and disappointment. Downside is that this lasts too long, meaning requires a lot of time and energy to watch."

","Doesn't matter how many times I've seen it, It still grips me and catches me off guard every time. The book was pretty damn good, no question, but Fincher takes Gillian Flynn's novel/screenplay and elevates the words into hypnotically watchable cinema. Easily his most unusual cast(Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris and TYLER PERRY?!) and yet every single actor is PERFECT and even though she wouldn't have been my first choice, Rosamund Pike is incredibly sinister and calculative as ""Amazing"" Amy and definitely earned her Oscar nomination for Best Actress that year. It's not Fincher's most provocative or disturbing work but it's still one of his very best films and without a doubt worth more than one viewing to really take in the collage of performances, story, music, sound and indelible images. It's truly one of those movie you should before you die"
"tabuno","7","1","2","15 January 2019"," Over-rated
","14 November 2014. I suspect why this movie is getting rave reviews and good box office turnout is due to its sustained measured suspense as a dramatic thriller where the who done it element becomes convoluted and layered with great emotional intensity as the audience is seemingly and subtly manipulated throughout the movie as to Ben Affleck's character and the apparent absence and presumed demise of his wife. Things become extraordinarily complicated that gives the audience a continuous shot of neurological brain transmitters of titillating endorphins.
One other pertinent fact that impacts my own personal experience watching this movie is that living in Utah where Susan Powell disappeared who lived in West Valley City, Utah and whose body was never been found and Josh Powell, her husband, was suspected in her disappearance and who later killed himself along with their two children. There were many parallels between this real event and Gone Girl.
But perhaps I am getting old; and watching this movie I'm reminded of Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in The War of the Roses (1989). If the movie had stopped two-thirds of the way through the movie with the first major twist, I might have really enjoyed this movie in its totality, but it continued with this odd twist that seemed like a guise for greatest as a film. Needlessly the audience is forced to watch a rather predictable sequence of events that seem creatively amazing but somehow it just seems tacked on with the appearance of genius. I can understand why this movie would seem innovative and offer up some new revelation of the human psyche not see before on the big screen.
Perhaps its just I was unfortunately lucky to begin to put the pieces of this mystery thriller together too soon, but this overly long, in places overly slow paced movie became too predictable, foreshadowing its scenes and the ending. For awhile the plot and characters were fascinating, the plot intriguing but eventually, the movie just seemed very good. Others might conclude this movie portrays a rather unique, albeit rarely seen complex characters who diverge from the ordinary two dimensional personas. While this might be true, there is something off-balance but not in aesthetic way, but detracting way. What David Fincher is striving for is one of the most difficult achievements in film directing. His effort is commendable, if somewhat unsatisfying for me. If the movie had been shot in the style and tone of say cerebral spy thriller The Russia House (1990) or Ben Affleck's The Sum of All Fears (2002), Gone Girl would have come across more in keeping with the icy, frigid psychologically tension and dramatic tone of the theme of the movie. One of the best examples of this conflicted tone might be Brad Pitt's character and performance as scripted in Interview with A Vampire (1995) or his scripted performance in the dramatic crime thriller Killing Them Softly (2012) or even Nicholas Cages scripted portrayal in The Weatherman (2005) or Daniel Day-Lewis in the drama filled There Will Be Blood (2007). Even the classic bitter sweet relational drama and alcohol-riddled theme of The Days of Wine and Roses (1962) has the oil and water imbalance that however is deliciously sweet and sour tone that this movie might have been well to have captured. Or take Nicole Kidman's harsh but memorable role in Margot at the Wedding (2007) or her role in Dogville (2004) or what happened to Brad Pitt in the superb mystery crime thriller Se7en (1995). Other edgy movie themed and uneasy but dramatic riveting movies that capture the paradoxical tone of beautiful ugliness include William H. Macy in Edmond (2006), Sam Rockwell's fascinating character in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), the dysfunctional family of American Beauty (2000), or Tom Cruise in Collateral (2004) even whose title is reflective of the dissonance of a battle where innocence is destroyed. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in director Stanley Kubrick seemed to capture both the cinematic beauty and the uneasy alliance between the unusual, fantastic in an artful and sinfully beautiful way with characters that sometimes lack in moral turpitude in his Eyes Wide Shut (1999) or take the sociological business war with its incumbent cold calculating businessmen of The Social Network (2010). Even Leo DeCaprio seemed to capture the decadent attractive sleaze character in The Great Gatsby (2013) or his performance as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). What seems to be missing is the more balanced background of the development of the relationship, a better visceral sense of the characters as they evolve which is conveniently missing during the movie, except with deliberate shocking sometimes unflattering flashbacks which was seemingly achieved with one character played by Christian Slater in He Was A Quiet Man (2007). The real fault in this very difficult film is that absence of the depiction of the behind the scenes of the false facades and the real persona essences of which even the characters themselves are unaware so as to reveal the hidden pane in Johari Window."

That is why movie failed here, else it created a high expectations from beginning.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is good. Very good acting for betrayed & confused husband apart from his Batman's role or other heroic roles. Rosamund is perfect wife as requirement of role. Kim Dickens as detective is super.

"Leofwine_draca","6","1","2","21 January 2018"," Fincher makes this worthwhile
","GONE GIRL is another epic-length feature from director David Fincher, in which he gets into the nitty gritty of the material like few other directors can. This one's based on a bestselling novel about a wife's disappearance in which the finger of suspicion falls on her own husband. It's a good whodunit-style mystery which twists and turns throughout and keeps you surprised with some unpredictable moments, but I did find it rather long-winded and suffering from a lack of likeable characters. In Fincher's hands it's an enjoyable film, and it's certain that both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike rise to the occasion to deliver lots of intense character moments. But at the same time I didn't really feel anything about what I was watching, and some of the moments feel very artificial and contrived, as if they could only come from a writer's mind rather than happen in real life."
"JamesHitchcock","5","1","2","17 January 2018"," Silk Purses and Sow's Ears
","When beautiful thirty-something Amy Dunne disappears from her home in North Carthage, Missouri, her husband Nick, a writing teacher at a local college, falls under suspicion of her murder. It quickly transpires that their marriage was not a happy one; Nick was having an affair with a teenage pupil and there are also suggestions that he may have been a reckless spendthrift and a perpetrator of domestic violence. The case arouses considerable media interest, as Amy was the inspiration for a series of popular children's books written by her parents. Although bloodstains are found at the housed, the main weakness in the police case is the absence of a body and the investigating officer, Detective Rhonda Boney, wants to give Nick the benefit of any doubt. When, however, the police uncover Amy's diary, which reveals that she was living in fear of her husband, Nick is arrested and charged with murder. <br/><br/>At this point, about halfway through, ""Gone Girl"" appears to be turning into a standard whodunit-cum-courtroom-thriller which will doubtless end with a climactic trial scene in which the truth about Nick's innocence or guilt will be revealed. That, however, is not how the film plays out. Now comes the first in a number of plot twists: Nick is not only innocent of Amy's murder, she has not been murdered at all. She is, in fact, alive and well, having arranged her own disappearance and framed Nick for her murder. (My apologies to those who don't like spoilers. This is the sort of film it is virtually impossible to discuss without writing a spoiler. <br/><br/>There are some good things about this film. Rosamund Pike is good as Amy, as is Ben Affleck, an actor who in the past has not always been a favourite of mine, as the hapless Nick. There are some decent supporting performances, especially from Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister Margo and Kim Dickens as Rhonda. David Fincher handles the direction and there is some effective satire directed at the media which take an obsessive interest in the case and an irrational dislike to Nick, whom they automatically assume to be guilty long before the police have even formally charged him. (In Britain, in order to guarantee a fair trial, we have laws preventing the media from commenting on cases which are still sub judice, but the American courts have always taken the view that such rules would be an impermissible breach of the right to free speech). <br/><br/>And yet this is not a good film. It is difficult to make a decent film without a good story, and that is something which ""Gone Girl"" conspicuously lacks. I have never read the novel on which it is based, so do not know how the story would work on the printed page, but it never works on screen. The main problem is that Amy never emerges as a remotely credible character, and the fault lies not with Rosamund Pike but with the way the story is written. Nick is indeed guilty of infidelity, but the other matters of which he is suspected, especially matrimonial violence, turn out to be inventions of Amy who wants to make her diary as damning as possible. If Amy had wanted to punish Nick by obtaining a divorce we could have understood her, even sympathised with her. What we never understand is why she should have conceived so violent a hatred for him that she wanted to see him executed for a murder he never committed, a fate most of us would not wish on our worst enemies. <br/><br/>Amy's original plan was to commit suicide, thereby providing the police with the missing piece of evidence, her body, thereby sealing Nick's fate, although it is never explained why she thought that a forensic examination would not reveal that she died by her own hand, thereby securing Nick's acquittal. Nor do we ever understand why she should abruptly abandon this plan and return to the husband she so loathes and despises, explaining away her disappearance as the result of a kidnapping by a jealous ex-boyfriend (whom she has conveniently murdered in the interim). The only plausible explanation is that she is completely deranged, but even as a psychological study of madness the film is never convincing. (If Amy is indeed mad, we never discover how she became mad in the first place). The best actors, and the best director, in the world will never succeed in making a decent film out of a story as badly written as this one. Silk purses and sow's ears come to mind. 5/10"
"Fem1982","6","1","2","30 December 2017"," Should have been an 8. Let down by the last 30 minutes
","Firstly, I would recommend that people watch this film. For the most part it had me hooked with some interesting ideas and nice plot twists. Affleck was good at walking his character along the line between likeable and unlikable (probably because this is the way that Affleck comes across in real life), and Pike's acting was sound until towards the end (which I suspect is more to do with the directing than Pike's acting skills). <br/><br/>Sadly, the film was let down by the last 30 minutes, which came across as rushed and/or overly edited. The storyline became totally unbelievable and I was no longer able to suspend my disbelief. Which was a shame because I feel the potential was there. <br/><br/>So here are the SPOILERS...<br/><br/>These are the plot holes that I took issue with:
1. Why did Amy suddenly lose all ability to be duplicitous when being interviewed by the police when she had managed to ""keep in character"" for months or even years before this?
2. Why did the police/feds not see anything unusual in her behaviour, especially as we had been made to focus so heavily on Nick's behaviour earlier in the film? 
3. Why did the doctors let her return home with her husband so easily when she had said how afraid of him she was?
4. And why, oh why, did Nick stay with her when he knew she had committed murder and tried to get him arrested and killed?!!!<br/><br/>I think there would have been scope to justify the last point through Nick's desire to keep the house and bar but this was never effectively conveyed. I also feel that Nick should have been darker in character, which would also have helped justify the end. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I really wanted this to be an 8/10 but, alas, I really don't think it is."

","David Fincher continues to show what a master of controlling an audience through cinematography and editing, as well as showing his ability to once again elevate a popular novel into one of the better movies of the year. The only thing holding this one back from being on the same level as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and Fight club is the sometimes fine, most of the time laughable, and always distracting performance from Ben Affleck. Even with the disappointing lead, Gone Girl is absolutely an above average film, and is absolutely worth seeing."
"VishalVijayLeo","7","1","2","3 May 2017"," David Fincher's touch and Gillian Flynn's Script
","'Gone Girl' is a well made movie with David Fincher gracing the movie with his usual style and Gillian Flynn penning a strong script. I have not read the book yet therefore is in a position where I can't really say anything about how different the script is from the book. But the script was decent and manages to juggle the movie's time lines and themes without causing much ruckus.<br/><br/>I think Ben Affleck's wooden acting was perfect for this movie and gave his character a very authentic charm to it. Rosamund Pike, on the other hand, transformed herself into the multidimensional character of Amy and gave a brilliant performance. Overall, 'Gone Girl' is a good movie with nothing new to offer but still manages to add a new spin to a movie which basically is about the domestic tensions between a man and his dear wife."

","I understand why people didn't like this movie. There were lots of mistakes. Lots of unanswered questions. A tidied up episode of CSI it's not. But is that the reason we watch movies? For me a good movie is about keeping me captivated, entertained, and I need to feel something for the characters. This movie did that and more. Ben Affleck and Carrie Coon were very convincing as a loving brother and sister. Rosamund Pike's performance as a psychotic killer rivaled Glenn Close's performance in Fatal Attraction. While I would probably not hire Tyler Perry's character to defend me for murder, his performance was a breath of fresh air. And then there is Kim Dickens. She was soooo good as the lead detective on the case, she should have been nominated for an Oscar. I felt for these characters, they captivated me,and I genuinely wanted to know what was going to happen next. And that makes for a good flick in my book. <br/><br/>I was disappointed however in how the movie ended. And to elaborate on my earlier comment, there were plenty of plot issues, loose ends, and things that didn't add up. For that it doesn't get a perfect 10. Not even that close to a perfect 10. But I feel sad for people who only like movies if they answers all of their questions. They are missing out."

I was really happy with the casting choices and how it follows the plot of the book so closely. Also, round of applause to Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike who kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie even though I already knew what was going to happen. You could tell they put a lot of hard work into it and they both fully embraced their characters and it payed off. It has a pretty long screen time of 145 minutes but it doesn't drag for a minute.

Not only was I surprisingly impressed with Ben Affleck in this film but the entire supporting cast did a tremendous job of selling this tense set of circumstances.

"kcx-18044","Null","1","2","4 October 2016"," Gone Girl is a decent thriller.
","Thrilling and disturbing. By far, David Fincher's best movie. Intertwined with disturbing appearances of the main characters, the movie is filled with odd occurrences and dark comedy. It contains enough suspense and mystery to keep the audience gripping at the edge of their seats. The movie is about a former writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his glamorous wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) who present themselves as a lovely, endearing couple to the public. However, the image of their perfect union is shattered when Nick's wife goes missing on their fifth wedding anniversary and Nick becomes the primary suspect of her disappearance. This description of plot might not sound interesting but the twist is that the wife, Amy has planned her disappearance and has left clues for the police in order to framing her husband for her disappearance because he was unfaithful and cheated on her with another woman. In the end, the police find Amy and the couple surprisingly stay together. However, the couple does not stay together but because Amy has once again cunningly forced Nick into staying. Nick know he has no choice but to continue this relationship and maintain his faithfulness in order to protect his child from the child's mother, Amy. In this movie, Ben Affleck takes on the role of a man with a serious personality like he normally does and does an excellent job with executing his role. However, Rosamund Pike did an even better job at executing her role. She had a hard job. Rosamund Pike had to step out of her comfort zone and play the role of a cunning yet crazy woman, an interesting combination, which she took on magnificently. In addition, the combination of the eerie music and dark lighting at certain scenes throughout the movie provided an intense, suspenseful atmosphere. With the actors' fantastic acting skills and Fincher's incredible cinematic skills, the story of the dysfunction couple's love and communication magically comes to life. I would recommend this movie to someone that is looking for an exciting thriller who is not afraid of disturbing content and concepts."

I also appreciated the twist in the movie and they also had very good actors portraying the characters. I'm not a huge Ben fan, but this was a really good performance from him.

","Right from the beginning let me say that I loved this clever movie, which is many notches above the average thriller.<br/><br/>However my plot hole detection antenna, fine-tuned over hundreds of episodes of ""Columbo"", ""Morse"", ""Wallander"", ""Jesse Stone"", ""Lewis"", ""Silent Witness"" and of course, ""Poirot"" and ""Miss Marple"", pinpointed an unresolved plot element, which probably would have added yet another cute twist at the end.<br/><br/>What happened to Greta and Jeff, the two lowlifes who rob Amy at the motel? They guessed that she was hiding out, but logic would have to tell you that with all the publicity, sooner or later they were bound to realise who she was, and they would know that Desi Collins hadn't kidnapped her at her front door as she claimed.<br/><br/>Being total scumbags, surely they would have seen the opportunity to either blackmail her or sell their story to the media. Maybe they were in jail or dead but something needed to be explained. It would have added a nice little piece of business for Amy to overcome, or at the very least the thought of the two of them still out there would have given even more ambiguity to her final look to camera. Anyway it's a nagging detail that just seemed to leave a hole in the internal logic of the film; Greta and Jeff are simply gone.<br/><br/>Maybe plenty of others have picked up on this point, but as there are 1,076 reviews of ""Gone Girl"" on IMDb as of this writing, I haven't read them all. Also to date, this point hasn't appeared in IMDb Trivia or Goofs as a plot hole.<br/><br/>With that off my chest, I love how the story turns on its head at the midpoint. I don't think giving the big surprise away so early was a problem. After all Hitchcock did it many times in his movies, believing that the suspense came from the audience waiting to see when the protagonists will find out what is going on.<br/><br/>Like all Fincher's films this one has a dark, ominous look; I can't ever see the guy doing comedy. I also admire the moody, atmospheric score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.<br/><br/>Great movie all round; a clever story with plenty of layers, stylish direction and perfect performances, but there is still just that nagging little detail"

","I just got done watching this for the first time.<br/><br/>It was good. The first 45 minutes were gripping, riveting, and almost flawless for this type of story. It was the captivating type where you don't blink- very good filmmaking.<br/><br/>The next forty five minutes were good, but it changed into more of a comedy with laugh out loud funny parts, which while it was entertaining, from a critical perspective I preferred the mysterious stuff. Still, it mixed in the seriousness enough to not fully stray too far into satire.<br/><br/>The ending got back to riveting, but I was someone who was anticipating a big climax of wacko proportions. While it was disturbing and captivating, it didn't end how I expected.<br/><br/>Still, I have to give it props. This one will be hard to forget, and that's usually the case with a good movie. It reminded me a little of Basic Instinct a few times. Very shocking, insane, and the madness on display is of the utmost psychopathic levels, including Neil Patrick Harris' character.<br/><br/>This movie took madness to an all new level and heights is my general analysis. Finally, I'll mention that I liked there were some undertones and depth to the story about how the media portrays things inaccurately and I thought that was a nice addition for modern day mystery like this. It's very true. A starlet writer is really a crazy psycho, goes missing, the media turns it on the husband, they kill him in the public eye, then she returns and they can cash in on book deals and the popularity.

"sandnair87","9","1","2","5 May 2015"," Marriages are Made in Heaven? Not in David Fincher's Universe!
","The problem with Gone Girl, David Fincher's first rate adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel, is that there's relatively little one can say about the film's gnarly plot without giving away the twists. So I'll step lightly over the plot synopsis.<br/><br/>On the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to Amy (Pike), Nick Dunne (Affleck) returns to their small-town Missouri home to find signs of a violent struggle and his wife missing. The police arrive on the ""bit-too-arranged"" crime scene to find specks of her blood, as the search fast gains national attention, with the media circus rolling into town in a frenzy of crass curiosity. The more the cops investigate, the worse it looks for Nick as his responses are unfairly interpreted as too cold to be genuine outpourings of grief. The noose is slowly tightening around Nick, who it turns out is harboring a few secrets of his own. Despite his best efforts to appear sympathetic in front of the cops, the cameras and the court of public opinion, Nick can't help coming off as insincere and smug. But a mid-film twist turns the movie from complex whodunit into a psychological thriller. The shift doesn't come entirely out of nowhere and in spite of the tonal shift, everything feels naturally derived, taking us from sympathy to revulsion and back again to sympathy for the central protagonist. <br/><br/>Gone Girl bounces back and forth seamlessly from the investigation and the attendant media circus to the horrific dissolution of a fairy tale union. The audience is always kept one step ahead of the characters thanks to extracts from Amy's diaries and a series of flashbacks, which show that a once-idyllic marriage founded on sizzling mutual attraction has begun to flounder on acidic mutual disdain. The storyline itself is pure pulp – a twisting, lurid crime tale with uncannily familiar elements. But in the hands of an immaculate craftsman like Fincher, Gone Girl is a sleek work of art that polishes its literary source, leaving all of the story's vitriol and venom intact. The black humor of the film consistently bites as it spews bile all over the sanctity of marriage. Fincher orchestrates the drama beautifully, providing the film with a steady, unhurried pace that proves perversely effective as it starts to shred the audience's abraded nerves.<br/><br/>The lead actors have a palpable chemistry that helps construct the narrative of two loving individuals crumbling under the weight of marital infidelity. Ben Affleck's self-conscious presence translates into an indispensable part of his character, imbuing Nick with an ambivalence that leaves us uncertain about whether we should be cheering or booing him, even when the narrative is ready to throw him to the wolves. Rosamund Pike leaves nothing behind, delving full throttle into an iconic performance as Amy. She uses her cool exterior to mask a seething lump of volatility - an intoxicating blend of slow burn and volcanic flash – that makes her an overwhelming presence. The supporting cast also delivers wonderfully realized performances.<br/><br/>David Fincher's graceful cynicism proves to be the perfect channel for this comedic tale of moral decay that remains one of cinema's most supremely cynical statements about the institution of marriage."

","I don't review movies often but after seeing the horrible reviews people gave this movie I had to say something. It is not near as bad as people say. I liked it. It kept me on the edge of my seat and ended completely different then expected. I like movies with twists but apparently people here just want hour and a half movies with explosions and an easy plot to follow. God forbid you actually have to think about something. <br/><br/>If you like psychological thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat, watch the movie. Don't let a bunch of whinny people keep you from watching this, judge it for yourself, Im glad i didn't base my choice off the poor reviews. <br/><br/>Its something I've never seen before and I like that. Apparently people on here don't like to think or watch crazy plots, but hey what can you expect from a country thats most watched show is Keeping Up With The Kardashians?"
"best_value_vacs","8","1","2","29 March 2015"," Excellent acting, suspense, and certainly kept me guessing.
","( This is being written in my 'simpleton mode' because I was typing all day before watching this film, but hope the points get across:)<br/><br/>The acting was awesome. The sets were true to life. The main actress played a great psychopath. As a musician/composer I strangely enough did not notice the music. That means either it was dull or it was so good at seeming together the moods of the film that it went past the ears straight into my subconscious mind. <br/><br/>Now as far as the story line goes, I felt the lack of any images of his wife on all of the media coverage was unrealistic and it seemed to lessen the chance that the girl she befriended at the hotel would ever connect the dots and rat her out. The film reminded me of how much I really hate mainstream media and Nancy Grace. Living out of any spotlight has been a real privilege. People shouldn't wish for such icky things. The last 30 minutes could have played out in any of a number of ways. One of which I would have taken (too?). I can't say, that would be a spoiler;) Bottom line, the film was a very good suspense thriller that kept me captivated. By that last 20 minutes the I think just about any viewer would feel they were being shown a top notch movie simply because of the awesome acting. The 'Elvis' attorney was a bit shallow, but that was the point. The sister was the leavener of the film and added the warmth that seemed to missing from the psycho wife's parents roles. The pen pal ex boyfriend was performed very convincingly. Overall, an 8 out of ten."
"danbeebe3","3","1","2","27 December 2014"," An Intriguing Plot with a Distressingly Unsatisfying Conclusion
","First of all, I'm not one of those low-lifes who watches movies for the sadistic pleasure of finding the most minuscule plot hole, inconsistency, discontinuity, or incongruency. I can suspend my disbelief and let chaos theory and mystery preside, but only to a certain degree. This film's plot has gaps that a logical plot progression does not.<br/><br/>The necessary staging elements for the two individuals in question (i.e., Nick and Desi) ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. The convincing ""stage-job"" she planned for Nick doesn't work for Desi too! It falls especially flat when her plan ends with her ALIVE as opposed to her committing suicide. You can't just change up your meticulous plan on the fly and transfer it to a completely different person and expect it to be even a fraction as convincing! Also, kind of in the same vein, is the complication of the diary. It's stupid for the Nick AND Desi stage scenario. If Nick killed her, why would he DRIVE TO HIS DAD'S HOUSE to burn it? Even if he did for some reason, he fails to finish the job, only singing the corners? What? If you're Amy, why fake-burn it at all? For all the cops know, Nick was unaware of the diary's existence. Just put it on a book shelf or something so the police find it once some of the other incriminating evidence she's planted provides the impetus for a search warrant. Last point about the diary: why in the name of God would Desi burn it? What's the motive? Besides the implausibility that he would drive to Nick's father-in-law's house (?) to do it, he would ultimately fail to do it successfully? How would he even know about the diary? Even if he did, why would he care? It incriminates Nick, not him. Once again, the two staging scenarios don't line up properly. Yet another flaw: the cameras. Lots o' people have mentioned this. If you're Desi, an apparently rich, smart, successful, affluent, etc, etc. person (Neil P. Harris fails to convince me), why in the world would you not completely disable the security cameras while you TIE UP AND RAPE your long-awaited stalking target? This is how the cops would see it, at least. Also mentioned by others: how's Amy gonna rig the tapes? What, is she just gonna delete everything over that THREE-WEEK SPAN, other than her twenty seconds of her I-just- got-raped screams and her slitting Desi's throat? Cause I know she's not gonna leave the foreplay in there; it was the definition of consensual. How is this sparse thirty-second footage going to look to the cops when compared to the TWENTY-FOUR DAYS she's been ""gone"" (ugh, that title). Then, of course, if she didn't delete the footage, there's plenty of TV watchin' and wine drinkin' and general doin-nothing-in' to shoot holes in her story. (sidenote: not only does she casually and expertly slit his throat; afterward, she FLIPS HIM OVER, HOLDS HIM DOWN, AND PULLS HIS HEAD BACK to finish the job! This is not normal behavior for a rape victim.) Tangentially, why on Earth would she completely change up her calculated, ""brilliant"" plan and decide to frame Desi instead and return to her now saintly (?) husband? She knows that Nick knows she framed him. Why would she think he wouldn't try to put on a good face for the media and avoid lethal injection? She's presented as being smarter than this; a manipulative, murderous, run-of-the-mill psychopath, yes, but smart nonetheless. Why would she assume that he'd stay with her if she returned? The baby? She wouldn't be the least bit wary of him finding a flaw in her now-spontaneous staging attempt? Or the cops for that matter? Remember, the culmination of this woman's original plan was her suicide, therein providing closure for her and the case, since the cops finally now have their body to add to the rest of the evidence ""building up"" against Nick (cue the explosion). Are we really supposed to believe that she became lovesick and altered her entire plan because she saw her hubby do a convincing acting job on television? Lastly, there is no plausible scenario in which Nick would stay with her. No way. You can't prove to me otherwise.<br/><br/>I'm fine with negative endings. I could have lived with Nick dying or being incriminated. The ending we are given is a cop-out, a pseudo-ending. As soon as Amy comes home, the movie falls flat. Everyone gives up, the cops, Nick, his sister, the lawyer, etc. The movie's over; deal with it. Pick up your stale popcorn and Butterfinger wrappers. The film provides no explanation for how or why she gets away with it. It feels as if the screenwriter, Flynn herself, has decided ""she's just going to and you better accept it."" The ending insults the audience and detracts from the characters' collective credibility. It's like Gillian started with the ending and only had enough track to lay ¾ of the story leading up to it. The audience is forced to believe that a runaway train will arrive at the prescribed ending in a neat and orderly fashion (surely tying together all loose ends in Flynn's mind). I don't believe it and you can't make me. And what was up with Nick at the very end? ""I always think of her head. I picture cracking her lovely skull, unspooling her brains, trying to get answersthe primal questions of any marriage. What are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done to each other? What will we do?"" His tone is incongruous. This is not a normal marriage! He's practically mesmerized by her, like he's been hypnotized into a trance. In reality, he'd be utterly freaking terrified of her!<br/><br/>I liked the score, cinematography, and Pike's performance, though. My main gripe was that I hated the final act of the plot."
"tavm","10","4","18","16 October 2014"," Gone Girl is the film to see this fall, I kid you not!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend, his sister, and her husband. We were all enthralled watching this drama-thriller about a man whose wife had disappeared and the revelations about them both. Ben Affleck is the star with nice supporting turns by Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry (yes, the guy who's usually known as Medea!), Carrie Coon, Casey Wilson, and many others. However, the most compelling performance is from Rosamond Pike. I remember liking her as a Bond girl in Die Another Day but here, she's really on fire if you know what I mean! All I'll say now is you may or not be surprised by the twists and turns that happen in this film but you won't be bored, that's for sure! David Fincher has done it again! So on that note, I highly recommend Gone Girl."
"aharmas","10","4","18","2 October 2014"," It Must Be Cold in Hell
","David Fincher knows how to pick his choices for movies. He's gone from the nightmarish but brilliant ""Se7en"", the puzzling ""The Game"", and list goes on and on, but nothing will prepare you for the sharp portrayal by Rosalind Pike of the fantastic character that is the heart of ""Gone Girl"". Throughout the film, she shines, radiating this cool, cold beauty, matched only by the cold design of her intellect and the execution of the movie.<br/><br/>At first, I thought having Affleck play her counterpart was one humongous mistake, but it actually works well because Affleck's range gives him enough room for us not believe that he can never be a match for her. It's obvious from the beginning that he is nothing else but another step on her way to something much bigger and better. Yes, there are a few seconds when we think it is possible to up her game, but if that were to happen, it would feel like cheating. It's nature game that it's the survival of the fittest, and if he is to make it, it's not going to be her choice. In fact, I think it's pretty courageous of Fincher that the film ends the way it does.<br/><br/>Everyone involved in the film is fantastic since they're not afraid to show their flaws, their doubts, the fact that it's after all, a cold and unsympathetic world. We never root for anyone because we're surrounded by vultures, ready to prey on the leftover of the other vultures. Children are nowhere to be seen, except for a couple of shots where they hurriedly leave the scene. If anything, they are weapons to trap and destroy your opponent or worse, they're to be used in order achieve bigger goals.<br/><br/>A man soon becomes the presumed guilty party in the disappearance of his wife, a woman who is seen by many as a stranger and difference creature. She is after all, from New York, and this is a small town where affairs happen, but murder is just something else. The rope gets tighter and tighter, and we have no other expectations that the mystery will be solved and Affleck will get his due. Before the deal is done, the first of the unexpected turns happens, and designs change because of fate. Here is where everything we think is coming takes a completely different spin, but the tone and the mood remains.<br/><br/>This is where the cool beauty of Pike gives way to her cool mind, and things become uglier as we discover what is really going, and how she is one of the most resourceful people here. It becomes clear that it would take a miracle to upset the natural order of things, and the realization is not how it will end, just bad the ending will be.<br/><br/>I overheard some people walking out of the theater expressing disappointment, but that only made me realize, how well the resolution is executed because this is after a work of art that has taken plenty of chances both in its written source and the translation to the cinema. Unlike ""Tattoo"" where emotional involvement went subzero in its American adaptation, this one maintains its rotten heart beating quite strongly. There is not much affection or happiness involved. This is not a movie about love, but a movie about how dark human nature can be. There is very little bloodshed because even the big scene is meticulously executed, almost begging to be admired rather than for shocking purposes. Sharon Stone's character in ""Basic Instinct"" would be a mere apprentice if she hanged around the characters in this movie.<br/><br/>Behind the camera and in absolute control is Fincher who manages to give Missouri and the Mississippi a cold, gray and steely look and feel that has probably not been seen before. It's an incisive look at how humans really behave when the fantasies of love go away for whatever reason that might be."

While well acted, well shot, at times well written, and with some real memorable scenes, there are more holes in the story than a round of Swiss cheese. The underlying theme of a psychopathic wife is fascinating, but the whole effort here is frustrating to watch due to all the incredible suspensions of reality the film makes you embrace - all the while presenting itself as a story that could actually take place. Ha. I can't tell you how many times you just won't believe it. I also can't see how there could be a number of 1 ratings out there - I guess that's a function of how frustrated some people were at how the film under delivered vs the hype. But it wasn't a 1.

","Gone Girl is a tour de force of modern cinema. It combines that best of both worlds; those worlds being 90s Fincher and 2000s Fincher. It has the intricate, multi-perspective narrative of The Social Network, the interplay of media and crime reminiscent of Zodiac, the playful surrealism of The Game, the brash blood and gore of Se7en. And of course, like Fight Club, it had that indefatigable story, twisting and turning at every point imaginable, and taking the audience on an unforgettable cinematic experience.<br/><br/>It was particularly joyful to see such well written female characters, the centerpiece being Amy Dunne played by the Hollywood newcomer Rosamund Pike. Like an amoral Lisabeth Salander, Amy presents a terrifying image of female vengeance. It was good to see a filmmaker known for his sausagefest films expand to include a more balanced cast where women aren't reduced to sexual objects (I'm looking at you, The Social Network). I hope this marks a new era of Fincher, one which balances intelligent, sophisticated filmmaking with loads and loads of dark, twisted fun. 10/10"

And my advice is, if you have done this, keep it that way and see it.<br/><br/>Fincher has made his finest movie since Zodiac, and the way he handles the narrative with the story is something very special.<br/><br/>Apart from Margot, all of the women in this movie are portrayed as opinionated, self obsessed people who want just one thing, their time in the spotlight.<br/><br/>And this goes the other end of the spectrum for the male characters too, with the exception of Tanner Bolt, they are all depicted as weak individuals, moulding themselves around the women that they are with the most, or have been affected by the most.<br/><br/>When the film hit the curveball at the beginning of the second act, it really did shock me, the amount of deception and effort that a certain character does in order to 'be free', but then the end of the second act is pretty predictable, and it almost fooled me into thinking the film was going down the Vertigo route, but the look on someone's face just gave the game away to me.<br/><br/>The cast are all excellent, but Pike here has made her career defining performance, she is brilliant, and if she doesn't get nominated for several awards, I will be pretty amazed.<br/><br/>it's a really wonderful date move, really.

""Gone Girl"" seems to be a typical mystery/thriller on the surface (and it is, to a certain extent), but there were quite a few unexpected turns and shifts that made me wonder what genre it really belongs to.<br/><br/>With a two and a half hour runtime, the narrative and pace never got me bored. Several elements could have been so cliché in the hands of the wrong storyteller, but here they were handled effectively. <br/><br/>The acting is overall credible, Ben's performance believable even though his body-language makes him more often than not look like a bull in a china-shop. Rosamund Pike shines here. I'm not familiar with her work but her role will certainly reverberate strongly in her career in many years to come.<br/><br/>My only slight surprise was how low-key Fincher was in his style, in comparison to his previous work, such as ""Panic Room"" and ""Fight Club"".<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for a mature audience."
"AudioFileZ","6","3","12","13 October 2014"," Not Hitchcock
","This is a riddle wrapped in an enigma and I'm not just talking about Amy Dunne. The movie is basically the undoing of Nick Dunne, a cheating husband. It slowly becomes apparent, in spite of himself, the problem is he married the wrong woman to leave. The story that ensues is in parts both plausible and implausible where both are treated as one and the same. At many moments the story reels itself in with the believable, cloaking it's absurdity almost expertly. Almost is the key word here, much requires more than a modicum of suspension of belief.<br/><br/>Using a failing marriage as the cauldron of resentment inside Amy Dunne is certainly believable. The extreme manipulation she goes about creating her own disappearance/re-appearance is at turns brilliant before veering into the insulting. Amy becomes a murderer, or was she always so mentally unstable, under the radar, she was destined to no less? As things unfold who she really is builds.<br/><br/>Gone Girl insults the police and media, two groups that in their whole deserve to be held under the microscope. Both come off so self-serving inept, even criminal, the writers veer into comedy to shroud the ample silliness. While the media today has gone tabloid sensationalist driven and deserve the ridicule one still hopes there is no earthly way that law-enforcement can be this stupefyingly dumb and corrupt. Yet, even that is wrapped into that shard of fact that many innocent people get railroaded.<br/><br/>So, Gone Girl may not be all that it aspires to. Viewers certainly must ""dumb down"" what is accepted as possibly believable, it does keep the viewer watching because what may come next is never really given up too early. The craziness of the story, thus, moves slow and is rolled in things that could be which helps. As far as bringing this somewhat ""hard-to-swallow"" ride to the quite alright open-ending requires talent and finesse. The cinematography is fine for such a story never being too defined or bright, totally right for a modern mystery. However, in the end it's the acting. Ben Affleck nails the often befuddled Nick Dunne who lost so many pieces of himself in his marital ride he struggles to regain his life. Rosamund Pike plays the America's Sweetheart writer character Amy Dunne to perfection going from precious to psychopathic maniacal manipulator, and murderess, morphing from an intelligent beauty to Satan himself. Tyler Perry hits the right notes on what could be any present day high-powered legal defender. Neal Patrick Harris plays the guy that lost the girl only to over-achieve financially - still never getting over his lost love which, almost comedic-ally and ignorantly leads to his murder. And, finally, Nick's sister Margo, played by Kim Dickens is the sibling we'd all love to have in times good and bad. The cast gets a big ""thumbs-up"" for keeping the non-sense so much more compelling than it has any right to. Thus, in the end, I think there is good acting that acts as a catalyst in raising the viewer's interest and entertainment value. If this could be accomplished without the mis-steps of low credibility as far as the story goes Gone Girl would get a 8 or so, in the end it is less though still enjoyable. Almost, but not quite, Hitchcok worthy."

","Once in awhile a film comes around that throws your brain into so many places that it becomes hard to come to grips if you actually like it or not. Don't get me wrong I liked Gone Girl. I think it's a brilliantly directed film. But this film also ticked me off more than one I can remember. David Fincher films tend to have that effect on you at times. And a sign of a great film is one that makes you think for hours upon hours after viewing, and Gone Girl does that. It's one of the most twisted, obscure, and disturbing films I have seen. But not because any obscene images or gross out scenes. But because it is such a cynical view on marriage and relationships in general, or even just the human brain. You leave the theater asking, do people really think like this? Is trust a big enough issue to where a sustainable relationship is completely off the table? First of all, major props to everyone involved with this film. All of the performances are marvelous. Affleck is at his best and Rosamund Pike gives what is most likely an Oscar worthy turn. But it's once again David Fincher who is the star of the film. Every scene looks and sounds beautiful (thanks to a little help from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). Fincher directs with such ease that at times you feel like you're actually observing these events happen in Missouri and not in a theater. A scene in particular near the end of the film that was so perfectly directed and looks so unbelievably real that it's hard not picture Fincher getting an Oscar nomination for directing.<br/><br/>The screenplay was done by the author of the book of the same name by Gillian Flynn. From what I hear, she is great at writing well developed characters. And I think the characters worked really well on screen. Tyler Perry's Tanner Bolt gave both comedic flare and a relatable character for the audience in a movie that involves several off-the-wall crazy people. I'd like to think that I can trust the people closest to me to be honest and not hide secrets. It's hard to like any of the characters in this film. Fincher often gives us glimpses of good characters but with many flaws. Gone Girl very well may be his most depressing movie. It's hard to imagine this author having a family and kids and being able to write such horrific tales without thinking twice.<br/><br/>Onto the highly publicized 'twists'. I'll say right off the bat that I didn't expect any of them coming. But I wasn't overly shocked either. It was built up to me to be something that is so unthinkable that it will be hard to wrap your mind around. Sure the film surprised me at times, but it's no Se7en. I think if I wouldn't have had both my sister and my girlfriend build this book and it's twists up so high I would have had a more fulfilling experience. But I did love watching this movie. It's also perhaps a movie I appreciate more on second viewing. Most of Fincher's work is significantly better after a few watches.<br/><br/>Overall Gone Girl sets out to do exactly what it wants to. It's a haunting tale and the supposed ""husband kills wife"" style film. It's also a funny play on the media today and how our view on the world is solely based on what the media feeds us. With this beginning the Oscar season it's hard to say how it shapes up against the field. But I will say Pike and Fincher are locks. With Affleck hopefully picking up his first acting nomination as well. As a score, it's very hard to give one. This film is truly the 'Zodiac killings' of a review. I don't know that I will ever grasp what the right score is for a film like this.<br/><br/>+Pike <br/><br/>+Affleck deserves his first acting nomination <br/><br/>+Fincher's direction is PERFECT <br/><br/>+Well written characters <br/><br/>+Does exactly what it sets out to do <br/><br/>+Tyler Perry was actually GREAT! <br/><br/>+Score <br/><br/>-Not-so-shocking twists <br/><br/>-Ticked me off <br/><br/>-Ending <br/><br/>8.4/10"

","After a stressful day of work, I decided to go to the show and see Gone Girl. The reviews after release were strong, and I was intrigued. I will be frank that Ben Allfeck has never been one of my favorite actors. Nevertheless, I relented and found myself sucked into an intriguing plot about a story I knew nothing about. In a way, I like being surprised having not read the book before seeing the movie. I think had I known the outcome it wouldn't have been as interesting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can tell you NOTHING in this review beyond the superficial gist of the movie. It would be a crying shame to spoil it for you, so I won't.<br/><br/>The story starts out on the truthful fact that marriage is hard work. Marriages can fail. People can drift apart. However, it's how the husband and wife of a marital union handle the challenges that determine the outcome of sticking together or getting a divorce.<br/><br/>We've all been privy to true-life instances in the media where a man has killed his wife. The plot is like watching the 6 o'clock news of the latest missing spouse. Nick Dunne returns home one day to find his cat wandering outside and his front door open. When he enters the house, he finds a scene reminiscent of a struggle and his wife has disappeared.<br/><br/>Of course, when the police get involved, Nick is the first person they attempt to eliminate in this strange disappearance of Amy Dunne. Nick is far too nonchalant about her disappearance, which sheds suspicion upon him. Everyone thinks he murdered his wife. As the story progresses, more evidence mounts against him making him look quite guilty of bludgeoning her to death. Nick, on the other hand, is playing a game of anniversary clue with his missing wife and decides that she is staging an elaborate prank.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the movie's first half is riddled with the question of whether he did or did not kill Amy. You are left with the evidence to sort out on your own until suddenly the story takes an 180 degree turn in the opposite direction. I will confess that I had this sneaking suspicion it was going to play out this way. Even though I was correct in my assumption, it certainly did not prepare me to see the outcome that leaves you speechless, questioning, unresolved, and unsatisfied. It's quite a void after the credits roll, which haunts you on the way out to the parking lot.<br/><br/>Even though Ben isn't my favorite actor, I will say his performance in this movie is well played. He was the droll and unconcerned husband at one point, worried at another, and mortified toward the end. As far as Rosamund Pike's performance, she was so disquieting I hope I never meet her face-to-face. Outstanding performance that will define her for years to come.<br/><br/>Somewhere in this story lurks a narcissistic psychopath that will make your skin crawl. The film doesn't have any fright factor, except for one horribly disturbing scene that will make you gasp as it plays out. However, like any good thriller it does a good job of leaving you inwardly distraught as a result. In conclusion, it's worth a movie ticket, a medium popcorn, and two and half hours of sitting in a dark theater. Though I read there was a scene of frontal nudity of Ben Affleck's prize possessions, I'm here to report I never saw anything. I mean that too! I'm not sure if they cut it out of the film or if my eyes just glazed over. Maybe I can get a partial refund since I didn't get my money's worth."
"Robert_duder","9","4","19","8 October 2014"," The first Oscar contender for me...a brilliantly made, mind bending thriller with a breakout role that will leave you mesmerized
","Yesterday, before I saw this film, if you had asked me to list my favourite directors I'm not sure if David Fincher would have been mentioned. I just wouldn't have thought of him. Then as the credits rolled on Gone Girl...I was just mesmerized by how brilliantly he crafts a thriller. The eccentricities of his characters and stories. Add in to that he has directed some of my favourite films including Se7en, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Game and The Social Network to name a few. The man has a style all his own and he draws you into the darkest of worlds and makes you believe every minute of it. Gone Girl is a slow paced, carefully executed mystery that I am absolutely certain will go into the annex of Hollywood history right up there with Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, Single White Female, Psycho...films about stalkers or psychotic individuals where a star has shone in their role by being completely and utterly, mouth dropping insane. There are lines delivered in this film and scenes experienced that will stay with me for years. I will go back and watch this movie to experience those scenes. I actually sat in the theatre recognizing that I was living what will be talked about as ""that classic scene."" Fincher truly has created a masterpiece...again. Gone Girl is this years Prisoners and it best get the accolades it deserves.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is getting an awful lot of press lately with his mainstream film career ahead of him as Batman. This role takes him back to basics and reminds us that he is talented for a whole other reason. He shows an intensity and a down to earth, very real quality that makes his character so damn easy to hate and love at the same time. Its a subtle performance compared to some of the more emotional ones in the film but he leads this cast very well and I think watching him again will only make you appreciate it more each time. If you look at Fincher's film history he does an incredible job at surrounding the main characters with incredible supporting characters. In this case you have stand out performances from Tyler Perry (maybe one of the best roles I've ever seen him in), Carrie Coon (supporting actress nod would not be out of the question), Kim Dickens (same for her), Patrick Fugit (lesser scale for him...found him a little underwhelming compared to everyone else), David Clennon and Lisa Banes. Dickens is particularly great in a very ""Fincher-esque"" type role as a Police Detective who thinks she always one step ahead of Affleck. Also particularly terrific was Neil Patrick Harris in a dark and twisted role as a man completely obsessed with our lead girl and yet has no idea what he's in for when he goes up against her. Harris also has the honour of being a mainstay in one of those scenes mentioned earlier that will not soon be forgotten by anyone watching this. And finally we leave the best until last. We still have a lot of movie viewing ahead of us in 2014 but at this point if Rosamund Pike didn't walk away with the Best Actress award then the Oscars are a sham. Sweet innocent Pike who has always been sort of back drop in most movies is absolutely mind blowingly insane. She is jaw dropping in this performance and it gives me chills when I think about her dialogue delivery and certain scenes. She'd be the last actor I'd pick for this until I've seen her do it. This might be her masterpiece. She is evil and absolutely amazing. See this...FOR HER.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is excruciatingly long for this type of film (much like Prisoners was last year.) It does even feel long at times considering you know that Fincher will end it when he's good and ready and even then he might not give you everything you want out of an ending. I was prepared for it. I only fault a film for being long if there isn't a distinct purpose behind it and I think every second of Gone Girl was necessary. We become so entranced with these characters that you want to see how every little detail unravels. I must admit (and I don't consider myself a genius in these matters) that I figured out the direction of the film very early on with just one clue. That didn't even remotely ruin the film for me because we then get to see how and why and where everything plays out. I don't often talk about musical score either because what do I know about music but again we have an Oscar winner Trent Reznor who worked with Finch before and his music is distinct and noticeable and haunting and sets a painstakingly created tone. Gone Girl definitely won't be for everyone. It is a critical darling sort of film but in my opinion it deserves it! A well acted and brilliantly crafted crime thriller. 9/10"

","First off the movie dragged in the beginning until she disappeared, however any person with half a brain could see the crime scene was staged and why would someone take the time to clean up the kitchen but not the living room. <br/><br/>In the middle, the story gets explained in great detail in her own words step by step. I thought Nick Dunn and his attorney would get the chance to figure it out and track her down. Doesn't leave much to the imagination if everything is explained to you in great detailed of how she staged everything and why. <br/><br/>Neil Patrick Harris wasn't believable in his scene as a love sick renaissance man finally getting the girl. <br/><br/>The ending wasn't that good either. After Nick is scared to death to sleep in the same house with her knowing she committed murder by slitting a guys throat and saw first hand her twisted mind. Yet he stays with her because she told the media she's pregnant again. But all the cops and lawyers go OK nothing to see here they just have a f***ed up marriage.... <br/><br/>The movie was long but the ending was rushed to a 180 degree ending of an unreasonable choice for Nick Dunn to make to stay with Amy Dunn with his sister begging him not to stay. Instead of her tripping herself up in her own lies. <br/><br/>Why in the world did everyone in Missouri including the female Detective have a southern accent?? :-) Why did the media hang outside for 5 weeks after she came home? I'm sure there will have to be a sequel for Nick Dunn running from the house with his hair on fire trying to get away from crazy town."

","David Fincher's films have a certain dark style. You don't have to look much farther than the excellent ""The Girl in the Dragon Tattoo"" to see that. Here he takes it to another level, bringing us another dark and twisted adaptation with even more attention to the characters. <br/><br/>The film, written by the author of the novel, Gillian Flynn, centers on the relationship between married couple Nick and Amy Dunne (played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike.) On their fifth anniversary, Amy goes missing in their little Missouri town. It seems like a normal murder mystery, but there's a twist. Amy happens to be the inspiration for a series of widely successful children's books written by her parents. Thus, the search transforms into a nationwide media frenzy. With Nick acting very strange, he becomes the prime suspect. We begin to learn that Nick and Amy's marriage was not as perfect as it seemed and a series of fun twists push the movie forward at a rapidly increasing pace. <br/><br/>The film hits two major areas spot-on: characters and story. The twists are truly unpredictable and the plot does not feel like something we've seen before. David Fincher's demanding presence is felt both in the aesthetics of the film and in his actors. Affleck and Pike are perfectly cast as the two leads, and Pike is especially exceptional. The film will benefit Affleck in the long run because it shows us once again that he has real acting chops. This guy can do much more than direct great films, and his reputation as a subpar actor is a myth. We are also treated to a slew of excellent supporting characters played convincingly. The stand-outs are the underrated Carrie Coon as Nick's sister Margo, Tyler Perry in a surprisingly delightful performance as Nick's lawyer, and the lead detective in the case played with conviction by Kim Dickens.<br/><br/>The driving force in the film is Nick and Amy's relationship. The movie becomes quite terrifying as the story moves along and more and more information is revealed. With a great script that gives us thrills, excellent dialogue, and even some nice laughs, we reach the end somewhat exhausted, meaning Fincher has done his job well. Viewers will either love or hate the ending, but it's the conclusion the film needs to set itself apart from other Hollywood mysteries. This is one of the best films of 2014."

Their investigative process is nothing like what happens in the real world. The story lacks suspense. The ending is a huge let down.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate the author of Gone Girl was given the job as screenwriter. Perhaps if a seasoned screenwriter had been given the adaptation job, Gone Girl would have been a clever and sophisticated movie instead of what it is: mediocre.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with Gone Girl. Skip it for a the tautly suspenseful Tell No One."
"vinsim27","9","2","7","2 July 2015"," It was so good that after it was over I rewound it and watched the whole thing again.
","David Fincher has done it again with a claustrophobic film that surprises and keeps you invested at every turn.<br/><br/>The film stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick and Amy Dunne. They seem like a normal married couple until Amy disappears. Slowly, more evidence piles on to Nick and many believe that he murdered his own wife. Nick does not despair. After a diary shows up stating Nick was abusive to Amy. In actuality, Amy isn't dead at all. Amy is revealed to be a manipulative sociopath who staged her own murder and pins it on Nick after finding out that he was having an affair. Eventually after losing her money, The on-the-run Amy seeks the aid of a high-school sweetheart Desi, played by Neil Patrick Harris. Unfortunately she, being crazy, changes her mind, stages rape scenes, and murders Desi. She returns to her husband blaming Desi for the whole thing, claiming that she killed him in self-defense. In the end, Nick stays with Amy, and she with him, with a newborn on the way.<br/><br/>This movie was the epitome of going full throttle. This film does not hold back. It's disturbing and atmospheric as hell, The sound mixing and editing was beyond exceptional like in every David Fincher movie, the screenplay was fantastic, and all the performances(yes, even Tyler Perry's) were really good. Rosamund Pike absolutely stole the show. Not only did she sell the ideas her character stood for, but this was probably her best performance in a film.<br/><br/>The twists and turns made for a fantastic and f*%@#d up ride that I'm sure to watch again. This film was incredibly immersing and well-paced, and I couldn't even tell that it was 165 minutes long. This is definitely one of 2014 best."
"jcookie-63351","2","2","7","23 June 2015"," The acting was fine; however the story was just ridiculous and too unbelievable at the end.
","I don't understand why people would give this movie a high rating. The movie started out okay, and my husband and I thought it was going to be a good one. Unfortunately, the whole thing took a nose dive about halfway through. It was too long, for one thing, and the plot ended up being utterly ridiculous. Other reviewers mentioned a lot of the holes the film had in it, so I don't need to go into all that here. However, I'll mention a few things that really bothered me. I had trouble with the fact that Ben Affleck's character and his sister didn't remove the items from the woodshed when they discovered them. Also, the psycho wife was still covered in blood after she was examined and treated at the hospital-so stupid –and worst of all, her husband ended up staying with her after all the horrible things she did to him! The cops believed her ridiculous kidnapping story and didn't follow up on that? Towards the end, the female cop said she couldn't help Ben Affleck when he asked her to, even after she knew what the wife had done to him. And the psycho wife got away with a vicious murder and just went on like nothing ever happened – then all of a sudden gets pregnant when her husband hadn't even slept with her. Come on! Very disappointed."

Since the film was recommended to me, however, I felt it my civic duty to add my voice to all those saying that it is absolute, unadulterated garbage. Others have quite eloquently pointed out its sheer implausibility, colossal plot holes, and absolutely enraging conclusion. I would simply like to add that everyone involved in the making of this film should be ashamed of themselves and mortified by their participation in such a cinematic travesty. I do not appreciate being treated like an imbecile and would strongly encourage all like-minded individuals to boycott this, and all other films made by these people. I don't think I will ever be able to forgive the man who recommended it for this vicious attack on my intelligence."
"tamara-a_98","3","2","7","12 June 2015"," It was too twisted that it became pointless...
","I thought the movie was pretty much pointless. I could not understand the message behind it. At first I was like okay it's about revenge or it's about showing how Amy is going to defend herself after she was mistreated but then all of this was betrayed when (spoiler alert) she goes back to Nick like nothing ever happened.<br/><br/>I googled the movie trying to get the message behind the whole movie. Apparently it is about marriage, coupledom and the psyche of two people living together. If this is the case, it is completely far-fetched, not merely close to reality and absolutely absurd. <br/><br/>Also there were too many plot holes, and it is almost impossible that FBI agents would go along with the story with no questions asked. Even Nick asked how she got that knife if she was tied up all the time. <br/><br/>Not only that, but the fact that Amy killed Desi confuses the plot line and the message even more, if there is any. It was unnecessary and it only made me lose whatever shred of empathy I had towards her character.<br/><br/>So basically, there was no protagonist, no antagonist and barely a plot. The viewer could not pick a side. The ending was disappointing. The movie was just going on and on to reach absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>Yes, I liked the thrill of it and the mystery was entertaining, which is why it got the 3. But at the end it even lost that thriller factor when the ending was revealed and we just waited for the characters to act on it. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck played the role well but I thought Rosamund was unnatural. And personally I thought the characters themselves are not charismatic and do not help the viewer in engaging with the movie.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I think this movie is completely overrated. And although entertaining at times, it was too twisted and too sick that it lost its meaning."
"Irishman15","3","2","7","1 June 2015"," Disappointed
","I am glad we did not spend more than a $1.50 to see this movie. The plot was completely predictable, and the ending was brutal. The length of the movie seemed fine, right up until the end, which was a complete dud. By dragging a movie for that long, there should be some type of satisfaction one way or the other by the end, but Gone Girl provides none. A better plot would have seen Ben Affleck's character and the Detective destroying his psychopath of a wife; to watch all of her stories unravel, to see vindication for the ex- boyfriend, but that was not the case, not even close.

So what did I like? Well, the Nancy Grace-like 'journalist', Ellen Abbott, was terrific and I am happy about anything that makes Ms. Grace look bad. I also liked most of the acting. I actually thought Ben Afleck was really good. The plot also reminded me a lot of a great old film ""Leave Her to Heaven"".

","BeginRantNow.<br/><br/>I understand most people are beyond the SNUBBED-GAME by now as I'm usually late to any game, but DAMN. How in HELL did Gone Girl miss a Best Picture nomination? Or Best Screenplay? This movie wasn't just amazingly written, but one of the most original movies I've seen in 2014 and one of the best of the year overall.<br/><br/>It helps that I absolutely loved the character of ""Amazing Amy"" (Rosamund Pike.) I will not spoil the reason why I loved her as much as I did for I discovered it myself while watching this movie pretty cold. Mercifully, they did nominate Pike for a Best Acting Oscar, though I am uncertain at this point (February 4, 2015) if she'll win, especially since I haven't seen all the Best Acting films nominated. But, I would certainly love to see her accept the award.<br/><br/>Now, she wasn't the best this movie has to offer. In fact, I might consider a Best Director nod and definitely – as mentioned – a Best Screenplay nominee. Heck, I even liked Tyler Perry, and I usually cannot stand him or his movies.<br/><br/>That all said, yeah, Ben Affleck is still a terrible actor and might have turned off some of the voters. Granted, this wasn't his worst performance, but it was definitely right on par with most of his career.<br/><br/>This movie completely surpassed more than half of the Best Pictures nominated for 2014. In fact, only this, Birdman, The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything were granted the same 4/5 star rating from me with this and Birdman an imaginary tie for first place had this been nominated. <br/><br/>EndRantNow, and begin my remaining review.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much about the plot or what I favored the most, only because the experience of barely knowing the synopsis of husband Affleck being accused/investigated for murdering his vanished wife, Amy, was a good place to start with and then proceed with watching the complex and deep plot unravel. It's long, and yeah, some could be cut out, but it kept me going. Especially, the character of Amy.<br/><br/>And keeping with my experience, I implore you to see this movie and let it draw you in with its many twists like a great novel you have in front of you. I love movies like this – ones that start off with a simple premise and evolve and surprise me. I even had to rewatch the finale just to understand and absorb the whole meaning.<br/><br/>The Oscar voters are probably right with their picks and nominations 50% of the time. Like The Lego Movie being snubbed for both Best Pic and Best Animated film this year and nearly a decade back with the completely underserved shut out of Brokeback Mountain for the win, this movie deserves a helluva more attention.<br/><br/>Sorry, I did think the rant was over. So, just see the movie and you'll begin ranting yourself.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Though, personally, I thoroughly encourage more penis shots in movies, the Ben Affleck completely out of left-field, quick second or three, full frontal shot wasn't just unnecessary, but felt manufactured to cause buzz. It was clearly established he was without clothes due to the shower running, so, honestly, it didn't feel like it belonged in either the scene or the movie. Granted, I'm not an Affleck fan, but seeing ""it"" had me scratching my head more than enjoying the view.<br/><br/>Did it ruin the movie? No, it's still a penis shot, after all. And even though I didn't think it fit, at least it wasn't the billionth woman to disrobe for cinema."

The viewer is left with the impression that this will be another interesting story of a married couple and their struggles.<br/><br/>This goes until the plot twists so hard that you almost need to pause to comprehend what happened. The plot is so well thought that you get the ""aha"" and ""so that's what happened"" moments every few minutes, but it is apparent enough to let the viewer intelligent enough to guess some of the scenes, just so they get astonished with the next one. <br/><br/>The movie leaves the viewer with the impression that there is a good/bad guy plot in the movie until the very end when the scenario twists again and leaves the viewer astonished and questioning if there's a bad character at all and what would they do in the characters' place."

This film, however, was carried by Rosamund Pike, she is intense and has all the attributes of a psychopath, you can tell she has put all her effort into this role and doesn't flinch or move out of character once, a moving performance.

","Putting aside the issues mentioned in previous reviews about how this is a sad reflection on modern film-going tastes, I just found this film disappointing. I found myself saying the same thing I almost always say when watching an adaptation of literary thrillers which is that the director does not have the intelligence to pull it off convincingly, which is why he directs films and doesn't write books. There are so many holes in the plot it resembles a pair of my favourite jeans and the characters are so idiotic and, in the case of the police, plodding that it does the book (which everyone tells me is amazing) and modern police methods a disservice. It is a good example of a well regarded book being rushed into adaptation by the Hollywood sausage factory. Unless all the people I know who have read the book are wrong..."

Flynn gets a rare chance for a successful author to adapt her book for the screen, and that's the second-smartest choice made for this project.

Or more accurately, Missouri.A masterpiece of genre film-making. I felt like I was watching a long-lost Hitchcock classic (but one with all the sex and violence Hitch was only allowed to hint at).

","Directed by David Fincher (The Social Network, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) and based on a popular novel by Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl is the story of Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who discovers on the morning of his 5th wedding anniversary that his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has disappeared. As police begin to investigate her disappearance, it becomes clear that their marriage is not as it seemed and soon after the media descends on his home to cover the salacious story. Seedy details about Nick's personal life emerge and his strange behavior only serves to fuel suspicion. As lies are uncovered and secrets are revealed, inevitably the police, the media and the public arrive at the same conclusion: Nick Dunne murdered his wife.<br/><br/>I loved just about everything about this movie; whether it's the creepy score, it's consistent suspenseful tone or it's scathing critique on marriage and the dangers of ""keeping up of appearances"". At first the film goes where you might expect; you'll laugh at the silly moments of their courtship, you'll fawn over their romance as the story of their relationship is retold leading up to her disappearance. But marriages are not often as they seem and neither is this film; you'll recoil as events unfurl (for the sake of not spoiling this for anyone, I won't say any more than that). Let's just say this film has a few scenes that will shock and stay with you! It was very unpredictable and had a few turns that had me gasping out loud. <br/><br/>There's also some obvious, but still really interesting commentary on public perception, the power of the media and it's ability to drive narrative (I found this to be a pretty sobering and relevant analogy given current events and how the US media has portrayed them). The film also cleverly plays on gender stereotypes and uses them to effectively drive home it's message. At times this felt like an unconventional horror film (I might even say it's a modern day take on Psycho), but it also has some elements of Fatal Attraction.<br/><br/>While I thought Ben Affleck's performance was nothing to really get excited about (he does have a few strong scenes), what really stands out here is Rosamund Pike (Barney's Version, An Education). Her performance as Amy is simply incredible! As the snobby film critics would say, this is a ""Tour De Force"" kind of performance. She really takes over this film and delivers work that you can't help but get immersed in. If she doesn't get an Oscar nomination, it will be a travesty because this was an unforgettable performance and I can't think of a better performance I've seen this year to date. Yes, it's THAT good. <br/><br/>The last 15 minutes may leave you a little puzzled (characters make decisions I can only describe as incredibly strange), lead to a few questions and will spark debate. I'm usually never a fan of ""I need to spend an hour on the IMDb Message Boards so I can full understand this"" kind of ending, but it does seem somewhat appropriate given the tone of this film. This is also definitely the kind of film that requires multiple viewings to grasp all of it's themes and I will certainly oblige as I found this completely engrossing.<br/><br/>Thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, this really is a brilliant film and easily one of the best of the year. Do yourself a favor and find a way see this, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>Was my review not horrible? Great!

"jmperou","9","2","7","23 December 2014"," The 1-star reviewers are missing a very important point...
","I was quite surprised to see so many people bashing this movie and even bashing other people for liking this movie. It seems like most of the negative reviews are from people spotting ""holes"" in the plot and calling the entire movie unbelievable. Well, I'm sorry, but you're missing the point entirely. <br/><br/>A huge theme throughout the movie is this: facts are not as important as the perception of those facts. Why are there no court scenes in the movie? Because their trial is the Media, with Ellon Abbot presiding as judge and America as the jury. Tyler Perry's character is not being paid to be Nick's lawyer in court. He's his ""lawyer of the media"", a PR consultant. Why does Nick have to practice putting on a certain face whenever he talks to media? Or why Tyler Perry's character urges Nick to come forward publicly with his ""secret"" before anyone else does? Because the Media decides who is innocent and who is guilty. <br/><br/>Are there ""holes"" in the plot? Absolutely. But the holes don't matter in the movie because America makes their judgments from what the Media has told them. The capstone to this point is when the detective starts rattling off holes in Amy's story, ironically just as the negative reviewers here on IMDb are doing as well. And why did the FBI agent react so negatively to the detective's questioning, which was mere due diligence on her part? The answer to that question is the point. <br/><br/>It's a shame so many people missed this.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is well acted and very well directed. 9/10."

","Well, I was most looking forward to this particular film. The trailer was so intriguing. WHO killed the wife. That's the main plot. The plot unfolds, when Nick Dunne(Affleck) gets a call. He finds that he comes home to an empty house, ie the wife(Pike) has disappeared. He contacts the local police office. Detective Rhonda Boney(Dickens) heads the investigation. Each clue, and evidence faces towards Nick himself. BUT there's a twist. In that, Sociopaths Path is inside the wife's mind. IN that because she caught Nick cheating on her with Andie(Ratajkowski), she wanted to frame him for her murder and as Missouri has the Death Penalty to kill him. SO she herself disappears. She herself frames Desie(Patrick Harris).<br/><br/>That's all I can give without giving it all away. Overall, I am most disappointed with this film. In that, the trailer gave it all away, by that I mean, in the trailer, it is found that NOT ONE MENTION of Amy, the wife, is sociopath. All we're told is that she's missing and Nick is suspected. I would have loved that the WHOLE movie be surrounded by this plot. Instead half way through they introduce a twist. I detest this, as I got so confused, and simply put there was no need for it."
"FlickChick82","5","2","7","22 November 2014"," Gone...all the logic
","This movie I really wanted to like, because I'm a fan of David Fincher movies. I enjoyed watching The game, Se7en, Zodiac. I like his style as a director. When you watch one of his movies, you know that you're watching a David Fincher film. Sadly that wasn't the case here. Maybe he lost his touch, but it felt as if anybody could've been behind the camera. That how uninspired and unoriginal it seemed. Sure the director is in love with his leading lady, which is showcased in the first and the last scene, that it almost looked like he was ripping off Hitchock and his obsession with blondes. Rosamund Pike was chillingly good as a vindictive wife, Ben Affleck was great in interaction with his twin sister, I enjoyed watching their relationship, but in scenes with Pike he was wooden and not at all believable as a husband. The story is completely illogical and the ending is particularly bad. It ruined the entire movie for me. The best part of the film is Rosamund Pike's character, which reminded me of Sharon Stone's character in Basic Instinct. Her performance was that good and even Oscar worthy."
"RyanCShowers","Null","2","7","18 October 2014"," Exceeds the established expectations of crime thrillers.
","Gillian Flynn published a book titled ""Gone Girl"" in 2012, which soared to the New York Times bestseller lists, captivated critics, and invigorated audiences across America. As anyone would assume from the commercialized system of entertainment, ""Gone Girl"" was developed into a motion picture. Flynn wisely adapted her own novel into the screenplay, and director David Fincher accepted the mission of satisfying the zealous fans of the novel. Thankfully, Fincher has been successful in making a movie that will permeate through cinemas just as the novel did through bookshelves.<br/><br/>On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns to their quiet suburban home in Missouri to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has vanished from their home and the only clue left to her disappearance is a messy crime scene suggesting a struggle. Did Nick kill his wife? Is he holding her hostage? Was Amy murdered by someone else? If so, then by whom? These are the questions that plague police, reporters, and spectators when assessing Nick's apathetic attitude to the situation and the contradictory evidence that emerges.<br/><br/>The first act of ""Gone Girl"" is told from two different perspectives: an objective view of Nick dealing with ramifications of Amy's disappearance and a subjective telling of the love story before Amy went missing, told from Amy's perspective via her diaries. The film functions sufficiently through this period, sometimes it even transcends, but the sharp turn ""Gone Girl"" takes in its second act discombobulates the viewer. Subsequently the film prospers. By act three, ""Gone Girl"" pushes every boundary imaginable, and the final turn of events will not abate from your mind for hours after leaving the cinema.<br/><br/>Within the spear-edged twists of the screenplay lies a mordant stand on probing themes of husband and wife dynamics, marriage deceit, and the fabrication of ideas of being a ""celebrity."" One of Amy's first diary entries begins with Amy underlining this sentence: ""Marriage is hard work."" ""Gone Girl"" asks the question in the most extreme case scenario, do any of us truly know the person who sleeps next to us? The screenplay presents its leading characters in a reticent way, both guarded and unwilling to compromise. The strength of this approach supplies the film with depth because neither character is entirely sympathetic, both have their explicit flaws, and each are mired together in marital issues beyond repair.<br/><br/>David Fincher directs ""Gone Girl"" with the same storytelling standard he has brought to ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" ""The Social Network,"" ""Zodiac,"" and ""Se7en."" There is no question who made this film. Fincher's lark auteur touches are on maximum display in ""Gone Girl,"" and are just as crafty as ever. He adorns his take on the heralded novel with his typical, but ever so effective, scratching, toned score and somber darkly-lit cinematography.<br/><br/>Everyone seeing ""Gone Girl"" is probably familiar with Ben Affleck in some capacity. He's swell as Nick Dunne. However, most people seeing ""Gone Girl"" are probably inexperienced with the British actress Rosamund Pike, but after seeing this film, everyone will know her name. Not only does she have one of the most tremendously written female characters in recent years, but she performs it without a blemish. Pike is eager to summon the terrifying Amy Dunne, and the product is a bravura piece of acting.<br/><br/>If you have never taken any of my opinions on film seriously before, take this one. I plead that you see ""Gone Girl"" because it is a cinematic experience that needs to be lived. The echelon of talent from Fincher, Affleck, Pike, Flynn, Jeff Cronenweth, (the cinematographer), Kirk Baxter (the film editor), Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (the composers) make this an inconceivably good film, which exceeds the established expectations of crime thrillers.<br/><br/>* * * * / * * * *<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"EPDirector","Null","2","7","7 October 2014"," Gone Girl - Gone Nuts!
","Ever since the credits started rolling last night after GONE GIRL, my mind couldn't stop thinking about the film. Not just about how great it is and what an amazing job Fincher has done, because what Fincher has actually done is beyond amazing. It's radical, it's sublime and it's powerful. By the way, I am not just talking about the film.<br/><br/>Back in 2006, M Night Shyamalan was super hot, just like Fincher is today. With that said his 2006 film ""Lady In The Water"" was a miss. Not because the movie was bad, it was actually pretty awful, but rather because he was too blunt about making a movie as bad as that. The plot was ridiculous, spewing mockery of pretty much everything the studio system has been looking to make – the monsters, the unbelievable plot lines that were supposed to be buried behind major visual effects and set pieces shots. You watched ""Lady In The Water"" and were thinking ""WTF IS THIS"" every five minutes, one minute at time. And then you probably walked out. Or stayed, because just like Howard Stern would do it, Shyamalan would keep your hopes up while you sat thru the muck and waited for that amazing twist or a plot line to reveal itself.<br/><br/>But wait a second. Why am I talking about Shyamalan and ""Lady In The Water""? 2 years ago, David Fincher took upon himself to re-create ""Girl With A Dragon Tattoo"" remake, as we know it. We also know that people didn't respond to it too well. Despite the fact the series has been extremely popular in the US, it still felt that the market has been over-saturated with hard covers and paperbacks of the book as well as DVDs of the Millennium Trilogy all around the country. Arguably, every library has been selling off it's excess copies of those books and you could find them virtually in every thrift store for 50 cents a piece.<br/><br/>Fincher knew what he was doing. He knew he had a super famous book on hand, a book that was probably even more so famous because of the EU films. And yet, he took it upon himself to make the film. Don't you think for a second that there wasn't a pile of scripts every studio in town would have killed for Fincher to direct for them. He wanted to direct ""Girl"". And he has. And not too many cared. And it probably affected him in more ways than one.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"", to me, is Fincher's brilliantly masked ""Lady In The Water"". It's a movie that was created to f*ck with your head, senses, morale, the language of film you thought you understood and overall commentary of the pop culture and the shape it's in today. I am only guessing, but the wizardry of ""f*ck you"" in ""Gone Girl"" is astounding just as it is mind boggling.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's life has been in danger after making ""Clockwork Orange"" and why? Because he caused you  manipulated you  made you relate to and sympathize with a sociopath in that film. He made you feel bad for him, he pretty much manipulated an emotion out of you that simply resembles what (and pardon my political parallel) the media is trying to evoke in you when they talk about Hammas and the Gaza strip, by showing you crying women instead of crazy radicals who are killing themselves on camera. Fincher basically held nothing back. He introduced a whole new level of ""f*cked up"" masking it as ""the new norm"". And how can you blame him? Which were the most popular books-turned-movies of late? And I mean, MEGA successful franchise type books-turned-movies? ""The Hunger Games"" is one. A futuristic utopia where children must kill each other. ""50 Shades Of Grey"", a whole new level of ungodly trashosphere about love parading as BDSM and then you had  ""Gone Girl"". In other words, if you want to write a book and ensure it's a huge bestseller, make sure it revolves around hyper reality of blood. Whatever it is. Cut people, rape people, tie people. Seems like it will hit. And that is why Fincher parades ""Gone Girl"" as ""just a close and loyal adaptation of the book"". But then he makes you laugh where it isn't really funny. He shoots intense scenes and makes you laugh. He f*cks with your cinematic sensibility and makes you laugh when you should be crying. And he does it so well that it can make you sick and you wont know why.<br/><br/>I thought Fincher wanted to expose more than just a social commentary on extraordinary power of the news and media overall and how the smallest of stories can be turned into an unprecedented sensation. I simply think that Fincher, hurt and bothered after being pretty much rejected by the masses for doing ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", decided to give birth to another ""Girl"", so f*cked up and yet so perfectly so that no matter what crime he were to commit on screen, and how dark it were to be, he would know that the audience would eat it up it even more-so. And that is probably more disturbing than the film itself. And something tells me Fincher's intent has been achieved that way.<br/><br/>David Fincher has proved himself to be the utmost talented and arguably ""perfect"" director. He can do whatever he wants with hundreds of millions of people as long as they fall under the spell of his films in film theaters, living rooms and bedrooms around the globe. But something also tells me that he got really mad. And that he couldn't take it anymore. And then he made ""Gone Girl"". And I won't be surprised if it's success will hunt Fincher for years to come."

","With his wife's disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man sees the spotlight turned on him when it's suspected that he may not be innocent.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is directed by David Fincher, adapted by Gillian Flynn from her 2012 novel of the same name. It stars Ben Affleck, Rosemund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. I was really excited about this film as David Fincher is on of my favorites director and he's a perfectionist so I knew deep down that it'll be a good one. I was even more excited when I discovered that he hired Ben Affleck to play the husband. This role is perfect for him and he's fantastic in this movie. Rosemund Pike is also excellent; this is probably the best work I've seen from her. I loved it. First I have to say that I read the book before... But for those who did not read the book before, you barely know anything going to this movie. The trailer didn't reveal a lot of things and details, which you don't need to know until you are sitting in the theater experiencing the movie for yourselves. There are so many hidden facts to the story and that I won't spoil to you as so you'll be able to experience them without knowing. I'm glad to see that Fincher cherishes this kind of movie experiences as well. As the film progresses I was continuously surprised, it got darker and darker and meaner. My mouth was dropped. It's really intriguing and you don't know who to root for. You are the detective, watching everything the husband does. Plus, this movie legitimately make you think about the way we perceive the media, the news and factual events. How you just see what the media is showing you. You don't know all the facts. Also how the news and media affect the situation of this man; as a viewer I evolved behind the scenes of how a person's life can crumbled to the ground simply based on a few lies. Technically Fincher is a visionary director and that's what I love about his work. His frames are PERFECT. Secondly I liked the fact that twits and turns of the movie don't came out as showy as I'm use to; just as ""wow..."" thanks to this really good screenplay. The cast was really good. Beside Ben Affleck and Rosemund Pike who are fantastic, I wasn't sure of Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris... So let me tell you that they are great as well! Finally, for being as long as it is the story keeps you certainly interested till the end with an heavy content. You want to get to the end to find out what really happened? What will happen now? And then? What's next for them? This movie is REAL, every situation is realistic. This is obviously one of the best movie of the year. It's a dark story, even a bit rude but I can see the truth in a lot of things that are portrayed. What is so shocking is that things like this are really happening in nowadays society. <br/><br/>Overall Gone Girl has some flawless features, a dramatically powerful core, it's wonderfully acted and it's damn sad when you start thinking about it."
"jtindahouse","8","3","13","2 October 2014"," Stays a touch too faithful to the book
","Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of the novel 'Gone Girl'. It's one of the best I've read in years and renewed my faith that it was still possible to write a clever, surprising and original thriller. Obviously having enjoyed the book so much I was glad to find out it was being adapted into a film. If at that point I had been asked the question, ""what's one thing you'd like to see changed from the book to the movie?"" I would have said the ending.<br/><br/>Now it's not that I didn't like the book's ending, it was simply a case of not being able to imagine that ending being satisfactory in the film version of the story. Doing some reading a few months out from the films release I was ecstatic to read in the trivia section on IMDb this: ""Gillian Flynn, author of the novel the film is based upon, wrote the screenplay with a different ending to keep readers interested in the film version, and viewers from getting spoiled."" I got straight to thinking what should be the ending and to my surprise I had a tough time coming up with anything at all, let alone something deserving of ending this wonderful story. Sadly Gillian Flynn must have found the same thing as me (and what I read in the trivia section must gotten lost in translation), because I was very disappointed to find out tonight that the ending really hadn't been changed at all.<br/><br/>The ending aside however, this is a wonderfully made film. David Fincher always creates such perfect, seamless films that are a pleasure to watch and this one is no exception. I wouldn't say it's quite as dark as some of his previous work or as the trailers might have you believe, but there is one scene in particular that seemed to have a lot of the female audience members squirming in their seats. Those who have read the book will probably be able to guess which one it is.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing short of superb. I would not be at all surprised if both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike receive Academy Award nominations for their performances. Affleck probably has the easier of the two roles but still manages to find that perfect balance between being an utterly unlikeable dirt bag and being the guy you're still rooting for things to work out well for in the end. I wasn't completely sold on Pike's performance until the final third of the film when she really kicked things up a gear and became mesmerising. It was the role of a life time and she nailed it.<br/><br/>Overall 'Gone Girl' is a brilliant film but I can't help feeling that's mostly just because the book itself was so good. It just seems to me you're not getting a different enough experience between reading the book and watching the film. Other than that the only other thing I could fault it on would be the run time. Shaving 10-20 minutes off it may have helped appeal to a few more people. Those two points aside though it's a great ride and a title we'll hear mentioned a lot during award season."

","I have this little movie watching game I developed with my family in which whoever first notices a product placement ad for Coca-Cola yells 'Coca-Cola'. Well I almost did it in a crowd filled theater because it was so blatant here, and only TWO SECONDS onto the picture! I wonder what that cost them, it took up the whole screen.<br/><br/>So this movie's getting a lot of hype and I can't say it's not deserved. But like with all films, with time after it's over to think about what went on in the story, this one appears to be a thrilling story with more loose ends than any recent blockbuster I can recall. The huge credit card bill rung up by Amazing Amy (Rosamund Pike) should have set off some alarm bells with Nick (Ben Affleck) earlier, and at the least he should have been curious about all the stuff she bought to set him up with. Didn't he ever look at the bill? And then, and this is a big one to my mind, once he discovered the stuff in sister Carrie's (Margo Dunne) shed, why didn't he/they move it all the heck out of there? They had to know the cops would come calling at some point.<br/><br/>And finally, here's the one I thought might do Amy in, and it was never even entertained. Why wouldn't Nick's defense attorney (Tyler Perry) call in a forensic handwriting analyst to challenge Amy's diary. It might have been discovered that the entries weren't made over a span of nine years (2005 to present) by analyzing the ink and Amy's writing style that might have changed over the course of time.<br/><br/>Now with all this criticism it might be inferred that I didn't like the movie. On the contrary it was a thrill ride for the most part, and there was one scene, you'll know it when it happens, when I let out an almost inaudible 'Whoa' and the woman sitting next to me looked over and nodded her head. Soon to be followed by a 'WTF' when Amy showed up in her blood soaked dress. I have to say, director Fincher did some clever stuff here to keep you guessing, and I'm sure the film will do extremely well at the box office.<br/><br/>But wait, I'm not done yet - now for the REAL biggie. Why, oh why is Nick staying married to this lunatic? I think that's the thing that most everyone will express about the film and their disappointment with the ending. My idea is they're setting up the sequel, likely to be titled ""Gone Guy""."

We get it! It's a dark/suspenseful/sinister movie! Even scenes shot in bright sunlight or under the glare of indoor office lights are turned murky and dank. I really don't enjoy being beaten over the head for nearly two hours by distracting visual cues in EVERY scene. <br/><br/>Anyhow, at least I didn't bother to see ""Gone Girl"" in a theater but waited until it was on HBO. I watched it because it had been much-hyped and had Oscar nominations. This movie was a complete disappointment and I simply don't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. The acting was mediocre at best, and the storyline impossible to buy into. You could have chopped 45 minutes off of it and it *may* have had a more satisfying end. Amy should have just drowned herself and it would have been better. The twists and turns became almost laughably ridiculous until it was finally over- then you hate yourself for the time you just lost forever wasting your brain cells on it."

We sit and wait for the action, the greatness, the imperious glorious abandon to come, and we are still waiting as the credits roll up the screen. What does this mean? It means Ben Affleck is no Martin Scorsese, no Robert Altman and no Steven Spielberg. No, he is mix between Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino, always falling painfully short of greatness. It is no wonder Jenner Garner wants to divorce him. And yet, there is a Hitchcockian flare underscoring his work, which to me shows great promise, great potential, that could eventually culminate into something as brilliant as ""Strangers On A Train."" Perhaps the problem is that Ben just needs to ""Let himself go,"" trust in the force (instead of his producers) and man-up and grow some balls and unleash his true creative vision upon us.

It's not just the way her voice sounds either, her vocal style and the way she uses words compounds the offense and insult to the ears. I was thinking that instead of using torture, they could just put this actress's voice in the film on repeat with a loud speaker, and strap a terrorist suspect in a chair, and he would confess to anything within a half hour! <br/><br/>This movie is also very slow and boring, with the actors seeming to play their roles in a hammy fashion, not taking any of it seriously.

"bob the moo","Null","2","8","18 January 2015"," Trashy but expertly delivered (SPOILERS)
","When this film came out there was a lot of very positive reviews on it, and I also was aware that it was based on a book (which I then saw lots of people reading). These factors plus the names involved brought me to the film expecting a very high-brow affair with lots of soul searching and seriousness. I was very surprised then to find that actually this was a much more trashy affair – a thriller asking a lot of suspension of belief but rewarding it with a twisty-turny plot and a good strong sense of urgency.<br/><br/>This latter quality is probably what makes it work so well, because it is a very well crafted film with a lot going on around the actual narrative. This is not to say that it needs it, because the central plot has plenty of forward motion to engage and intrigue. Fincher probably delivers it a little poe-faced for what it ultimately ends up being (the ending is enigmatic but seems a little out of place in terms of the 30 minutes prior to it) but it is hard not to like what he does with the material. The structure works very well, and there is a consistent cold atmosphere to it that sits well with moments of rage, spite, or out and out gore. There are interesting things here too; the media frenzy and involvement in everything is shown for what it is, warts and all, even though it is under control to not be more than a supporting thread. In terms of what it says about marriage, that we have basically got Fatal Attraction but from within rather than without, I'm not sure, and wasn't totally sure how comfortable I was with the way it worked that angle, but it did give me something more to mull.<br/><br/>The cast are mixed but mostly strong. Affleck is probably the least engaging because he plays his character well. Awkward, conflicted, out of his depth, he seems like a tall wet rag at times, which I guess in the point but it does mean he tends to be second fiddle to whomever he shares a scene with. Not so Pike; she is fantastic throughout her twisty character – convincing whether she is weeping, coldly destroying someone's life, or conducting terrible acts with a cold, distant look. In support Coon and Dickens are very good and drew me in with their characters. Perry was an odd but enjoyable find, while Harris was solid playing away from the material he is famous (again) for. Pyle was probably miscast as she was a bit heavy and obvious for the media role; meanwhile the cast throws up some other memorable appearances – I was surprised by Ratajkowski being actually pretty good since previously I, like most of the world, only know her for her comfort being naked for Robin Thicke.<br/><br/>In the end I am not sure it is as smart or worthy as the production itself suggests – with its cinematography, great score, big names, and overall presence; but it is still a very engaging and entertaining film with a twisty thriller plot, plenty of events, and lots that keeps the viewer on their toes."
"ashane-mizanian","9","2","8","13 January 2015"," A fantastic thriller !!!
","This might be the most amazing story writing skills in years maybe. An amazing thriller. But the movie is too long and and lack of realistic. But the acting skills were amazing. But I think Neil Patrick ( Desi ) needed more character development into it hence his acting must be praised. And the directors were able to play with our minds by drivings us more and more into the movie. I recommend this movie for people who are above 18. Not because of the sexual scenes or behaviors, this movie tells a story about a cheating husband and a crafty wife. So it is obvious that people need experience in order to feel this movie. Overall I must say "" Best thriller in decades ! """

","With his wife (Rosamund Pike)'s disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man (Ben Affleck) sees the spotlight turned on him when it is suspected that he may not be innocent.<br/><br/>Not being familiar with the source material, most of the twists and turns came completely unexpected. And it was just such a wild trip, one that could be experienced again and again (probably making more sense with each viewing). Affleck is strong here, and Pike absolutely steals the show. Whether this is a contender for Best Picture or Best Director is doubtful, but Pike has a strong shot at Best Actress.<br/><br/>Shockingly, Neil Patrick Harris is not as strong of an actor as one might think, though his role is relatively small. Tyler Perry, on the other hand, is amazing and will blow anyone away who thinks of him simply as the ""Madea"" guy. The plot slows down a bit in the third act, but overall is a tense thriller that is sure to please any movie fan. David Fincher has not made a bad movie yet."

","I'm not going to write a review of this flick because it's been done many times already.<br/><br/>But I will say that this flick creep-ed me the hell out.<br/><br/>The muted colors, gentle splashes of light from the cinematographer. Quick editing.<br/><br/>This film serves as a metaphor for The American Marriage.<br/><br/>That those who succeed in sustaining long term marriages in our poisoned Western Culture must do so at their own peril. Which is actually quite respectable, considering that ""until death do we depart"" is a solemn vow.<br/><br/>The key scene at the very end says it all. Ben Affleck's character, despite his wife's psychopathic sins, suggests that he's going to stay with her. That despite desperately wishing to leave the marriage, he's going to stick it out.<br/><br/>Dysfunction attracts dysfunction, and marriages are about dysfunctional people who are just barely willing to put up with each others nonsense, no matter the cost, simply because nobody else will.<br/><br/>That's really what this movie is about, or at least what I take from it.<br/><br/>Kind of reminded me of blade runner. Similar vibe, dystopia, with characters facing the inevitable.<br/><br/>This film will take multiple viewings for the Under 30 Crowd to have a prayer of understanding what it truly is about.<br/><br/>Of note, I've never been married...."

","I've decided that David Fincher as a director is only as good as his writers. All of his movies look and move the same. They're all dreary grays and browns and each one gives the impression that Fincher is striving to make The Great American Movie whether or not the subject matter warrants. It falls, then, to his writers to distinguish one of his movies from the next, and if there is any playfulness or humour in a Fincher film, it's not because he put it there.<br/><br/>I haven't read ""Gone Girl,"" but since the screenplay is by the same woman who wrote the book, I trust that the film is fairly faithful both in story and tone to the story on which it is based. In that case, it's a crock of hooey masquerading as a serious work of art, a pot boiler that pretends to have something to say. Indeed, I've heard that Gillian Flynn intended for her book to be a commentary on modern marriage, to which I say, HA!<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is entertaining enough while you're watching it, but the thing completely unravels as soon as you start thinking about it afterwards. It's all about plot and nothing about character. To a certain extent, Flynn has made her story critic proof, because the lead female character, played well by Rosamund Pike, is just flat-out insane, which means she doesn't have to be consistent and her motives don't have to be plausibly explained, because the explanation is ""Hey, she's crazy!"" Makes for a convenient narrative device but isn't especially interesting as a central character. Ben Affleck fades into the background, proving once again that he's far more interesting behind the camera than in front of it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoyed ""Gone Girl"" for what it was but didn't give it an once more credit than it deserved. And the ratings here at IMDb at the time of this review!! The 86th best movie of all time? Give me a break. Anyone who thinks ""Gone Girl"" deserves to be on the list of 100 greatest movies ever made needs to see some more movies.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"powermandan","10","2","8","23 November 2014"," Best Movie of The Year!
","Every so often, there is a movie with full originality, great acting, great filming, and wide twists in the plot. Actually, this isn't ""fully"" original since it is about a disappearance, but the subplots and curveballs thrown are good enough! It follows a seemingly happy couple's (Affleck& Pike) journey after the wife goes missing. Throughout the movie, secrets will be revealed and the unexpected will ensue as we find out what really happened to the wife and how the marriage already was. The themes of dishonestly, media and perceiving are what make this movie important to see. If there wasn't important themes, there would not be importance and the movie itself would not have been as good. This movie is a first-rate thrill ride that has not been done amazingly since Inception back in 2010. Inception was an action-thriller, whereas Gone Girl is a mystery-thriller, and I honestly can't remember the last mystery-thriller that was this good. Alfred Hitchcock would have been impressed."

","OK, so I saw this film tonight at my local cinema and was hopeful the movie would live up to the hype I had been reading. Yes I have heard that the book is great although can't be bothered with reading it.<br/><br/>Anyway the film starts slowly where Affleck's wife goes missing and we follow the manhunt and the media frenzy as BA tries to put the puzzles together about his wife whereabouts, with his twin sister. Evidence start to stack up against Affleck as does peoples opinion. I won't spoil it for anyone but the plot didn't disappoint and the film is quite enjoyable for the most part. <br/><br/>Direction, acting, music and storyline blend well together to reward the film-goer. But here is where the film disappointed me or rather the storyline. For the last 15 minutes of the film I could not believe what was happening. It was as the author had given up on the last pages his book on how to come up with a great ending and goes for some unbelievable long-shot, hope it will stick conclusion. The story was so captivating and believable that I could see Fincher on the red carpet with the Oscar, but the ending killed the movie for me.<br/><br/>When all is said is done, could have been thriller of the year(IMO) but came up short."
"dstanwyck","7","2","8","24 October 2014"," Way too long!
","In a few words, too many words were an over-kill for this endless, endless movie. Way too long. The acting was very good, but then after awhile, given the misguided length of it, the acting became just good, without any superlatives. Could have eliminated about 45 minutes and I would have given it a 7 or maybe 8 - even the 6 that I did give it was probably 1 or 2 too many. That was more for the acting than anything else. Rosamund Pike, whom I'd never seen before, is a beauty (in the beginning) and quite good. The detective and the twin sister of Affleck were very good as well and Affleck also pulled it off. No fan in particular of Neil Patrick Harris, his performance seemed to be pushed into the film and then gorily pushed out of it without having the opportunity (or ability?) to do more. Tyler Perry was a bit too jovial and flip in his role, which he customarily is (in interviews) but I find him a pleasant character. The 2 trailer trash characters could have had their scenes eliminated (although they were good) and had her money taken in some other, briefer way. Too much time spent on her psychopathology without any indication of its possible root. All in all, I was itching to get up and go out much sooner than I actually did. Really disappointed. Had been looking forward to a film noir in color and it turned out to be non-mystery in blood."
"fernestar","8","2","8","19 October 2014"," Gone Girl. She be gone!
","I wasn't planning on seeing Gone Girl, but I'm glad I did. For a movie that has a listed running time of 149 minutes – which translates to 3 hours plus of cinema chair buttock time – it engaged for the entire period, with no lulls or 'boring bits'. At its core Gone Girl is a dramatic mystery, although moments of humour and horror are applied to provoke audience reaction – a particular standout moment had everyone in the cinema looking at each other with ""damn', did that just happen!"" across their eyeballs. You'll know the bit. The situational drama becomes ridiculous and convoluted - but at the same time is entirely believable. To allude to the plot would ruin much of the surprise, but the initial premise of 'girl is missing' is built upon to reveal a far more interesting tale. The polish of the movie should hardly be surprising really – David Fincher (Fight Club, Social Network) continues to direct story adaptations to a very high standard, capturing the ambiance of suburban America and providing a commentary on the role that sensationalised media and the age of instant communication can have in preconceiving instant judgements. Oh yeah, and the circumstances surrounding (some) missing people. The acting performances are delivered very well across the board. Ben Affleck's second coming continues (let's hope it carries on for Batman vs!), but it is Rosamund Pike that really stands out. She has been in a lot of films I've seen recently (A Long Way Down, Hector and the Search for Happiness, What We Did on Our Holiday) with Gone Girl delivering the most complex and complete character performance yet. It wouldn't be surprising to see recognition come awards season. Added to the great direction and quality acting is another grade A theatrical score from Trent Reznor – the electro classical combination creates genuine moments of disquiet and tension at key points as the plot unfolds. So why wasn't I hyped for Gone Girl in the first place? I mean, the movie doesn't really have any faults. Well, it was a case of the trailer judge hitting the hammer and missing the mark. The trailer looks like it tells you the entire story, in what felt like a desperate attempt to garner interest – but that was a very incorrect assessment by myself. If you like good quality drama stories, take the time to watch Gone Girl, it doesn't feel like 3 hours. Note:- if you are watching with a partner, just make sure you are solid before going into this."
"eoghanscally","8","2","8","15 October 2014"," A Film With All The Right Qualities
","Taking the classic route for a mystery thriller, Gone Girl delivers on all aspects of successful filmmaking. It does not hesitate to tell the nitty gritty of marriage, on an exaggerated yet believable format.<br/><br/>David Fincher returns with an adaption of Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name. With a cast including Ben Affleck (Nick Dunne) and Rosemunda Pike (Amy Dunne), Gone Girl is an intriguing story. It tells the tale of a marriage once loving yet now seemingly on its last legs but with the disappearance of Nick's wife, he soon become the focus of an intense media circus, the fight for justice and story of marriage mix well.<br/><br/>Fincher's ability to tell the story and switch between both sides is excellent. He allows us to take two accounts and begin forming our own opinions of what actually happened to Amy Dunne and the pairs once loving marriage. We are kept intrigued and guessing as to what has happened and as the story develops and it is revealed,we wait to see as to what will happen. Apart from the stunning performances by the two leads, the rest of the cast also deliver a rock solid performance. The script and shots are well delivered and the color pallet also adds to the dark tone of the film along with the music. It does also deliver a few jokes when your not expecting them, which lighten the mood at tense moments. <br/><br/>Overall, Fincher's film is a dazzling tale and one of the best films I have seen so far this year. So why only 8*? I just feel that there might be something missing, though I can't put my finger on it. Still well worth the watch."
"viktr","8","2","8","15 October 2014"," 7 for the thriller, 8 for the message about our relationships
","This movie starts out as any other thriller out there, the wife to the main character has gone missing after a few hours away from home and the search is on to find her. Nick played by Ben Affleck is a somewhat dull character and it's actually hard to tell if that's because he is played by Ben Affleck or if it's the reason Ben Affleck got the role. Sorry Ben. Under the surface Nick is clearly not as much of a nice guy as he would make others believe and any critic with a feminist view saying Nick is portrayed as a good guy with the wife being portrayed as a bad guy needs to put their sunglasses away.<br/><br/>Compared to Nick, the wife Amy is an intriguing character played by Rosamund Pike which I really think is an asset to this movie and hopefully we'll see more of her in the future. Besides Amy, few characters contain any substance to chew on for the audience and overall it's quite stereotypic. The story as it unfolds also feels a bit too fictional and Desi Collings played by Neil Patrick Harris feels downright silly.<br/><br/>However, the movie gets your attention and makes 2.5 hours go relatively fast. The dynamics between Nick and Amy as we are told is interesting.<br/><br/>But what this movie really does is using the format of a thriller to deliver a strong message about the roles we humans play in our relationships to get our needs fulfilled, both the ones we are born with and the needs we've been learned to have. This role playing is something we do everyday, mostly happening below our radar making it even more effective. When the movie in the end then introduce a very concrete and real role playing game above our attention radar we are tricked into thinking that this is something awful happening. But, just as we are told, in reality this is not at all different to the constant role playing we spend the days of our lives doing; ""this is what marriage is""."
"sportello29","7","3","15","5 October 2014"," A thriller at it's finest
","This movie is about a genius psychopath, about the prolonged pleasure of revenge. Amazing Amy (Rosamund Pike's best performance yet), who really is amazing, is a smart, charismatic and very positive character. With the help of her parents, she had made a name for herself early in her childhood through writing a book called Amazing Amy, which was a partially autobiographical novel based on Amy's real childhood. It is initially through this book that we get to have a glance on Amy's real hidden insanity and thirst for manipulation. Her own story wasn't perfect enough for Amy and she manipulated the character to have all the things she desired at that point – lots of friends, a pet and other little pleasures children wish for at this age. <br/><br/>Also in that very scene we get a sense of how gullible, simple and narrow-minded is her husband, Nick, brilliantly portrayed by Ben Affleck. The best he can do is shoot a good joke in a serious conversation or side with Amy on her 'unfortunate childhood'. We get an impression of Affleck as a sort of a trophy husband for Amy, he is good looking, charming and well mannered, however wildly unambitious, which makes him a perfect fit for someone like Amy, who likes and needs to be in control. The intellectual and cultural difference between the two is one of the things that strikes first in their relationship, emphasized with Amy's desire to dictate things, which is echoed in the film through many gestures like the ties she bought him, the watch that he hates but still wears etc. Yet she definitely and truly loves him and in the beginning he does so too. <br/><br/>Love is the only thing Amazing Amy was never able to control - and that's what initially drives her mad – jealousy. She recalls a scene where she goes to surprise Nick to a bar they owned (bought on Amy's money) and spots him with a woman that he kisses using the same gesture of love he used when they first met – and that for her is the tipping point. At this point, he already gradually ruined her big life ambitions, first by getting sacked during the recession, then by forcing her (without asking) to move to a different town to help take care of his dying mother and then, on top of everything, by falling in love with someone else. Love is the best and the worst thing that ever happened to Amy – we see how she quietly suffers without being able to let go, it drives her absolutely insane – we clearly see that her ambitions and abilities are far beyond the lifestyle she lives. <br/><br/>It is a sweet mixture of love-to-hate and revenge that fuels Amy in the journey she carefully and brilliantly plans and with a killer hand and instincts – embarks on. By all means she is incredibly smart and thoughtful – a genius even – we see that when she guides us through her mastermind plan that undoubtedly involved tedious planning and persistence. She however is a woman that doesn't strike us by making spontaneous decisions and the fact that she still truly loves Nick, something she still can't control – ruins her plan in end. <br/><br/>At the turning point of the movie, Amy loses all the money she carefully saved in order to completely execute her plan, however when this falls through, she is again left with a situation she cannot control and that she didn't plan for. Somewhere in the midst of running away, watching Nick perform his glorious smiles on TV and losing all her savings probably made her also realize that her life isn't worth his, that he would probably suffer even more with constantly having her around again after all that happened. At this point Amy's complete descent into madness begins. <br/><br/>She reaches out to an old high school boyfriend – later –stalker Desi who again seems like a perfect target for Amazing Amy to manipulate – he is desperately in love with her and is willing to go all lengths necessary to make it work between them again. In Desi we also see how his deep unintentional love for Amy eventually destroys him. <br/><br/>Going back to the scene where Amy initially reaches out to Desi, it is evident that she does so for the purpose of being able to come home again and continue manipulating her relationship with Nick. Desi by all means is a perfect target for this.<br/><br/>Amy seems to have this ability to constantly control people, but in a way that a psychopath would, stealthily, strategically, without the target even noticing. <br/><br/>Even after all what happened, even after the pregnancy, Nick seems to almost adjust to the situation. He even tells his sister, who supported him all the way through, that the baby is his (even though Amy artificially made this happen without telling him) and that maybe he should try and makes this work with Amy.<br/><br/>One thing remains certain about the amazing Amy Dunn - her nature, choices and unfortunate circumstances have led to a complete and unstoppable descent into evil, revenge, madness and a deep dark desire to be in control of her perfect life, which is a state we leave her and Nick in when the credits start running."
"ZChrisJ1995","9","3","15","2 October 2014"," Another stylistic masterpiece from David Fincher
","David Fincher's career has been defined by grim, bleak productions with an underlying dark sense of humour, and 'Gone Girl' is no exception. While not as good as the likes of 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', 'Gone Girl' is still an excellent production, and up there with the year's best films. <br/><br/>The initial premise of the film is whether Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) has murdered his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). However, the film takes multiple plot twists and turns, making the matter much more complicated than it initially appears. <br/><br/>The two leads are fantastic, but Pike is the real highlight, flawlessly portraying a woman who has some serious relationship problems to say the least. A potential Best Actress nominee. <br/><br/>Other stand-out performers include Neil Patrick Harris, who takes a rare serious role without any difficulty, as well as Tyler Perry as idiosyncratic defence attorney Tanner Bolt. <br/><br/>'Gone Girl' carries on Fincher's current tradition of a highly polished visual style juxtapositioned with its morbid subject matter, complimented by its crisp editing and cinematography. <br/><br/>Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who provided the soundtrack for both 'The Social Network' and 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' are likewise a familiar addition, with the score provided by them being mostly minimalist, yet perfectly tied-in to the on-screen occurrences and the film's grim tone. <br/><br/>As an adaptation of the popular 2012 novel, 'Gone Girl' doesn't disappoint, removing certain elements that are superfluous or unnecessary, yet still strictly sticking to the unique plot structure and maintaining the novel's cynical view of marriage and long-term relationships. It would seem that Fincher and author/screenwriter Gillian Flynn are a match made in cinematic heaven. <br/><br/>Highly-recommended viewing."
"Theo Robertson","7","2","9","14 April 2015"," Trash But Entertaining Trash
","!!!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!! <br/><br/>I notice a lot of people are saying this is our generation's equivalent of FATAL ATTRACTION and I guess the trailers emphasised this a bit with a deranged blond woman as an antagonist . Based on a novel by Gillian Flynn I was reminded of a novel by Sean French called SECRET SMILE which was turned in to a ITV teleplay starring David Tennant just as he was embarking in his role of The Doctor in 2005 . I thought SECRET SMILE was an incredibly daft ,trashy , crime melodrama . . Considering both stories had a very similar premise I have the opinion that GONE GIRL is also an incredibly daft , trashy crime melodrama but one that's far more entertaining than it has any right to be <br/><br/>I've never been a great fan of David Fincher . He does make good movies but I don't think he's made a truly great movie but GONE GIRL does show he's quite good at what he does . Ben Affleck is merely okay which is a backhanded compliment because he's one of those actors that I'm constantly puzzled as to how he became such a star and normally can't stand him . English rose Rosamund Pike who will probably be little known stateside is an absolute revelation as American housewife Amy Dunne a woman whose personality disorder manifests itself as misandry and goes about trying to frame her husband for her own murder and the performance is Oscar nomination worthy . For me however the star of the movie is the soundtrack by Reznor and Ross involving a sort of fusion between classic , industrial and techno beat . There's an absolutely stand out scene about halfway through where Amy gives a long monologue in voice over as to how she conceived her plan and the use of music is compelling and hypnotic and might just be my favourite soundtrack from recent cinema <br/><br/>Despite all this you need a great screenplay in order to make a great film and here GONE GIRL falls down slightly . I've never read the source novel so don't know how faithfully it has been adapted for screen but there is a massive plot turn towards the end that I found rather jarring almost as though the plot realises it has painted itself in to a very small corner and needs a way to wrap up the story . That said the ending is somewhat ambiguous and we're are left with the feeling perhaps Amy hasn't got away with . Her plan however would never have worked in real life but I suppose you're not supposed to give too much thought as to the plot mechanics and sit back and enjoy the ride which as trashy entertainment succeeds very well"

"stock-1","10","2","9","23 December 2014"," Stunning Peace of Work
","Indeed David Fincher did it again. At the surface the movie script resembles a totally over the top fictitious story which could never happen for real, with the Find Amy Trust Fund and the nightly press coverage. Only occasionally once in a decade such a thing could happen in America but in the rare event it does the missing girl is either never found back or found dead. Press coverage of such events is these days mostly brought as aftermath after finding a dead body. Inside Gone Girl the audience is presented with a 'live' kidnapping where the wealthy parents within 24 hours setup a website with a trust-fund to find their Amy back, including day to day press coverage, like we have seen from the Madeleine McCann case. Gone Girl kept me watching for two hours and thirty minutes without even feeling the need for a break for a smoke or drink, which likewise only happens to me once in a decade. People who followed the McCann disappearance will no doubt do the same. A warning is at place though as the ending is quite unusual and will put-off a lot of McCannies including Amy's husband Ben Affleck who plays his amicable role as the Missouri husband very nicely. After watching the viewer will finally understand why it is that real rapers and sexual abusers never burn their hands on women like amazing Amy Elliot, and aim for the homeless and orphans instead. Is Gone Girl a movie which is only produced occasionally once in a decade ? It depends whether or not Hollywood is interested in doing a blockbuster about the disappearance of Madeleine McCann featuring its real details, which is no fairy tale as the Portugese Police department has made the entire dossier material available to the public, which has never happened before during the entire documented history of Interpol, Europol or the Metropolitan Police combined."

Don't listen to those bad reviews done by retards who expect only stupid action, monsters, shootings, blood, fights, they appreciate only B-movies, they have no patience for a slow and good action, they don't appreciate the acting, they want to see only fights and killings without any dialogs. These stupid people are laughing when someone is slipping on a banana peel, but cannot understand a smart and funny dialog."

A lot of good scenes will keep you enjoy watching the movie. Too many twist aren't really made it bad.

","If you like previous Fincher works like The Game, then you will thoroughly enjoy this, as it is full of stylish twists and turns in the film making. As someone that's not a huge Affleck fan, I felt he really did a good job with this role but Rosamund Pike steals the show with her performance. The Soundtrack is really well done sounding like a mix between Vangelis and Nine Inch Nails at points. I believe films should be advertised purely by who directs it, as a David Fincher fan this film is truly damn near perfect from the subtle perversion within editing, the innovative soundtrack and especially great social commentary. I honestly feel this film will receive negative reviews purely for the issues it looks, essentially the opposite effect of a movie like ""The Butler."""

","I couldn't wait to see ""Gone girl."" I've loved most of David Finchers movies, with ""Seven"" and ""Zodiac"" being 2 movies I can't get enough of. Not to mention that word of mouth was saying it was another masterpiece, and it is. Its awesome.<br/><br/>This Moody thriller sees Ben Affleck as the centre of attention as his wife Rosamund Pike goes missing. From here I don't really want to give anything else away. As the movie really does go in as many different directions as you could possibly squeeze into a 2 and a half hour long flick. I was thinking I had it sussed at first. Knowing that there were a couple of twists on the horizon. But the fact that it can mislead you so easily is probably the reason why the film has become as popular as it has become. There is virtually no way you will predict where this movie is going, and when you think you have. Your wrong.<br/><br/>""Gone girl"" is a brilliantly twisted thriller that has a dark and complicated plot that will have you hooked on a film that manages to breath new life into the careers of many of its stars too. Ben Affleck and Neil Patrick Harris impress with their serious performances (though the film has a sarcastic sense of humour at times too). But the breakout star here is one time ""Bond girl"" Pike, who is actually amazing as the ""gone girl"" of the title."
"thomas-w15","5","2","9","20 November 2014"," Too Dark for my taste
","Gone Girl: Not since I saw Prisoners last year have I felt the way I felt after seeing Gone Girl. In certain parts it makes you feel horrified by what happened and how they showed it happening. It is probably the darkest film I have ever seen. For what it is though, it was very well put together. With creepy good acting from Rosamund Pike and well guided directing from David Fincher, Gone Girl successfully disturbs you throughout the whole film. <br/><br/>Quick note: For those of you that read the book, the author of Gone Girl also helped write the film and in order to keep the readers interested, she changed the storyline and the ending. <br/><br/>The reason I may not sound super enthused about this review is because I am not a very big fan of dark movies or scary movies in general. They just are too creepy for me. If you love those kind of films, I could not think of a better choice for you than Gone Girl. As far as what I thought the film could have done better, I cannot think of much other than to try to put a little more comedy in it so it would not feel so dark for such a long time. This way it would be able to appeal to much wider audiences. <br/><br/>The acting speaks for itself in Gone Girl. Ben Affleck does a good job playing the psycho, unlucky husband. Rosamund Pike does an amazing job convinces us that she is certifiably insane. Even to a disturbing degree in fact. For those of you wanting Neil Patrick Harris to be playing a similar role as the one he played in How I Met Your Mother, you are in the wrong place. He is much more versatile than I could have imagined, as his role was completely opposite of what his role was in How I Met Your Mother. The only thing I kind of liked was the way the director plays the audience in the film. He makes you sympathize for one character one minute then make you hate that character the next, and visa versa. The great use of underscoring, selection of shots, and shock and awe moments were the key factors that made Fincher's directing of this picture successful. The author/screenwriter Gillian Flynn did a fine job supplying the necessary source material horrifying enough to have every audience member say ""what the ****!?!?""<br/><br/>As I said before, if you like dark films, nothing will suit you better than Gone Girl. If not, I recommend you to stay away from this film.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","9","8 November 2014"," Fincher Once Again Comes Thru
","Gone Girl (2014) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>David Fincher's adaptation of the best-selling novel about a husband (Ben Affleck) who finds himself under media scrutiny when his semi-famous wife (Rosamund Pike) goes missing is certainly something twisted and wicked but what would you expect from this director?<br/><br/>I went into this film knowing nothing of the story, outside of the wife going missing, so I was really along for every twist and turn that the story threw at us. Obviously, with this type of mystery, it's impossible to fully discuss it without spoilers so I will avoid that for any new viewer. With that said, there's no question that Fincher can handle a bizarre mystery like this but what makes the film even more memorable is the rather sly and bitter social commentary on the media and how they'll destroy anyone just for a good story and ratings.<br/><br/>Fincher is too smart to make the social commentary stick out like a sore thumb but he does manage to put it in the film and play it off well with the mystery that we're watching. The way the film unfolds is so brilliantly done and edited that you can't help but be wrapped up in the mystery one moment, cheering for one character the next minute but then a second later be feeling something completely different. The film had a rather laid back approach and it clocks in at nearly 150-minutes but the roller coaster ride is there from the opening scenes to the closing one. Again, I'm going to avoid spoilers but you and your date will certainly be discussing the outcome and events for months. <br/><br/>What really helps are the terrific performances including Affleck who once again proves he can act whenever he wants to. This is easily the best performance of his career and not for a second do you see a superstar but instead you see a husband who is facing the biggest stress of his life. Pike is another standout as the wife who will certainly go down in history as....well, I can't say it because it would spoil too much. Neil Patrick Harris is also very good in his supporting role and even Tyler Perry brings a certain style and cockiness to his role, which was really needed. Carrie Coon as the sister and Kim Dickens are also stand-outs. <br/><br/>GONE GIRL, due to its story, has a few moments that you might question and there's no question there are some major twists and turns along the way. What's clear is that this script and cast could be given to a dozen different directors and I think it's safe to say that ten would probably really mess it up. It's the type of story that one false move in the directing department could lead to a train wreck of a movie. Thankfully Fincher is smart enough to pull the material together, bring his style to it and deliver a very memorable film that keeps you guessing, and most importantly thinking, up until the credits roll."
"nightwing90","8","2","9","3 November 2014"," Slow But Engaging Thriller
","David Fincher's Gone Girl is a slow paced thriller and engages you for the full two and a half hours with a different way of story telling which is not something that we see quite often. The film stands out with solid performances to complement and back the narrative to make it a must watch thriller that is mixed with the right doses of emotion and drama. The variety in how the story has been treated is too refreshing and puts Gone Girl in the league of some of the best films from Hollywood.<br/><br/>The story has two central protagonists Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick Dunne (Benn Affleck). They fall in love and gets married but gradually difference of opinion puts gap in their marital life. On their fifth wedding anniversary day Nick returns home only to find that Amy is missing leaving some hidden clues but not conclusive enough for a breakthrough. The investigation that follow for the search and cause of Amy's missing is presented too well in this film from Fincher.<br/><br/>The film has a slow pace initially but gradually picks up momentum and the treatment of the drama is such that never the movie goes dull or unexciting. As said earlier, direction and screenplay is backed by solid performances from all the actors to make Gone Girl a well crafted film in every department.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck was in fine form as Nick Dunne portraying the character entrusted to him with such perfection and finesse. Matching equally was Rosamund Pike as Amy. Kim Dickens (as Detective Rhonda) was another actor who stood out with a terrific performance to match the lead pair. Also impressive was Carry Coon as Nick's sister and Tyler Perry who is the advocate helping Nick in his legal battle.<br/><br/>So in every aspect, this movie stands apart and here is one cinema you cannot miss at any cost. Since i haven't read Gillian Flynn's novel, i am not in a position to say how far the adaptation from book has been but that does not stop me from giving four out of five for David Fincher's Gone Girl, a slow and an engaging thriller with a presentation that deserves a big thumbs up. ""GO FOR IT"" is the final verdict from here."

","My Review For Gone girl Is marriage is such a complicated thing? We all know it has its ups and downs can marriage can be dangerous too? How well a person can understand the other person in just 5 years of there relationship ?. All this question rush through my mind when I left the theater with a heaviness in my heart. I read the book Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn 1 month ago it was such a great experience of exploring such dynamic characters and Gillian Flynn does it so well that the story gets deeper and deeper in to the horrors of marriage. The movie starts off great with the line which is also the starting line of the novel an if look at it carefully you will understand that the movie completely justifies the novel except the movie doesn't go deep in to amazing Amy fantasies story books as they have written in the book. David Fincher nails it again,the atmosphere of all the scene and the lighting effect are just as perfect as they gets when you read the novel this movie gives you a remainder of Hitchcock classics suspense movies. Ben Affleck was amazing, cool guy the kind of character who keep all his fears secrets inside his stomach and doesn't give you a slightest of the hint when you look at his face and Hats Off to Rosamund Pike the greatest on screen performance of the year she truly deserves an Oscar Noam and Margo played by Carrie coon was too perfect and all the other characters was also great. The ending of the movie will be a part of the discussion because I can say that the people who haven't read the book are the people who will not like the ending. The message you get is like marriage is like a cigarette you know from the start that the thing is going to kill you someday but you couldn't leave that because that is the only thing that you need when you are alone or under stress so its an undying relationship. So go rush to the theater and this movie will make you day"
"capela30","9","2","9","28 October 2014"," Gone Girl - One of the best of 2014
","How can you tell when a movie is great? It makes you feel good? It makes you feel gut- wretched? It makes you want to watch it again? It makes you want to talk and write about it? For me Gone Girl is all these things except the first one. This is not a feel good movie. But it is one hell of a movie. It picks you up, swirls you around and just when you think you know what's going on in pulls the rug from under you like a slap to the face. No wait, like a f***ing punch to the face.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is one of the most hated Hollywood actors, but there's really no reason for that. Not anymore. Those infamous Daredevil, Paycheck and Gigi years are long gone. It's been 10 years. And for the past 4 years Ben Affleck has produced (with the exception of Runner Runner, let's ignore that one) really great work. As an actor AND as a director. In Gone Girl he was superb. Flawless as an actor who plays a flawed character.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great (and I mean including Tyler Perry). But the one who steals the show is, without a doubt, Rosamund Pike. Her portrayal of the missing wife is beautifully constructed and layered. It's a very complex character, certainly not an easy one to play, but Rosamund Pike succeeds in turning it into a whimsical character. Oscar nomination? Certainly. Oscar grab? Too soon to tell.<br/><br/>David Fincher. You twisted man. And I mean that in a good way. You took a very demanding book adaptation and it's all just soÂ… exquisite. Every shot, every character development, every dialogue, every twist... Fincher had the right ingredients and he cooked them perfectly for you to savor every single moment.<br/><br/>Gone Girl starts as a simple but intense thriller. Yes the first half of the film starts a little bit slow. But it's all part of the act. After that it grows to be much more. The film tackles subjects like the complexity of marriage and the compromises it demands, the manipulative power of the media, the gullibility of the audience and the curse it is to be the subject to scrutiny of public opinion (The Hunt. Another very good film that approaches this same topic).<br/><br/>(T)he Good: The brilliantly played characters, Fincher's directing, Trent Reznor's soundtrack, and the motherf***ing twists and turns.<br/><br/>(T)he Bad: Neil Patrick Harris. I like him. But not in this movie. I wouldn't buy it and I feel the character he played could have been much more intense and deep. Michael C. Hall or Michael Shannon would have been great.<br/><br/>(T)he Trivia: Originally Nick was supposed to wear a New York Yankees cap in one scene. But Affleck, a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan, refused to wear it. Ultimately he and Fincher compromised and in that scene he wears a New York Mets cap.<br/><br/>When Should I Wa(T)ch - Gone Girl: Saturday night, with a couple of friends in a movie theater (to absorb the loud and hypnotizing soundtrack)."

","A popular trick in novels is the ""Unreliable Narrator."" One of the characters tells us everything that happened; but then we discover that character missed important events, or is lying, or is insane. Perhaps another character then tells everything from their point of view; and then we realize the first character was lying. Perhaps the second character is also lying. Etc. This ""Unreliable Narrator"" technique can make novels very entertaining (especially mysteries.) The problem with films: we usually believe everything we see happening on the screen (unless it's obviously a dream or hallucination.) How can a writer and director and actor show a lie on film? In ""Gone Girl,"" is everything we see and hear true? Or is it possible the director showed us events that didn't happen?"
"bw92116","5","2","9","26 October 2014"," See it for the cat
","This film starts out as almost a modern-day film noir, and a good one, but about halfway through the mystery is revealed, and after that it tries too hard to be a horror comedy. It is weighed down by an uninteresting and unnecessary subplot which culminates in a graphic and bloody murder scene, and the film's conclusion is implausible. It might have been a terrific film if they had just held steady to the main storyline.<br/><br/>A patient is released from the hospital still covered with dried blood, and there cannot be any doctor that would sign a discharge order for a patient in that condition. The dialog towards the end is a mess, with the worst line being ""That's marriage."" The primary villain is given a pass on everything. I'm not against having a story end with the bad guys winning, but it has to be believable. And I didn't find this believable. I suspect it has an ""incomplete"" feeling because they are leaving room for a sequel if this becomes a big hit.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's acting has steadily improved over the years and I was impressed with his timing and delivery. Rosamund Pike gives it her all and pulls it off. Individually they both give strong performances, but I didn't detect any real chemistry between them. Even the flashbacks of when they were ""in love"" are not convincing. The supporting cast adds a lot of value, and even though Tyler Perry doesn't seem committed to his role and was probably miscast, he did deliver the line that got the only real laugh out of the audience.<br/><br/>I have to say that the recording and editing of the dialog failed at many moments; even key lines of dialog were often just barely audible, and quite a few times we had to ask each other, ""what did they say?"" The background music and sound effects are well done, so it seems odd they would fail at recording the actual dialog. They're also trying to make some kind of statement about the media and the whole celebrity culture, but those scenes seem like filler.<br/><br/>The real star of the show is the hefty orange cat that appears periodically and takes all the bizarre shenanigans in stride, even sitting serenely while 10 police cars are outside with their sirens wailing... must be a deaf cat."

","Review of the film Gone Girl The film adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel Gone Girl comes across the screen with an eerie stillness that elevates from the very first moment where Nick Dunne, played adeptly by Ben Affleck, stands at the curb of his suburban home taking in the silent Missouri morning. It is an unforgettable beginning, one that comes to mind abruptly late in the film when the chaos has come full circle, and Nick is standing at the exact same spot in the early morning, except this time the curb is lined with television trucks.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is more than just your typical murder mystery. At its heart is the concerns of relationships, specifically marriages, and the way in which people tend to eat away at one another, trying to devour the significant other with questions that seem to load the burden of reciprocity: What are you thinking, Amy? Who are you? What have we done to each other? What will we do? The questions not only imply the insecurities of relationships, the need to discover in someone else what you can't seem to find in yourself, but they foreshadow the major themes of the movie as well: the inability to truly know someone or to convey yourself to somebody else, the inevitable burdening of apprehensions onto the significant other, and the hope that a significant other can alleviate the itinerant loneliness that comes with life. The central conflict is a nail-biting spin-off of how far people are willing to go to make the person you once loved suffer mixed with how far are you willing to go to make it last.<br/><br/>On the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary Amy Dunne goes missing, and the actions of Nick Dunne call into question his relationship with his wife, making him the obvious suspect. He is seen smiling in photos, his features are smug and somewhat emotionless, except to reveal the occasional self-awareness that he is good looking, a sweet heart in the heartland, and he does not seem to be overly concerned with his wife's absence, as if he believes it is some big hoax, his wife just trashed the living room and took off.<br/><br/>The film oscillates between ""the day of"" Amy's disappearance as it progresses forward, to the earlier stages of their relationship, where you begin to realize they were a hopelessly doomed couple, artistic and witty, both writers in New York, both young and beautiful, idealistic, she wealthy from the trust her parents established publishing Amazing Amy children's books based on her when she was a child. What you will notice in the film is how the family dynamic is prominent throughout. The focus on Amy's resentment of her parents, creating an alter-ego of their daughter that excelled where she failed, despite the privilege and status it provided her as an adult, a privilege she recognizes and loathes at the same time. And Nick, whose twin sister Go lives in North Carthage, the suburban town they grew up in, where Nick thoughtlessly brings Amy to live when they both find themselves unemployed at the same time his now deceased mother is diagnosed with terminal cancer. That, and their father who they abjectly placed in a nursing home, visiting once a year, an apathy developed out of disgust for the way he raised them. Amy and Nick seem to have deep seated family issues at the core of their unhappy marriage, addressing the question of whether or not our inability to have rich and healthy relationships in America is not a product of having not many great examples of them. The point is that you could spend all day picking apart this movie, debating what it's about, analyzing its motifs and symbols, or simply admiring it. Because it is powerfully wrought, thoughtfully designed, and the translation from novel to film is one of the best in years.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a shocker, full of twists and turns that move at a gradual, yet surprising pace. The movie is about two and half hours long, but you won't find yourself drifting off, no, you'll find yourself entranced, unable to pull away from either Nick or Amy or Go or Tanner Bolt, Nick high profile lawyer, for that matter. All of the characters are played thoughtfully, with the exception of Desi Collins, play by Neil Patrick Harris, who seemed out of place amongst the seriousness of the film, or maybe it is just too harsh a contrast from seeing him as Barney in How I Met Your Mother. Still, this is easily one of the best films of the year, packed with surprises that shake off your expectations in the most exhilarating way. Well written, directed, filmed, and acted, an all-around pleaser that will leave you with an eerie stillness that follows you, like Nick standing at the curb of his suburban home, out to the car as you try to digest what exactly it is you have just witnessed."

","After seeing this movie I became speechless. The only word that came to my mind was ""WOW"" but I don't think even that justifies how amazing this movie was. Gone Girl is hands down one of the best thrillers I've ever come across.<br/><br/>David Fincher, known for his previous films like Fight Club, Seven and The Social Network, has masterfully directed this movie. He brings out tension throughout this film like no other filmmaker. The cinematography is top-notch and the screenplay by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the book, is extremely engrossing. Flynn adds a ton of development to the characters accompanied with many twists and turns which allowed the film to be riveting as well as unpredictable. On a technical level, Gone Girl is perfect.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. Ben Affleck is terrific as the husband. He portrays a great amount of emotion whilst being under media scrutiny in the film. An actor who I was skeptical about, who is in the film, is Tyler Perry due to his filmography consisting of the poorly received Madea films but to my surprise he shouldered his role well. However, the best part of the film is Rosamund Pike who gives the best perfomance of her entire career. Not only is her character so interesting but her portrayal of that character is Oscarworthy. Her dialogue delivery and body language is perfect. I can't envision any other actress playing this role after seeing Pike's performance.<br/><br/>Gone Girl also has a lot of social commentary on the media and the way we perceive them. It's incredible how one headline can change a person's view on someone or how one small detail can be manipulated to make someone look bad. This message, alongside the main story, were done in such a realistic manner that we, as an audience, can relate to and believe what the characters are going through.<br/><br/>All in all, Gone Girl is outstanding. The nail-biting script, Fincher's harrowing direction and the amazing performances by everyone make this film really intense, dark and disturbing. If you're a fan of thrillers or enjoy films as a whole, definitely seek this film out."

","Gone Girl is supposed to be a mystery/thriller but does not fit into the genre. If fails at the first premise of a thriller - the plot's not serious and it insults the viewers' intelligence. *Spoilers* Police officers who investigate the disappearance of the leading female character (Amy) don't strictly follow the usual criminal procedure. For example, there were forensic experts at the ""crime scene"", that is, in the house of the Dunnes, but they didn't immediately search surrounding sheds or the garage. The prime suspect (Amy's husband) was allowed to enter and exit the house whenever he wanted,even after the police had found out the kitchen floor, which everyone was walking across the previous day, was covered in blood. The middle part of the film gives the viewers a very interesting plot twist. The focus changes from a ""guilty"" husband to an intelligent, revenge-seeking and deranged wife.As Amy put it ""I'm so much happier now that I'm dead"". Amy had a plan to frame her husband and her wit and ideas are quite entertaining. In my opinion this should be enough to bring this film to an end. Unfortunately, the story becomes silly and subplots completely redundant at this point. Why the scene when Amy smashed her cheek bone with a hammer? Why did she naively drop the money bag behind the motel?, Why was the character of the stalking Mr Collings even introduced - to bring more crazy and psychotic creatures to the film?, Why was Amy covered in blood during the talk to the police?, Why did Amy's husband stay with her? I think it would have been better if the film hadn't got lost in the surreality. The average viewer can't help him/herself from counting plot holes."

Just ridiculous.<br/><br/>I am astounded other people are OK with the ending. That's the biggest surprise in all of this. Anyone who knows anything about legal issues or psychology will realise how stupid the ending is. I can only think that some people are ignorant to think it's a good ending! Sorry, but that's my opinion. Just awful. Watch it, and then make up a better ending with your friends (maybe that's worth doing for fun!?)."
"Tweekums","10","1","3","14 November 2016"," A gripping mystery with plenty of twists
","Before watching this I knew that there was a fairly major twist but had thankfully managed to avoid details and as it is so major I shall endeavour not to spoil it here even though that means not saying much about the second half of the film.<br/><br/>On the day of Nick Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary he is talking to his twin sister about his wife Amy and not in a good way. When he gets home there is no sign of Amy and there are signs of a struggle in the house. He calls the police and they search the house; among the things they find is an envelope labelled 'Clue One'. Nick explains that she created a treasure hunt for him on their anniversary; the first clue leads to a second then a third then Nick tells the police that he can't solve the third; he clearly has something to hide. It isn't long before the police suspect he may have murdered Amy and the more we learn about him both through seeing his actions and a series of flashbacks based on Amy's yet to be discovered diary it looks increasingly possible that he did kill her. Then half way through the film there is a twist and most assumptions are turned on their head. From then on we learn more and more about what really happened and things look worse for Nick as both the police and the wider public become more convinced of his guilt.<br/><br/>I'm glad that I managed to avoid spoilers as the story kept me gripped to the very end as I wondered how much of what had been revealed to the viewer would become known the police within the film. There is a dark tone throughout the film so I wasn't convinced that it would all work out in the end as one usually is in mysteries. Director David Fincher does a fine job as he keeps us guessing as to what really happened. The cast did a great job; Ben Affleck impresses as Nick; a man who at first appears innocent but clearly has secrets and Rosamund Pike excels as Amy. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too. Most of the time the sense of threat is fairly existential; whether evidence will lead to Nick being charged with murder there are some moments where the threat is very immediate and in one occasion things get shockingly violent and very bloody. There are also scenes of a sexual nature and considerable amounts of swearing that some viewers will be put off by. Overall I recommend this to anybody looking for a gripping story with some surprising twists."

","The highlighting of the media and public abusing the rule innocent till proved guilty is the only redeeming factor in this production. It would make a poor afternoon made for TV movie. This is not to denigrate all those who strive to achieve entertainment in that genre. In fact I have seen a few afternoon ""real life dramas"" that leave this overlong piece of overlongness in the bin The acting was formulaic. they must all be congratulated on keeping a straight face and carrying on with such a convoluted, preposterous plot. I felt most sorry for the female detective who starts out strongly and obviously in awareness of her legal obligations and then ends up dealing with an army of stupid plot twists that nobody in their right mind could give a care about. Which reminds me! What was the point of Ben Affleck returning his dad to a care home? Don't waste my time again!"

","The idea is great and well developed. At first glance, it seems predictable, but in fact, it is not. It has unexpected... not exactly twists or turnovers, let's say unexpected situation development. Unfortunately, in a manner of many movies these days, a fantastic 90 minutes story was stretched and raped to 150 minutes and the final blow to the quality of this movie inflicts Ben Affleck who is lousy by default. I never saw a movie where Affleck gives a stunning performance and even my favorite ""Chasing Amy"" is partially ruined by his sleaziness. All in all, replace Affleck and cut it under 2 hours and you'll get strong 9/10. But this way... 7, maybe<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","The movie and real life:The movie is about marriage. It takes the problems that most marriages face such as 'trying to change each other, resent each other and only cause more pain' and applies them to a couple that is extraordinary trying to pass them as acceptable and present even then, trying to pass them as 'normal'.<br/><br/>Amy Dunne is exceptional. Extremely smart as smart as to get Harvard and Yale degrees and make up crime scenes and achieve to pass them as believable. She is a perfectionist. She looked for a perfect husband and when she realised that perfect does not exist (at least in her partner) she tried to change him. This was too much for Nick Dunne and it drove him away. He cheated, broke Amy's heart and triggered her craziness. She was in love. And one might say when you are in love you are bound to do crazy things, jealousy makes you irrational.Amy however went too far. She planned Nicks penalty death and killed Desi Collings. Even for a crazy person in love there must be a line and not everything (as killings) is justified with 'I did it for love'. <br/><br/>While Nick Dunne might appear as the rational victim he is not all well either. His desire to be with Amy even after he know everything she had done and even killed does not speak well for him. It makes you believe that maybe what Amy said is true. That maybe he liked himself best when he tried to become the perfect person that a perfectionist as Amy would like. Is that love? Absolutely not. That's a self-love triggered from outside. Dependence on someone else liking you so that you can love yourself. A weak character. But love? No. <br/><br/>Was Amy in love? Not really. She was in love with perfectionism. As soon as she had hope that Nick was not a lost case and that she still can turn him into the perfect husband she wanted (when she saw him on TV) she went back. She went back to work on her perfect life. To work on making her husband fit into that. So actually, unconditional, real love is no where to be seen. Begs the question, is that real life? Is unconditional and real love non existent? Is that real marriage but in a slightly less crazy notch? I don't know. <br/><br/>The scenario of the couple's life in Amy's diary has no resemblance with real life. Why would someone that has a wife that is actually as cool as Amy (not nagging, understandable, we are the most important thing everything else is background noise) not be happy with her and cheat on her. It's irrational. So if the couple from diary was real they would actually be happy and the husband would not cheat (usually the husband cheats when he feels emotionally not good in a relationship). But that couple was't real and I happy that I could tell that something is wrong with Amy's story and we haven't heard Nick's side yet. <br/><br/>So overall real life message would probably be: don't be someone you are not and don't try to change people (cliche right?). But as it can be seen from this movie as well it only leads to unhappiness and sooner our latter you are exposed. <br/><br/>As for the production: acting is good (Rosamund Pike much better than Ben Affleck tho). The movie is long but interesting so it makes the time go fast. A very good development of characters can be seen. The character are very real life like. <br/><br/>So overall I would recommend this movie to anyone who has 2 and half hours. It is interesting and makes you think about marriage."
"simon-orourke-876-303604","6","1","3","3 April 2016"," Macbeth in another form
","I had been watching Orson Welles' film of Macbeth and I couldn't help but notice that there were some psychological similarities between that film and Gone Girl.<br/><br/>In Macbeth, Macbeth was motivated by his wife, Lady Macbeth, to improve his position in life, and he liked her for it. In Gone Girl the husband Nick Dunne, for all of his wife's psychotic faults, also gradually realizes that his life has benefits because he is with her, because of who they are together. Though they do not at first realize this. She, Amy Dunne, gives the very interesting ""cool girl"" speech about halfway through the film of how she had failed in trying to live up to what she thought was her husbands image of the perfect partner, which her husband Nick later echoes about himself in his one successful media interview. In their marriage, each had been trying to be that ""cool girl"" to the other. For many people, trying to live up to the right kind of ideal may in fact help them to become better people. But not so the Macbeths, nor the Dunnes. People die, former victims suffer injustices, all the while he and his wife gradually ascend to become the king and queen of the media.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes the Shakespearean plays so satisfying is the sense of justice resolved. That doesn't really happen in this film which is why I have only given it six stars out of ten. The film feels incomplete, and it would have been interesting to see their arrest, or at least a gradual unraveling under the wight of conscience--again harking back to the first couple Macbeth.<br/><br/>The psychological aspects of the story were good, the actors were great I have to say. However, as other reviewers have noted there are many inconsistencies in the police investigation. For example, apart from those previously mentioned, why wasn't the diary and ink tested for its actual age, and the security footage at the lake house of her supposed kidnapper would surely have had a number of discrepancies, particularly her relaxed arrival. For a film that relies on that sense of realistic grittiness, there are far too many unfortunate oversights."
"snhunter-hunter","7","1","3","3 January 2016"," An excellent film ruined by its ending
","...No spoilers...<br/><br/>I had heard good things about Gone Girl and was pleased to finally watch it. The film starts well and only gets better as the storyline progresses. There are twist and turns which constantly shift your opinions of and emotions toward the characters. I felt well and truly gripped - there was plenty of suspense, as well as moments which make you switch between being frustrated and calm.<br/><br/>As the film approached the end I was thinking of awarding it a 9/10. It was very good. Unfortunately the ending completely ruined it for me. There were several ways in which it could have ended. I personally was hoping it would finish in the way I am sure almost everybody who watches it would want it to go. Even a more open ending would have also been acceptable, however instead it went in an incredibly annoying closed way. Such an annoying way in fact that I now never want to see the film again because I know I will spend the whole film remembering how let down I felt at the end. It was not just that it ended not in the way I hoped, it was also that the ending they chose had several flaws in it.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film which could have been great (and for that reason I won't be too harsh on the rating front), however it was completely and utterly spoiled by the last few minutes. It is well worth a watch, as long as you turn it off ten minutes before the end."

","There are too many reviews about this film, which proves that good or not, you have to go and watch it because of all the talking about it. Well, it is a good film, the story is interesting and it almost reaches the borders of a horror movie, but not quiet. I have to admit that Bed Affleck is not my favourite actor and up until this movie, I didn't really think that he can act seriously, but he pulls it off. However Pike is the one who steals all the spotlights. She is great as Amy and how she transforms from the quite wife to the psychopath that was actually hiding behind her perfect image. The movie chose to show us Amy's side as well, which was a smart choice, given the fact that her husband's story was growing thin without her. So 6 out of 10."
"toddg-473-289818","6","1","3","2 November 2015"," Decent story, lame ending
","Gone Girl is a tale told from the dual perspectives of a husband and wife, whose declining marriage leads to the disappearance of the wife. The story is dark and cruel, with both of the main characters being both flawed and not particularly likable. The audience starts out not liking Ben Affleck's character (Nick) because they don't know what happened to Rosamund Pike's character (Amy). But as we learn more about Amy, we begin to root for Nick, who is the lesser of the two evils. Two strong supportive roles come from Neil Patrick Harris as a rich but hapless beta admirer of Amy's that she can easily manipulate, and Carrie Coon as Nick's sister Margo, who serves as Nick's wavering moral compass.<br/><br/>The one problem with this movie is its weak ending. After Nick finally regains his freedom after being charged with Amy's murder, he lives uneasily with her in their large home, sleeping in separate bedrooms. But upon learning of her pregnancy, he chooses to stay with her, and the movie ends with Nick and Amy staying together. Why would he do that? After everything she did to ruin his life and attempt to send him to prison, he suddenly gets a conscience? One possible explanation is that this ending was meant to leave the audience with the same uneasy feeling that the rest of the movie infused. If that was the script's intent, it failed on plausibility reasons. Other than that, Gone Girl is an otherwise successfully creepy movie whose storyline is well paced and breezes through its two and a half hour length."

Initially, I thought most of the latter; the film felt slow and I was waiting for it really would prove to be a thriller and not a love drama. And then it turned and the tension started to built up. The story gave room for more and more uncertainty - what is it that actually happens!? When you thought that now everything will be tied together, and the guilty one will be caught, then everything turns and continues in a completely unexpected way - right up until the last minutes of the film.

"billylarrick","4","1","3","15 September 2015"," A terrible ending to a film that otherwise had potential
","I went into this film with an enormous amount of respect for David Fincher for his directing in both Fight Club and Se7en (Panic Room and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo were also well done but nothing special). Gone Girl was quite a disappointment. There was very little to this movie other than Pike's performance that stood out as anything above mediocre. Fincher was certainly not at his best and neither was Affleck. <br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>Ben Affleck: At times Affleck seemed very believable as the frustrated victim of a crazy and manipulated wife. The scenes in which he comes off as untrustworthy and indifferent towards his wife, such as the speech he gives to his neighbors at the awareness event, are well done and more dynamic than what we are used to seeing from Affleck. There are other moments, however, where he comes off as painfully forced and regresses to the point where we are reminded that it's Ben Affleck we are watching, rather than Nick Dunne. The scenes at the end of the film after Pike has returned and we are supposed to feel for Nick's uncomfortable and downright scary situation, are not compelling at all. Part of this was a failure of the story to provide a practical ending, but Affleck's uninspiring performance should shoulder some of the blame.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike's performance in this film was, mostly, phenomenal. She played the loving wife, the scared victim and the crazy psychopath all so convincingly that it was difficult at times to tell which role was real. The only downside to her performance was that for the first half she was in very little of the film and was limited to reading from the diary. This restriction on her character was a necessity for the author Gillian Flynn (personally I think it would have been better to have just told us from the beginning that she kidnapped herself and to show her more since there was only about 30 minutes in which there existed any real doubt for the audience as to Nick's innocence) but I still would have liked to have seen more of Pike. Keeping the disappointment I felt for the story's end aside, I thought Pike's performance was a roller coaster that sloped upward and built with the film's heightening plot until it abruptly careened down a hill as the film's plot reached its conclusion. As Pike's juggling act of playing the victim and the wife gave way to one insane psychopath it reduced the significance of her range and confined her to the limitations of the story's hopelessly implausible ending.<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>After Nick's wife Amy goes missing, his relationship with the police is created and immediately strained to indicate they are suspicious he might be involved, a suspicion that is easily transferred to the audience. In fact from the police, Pike's diary, the news' portrayal of Affleck, and Affleck's own actions, this audience is strongly made to believe that he is guilty, which quickly turns this film into a ""who done it."" That is, until writer Gillian Flynn breaks away from this murder mystery cliché and convinces the audience of his innocence (performing the same 180 in character perception that defense attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) says he and Affleck must pull off to convince the public of his innocence.)<br/><br/>While normally I would applaud a writer and director for taking a risk and going against a cliché for the sake of innovation, I can't help feeling that this film might have been better had it stuck to the format of a conventional murder mystery. Once the plot evolved from a ""who done it"" to a clear establishment of Affleck's innocence, much of the tension that had been building in the audience's mind fizzled out. It seems that Flynn intended to replace the audience's suspense over whether or not he was guilty with concern for whether or not she would get away with her frame-up. This transition was poorly executed because it required the audience to suddenly build up feelings of sympathy for a character (Affleck) they had just spent half the movie learning to distrust. The failure to connect with or care about what happens to Affleck's character proved to be a major hindrance to the film's story. <br/><br/>The greatest criticism I have of this film was its ending. After watching Affleck accused of murder by his neighbor, denounced by his in-laws, interrogated by the police, and almost imprisoned all on the account of a woman he now realizes has a history of falsely accusing another man of raping her, the audience is somehow expected to believe that he not only doesn't turn her in but decides to stay with her?? This resolution is so ridiculously improbable and unsatisfying that it actually undermines what good this film had to offer. What had at least been an interesting story, despite some weaknesses, loses all credibility with this preposterous conclusion. Not having read the book on which this film is based, I am forced to assume that this ending is the product of Flynn as it in no way resembles the brilliance of Fight Club or Se7en.<br/><br/>This film teeters on the edge of being good and had a lot of potential to be a solid film, but a terrible ending and limited storyline prevent it from realizing its potential. The directing was also rather ordinary which is a disappointment for a Fincher film and Affleck seemed to digress back to his former uninspiring acting performances. Rosmund Pike is the clear star of this film but even her performance is not enough to save it.<br/><br/>Check out more of my reviews at http://windreelandprintmoviereviews.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>Or just search Wind Reel And Print Movie Reviews"

Every character did amazing in their roles and I was pleasantly surprised. Mystery films are among my favorite genres and this is one of my favorite films. It grabbed my attention from the start and I was interested in seeing what happens next and very interested in how it was going to end. There is a great twist in this movie unlike any I have ever seen.

","Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home one morning to find that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) has gone missing, amid signs of a struggle. Scenes of the case, and Nick, being investigated, are interspersed with Amy's diary entries, which cover the early, happier days of their relationship, and the darker ones after the recession hit and things took a turn for the worse. While the movie sets itself up for a modicum of ambiguity, it's actually relatively straightforward once it starts playing its hand. Gone Girl was a novel of two voices; here it's a piece of one set of actions and one of narrations, a different representation of each half of the relationship. If Nick and Amy are dysfunctional at best, Fincher and Flynn are the actual dynamic duo that make Gone Girl work, having made careful decisions as to what to reveal at any given time."
"kevinlienhagen","8","1","3","2 August 2015"," Great Movie (Do NOT listen to these 1/10 reviews)
","Contains Spoilers This movie was amazing. That is not what this feedback is about, this is about all the angry haters which give this a low score for unpropability. So yes, movies have plot holes, and a movie with this much attention to detail is bound to have some mistakes. But these people giving hate reviews are so narrow minded (or stupid) that they DO NOT see what really happened. Here are some examples. 1. The diary. Desi did NOT burn the diary, and this is so obvious i do not see how people thought this happened. The police also know Desi did not burn it. The husband did this to protect himself, and this is what he did there when the alarm went off. You also say ""but why didn't he properly burn it"". The wife changed the password so it would look like the alarm went off and stop him from burning it properly, thus causing the police to find it later on. This is even shown in the movie! 2. The cameras. I get that if you analyze the situation she might have done unexplainable things infront of the camera, but common, she is smart in this movie. She have probably stayed cleared of them and made the footage show another story. Also being his prisoner does not mean she is crying 24/7 and he is hurting her 24/7. 3. The injuries. She was raped, and had wounds consistent with that. She had rope marks etc. She didn't claim to be injured in other ways. The blood was from HIM, and they knew that. I am guessing she asked to have the blood on her for the media to feel sorry for her, and to help her story. 4. The kidnapping itself. I get that this is a hard one, and yes, this one is flawed. But here is what happened - Desi forced himself into the house. He flipped the table, and went on a rampage. He then took the club and hit her. Yes, he did not use a knife. She obviously got knocked out and bleed om the spot. This is why there is not blood all over the place. I get that its a lot of blood for a hit in the face, and they could have kept it down, but this is somewhat plausible. Lets say she bleed out of her nose, this explains why there is not blood from her to his car. Easy to control. 5. There are so many small things you could find wrong, but that matter little and probably have an explonatiom, the movie just does not show us this because its already 2,5 hours long! All the ""major"" plot holes these people have found are wrong. They just cant pick up all the small details, and see that a movie cant show us every single explonation without becoming a TV series! Great movie, would recommend, but it requires a brain if you are out to find mistakes that aren't there"

","Gone Girl keeps you guessing for a while about one thing - did he do it - and then keeps you guessing for a while about another thing. It's hard to talk about the plot without giving away spoilers.<br/><br/>The story describes the complex relationship of two writers who meet, get together, then move from a big city to a less big place. You are left guessing what each one is thinking and doing, and why. Affleck does a good job as Nick Dunne, the good looking down-on-his-luck guy. He loves his wife, or does he? His wife loves him, or does she? Then she is Gone, one day, like that, and you ask - what happened.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike is terrific as the wife, Amy Dunne, a talented author with a complex mind, and complex past with her parents. Her acting is spectacular throughout. I remember her from the Bond film - Miranda Frost - and here she delivers too.<br/><br/>Affleck's movie sister - Margo - who plays his twin, is equally fantastic and emotional throughout. <br/><br/>It's the acting that makes this a very good movie. The story itself is a bit simple once you see what is happening. Then it moves to a cat and mouse game, and the finish where you sit there and think, humh, OK, that's one way to end this. My only con is there are sexual scenes that I think were pushed a bit too much into the graphics - a bit more subtlety might have improved this movie.<br/><br/>See this movie if you like thrillers that keep you guessing till the end.

","Very well done movie, and totally on point with the whole ""psychopath"" thing! I really appreciate screen-writers that do their research and talk about sociopaths and psychopaths appropriately. When it's done correctly, it turns out really well! So many aspects of the movie reflect the post-modern condition and the manipulative/narcissistic aspects of the self. It also critiques the post-modern individual's obsession with the obscene in the way that the obscene is played out throughout the movie. Generally speaking, it is a critique of average life and that becomes VERY apparent at the end. It's a dark satire and I loved it for that! Not many movies are well-engineered for the sociological mind. Usually it's more obvious, but there was a lot of unpacking in this brilliant film!"

I just thought that the film was presented to be a story to believe in and I really think that what the wife does is really something impossible to pull through and accomplish without being exposed or discovered. This is why I was a little bit disappointed with the film, I ended up a little bit upset that Ben Affleck (I mean his character) does not come up with any way to free himself from her lie and expose her. It was not a bad film, I just had more expectations and pretended something a little bit more real since the tension and the initial story were very well presented, but I think there were enough loose ends to give another twist to the story at the end that the one given presented as if there was no way out when, in my opinion, the scenes and the story clearly reveal some tracks to ruin her plan."

You could of course watch any other popular thriller that is 50 minutes shorter but otherwise similar and you would lose nothing. Except for the end that is. If you want everything to be OK when it's over, this is not a film for you.<br/><br/>The script bends you to and through, making you believe first one thing and then something else. Ben Affleck's performing is effectively promoting that drive but he's such a bore when doing that. And when we as viewers gets to know the truth long before the end, every suspense is lost. After that it's just a ""soft action thriller"" for the most.<br/><br/>All in all I couldn't feel for any of the characters at any time."

Reach number 1 in directing a crime and mystery also 10 of the best director in the current time. <br/><br/>Gone Girl starts with more likely high pace with Fincher's dark screenplay style. Fincher try something new with a young and fresh style of script. This movie is good, i mean decent as average. I mean with Fincher direction, this movie still can reach it's maximum potential but it's not. The plot was amazing and unique but too much plot holes in it. Maybe it's because the movie duration was only about 2 hours. In my opinion, increasing duration will add more time to add scenes to close all plot holes there and there. The other thing was the acting. Fincher had create a dark-interesting main character in ""the girls with the dragon tattoo"" but he failed to tense the character development in gone girl. He focus too much in the plot story but forget the character depth. Hence Ben Afflect and Rosamund Pike did not become a powerful stars in the movie.<br/><br/>An entertaining movie in late 2014 with excellent plot.

","There was a bit of hype about this movie. So after watching big hero 6, i decided to give it the old afflick a try. Everything in the beginning was the typical disappearance mystery. Then i thought what if the girl was gone but not forever, like the media was saying. Then boom flash back..<br/><br/>This was movie was about the justice system for men and for women. It was also about the media for men and for women. Abuse from the husband and abuse from the wife.<br/><br/>I just wanted to see how the movie was going to tie up the ending. In 99 percent of Hollywood films the murderer always dies. This time the socialsiopath not only wrecked a man's life, murdered another man, mind you a nimcompoop. She stays in martial bless.<br/><br/>Its like the sequel to thelma and louise, they find the man of their dreams and live happily everafter.<br/><br/>The movie was okay though the killer got away with murder, on screen and my 125 minutes. Why do people write to complain about holes in plots. The movie is base on FICTION. The book is found in the library under FICTION. I am most certain they all still go to the library. And the movie is a FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF EVENTS.<br/><br/>If you want non fiction watch documentories, or your home videos or E!TV. But if you like fiction read a book on atheism.<br/><br/>i"

"3xHCCH","10","3","18","9 October 2014"," Rosamund Pike's Breakthrough: She Was Fearless and Fearsome
","Five years ago, laidback Missourian Nick Dunne married gorgeous and smart New Yorker Amy. On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick comes home to find their living room a big mess and his wife missing. Media hype hounds and persecutes him as police detectives turn up evidence that indicating that Nick killed Amy. Nick denies these allegations, but there seems to be no more way out for him.<br/><br/>I was not a fan of Ben Affleck as an actor. I thought his best role was that of the ham actor in ""Shakespeare in Love"" because he was basically playing himself. In this film though, Ben Affleck actually does a great job essaying this role of Nick. His character needed to teeter between guilt and innocence, and Affleck effectively handled this tricky balance. We should not know how we should feel for him in the first act. But by the last act, the audience, especially the men, would feel his helplessness.<br/><br/>I was also not a fan of Rosamund Pike. I thought she was just a pretty face but rather dull, icy and without passion when she acts. All that totally changed with her riveting performance as Amy. It is difficult to describe her performance without dropping a spoiler, so I have to stop right there. Suffice it to say, this performance is her breakthrough as a serious actress. It was fearless, and fearsome.<br/><br/>David Fincher is an amazing director. I have been a fan since ""Se7en"". He had an amazing filmography since directing iconic videos of Madonna (""Express Yourself"") and Paula Abdul (""Straight Up"") back in the 1980s, including films like ""Fight Club"", ""Zodiac"",""The Social Network"", ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and now this one. This guy just keep on improving in his aesthetics. I have not yet read the book by Gillian Flynn , who also wrote the screenplay, but the storytelling skills of Fincher were flawless in this film. It kept on surprising the audience up to the very end. His fluid style makes us look beyond certain plot details which may seem questionable or even absurd. He raises serious issues about the intricacies of a married relationship and sensationalization of crime by the media.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is the first film of the year that is seriously in contention for the major Oscar awards of this year. In fact, nominations for the top 5 awards: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay (Adapted) are all sure things as early as now, with the statuettes themselves a reasonable reality. 10/10."
"mistarkus","8","2","10","26 October 2014"," New Film Genre
","Similar to this filmmakers other films such as Fight Club and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo the dark anti-societal theme and sort of pseudo-realistic film noir genre are present in this movie. The anti-society theme in Gone Girl is the dark, eerie commentary on marriage.<br/><br/>This along with the director's other films seem to create a new film genre. This new genre contains elements of film-noir/thriller/horror/comedy/fantasy yet it can not really be described as any of those. Gone Girl has a superb exciting flow and it was unpredictable if you did not read the book and don't know the story.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is about a missing wife, the search for her and the mystery of her disappearance. There was nothing typical about this seemingly mundane sounding mystery premise. The whole film, its theme and story reflect and comment on the darkness of marriage. This commentary on marriage is satirically, darkly humorous as well. It asks the question, do we really know what our spouse thinks. <br/><br/>It was a well created film that is unpredictable if you did not read the book or know the story however the film was not without flaws. The pseudo-realism creates improbable events that are difficult to swallow. The unconvincing pseudo-realism works less in Gone Girl than other movies like Girl with Dragon Tattoo and fight club because Gone Girl was more of a mystery than the other films and less of a fantasy. The whole film was mystery so what I expected is more realism. The settings seem to be realistic but the story ends up in this realm that is so far from reality that it is almost a fantasy. I did not believe the practically supersonic abilities to manipulate the circumstances that the wife had.<br/><br/>Another flaw was that there was no connection to the wife and her monstrously diabolical persona. This was a problem since we were granted a window into her past through flashbacks yet no understanding of how she became a truly menacing character.<br/><br/>Overall a unique interesting film that was really well created. It thematically commented on the possibility of the truly dark, eerie side of marriage. It holds interest with the unpredictable story and curiosity created from the odd characters."
"StaticEngine","8","2","10","24 October 2014"," A Twisty, Turny Meditation on Expectations
","David Fincher gives us another beautiful, stylized look at some of the darkest sides of humanity. Plenty of other reviewers have covered the plot, the twists, and the characterization (with excellent acting by Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, and Carrie Coon), so I wanted to focus on the feel and the theme.<br/><br/>Fincher brings his cinematic eye to present scenes that are downright dreamy and otherworldly, with a soundtrack by Trent Rezor and Atticus Ross that subtly reinforces the message that something is not-quite-right with what we are seeing. Then, he quickly snaps back to a dreary reality, with a man out of his element, dealing with pressures and situations he cannot comprehend. Even the opening title sequence, with cuts far too quick, are unsettling, setting the viewers up to expect plot twists to be thrown at us fast and unexpectedly. Visually and from a sonic perspective, the movie is glorious to behold.<br/><br/>The plot, of course, is a clever twist on the husband-kills-wife story that we've seen plenty of, but upon close scrutiny, it doesn't hold to examination. No one saw a big-screen TV being loaded into a shed? The FBI didn't deeply investigate all the inconsistencies? There's really no way out for Affleck's dopey, played husband?<br/><br/>Upon reflection, it's not meant to be examined closely. Gillian Flynn is presenting a parable of expectations, communication, and media manipulation. Largely, we see what we want to see, and we glorify what we are told to glorify. The beautiful, pregnant wife is an untouchable icon. The perfect marriage is a young couple in NYC, with plenty of clandestine sex in public spaces, this is the ideal aspiration. Men have issues with control and fidelity, and while they can be forgiven, this should not be forgotten. These ""truths"" are not really truths at all, but they are what we buy into as a society because we want to. When facts get in the way, we willingly brush them aside to embrace the easy mythology, because the lie is more appealing than the truth, and the truth hurts if we do not wish to embrace it.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, wronged husband Nick Dunne asks how they got to this point. ""All we did was resent each other, try to control each other. We caused each other pain."" The response? ""That's what marriage is."" More like life, but then it doesn't have to be, unless we let ourselves be seduced by the myth instead of embracing the reality and communicating openly about it."
"ghost_dog86","8","2","10","20 October 2014"," Gone Girl: Men Are So Dumb
","""Gone Girl"" centers around a woman (Rosamund Pike) who goes missing (presumably murdered) and the media coverage which ensues and rapidly turns the husband (Ben Affleck) into the prime suspect. As this film moves forward, there are other characters which help accentuate the mystery aspect of this ""murder mystery""; e.g. Desi (Neil Patrick Harris) a past lover, Margo (Carrie Coon) the husband's sister and only confidant, and Tanner Bolt (confidently played by Tyler Perry) a charismatic Johnnie Cochran-type who loves to win as much as he loves the pageantry of defending high profile clients. <br/><br/>Though the storytelling is continuously strong, the first half of this film is constructed in a way that due to the actual source material (which was adapted for the big screen by Gillian Flynn, from her own novel) and a heavy slathering of director David Fincher's powerfully distinctive visual sensibility, this is a film that will intentionally fool people into thinking it to be a stylized but somewhat routine murder mystery, when in actuality, what ""Gone Girl"" turns into is more so a uniquely inventive, satirical, tale of fatal attraction.<br/><br/>This ""turn"" takes place about half way through, when a major plot twist occurs. A twist which separates this film from the routine and (aside from the morbid slather of dark comedy perfectly incorporated into a film about murder) puts ""Gone Girl"" into a genre all its own. Not to say that other aspects of ""Gone Girl"" aren't up to par. The fact is, most of the performances are engaging (if you know me, then you know I hate to admit that Tyler Perry was a part of anything worth watching) especially the work of one Rosamund Pike, who delivers a performance so visceral that it should elicit a vocal response from audiences. But all of that is overshadowed by the fascinating marital motivation concepts thrown at the audience (especially in the final scene) Fincher's direction, some excellent editing and another haunting score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. <br/><br/>Final Thought: Though ""Gone Girl"" is still receiving mostly positive critical reviews, I believe this to be a film that due to its unconventional comedic tone and twist, Fincher's adaptation of this odd little novel may not be truly appreciated as a masterwork until years down the line. Hell, with a 4 out of 5 Star review, I know that I don't truly appreciate the structural and satirical brilliance of a movie like ""Gone Girl"" as much as I should or eventually will."
"bf16796","9","2","10","20 October 2014"," A movie that doesn't treat you like an idiot.
","At the end of Gone Girl, the audience in the theater I was in had a solid 3 second pause of no one moving, of people just collecting their thoughts before they could start to get up and leave. That is how engrossing the film is, you get completely sucked into the alternate reality for a short while. <br/><br/>The most obvious thing about the film is the Soundtrack. Done by Trent Razor, the building drones create a tension you are not even conscious of feeling until the drone cuts to silence and you get a break from the intensity. In addition, the soundtrack contains many elements of noise that just add creepy insanity into the mix.<br/><br/>The film did have elements that it chose not to focus on. The cinematography and colors in the film are bland, but there is a nice distinction in style between Affleck's story, and that of his wife's.<br/><br/>The movie did a great job of giving you something more than you expected. Had the film just been about a murder mystery, it would have been OK. But since the movie contained so much more, it takes the suspense genre into new territory. <br/><br/>In addition, there seemed to be many red-herrings, or times when the film was pushing you to think one way, only to get jerked another direction 5 minutes later. <br/><br/>I did find the Wife to be an unbelievable villain. To me, she was so over the top that it took the film out of a believable world, and made it obvious you were watching a film."

","I just want to confess that I did not see the movie. That being said you must be asking what right do I have to write a review. Well, I watched the trailer and figured out where the movie was headed before it was half way done. It seemed all too obvious that the escalating suspicion had to have a twist and it did. Predictable at that. The acting looked fine as well as the craft of film making but the plot.... not so much. Typical and average so I gave it a 5. I'm just glad I read a review with a spoiler so I didn't have to actually watch the movie just to see if the ending was exactly what I figured it would be from watching half of the trailer. If you can't guess the ending from the trailer then I would say go ahead and see the movie as it does look pretty good - if you can ignore the obvious far fetched twist that made an otherwise believable movie a cliché"

","I was fully engrossed in the film right up until about 30 minutes before the end but felt cheated by the end. I hadn't read the book, but when I came home and researched a bit more, I discovered that the writer liked the ending of Rosemary's Baby so that's why she chose her ending. <br/><br/>So here's the thing: I too liked Rosemary's Baby. I found the end credible because it was a mothers love for a child, and she pretended to herself that as the child was 50% her perhaps the baby would be OK. The Gone Girl ending just didn't work. <br/><br/>I can think of how I could have found it more credible. Say Nick had mumps recently and was now sterile, Amy used his frozen sperm to impregnate herself, so it was the only chance he would ever have to get a son. And the film should have shown him talking to his sister, describing how he desperately wanted a child but Amy didn't. <br/><br/>We shouldn't have seen Amy's version where she said she wanted a child but Nick replied that having a baby wouldn't fix the marriage. Yes it was from her diary but the visual impact meant that was how I viewed Nick. I was left feeling why did he stay? He said a marriage can't be saved by a child. <br/><br/>There, I fixed the ending!"
"BeMi21","9","2","10","18 October 2014"," Exciting and Provoking Despite Some Logical Flaws
","Gone Girl tells the story about the disappearance of Amy Elliot Dunne (Rosamund Pike) whose husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is suspected of having killed her. Amy vanishes on her fifth wedding anniversary and everything indicates a crime: The furniture in the house is overthrown or broken and the police find traces of wiped off blood on the floor.<br/><br/>Throughout the first half of the movie, the viewer will ask him- or herself steadily if Nick Dunne has something to do with the disappearance of his wife - or if he has even killed her. In flashbacks (based on former diary entries by Amy) Amy informs the viewer about the development of her marriage with Nick. After the first flashbacks it's almost incomprehensible how anyone could think of Nick as his wife's murderer as it's obvious that both of them are in love with each other. But soon daily routine catches up with the happy couple (and their marriage) - and their marriage deteriorates, their luck fades. Nick Dunne seems the perfect suspect: He cheats on his wife, doesn't show much concern and acts suspiciously. Still, the viewer might wonder if he really is a killer or if this might be a too easy answer.<br/><br/>But Gone Girl isn't just a simple whodunit-thriller. It's primarily a movie about marriage. ""What have we done to each other"", Nick Dunne asks at the beginning of the movie. And this is actually the most interesting subject this movie offers: Seeing how a previously happy marriage plunges into ruin and who is considered the guiltier by others - husband or wife?<br/><br/>Another important issue explored by this movie is medial attraction. Nick Dunne can be considered as a victim of a medial campaign against him, but also uses the media to speak in favor of him. We see how easily media changes its opinion, how easily it can be manipulated.<br/><br/>But when the twist comes out there's another important aspect: women as victims and as culprits. When we learn about Amy's real character and actions we feel deceived. She manipulates her husband, her environment and finally whole America. All this is possible because she knows how - playing the abused victim, pretending a pregnancy and so on. No one would dare to deny anything of that and she is aware of that. We feel forced to believe Amy until she shows her real face. And even when she returns no one wants to investigate the case further, although one of the investigators asks some things that don't really fit into Amy's story.<br/><br/>David Fincher's direction is flawless, he creates (again) a masterfully dark and gloomy atmosphere, especially towards the end. Editing and cinematography are flawless and the soundtrack is thrilling.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch. Ben Affleck is very good (though not Oscar-worthy) in the role of the suspicious husband. Kim Dickens (playing of the detectives) and Carrie Coon (portraying Nick's sister) are great support while Tyler Perry is surprisingly good as Nick's skilled lawyer. Neil Patrick Harris does also a solid job in one of the creepier roles in this movie.<br/><br/>But the actual scene stealer is certainly Rosamund Pike. She's absolutely riveting and effective as either the innocent and unhappy housewife or the manipulative, psychopathic femme fatale. Her voice expresses both calm and hatred at the same time, her facial expressions are diverse and reach from fear over sadistic satisfaction to pure anger.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the caption there are - or may be - some logical flaws which, however, result from the fact that some things aren't really explained in the movie. One of those things are Amy's ""interactions"" with the camera in Desi's house. We don't know if (or how) she erased some of the tapes and even if she did it, it would be dubious why some of the tapes are gone but Amy's simulated scenes are still there. There are more things that aren't completely believable but to me they are forgivable as the movie constructs great tension and suspense, benefits from a great cast and explores several subjects at once during its running time."
"mamalv","9","2","10","18 October 2014"," Amazing Amy, for sure.
","GONE GIRL is certainly a thriller in the vein of a Hitchcock film. David Fincher is almost the reincarnation of Alfred Hitchcock in this tale of deceit and psychoanalysis. To understand Amy we must first understand her parents, and their obsession with the fantasy life that they created in books, Amazing Amy. They have created a childhood that never existed and thereby have created the psychotic adult. In the beginning of the romance we see Amy and Nick as a kind of urban couple who are in love. Their romance however drains away as life steps in. They lose their jobs, and go back to Missouri to take care of Nick's ailing mother. He was never too ambitious to begin with, he just sort of sits around living off his wife's trust fund. He is neither a good husband or good provider, and when Amy catches him cheating she sets out on a path of revenge. If you think you have the plot in the first 30 minutes of the film, think again. Nick knows Amy better than anyone else, and she does not have him fooled. There is a lot of blood and gore is in some of the scenes that may recall, Anthony Perkins shower scene in Psycho. Of course the shower scene will seem tame to the viewer of GONE GIRL, probably because of the era that Psycho was filmed. This is a good, if not great thriller with many twist and turns, and a ending that may not satisfy everyone, but is appropriate to the story of Nick and Amy."
"gunnarsfilmtips","6","2","10","16 October 2014"," A movie with great acting and great environments but it was a bit disappointing I am afraid.
","After spending a day at the beach Nick Dunne returns to his home. He has cleared his mind and is now ready to celebrate their 5th wedding anniversary with his wife, Amy Dunne. But when Nick gets home, he finds not only that Amy is gone, but also clear indications that she may have been abducted against her will ... Mmm ... It sounds exciting but ""Gone Girl"" made ​​me a little disappointed. <br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" based on the book of the same name and I'll admit right away that I did not read the book. However, it is the author of the book who wrote the script for the film, which often tend to be a good sign when a film-is-based-on-a-book. <br/><br/>The above-mentioned fact and the choice of star director David Fincher had really pushed the my expectations to the max. <br/><br/>The acting in the movie was just so good I expected in a David Fincherfilm. Ben Affleck did a superb job of constantly stay ""on the line"" so it was never clear if he was a ruthless psychopath, or whether he was a man gripped by the tragic moment. And Rosamund Pike was very good ... :) <br/><br/>When David Fincher recorded ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" in Sweden he delivered a lecture at the movie house and I managed to get a ticket. There, he talked about his way to work and that he likes to have his actors in front of the camera as much as possible. It is not unusual that he was filming a scene 80-90 times. Presumably it is this that has led to many of his films are really well played with stunning set design. <br/><br/>Here also filled the ""Gone Girl"" requirements, I sat up in my head. The movie was very nicely filmed with great sceneries and it really felt like that we always just got to see what the director wanted us to see. <br/><br/>If I were to compare this movie with other Fincherfilms (plus a few other films) so I would say that ""Gone Girl"" has some similarities with ""The Game"" and that it is reminiscent of ""Zodiac"" when it comes to telling way. Since then it reminds very much older ""cat & rat"" films such as ""Basic Instinct"". It was this which, for me was the film's major problems. <br/><br/>Instead of making an honest thrilling thriller (7even, The Game or The Zodiac) it felt like they had not really decided what kind of movie ""Girl Gone would be. And with their 2h 28min so it was quite a long and uneven seating. The various parts of the movie felt like they were working against each other and the ""fluidity"" of the film appealed to me at all. The first hour was amazing and then it went steadily downhill. <br/><br/>This felt very sad when everything else including the acting was flawless. Because of this, the overall impression was completely ruined for me and film dryers barely up to 3 G's. What do you think who watched this movie ??? Then I heard both very positive and negative things, it would be fun to hear which camp you belong to. :)"

","Heard so much about Gone Girl that I should have known it would be a let down. First my brother didn't like it, then my sister said she almost walked out of the screening. But I went anyway, and...it was okay.<br/><br/>First they tag the film with the following genres; thriller, mystery, drama. Well they could have added one more; comedy. Now while I didn't laugh, but a lot of people in the audience did and they did it quite often. Made me think that I don't think audiences laughed at Glenn Close's character in Fatal Attraction. Guess it shows that Gone Girl's filmmakers couldn't quite deliver on the seriousness of the subject and things almost become a parody of what they set out to do. Unless they were looking for laughs, that is.<br/><br/>Final note to Batman fans who were scared when Ben Affleck was cast as the Dark Knight. Be scared, be very scared. While I think he is a very good filmmaker (loved Gone Baby Gone) don't think he's much of an actor and he never personified anything in this movie. Not slickness, despair, anger, nothing. And I also heard raves about Rosamund Pike. Don't see it. Again on the ridiculous side. But maybe this will get her thought of when people are making comedies."

","So last night I went and saw the highly rated film ""Gone Girl"", I had REALLY high expectations of the film as it was hyped by many critics as being one of the films of the year, also the talk of it possibly being nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>I had NOT read the book before going into this film and watching it.<br/><br/>The acting was perfect, Ben Affleck was actually superb amongst a cast who aren't really known for making Oscar worthy films (Tyler Perry, I'm talking about you). The film started off great however after about 30 minutes I found things started to get strange (plot wise). The characters weren't natural and it seemed like an ""out of whack"" ""exaggerated world"".<br/><br/>After the plot twist is revealed mid film, the movie started to go down hill and down hill fast. If you're waiting for an amazing twist at the end, where your jaw drops and you go ""Oh ma gawddd"", hold off any hope, there is nothing coming (You get your twist mid film and its not that great).<br/><br/>I was majorly disappointed with the ending and I don't want to give much away, however lets just say I rushed home and searched up forums in hope to see if I had missed something important.<br/><br/>For those who HAVE seen the film, half way through the movie I developed this theory and was hoping that there was going to be a twist at the end where we find out the whole movie is a horribly written crime/mystery novel by Amy who has a failed career as a writer. It would have summed up all the cheesy, exaggerated and unnatural scenes that we see through out the film.. Like the woman who wants to take a selfie with Nick and the fact Nick has sex with a 20 year old so publicly in his sisters living room at night.. Did that not just seem comical to anyone? It would have also been perfect because in the film Amy was a Harvard University graduate, so to see her in reality as a failed novelist would have contrasted perfectly, of her living in this non-existent world, with a made up husband that she could get revenge on (Nick being symbolic for how unfair the world is).<br/><br/>I rate the movie 7/10 purely because the start and middle of the film carry the ending on its shoulders, keeping you entertained and guessing, even if there is no classic, twist plot ending, you still have hope."

","Overall I found the movie to be pretty entertaining and enjoyed the plot twists along the way. Overall entertainment value would probably be an 8 or 9 out of 10. <br/><br/>However, the movie has so many inconceivable discrepancies that I can't really call it a great movie. I found myself wanting to yell at the screen several times. Additionally, the actress did an okay job of playing the evil version of Amy but did a terrible job of portraying the normal Amy in the intro. You never once believed her and Nick were actually in love. <br/><br/>**Contains Spoilers**<br/><br/>Major Flaws: 1. The hicks that robbed her were smart enough to notice she had a patchy dye job, etc so she must be in hiding but even though they were watching the news about Amy's disappearance they were unable to recognize her? 2. The secret service agents never followed or checked up on NPH's character even though she had a restraining order against him? 3. Why would Nick go to his father's house to destroy her journal and then not even make sure it actually burned? Why not just destroy the 1 incriminating page. This part of the story becomes even worse when Amy returns and the police believe her story of being kidnapped. Why would NPH take her journal to Nick's dad's house to be burned? Especially when we are to believe he attempted to burn the ""murder"" weapon at Nick and Amy's house. 4. Who did she buy the car from on Craigslist/where did she store it? Seems like this person may have remembered her purchasing the car when they see her picture on TV. 5. Why doesn't Nick pursue Amy being charged with murder? Certainly the fact that she framed another man for rape in the same fashion could have come into play here. 6. Why don't the police bother viewing the footage from the lake-house? Certainly they could retrieve the footage of her frolicking around on the patio for days prior to the one scene where she throws herself against the glass pretending to be held captive. Additionally, after that scene doesn't she just pick herself up and walk away? When she ""escapes,"" why didn't she call the police from there, why would she drive all the way home covered in blood? Why doesn't she have any sign of injuries from the supposed incident of massive blood loss in her kitchen? 7. How did she retrieve Nick's sperm and get artificially inseminated as soon as she returned home? She would not have even had time to discover she was pregnant.<br/><br/>It was just completely unbelievable that Nick would choose to stay with her after this, he would be completely terrified of her and would not be able to live that way. The ending was just horrible!"

","This is likely as close to a romantic comedy that we're going to get out of David Fincher. And while I found the film enormously entertaining and watchable, I was unconvinced by the two leads. (The supporting cast is superb.) I do think it needed a screenplay writer to adapt the material, but here it is: the sensational Gillian Flynn novel with all it's dark humor.<br/><br/>Affleck tips the balance in his favor since his general appeal helps the audience forgive him (as Tyler Perry in a departure from his usual shtick promises). That leaves Rosamund Pike as the wife with the unhappy job of bearing the weight of all the misery of the relationship. In the audience I was in, boos and curses directed at Pike, primarily from the female members of the audience didn't seem to be bothered by Affleck's portrayal of more than just a cad in the relationship. And I took issue with how winningly he plays the protagonist in a story where there really isn't one.<br/><br/>All the gloss of a Fincher production is here: superb cinematography, sound and art direction. But the cleverness of the plot is bound to the page, particularly in the final third of the film where everyone simply shrugs ""nothing I can do about that"" and leaves more than just a little of the principals' behavior without consequence. But perhaps that's the biggest joke of all; it was just poorly executed and left the audience unprepared for the finale."
"Drive-in_Zeppelin","8","2","10","3 October 2014"," Dark, stylish and oh so suspenseful
","David Fincher is actually one of my favorite directors particularly for his Neo-Noir thrillers like Se7en and Zodiac, though he's probably better known for things like The Social Network and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Fincher, in a word, is an artist. He creates incredibly intricate and memorable settings for his films through his unique and highly stylistic visuals. Every scene in every film is crucial to the exposition of the story and has been painstakingly defined to be as impressionistic as possible. Fincher is known for being a relatively challenging director that often requires countless takes for a single shot as to get it perfectly aligned with the his vision for the film. But what's the result? His films are precise, beautiful, and often lend themselves to creating unmatched feelings of suspense and realistic psychological horror, and Gone Girl is no exception. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck (Argo, Good Will Hunting) and the lovely Rosamund Pike (The World's End) star in this unforgiving commentary on modern marriage and on the detriments of sensationalism. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry also provide strong supporting roles alongside the other more minor characters of the film. The story is that Nick Dunne (Affleck) arrives home one day to find that his wife Amy (Pike) is missing under suspicious circumstances. The Dunnes are both talented writers that live in the small town of New Carthage, Missouri along with Nick's twin sister (Carrie Coon) and father. As the story of Amy's disappearance begins sweeping the town and state, Nick's character comes under increasing scrutiny after some of Amy's blood is found in the kitchen of their home and he naturally is suspected of having committed foul play. Certain things are revealed that seemingly vilify Nick although his guilt is still in question since people like NPH - a revealed stalker of Amy - are introduced that cast a shadow of a doubt in the audience's mind. That's basically all I can say without giving the twists and turns of the story, but they should be fairly easy to guess with enough Law and Order under your belt. <br/><br/>The entire cast has a certain authenticity to them ranging from the overzealous neighbor that's out to crucify Affleck's character to the tenacious detective played by Kim Dickens. I was even surprised by Affleck in this movie as he doesn't seem like a caricature but rather a genuine every-man who has his situation go from bad to worse. It was actually Rosamund Pike that really blew me away in this film, not simply because she's absolutely gorgeous, but because her role as Amy illustrates the actress's diverse abilities on screen. Much like the movie Laura (1944) and how it propelled the strikingly beautiful Gene Tierney to stardom, I see Gone Girl having a similar effect on Pike's fairly relatively infant career. Until now she's played a few minor supporting roles in less than noteworthy films like Miranda Frost in Die another Day or Andromeda in Wrath of the Titans, but I have really started to take notice since her appearance in Edgar Wright's The World's End as Sam Chamberlain. My guess is you'll be seeing a lot more of the charming British actress in years to come. <br/><br/>If you want a good head-start on your Oscar watch-list, this would probably be a wise place to start. Affleck and Pike will no doubt be nominated in the best actor/actress categories respectively, and I see Gone Girl taking home a few other various awards like Best Original Score for Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose's accompanying soundtrack.It might even sneak into the Best Picture category, though I don't see it as a clear front-runner. Fincher once again delivers a beautifully crafted suspense thriller that will leave you guessing until the very end and forever questioning your spouse's inner thoughts and intentions. <br/><br/>Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website."

","I'd say it wasn't as good as I expected... and I guess that was the problem. I expected too much. I can imagine this movie would've been a surprisingly good if I didn't expect anything but the media hype ruined the experience for me.<br/><br/>I see two major flaws. Many plots are unrealistic. The movie makes it seem so easy to frame and get away with murder. Second flaw being Ben Affleck. I command his success as writer, director, and producer lately but his acting just never improves. And this was very interesting role too. Only he can make such interesting character so mundane. And in contrast, Rosamund Pike's performance was surprisingly good.<br/><br/>I certainly am not looking forward to him being the new Batmat...<br/><br/>This movie could've been so much better with different lead actor."

I was hooked and waiting for the reveal throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The characters were especially interesting because so many of them had contrasting strong points and flaws. There were characters that should have been sympathetic, but the character flaw overwhelmed the sympathy, and vice versa.<br/><br/>I suspect I would not have liked it as much if I had read the book first. I'm not sure whether the book will be as good now that I know what happens. Either way, I will probably go back and read Gillian Flynn's two earlier novels."

","When I first saw the preview for Gone Girl I was surprised to see Ben Affleck in the leading role mostly because after the success of ARGO I had thought he made the complete transition from actor to director/producer. As well as seeing Tyler Perry in such a serious role considering he himself said that he doesn't go after roles like this. Lastly was do to the fact that I was not sure who Rosemund Pike was and had not recognized her from past films. <br/><br/>But thanks to this movie I have a new respect for Ben Affleck as an actor, I will gladly see any movie with Rosemund Pike in it in the future, and I'll admit I enjoyed Tyler Perry.<br/><br/>This film had classic trademarks from director David Fincher which include...<br/><br/>1) Dark lighting in most scenes to convey the tone of the film. 2) Well constructed plot with a packed cast. 3) Gripping suspense thanks to unique camera movements and cinematography<br/><br/>The one part of the film I would like to point out was the film really seamed to fit into the modern area. Especially when it comes to the media and forced perspectives. Throughout the film some blonde news reporter was running her mouth and making exaggerated assumptions on little evidence about Nick Dunne (Affleck).<br/><br/>Insinuating he engages in incest with his twin sister, how ""sick"" it is when he smiled at the public service announcement of his missing wife. Then in the end when we find out his wife is still alive and much MUCH worse of a person than Nick (who still is kind of an ass). <br/><br/>I consider this film to be another home run for David Fincher and one of the best modern films I have seen in a while."

","David Fincher's resume shows that he is one of the finest directors in the business today. From Fight Club to The Social Network, you can't possibly go wrong. Well, believe me when I tell you that Gone Girl stands in the ranks of his best work. This is a hell of a movie. Or, if you will, a hell of a book, turned into a hell of a movie. But the ""what came first?"" argument is invalid here, when Fincher successfully replicates Gillian Flynn's brilliant thriller novel on screen, as he does here. The words fly off the page so seamlessly. It's almost seductive. The performances are grade A, coming from Ben Affleck but ESPECIALLY coming from Rosamund Pike. Pike steals the show as Amy Dunne, making her the most sinister on-screen anti-hero since Keyser Soze. Even performances from the likes of Neil Patrick Harris and .. I can't believe I'm saying this. Tyler Perry are at the top of their game. It's the most jaw dropping film of the year, and as a film-goer, you will be left satisfied. Gone Girl is the run-away hit of the Fall and the beginning of what is sure to be a great Oscar season."

","David Fincher's latest sleight of hand leaves the viewer spellbound for hours after witnessing this nerve-hitting, raw depiction of a marriage fraught with secrecy. Similarly to Se7en, Fight Club, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl leaves a lasting impression, which is the hallmark of all truly great cinematic performances. The cinematography is captivating, the storytelling is masterful, acting is flawless, and the score sometimes turns into the sort of gut-wrenching throbbing and pounding that not only underscore the scene, but rivet your eyes to the screen and set your heart racing. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are both at their best in this picture. They deliver exactly what the audience should expect of a Fincher movie's cast. Rosamund Pike pulls a relentless performance, bringing a cool, otherworldly wife into life on the screen.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only foible of the movie is Neil Patrick Harris. Although his acting is good, he is not on par with the rest of the cast, all of whom perform exceptionally well.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is very nearly a perfect experience that tackles the questions of media abuse, the gullibility of the masses who take everything at face value that comes at them from the TV, and the twisted ups and downs of an intricately irregular, yet hauntingly familiar marriage.<br/><br/>If you fancy an intellectual shudder at something beautifully complex and entertaining, you shouldn't miss Gone Girl.<br/><br/>I give the movie 9 stars out of 10. An instant classic."
"mirwais-orbit","6","2","11","20 October 2014"," Not that effective...
","The problem lies in the fact that Gillian Flynn tried to be extremely faithful to her own book, giving much attention to the facts and the story development rather than the layered personality of the main characters. Ben Affleck was never praised by his acting skills, and his natural apathy fits well to the character because in the book Nick is described as a guy unable to express his feelings and emotions. The movie doesn't make his personality clear enough as in the book, giving the feeling that Affleck is just delivering a bad performance, which he is not. Only those who did read the book will understand that no matter how low skilled Ben Affleck is as an actor, the character is exactly like that.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike does an incredible job mainly in the moments when those ones who did read the book will understand the real meanings of her looks and actions. In other words, the actress knew well the original material and exactly what she was doing, but the movie doesn't succeed or matters to explain her magnificent intelligence as described in the book. When Flynn and Fincher finally try to come to terms with it, it is too late and ineffective.<br/><br/>The film editing never achieves the same magnificence of some of Fincher's latest movies. The dialogs and the conflicts between characters aren't fluid as in the book. Fincher cuts it all the time like a soap opera discussion, making a table tennis with the cameras for meaningless and unnatural reasons. The same about the music. Although Reznor and Ross composed an amazing score that sounds naive, relaxing and at the same time creepy, for sure it is used effectively to distinguish the different times set, but it doesn't quite intensifies some dreadful moments, sometimes sounding more invasive rather than an important scene composition.<br/><br/>I did like the story development, which is the same as in the book, and the other characters are pretty interesting. Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Margo (Carrie Con) steal most of the scenes. The amazing thing for me is that the actors chosen, the scenography and locations are mostly exactly as I imagined when reading the book and that makes clear how rich is Flynn's description even being a 1st person narrative.<br/><br/>It's a fair adaptation, but far away to be one of Fincher's best movies. For me he is so desperate to make another huge thriller that he is not making movies for fun and pleasure anymore. He did not find yet a material to make him passionate to work on like he did with Se7en or Fight Club. He is obvious unfocused, shooting everywhere to eventually hit the target and accomplish his mission. All the acclaimed reception are mainly because Fincher is always overestimated. They did the same with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and people later discovered that his adaptation wasn't that good at all when compared to the Swedish version. Even being well developed Gone Girl lacks of important subtle details that make the main characters so rich and full of tricky personalities (they also forgot, for example, Nick's sarcasm and self depreciation). A book so rich in words and description that were underused in the movie. When compared to Fight Club and the impressive way Fincher reveals what was obviously clear but we could not see, we know that he could have used different and more elaborated ways to reveal important facts. That doesn't happen even in the most important turning moment of the story, a moment that in the book is shocking because it is unexpected and the movie delivers it in the most ordinary and unsurprising way.<br/><br/>Maybe all the few things that keeps the movie away from its glory is about Flynn's inexperience as a movie writer since this is her first movie writing work, but also feels like Fincher wasn't passionate for it anyway and he just delivered an ordinary hired work."
"haydenbtw","9","2","11","19 October 2014"," Fincher delivers yet again
","Gone Girl was a highly anticipated movie for me, solely because I am die-hard Fincher fan. I think that he has created some of the best crime movies of all time; namely Zodiac and Seven. So I went into Gone Girl pretty excited. I am happy to say that the movie did not disappoint. <br/><br/>The trailers led me to believe that this film would be more in the vein of Fincher's pulpier work, such as Panic Room, and I was expecting a well-made murder mystery/ thriller. Really, I got much more than I bargained for. <br/><br/>Gone Girl is a movie that is so dark on the surface, yet strangely hilarious and enjoyable, perhaps only for people with somewhat sick senses of humor. Fincher knows that this story is satirical, and he works wonders by contrasting the ridiculousness of the story with a very mute aesthetic. The aesthetic choices in this movie are not so different from later Fincher movies, with DP Jeff Cronenworth doing wonderful work as usual, and Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross delivering their most detailed score yet. The score compliments the themes of the movie very well, as there are many sweet melodies that are gradually overtaken by dark tones and grinding sounds, and there are some extraordinarily creepy tracks.<br/><br/>Performance wise, the cast is stellar. Affleck, who I have previously been fond of directing-wise but never completely based on acting, hits all the right notes, in a very challenging role. Nick Dunne must be a prick and frankly an idiot as well, and Affleck shows this without losing the support of the audience, a very tricky feat. Likewise, Rosamund Pike is good. I'll leave it at that, because saying any more would give away her wonderful character.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great, although Neil Patrick Harris was not given a lot to work with, and I feel like the storyline regarding his character, Desi Collins, was not given proper attention, and thus was the low point of the movie. <br/><br/>Many have complained about the plot holes in this movie, but they are really missing the point. Sure, Gone Girl is really plot driven, but it is essentially a satire, and by the end of the film, the plot is secondary to explorations of marriage, relationships, American media, and public representation. Also, Gone Girl is not a sexist film, despite some complaints that it paints women in a bad light. David Fincher is not a misogynist, he is misanthropic, and he paints everyone, male and female, in equally awful lighting. <br/><br/>FIncher's general distaste for people and their behavior is so evident in this movie, and in someone else's hands, this movie would be unlikable and hard to sit through. Luckily, Fincher knows exactly how to balance suspense, humor, pathos, and absurdity. Gone Girl is one of the year's best movies, but because of some uneven subplots, is not perfect, and is also not Fincher's best. However, it is equally entertaining and thought-provoking; a perfect marriage of pulp and art, about a very imperfect marriage of man and woman. Do not bring a date. You have been warned."

","Gone Girl takes a brand new concept and turns it into a movie that could easily bring home an Oscar. Imagine if your wife just randomly disappeared and was supposedly dead, yet she left enough evidence to pin the murder on you when she wasn't actually dead? That's what this film does, and also brings Tyler Perry into a more serious role as attorney Tanner Bolt, who brings suave and gravitas to his character. Neil Patrick Harris appears in something other than a comedy production and does a magnificent job. A lot of new technology can also be seen, especially in Collin's house, and it's magnificent. <br/><br/>Gone Girl is a good movie, and it's a good watch for everybody."
"rubenm","7","2","11","19 October 2014"," One twist too many
","'Gone Girl' could have been an outstanding crime thriller. And watching the first part of the film, you get the impression it is. The husband of a seemingly happily married couple comes home one day to find his wife missing. The police starts an investigation, and more and more elements point in the direction of the husband being the killer. For the media, it's also clear he killed his wife. <br/><br/>A nice start for a crime thriller, and in the capable hands of David Fincher you're soon captured by the mystery. You presume the husband hasn't done it, but what could have happened? Just when you're busy trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together, Fincher surprises by giving it all away. In a long, flash-backed monologue, the disappeared wife tells the audience what happened, why it happened and how it happened. With the mystery now completely solved, the suspense is gone and the focus shifts dramatically. The question is no longer what happened, but how the husband will prove his innocence. <br/><br/>Other films would go awry after such a dramatic shift, but Fincher is such a good director he gets away with it. The film even gets an extra dimension: no longer is it just the husband whose life we're interested in, but also the wife. Fincher nicely knots the two sides of the story together when, after some dramatic events, husband and wife are reunited, but not happily. <br/><br/>I think the movie could have ended at this point. I even think it would have been a better movie than it is now. The story would have a surprising end, and the film would have a clearer focus. Instead, Fincher continues and pushes the movie off the rails. Some highly improbable things happen, the police stop investigating, and the story shifts a second time, this time to morph into a psychological drama about a failed marriage. The thriller aspect is completely gone, and there is hardly any added value beyond emphasizing elements of characters we already know. <br/><br/>I think Fincher has been too ambitious. Instead of making a very fine crime thriller, he wanted to add elements of a psychological drama. It makes the film too long and less powerful. <br/><br/>One last word about the acting: the lead characters are adequate, but I very much liked two supporting actors: Kim Dickens as the down-to-earth police detective, who lets her own common sense prevail over the prejudiced opinions of her assistant, and Tyler Perry as the smooth talking lawyer of the husband."
"david-meldrum","9","2","11","15 October 2014"," A dark, delciously enjoyable parable of modern relationships
","Why are you reading this?<br/><br/>Do you trust my opinion, or is it simply passing the time?<br/><br/>Do you want to find out what's going on in my head, or is it a way of helping you form your own opinion? <br/><br/>That's a glimpse inside the world of Gone Girl. It's a parable of contemporary relationships that consistently destabilises the narrative direction; that portrays intimate relationships as minefields of (dis)trust and self-justification; in which there's scarcely a single sympathetic character but still has the gall to ask you where your sympathies lie ... and why. <br/><br/>Directed by David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac) and adapted from her own novel by Gillian Flynn it's best understood as a neo-Gothic melodrama/thriller. Yes, really. The film opens on the morning of Nick and Amy's 5th wedding anniversary; Amy goes missing in suspicious, possibly violent circumstances. The finger of public and police suspicion starts to turn on Nick, and we see the truth unfold in parallel with the flashback story of Nick and Amy's relationship from the day they first met. <br/><br/>It's hard to say much more than that without spoilers. So though I've tried to avoid any, proceed in the rest of this post with caution; I hadn't read the book, and managed to avoid spoilers. From the point of view of pure plot, it is a deliciously dark thriller, constantly taking the truth and twisting it just out of the viewer's reach. In the final sections the film turns into strange territory, but that it does so without ever feeling false is a measure of just how good this film is. David Fincher is on top form here, meticulously constructing every scene and narrative beat with a painter's eye; the performances - especially Rosamund Pike as Amy and Tyler Perry as Nick's lawyer - are pretty much on the money; and the film is shot with a sheen and style appropriate to the film's themes. It nods to all sorts of films - from Hitchcock, through Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct and in one startling moment, Carrie - yet is definitively its own vision. <br/><br/>For all that, the film demands more from you. It has a dark vision of human relationships, and more or less forces the viewer into some uncomfortable reflections. For me the film touches genius in making you to pick a side; then undercuts that by showing you how shallow it is to do so. There's a question around the source novel as to if it's misogynist or feminist; such a debate may miss the point completely, in fact. Truth isn't to be found on one 'side' or the other; it's to be found in the combustible chemical reaction of two broken people. In the film's deliberately over-stated central relationship we see writ large a deeper truth; that the sum of a relationship is greater than its constituent parts. Hence the uncomfortable reality the film leaves us with - give yourself to your relationships; don't hide. The more you hide, the more exposed you are. The less you give, the more you lose; the more you give, the more you gain. <br/><br/>It's not just relationships in Gone Girl's cross-hairs; it's a scathing attack on celebrity culture, on media obsession with making info-tainment out of personal tragedy (it felt apt to see this film in the week that Oscar Pisotrius was sentenced for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp), gender and domestic violence, and parenting. It needs a hearty running time to do all that without collapsing under its own weight. It is a long film, but necessarily so; it flies by. Mind, heart and eyes are fully engaged throughout. <br/><br/>In the end, however, it's the nature of intimate relationships with which it is most concerned. For all the heightened reality that is a feature of this and Fincher's other best work, it leaves you with pertinent and uncomfortable choices to make and questions to answer. It's impossible to come out of this film and not find yourself sitting in judgement one character or the other; analyse that for long, though, and you find the finger pointed back on yourself. Which is what a parable should do, really."

Regardless of the super sophisticated interpretations some reviewers will make of this work, the inconsistencies of character and illogical latitude taken in the film's climax leaves the entire story sadly wanting of any real meaning or purpose. Amy gets away with murdering a man on 'framed' evidence provided by cameras that would also have recorded her arriving with him unbound and wandering freely on her own over a day or two? And, as is pointed out but never addressed, how does a woman bound for days get a hold of a box cutter? Sorry, I don't buy it as clever. I buy it as not being clear on how to end what should have been a terrific story of pretense and manipulation behind a seemingly perfect marriage. Great set up for a big disappointment.

It's great to report that Gone Girl can be added to the list of impressive movies he's directed.<br/><br/>The film centres around the disappearance of Amy Dunne(Rosamund Pike) who is married to Nick (Ben Afflick). The story is told in a series of flash backs and flash forwards as we gradually get to know all the characters and the circumstances surrounding the disappearance. The first 30 minutes or so is slightly slow, but is important as it gives an insight into all the main characters. The rest of the movie is spellbinding and has numerous twists and turns. I suspect if you stopped and thought about it for a bit some parts probably don't really hang together, but it's so well done nobody (well I guess some people will!) is going to complain about that.<br/><br/>Pike is absolutely brilliant in the lead role and manages to outshine Afflick which is quite a compliment!"

","Gone Girl is a film based on Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel about a couple whose marriage is on the rocks when the wife mysteriously disappears. The husband then becomes a prime suspect in her disappearance. David Fincher pulled off another great feat with this cinematic experience. Gone Girl is high up in the ranks of best Fincher films. The dark feel he adds to his movies works well with the feel of this story. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck plays the great and very relatable protagonist Nick Dunne. He wanders around trying to find his missing wife while simultaneously thinking through his marriage piece by piece. His character reminded me of myself slightly at times because I have been through the same experience he was going through. The story hit really close to home. One day I too came home from work and found that my wife had gone missing. We had been going through some rough spots before then as well. I looked around the house and called her name but she was nowhere to be found. I checked in her closet, and all of her clothes were gone. I peeked in the garage and found that my wife's car was also missing. I tried her cell phone numerous times, but there was no answer.<br/><br/>Suddenly, it was clear to me what must have happened. An intruder must have broken into our home, kidnapped my wife, stolen her clothes and personal belongings to sell for cash, and then used her car to make a quick getaway. I immediately called the police and told them of my wife's kidnapping. They responded within a matter of minutes. <br/><br/>Some detectives came to our house and took a quick look around. They took notice of the fact that all of her belongings and car were gone along with her. One of the detectives asked if we were having any marriage troubles as of late. I told them that we had, but we still loved each other very much. My wife had been putting us into a lot of debt by putting a great deal of motel room charges on our credit cards. It was beginning to become a burden. <br/><br/>The detectives then proceeded to ask why she was spending money on motel rooms. I told them about how she bought them so that she and her friends, Sally and Marge, could have a private place to play bridge. Sometimes they would play bridge well into the night I told the officers. They inquired whether I had ever met ""Sally"" and ""Marge"". I told the officers that no, I had not met them. My wife wouldn't let me talk to other women. She always said that talking to the opposite gender was a gateway drug to what the kids these days call sexual intercourse.<br/><br/>They asked if she had any close male friends. I told her that she had become good friends with my best friend Charles over the past year. I'd known Charles since college. When I got married, I encouraged the two of them to get to know each other more. All three of us would hang out occasionally, but then about 9 months ago they would sometimes hang out and forget to invite me. I didn't complain, though. I just thought it was great that my sweet lovely and my best pal were getting to know each other.<br/><br/>The detectives then asked me if she had just started to play bridge in the last 9 months. I told them yes. She said she needed to socialize and find a new hobby. Both of the detectives looked down at the ground and sighed. <br/><br/>Then they told me something that would blow my mind. My wife and Charles were doing the no-pants dance together. Bet you didn't see that coming. Well, neither did I. At first I didn't accept it. ""Your wives are the ones having sex with Charles!"" I yell back at them. ""Not my wife! She's just a big fan of bridge!""<br/><br/>The detectives tell me that they're sorry, but it is the truth. I begin to bawl uncontrollably. I fall on the ground and roll around in my puddles of tears. ""I took her to see a Cee-Lo Green concert last year!"" I scream. ""Does that mean nothing anymore???!! After awhile, the police get tired of watching me roll around and decide to leave me lying my pool of misery. <br/><br/>What could my wife see in Charles? Sure, he has a great physique and world-class dong (I had gym class with him), and I have saggy tits and a plethora of sores covering my skin. But isn't love supposed to be more than appearances? Love means appreciating the Cee-Lo Green concert tickets I buy for her. Love means being impressed by my samurai sword collection. Love means being grateful for that I took a vow of abstinence on our honeymoon because she believed that if we even held hands we would both get AIDS. I guess those things were just too hard for her <br/><br/>Now, it is three years later, and I am doing much better. I now go to counseling five days a week. My therapist told me that it might be beneficial for me to buy a pet to keep me company. I took his advice and I bought a cat. I named him The New and Improved Charles, and he's my new best friend. Right now, I'm teaching him to play the piano like that one cat on that YouTube video. I think he might be the next Beethoven!!!!<br/><br/>In conclusion, I guess I'll just say this is a great movie. It brought back a lot of dark memories, but it's totally worth it. Oh yeah, and if you see Nancy Logsdon, AKA my cheating ex-wife, tell her I hate her.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>blakelogsdon1"
"Red_Identity","Null","2","11","5 October 2014"," Extremely unpredictable
","I have to start at the beginning with this one. Back when I saw Fincher directing this mystery, I totally assumed it'd be another Zodiac/The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo type of mystery- pretty straight-forward, very moody and dark, very beautifully shot. Heck, even two weeks ago I thought this. I thought it was just a simple woman-gone-missing case, and so the fact that Rosamund Pike was getting so much attention for it, for a possible Oscar nod, really blew my little mind. It wasn't until around a week ago or so that I accidentally got spoiled, and a pretty big one at that- that Pike played a villain, and that she was psychotic. Since it was unintentionally spoiled, I couldn't really get all upset but it did suck that now I knew a lot about it. Had I gone into the film completely blind, I would've been extremely shocked at every revelation. <br/><br/>This is a really twisted film, in a way I don't think Fincher has made since Fight Club. Whereas I expected a very serious, very atmospheric mystery, I got a thriller that took quite a lot of turns, and was also very often pretty funny and quite often super silly and just so much fun. I don't mean that as a negative, since I think it really made for quite an experience. The audience I was watching it with really took to all of it, mostly in a way I'm sure most of them didn't expect. On the downside, I'm not sure how well this will fare with rewatches, since it's very heavily plot-driven. But going by how most of Fincher's films I loved even more with time, I'm not too worried about that. <br/><br/>Technically, I don't think this is quite as showy as Fincher's recent outings. I was actually pretty surprised by how it wasn't driven by atmosphere and mood through cinematography in a way his last four films have. It's nicely shot, but this is the first time I wasn't marveling at just how beautiful a Fincher film looked. Maybe it was all of the plot turns that didn't have me focus so much on that? Regardless, surprising in that way, not that it matters so much. The score is wonderful, but definitely not as present as the scores for Social Network and Dragon Tattoo were. The editing is also strong, but not nearly as showy as his last two outings (if that's a good or bad thing, depends on you). <br/><br/>I've never been a big Ben Affleck fan when it comes to his acting (like most people) but he's never been awful either. The only time he really impressed me was in The Town, but I think this is quite easily the best I've ever seen him do. He really strikes a perfect balance with the character and the tone the film is trying to achieve, so much so that I think he's in the same league as Rosamund Pike. It's true that Pike has a hell of character to work with, something I definitely didn't predict before getting spoiled. I thought she did great, but I didn't find her nearly as amazing as many seemed to Between this and The Leftovers, Carrie Coon is really having an amazing year. And like a few people here, I felt that she might actually be the film's MVP, being able to bring such an authenticity to a character that could've felt like such a caricature and bringing loads of emotional investment in her. Kim Dickens isn't that far behind, really delivering the most of her role in a way no other supporting player besides Coon did. <br/><br/>I also want to highlight just how tonally weird the film is in the first half. I'm just super happy that this was not at all what I had expected weeks ago (not that that would've been a bad film). The fact that it came off as this weird, pretty funny, campy yet also serious satire and thriller is to be applauded, because I haven't seen many recent films like this."

","The first real horror release in the United States this October, doesn't come in the form of a cash grab movie about a possessed doll. No, rather it comes to us in the form of a nightmare of the American dream. Gillian Flynn and David Fincher have done for marriage, what Darren Aronofsky did for drug use in 'Requiem for a Dream'. 'Gone Girl' is a deliciously dark, furiously acted, and surprisingly funny representation of the dark side of married life. At times it's absurd as all Hell. But nevertheless, entertaining throughout. <br/><br/>Nick Dunne (Affleck) returns home from the beach one morning where he wandered off to collect his thoughts, to find that his wife Amy (Pike) is missing, and there seems to have been a struggle upon her disappearance. As Nick calls the authorities to report it, what is instantly off putting is how relaxed he is towards the situation at hand. In flashbacks, we see the structuring of Nick and Amy's relationship. Everything being bubbly and perfect at first of course; And as it would be, financial troubles, infidelity, and just the wear and tear of married life takes its toll. <br/><br/>It so happens that Amy disappears on the morning of the 5th anniversary of her marriage with Nick. She had left behind ""clues"" for Nick to discover that seemed to be leading him to a romantic conclusion, and the detectives investigating her disappearance think that perhaps these clues can be used to locate Amy. As the movie pushes it's plot going forward in the first half, Nick begins to be shredded by the media and local community. Everyone believing that he is involved in Amy's disappearance somehow, perhaps murdering her. This notion becomes even more potent when it's revealed he's been having an affair with a much younger woman. <br/><br/>The plot thickens further when Nick notices an ex boyfriend at a rally fundraiser for Amy. He becomes worried of his appearance, convinced of his involvement. However, Nick becomes manipulated by the media even further, and as more evidence surfaces to which it looks like it's a no-brainer he's guilty of murder. However, the mother of all twists takes place, and Gone Girl takes a deep, dark plunge into madness very quickly. Without revealing too much, I'll say as someone who avoided the novel I had grand ideas for how I thought this film would play out. And god damn was I mistaken. The one thing that prevents me from giving the film a perfect score is the fact that it's story has such a distasteful view towards married life. As if nobody is ever to be trusted with your love, and that we're all inherently pieces of grool. Once the film kicks into absurdity, it becomes the blackest of black comedies maybe ever; but that's what's so damn fun about it. Do I sympathize with anyone in the movie? Not really. It's a well thought out examination of how media works into tricking people into jumping to conclusions, and there's some interesting things to gather from it's stance on how ugly things can become behind closed doors. That doesn't mean it's not shlock. However, it's shlock of the highest order.<br/><br/>David Fincher is a master of perfection, and nothing's changed with this entry into his filmography. Every shot, every movement, every damn breath of a character is pre-planned, and executed to perfection. And as much of an advocate I am for 35mm, David Fincher is making the best case for digital filmmaking. He and returning favorite cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth captured this darkly lit story impeccably. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross return as well to provide a pulse like soundtrack, that never goes too far, but always creates the necessary atmosphere. Of course credit has to be given to Gillian Flynn on producing such a twisted story, and filling in scenes with such tasty dialogue in her debut as a screenwriter.<br/><br/>What would this movie be however without great performances? And man they are a plenty. Affleck once again turns in a great role, this time very subtle and subdued. He's not asking you to feel sorry for him, and I like that a lot. The standout far and away is Rosamund Pike however, and unfortunately I can't go into details why. Man oh man though, she is absolutely at the peak of her game here. To my biggest surprise is how good Tyler Perry is playing Nick's snaky lawyer. Neil Patrick Harris as the creepy ex-boyfriend is fine, somewhat miscast I feel. Another small weakness in the film.<br/><br/>Comparisons are being made to Hitchcock, De Palma, Verhoeven, etc. Fine I guess. To me, it was all Fincher, all the way. He earned his right to claim a style, 3 films ago. This is Zodiac, Panic Room, Se7en, The Social Network all rolled into one. It's not as good as 3 out 4 of those films, but it's yet another reminder that Fincher has meticulous detail in every frame. And a lingering sense of attitude and dread waiting behind every corner. Cheers to another great film, from a modern maverick of cinema.<br/><br/>614moviebuff.blogspot.com"
"MichaelM259","7","4","32","29 September 2014"," It's safe to say that if you're planning on seeing 10 movies this year, Gone Girl should be near the top of the list.
","Adapting novels into screenplays is tough: not only does the writer have to pack 400+ pages of backstory, characterization and plot into 100-120 pages of script, but the director is forced to make important choices about where within those pages to point his or her camera. They have to decide what the story is actually about and discriminatingly pluck snippets from the source material to tell it effectively, all while staying true to the author's intent. Luckily for David Fincher and his latest film, Gone Girl, he had Gillian Flynn—the author of the New York Times bestseller of the same name—manning the typewriter. While many will still prefer Flynn's original hardcover to its adaptation (myself included), the Fincher/Flynn tandem spawned a darkly intoxicating film riddled with its fair share of surprises and hilarity, even for those familiar with the story. It's safe to say that if you're planning on seeing 10 movies this year, Gone Girl should be near the top of the list.<br/><br/>The film is about Nick and Amy Dunne, a married New York couple in their mid-thirties who lose their print magazine jobs at the height of the recent recession and are forced to move back to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Missouri after his mother is diagnosed with breast cancer. Through a series of rosy flashbacks, we catch glimpses of what used to be Nick and Amy's life together in New York: the night they met at a party in Brooklyn, the night Nick proposed at the release party for Amy's parents' most recent children's book (Amazing Amy and the Big Day—based on their daughter), and the first few years of their blissful marriage. Subtract two jobs and one Manhattan loft, add a substantial loan to Amy's parents from her trust fund and multiply it all by Amy's reluctance to leave the East coast and shack up in a McMansion along the Mississippi River, and it becomes quite clear that the Dunne union has seen better days. Then on their fifth wedding anniversary Amy disappears. The local police scour Nick's house where there are clear signs of a struggle, as well as a letter from Amy: the first clue for the treasure hunt she plans for Nick every year on their anniversary. Gradually, the national media spotlight descends on the small Missouri town and the public turns on Nick when he's suspected for having something to do with his wife's disappearance. As the police investigation develops and the noose continues to tighten around Nick, everyone is left wondering one question: where is Amy Dunne?<br/><br/>However, the question Fincher would rather the audience ask themselves is ""Who is Amy Dunne?"" To be sure, there is a reason Flynn's novel has sold over 8.5 million copies. It's a thrilling murder mystery that tantalizes us with many of the familiar concepts we've come to expect from both Hollywood and the serial dramas of the small screen, which seem to be more and more concerned about killing than the people doing the killing or trying to stop it (there is even a show called The Killing that ironically, as Grantland's Andy Greenwald laments, just won't die). But Gone Girl avoids the missteps of its peers and provides the audience with considerably more existential questions than what happened to its title character. Fincher, working off of Flynn's themes, crafts his film around the most salient elements of the story that leaves the audience feeling at once shocked by its absurdity and terrified by its implications. At its core, Gone Girl is about serious relationships and the importunate questions that almost always hover above them. Who Amy and Nick are—as individuals and as a couple—prior to the former's disappearance is just as important to Fincher as what happens to Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick (Ben Affleck) in the film. Affleck turns in his finest performance to date as the people-pleasing, unintentionally smug Nick Dunne, opting for downplayed, restrained acting choices much like Christian Bale's subtly scintillating role in last year's American Hustle. Surely a number of other actors could have shined in Gone Girl, but Affleck's dopey charm and topsy-turvy career arc truly resonate with the character. <br/><br/>While staying true to the general ethos of the novel is admirable, actually augmenting the material in some respects is downright impressive, and not many directors can do it. One of Fincher's greatest gifts is his mastery of light and shadow, so much so that there is something definitively and obviously congruent about all of his work, and specific minutia stand out: the perpetually-stormy, decaying city streets of Seven; the organic, filthiness of Tyler Durden's house in Fight Club; the moody, gloomy halls of Harvard in The Social Network. In Gone Girl, it happens to be from a scene in the trailer where Nick Dunne is standing in the gazebo with the spotlight all over him at a vigil for Amy, explaining to the hundreds of skeptical mourners and reporters that he's innocent. It's a scene that recapitulates Flynn's prose regarding the proliferation of mass media celebrity culture and the gotcha journalism that promotes the sexiest story over the legitimate one. And while chastising the news media is nothing new in film (e.g. Natural Born Killers (1994), Network (1976), and the upcoming Nightcrawler it would appear to a certain extent), there is something simultaneously intimate and surreal about watching Nick and Amy's story unfold, as if we're watching a realty TV show about people we know personally. <br/><br/>There are at least another dozen scenes that gracefully sew the story together, which is no small task given the manner in which Flynn wrote the book, vacillating between Nick's account of the investigation and Amy's old diary entries, which serve as a flashback mechanism. One scene as reimagined by Fincher evoked literal gasps from the entire theater, while Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' haunting soundtrack had people squirming in their seats. It's why we pay to go to the movies."

"sime-taras","9","2","12","12 October 2014"," Another masterpiece from one of the best new generation directors....
","David Fincher has returned to what he does best, he turns a great story and a great script into a suspense what-will-happen-next drama-thriller (of course with a twist or two), so you can definitely say it's worth spending two and a half hours in front of a screen with this title....<br/><br/>The movie itself goes step by step, giving the viewer exactly enough information and plot as it is necessary to go into the next step. Each step is brilliantly directed and in that department it reminds me a lot of The Fight Club. At the very time you start thinking it will get boring, something happens to keep things going, and it keeps you in your seat the whole time....<br/><br/>Concerning the cast and the acting, I'm delighted with the performance of the whole cast in general. The portraits of the characters (even the supporting ones) is excellent, each and every one of them is well played, and necessary for the development of the main characters, the plot and the whole story in general. Ben Affleck, who is definitely not one of my favorite screen guys, does well, and it feels that the role fits him well. I also want to welcome a good debut part of stunningly beautiful Emily Ratajkowski, as well as the great role of Carrie Coon, but what definitely steals the whole thing is the performance of Rosamund Pike (expect an Oscar nomination, possibly even the statue in her hands). <br/><br/>To sum it all up, it starts as one thing, than it turns to another thing, and it ends as a third thing....Enjoy"

Amy is portrayed smart and psychotic but it does not mean that she is soooo brilliant that she can come up with a plot which is flawless and make sense to all the audience. The film clearly shows how there is pressure from the society and how much people loves Amy. Police looks at evidence when they investigate a case. Furthermore, they are just town officers. You cant really expect them to deep dive into the case when all of the evidence present are pointing towards Nick. However I don't like any of the characters and they make me so annoyed."

","I had one of the most amazing viewing experiences watching this movie for the first time! Unfortunately it cannot be re-experienced but I cherished my first watch. This movie...what a thriller!! I LOVED this film and felt quite a frustration at the ending: Fincher's goal with the ending, however, was to have the viewer feel the same frustration the main character felt, a sensation I have never experienced in a movie. Loved it.<br/><br/>EXCELLENT cast. Fincher carefully picked Pike over Witherspoon and I am thankful he did. Pike played her role perfectly and provided her soothing voice and wonderful tone. Affleck was perfect for his role, as his demeanor and real-life Hollywood experiences helped propel his relation to his character. Tyler Perry was great, and Neil Patrick Harris was a joy to watch.<br/><br/>So far, my biggest 10 out of 10 for a film. HIGHLY, highly recommended."

"nishanthzerocool172","9","1","4","24 July 2016"," Gone Girl - Movie Experience
","Marriage, in most sense, is a socially recognized union between two people that establishes rights and duties between them, including their children and their in-laws. And in most cases, that union doesn't last for a very long time. Questions arise between the spouses that lead to many challenges. What are you thinking? What are you feeling? What have done to each other? What will we do? My first praise goes to the story (or the screenplay) because the common subject of marriage problems after a recession has been beautifully twisted in the most conniving and manipulative manner. The novelist, Gillian Flynn, has penned the screenplay herself. I don't know whose decision was that, but it was a good decision in the end. The unfolding of each character, the non-linear narrative jumping between happy times and bad times of the couple, and the twist that leaves you mesmerized makes us completely attached to the characters. My unique experience from this movie is that my fellow peers had failed to notice many dark humorous dialogues, and most of the times I ended up laughing alone in the theater.<br/><br/>David Fincher, the director, is known for his low lighting shots and again we see them beautifully executed in this movie. Equal praise goes to the cinematographer as well. What was missing in this movie, based on my experience, was his trademark style of wide angled shots. My only guess is that he avoided wide shots to bring the audience closer to the characters, especially the couple, involving them in the characters' own twisted world. The music, directed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, brilliance at its core, escalated many scenes of the movie and heightened the mysteries surrounding the lead characters.<br/><br/>When it comes to performances, Rosamund Pike (playing Amy Dunne, the wife) stands out more than Ben Affleck (playing Nick Dunne, the husband). Her choice of tone in background narration and on-screen dialogues was soothing and creepy at the same. Special praises go to Rosamund and Ben for meticulously researching about their characters. Special mention goes to Kim Dickens for her amazing supportive performance as Detective Rhonda Boney. On the downside of performances, I was wishing more serious and creepy stuff from Neil Patrick Harris considering that great comedians are known for their portrayal of more serious roles.<br/><br/>The major and only frustration from my movie experience is that I have watched it in Indian cinemas. The nudity scenes were hidden by zooming in on a particular spot of the shot. And the violent and bloody scenes were edited horribly to reduce the gory nature of those scenes. I can empathize to a certain extent of hiding out the nude scenes, but I will never entertain in masking out the violent scenes. The reason I am mentioning this in my article is because it had disturbed my viewing pleasure. When will the Indian censorship board ever learn that they cannot f*** around with the audiences' feelings?"

","I was going to rate Gone Girl with an eight but the five last minutes made me change my mind because I really thought the ending was disappointing. But the rest of the movie itself is really entertaining. Maybe a bit too long but still entertaining enough to keep you interested. Crime/mysteries are one of my favorite genre of movies, especially when you can't really figure out what happened until the end. With this one I figured it out really soon but it was still enjoyable to watch due to the good performances of Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Well, the whole cast was good actually except Neil Patrick Harris. I don't know why but I don't find him a good actor and he's quite irritable to watch. Nevertheless Gone Girl is a good movie with a couple of twists and the right amount of suspense in the story to have a good night in front of the big screen."

","Before you read my review, I have to say that vote is low because I have to drop it from 8. 4 could be the actual rate.<br/><br/>I believe Gone Girl is good for a Monday night episode on a random series that you barely watch on television. Comparing to David's previous films, this the most poor scenario ever made.<br/><br/>Now to tell the truth, sometimes Hollywood directors have to make some movies, that the scenario will be easy to understand, even if you pay low attention. That's because most of people are NOT interested on clever plot twist, and nice acting - they just want to relax and eat their pop-corns (this is the majority of teenagers and 40+ years old).And that's what David and many directors do, they just want to earn the audience, thus to earn money.<br/><br/>There is good acting but bad acting as well from the same actors. Something is wrong with scenes - maybe David was not so excited with the movie himself; or maybe the cast were confused with the roles;<br/><br/>And here is the other thing that David did: He plays with feminine instinct. Yep he does it, just like he did with Str8 instinct back in Fight Club. If it is happen and you are female you gonna like Gone Girl TRUST ME.<br/><br/>As I said before is the kind of movies, that the next day you will probably forget what you watched the last night. I will finish the review and never deal with Gone Girl again. - Go for another movie."

This event even becomes news in the town after her husband posts the news through social media.<br/><br/>During the police's investigation, it seems Amy's diary is releasing the truth behind her disappearance. In her diary, police find out she has suffered in her marriage with Nick's violence and disloyalty. All Nick's bad behavior is verified by the police. Moreover, Amy financially supported Nick to open a bar. All the evidence shows this is a murder! The husband killed the wife, because he had an affair and wanted to gain sole ownership of their property. However, Nick denies any involvement. Is the truth that their marriage is a tomb of love? It would not be an attractive film if the story ended there. It becomes more complicated with Amy's ex appearing and Amy's return in the end. Did Amy just want to escape from the marriage for a while? What happened between her and her ex? The film reveals the secret step by step. You will feel a chill down your spine. People in love should be honest and trustful of each other and help each other to be a better person. It seems this principle should be applied to marriage. However, the director wants to show another side of marriage to the audience. Like Amy, who has dual personalities, we have to think about another angle of marriage. Life is not always sweet."

It's twisty and cold-hearted. The acting is superb headed by Rosamund Pike and Carrie Coon. Ben Affleck is a solid lead. The directing is relentlessly compelling. This is not to say I have no problems with the movie. I never once believed Nick killed his wife and therefore the twist is not that shocking. I choose to believe that David Fincher did not make Nick look guilty because he didn't want it to be manufactured. Nevertheless the whole story does have a manufactured feel like Amy's disturbed scheme. I also couldn't see past Neil Patrick Harris or Tyler Perry. NPH doesn't give off the creeps that his character needs desperately. Tyler Perry is Tyler Perry and I can't see his character without his Tyler Perry persona. The best moment actually comes when Amy gets robbed by the couple. That is a shocking brilliant reversal which caught me by surprise. The last half is deliciously cold. The movie ends a bit early but it's already over 2 hours long. Modern movie don't usually go far longer than that and it's set up for an interesting sequel."

","I am a huge admirer of Fincher's work. Hence once again he proved to be one of the best storytellers. This is by far the best movie i have seen in a long time. If you are looking forward to watch a great movie this weekend, trust me this has to be it. Although long, but it keeps you so engaged with all the suspense and thrill that you would not notice the time you just spent watching this movie. All those viewers giving bad ratings or reviews to this movie either need to watch it again or get a better taste in movies. The twist and turns keeps you involved in the movie for the whole two and a half hours without your eyes blinking. Rosamund Pikes performance in this movie is no doubt brilliant but one should not overlook what Ben Affleck has brought to this movie who played the role of a tired, oblivious and boyish character really well. The movie starts off really well with a mystery of a kidnapped wife. Missing wife. Murdered wife. But what twists and turns comes next after next will surely put a smile on your face at the end of the movie. I would surely recommend this movie to everyone. Also remember, getting married? Beware of the Gone Girl. Thumbs Up 👍"

","I have been complaining about the Hollywood movies lately because their lack of excitement and intelligence, but once in awhile, movies like Gone Girl really makes me want to go to the theater again.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a chilling story of a marriage gone bad. It is very entertaining for both men and women. It is a reminder of how thoughtless and insensitive some men can be and how far some women can go with their manipulating skills . It raises a question for some of us. Can being married be that bad?<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike isn't my favorite actor but I have to admit, she is always good with whatever role she plays. The plot is creative and unique with a lot of interesting twists. It keeps the suspense and excitement going. However, like many other reviewers had said, the end is a little disappointing. <br/><br/>Final verdict? I would watch it again!"

","Scenarist Gillian Flynn and director David Fincher deliver an adaptation of Flynn's novel that takes an intense, slow burn story and somehow remakes it into a dull, suspense-sapping film that goes on far too long. Filming in the dark style that has become his trademark, Fincher treats his material with seeming indifference, apparently not finding enough compelling material to engage with and he settles for competent performances without nuance from leads Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Flynn's screenplay doesn't help: the twisting, devious plot as told by unreliable narrators that delighted and disturbed in her novel here gets a hurried treatment that seems to trivialize important episodes. Yet it's bloated where the novel was propulsive. Flynn's book was a cynical but identifiable take on marriage in America, marred by a fizzled, inert ending; yet here by the end she has turned her thesis into something larger and uglier, a violent war waged by calculating women against unwitting men."

She will, then, ask her 1st lover to give her shelter and then start a new scenario to go back home.. BUT the end is: <br/><br/>what are they doing!?<br/><br/>OK she comes home, after killing Collings (N.patrick Harris) , she is literally painted with blood, saying ''he'' was trying to rape and murder her; well, OK, but then, nobody will even clean her face whatsoever at the hospital, may be she has been hurt right? so the 1st thing they must do is, look for wound or else while she is on the bed but no..., <br/><br/>Now she is there, in a wheelchair (still painted with blood) answering questions from the police, the woman, in charge of her case, who suspect she lied, can't talk or ask anything even months after.<br/><br/>oh!, alright then, see, B. Affleck is doomed, he is forced to live with her, saying, ''ok, we are a good couple now, no problem'' instead of putting his wife on Shutter island.<br/><br/>it's like they wrote an end quickly to make a longer movie than it should be, luckily, it's in the last minutes of it, so the disappointment isn't that high, but for me, the movie ended when she arrived home<br/><br/>In any kind of movie, actors can deliver great performance, R.

","A lot of people might not understand the plot and sub-plot of this movie. First, 2 flawed people who view each other as perfect get married, and then both are let down when they find out they are not perfect. Once they find that out, they each look for horrible ways to get out of what they did. They then apply that let down to each other and everyone around them.<br/><br/>The levels of torture do get absurd and go beyond what can be imagined.<br/><br/>The second plot is a major condemnation of the main stream media. Unfortunately that is right on target. There are murders which are always convicting people in the main stream media before a trial. This is why lots of people stay out of politics. That and you have to lie in politics and blame what you do on somebody else. Between that and doing everything corporations want you to do, politics have become a dirty business. They always have been without term limits which feed on the dirt an corruption.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, and Neil Patrick Harris do a credible job trying to bring card board characters to life. This has to be fiction, but it has been approached in real life. There is a case that has gone through many trials where a man's wife disappeared on 09/11 and even though there was just an acquittal, there is going to be another trial. There is no body in this one that can be found and all the man's friends and neighbors and media had him convicted before the first of now many trials.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie for Mr. Harris, he has already lived it and is continuing to live it.

"maddiemooox","9","1","4","17 March 2015"," Thrilling, convincing and very realistic
","One of the things I really liked about the film is that even by watching the trailers, interviews and critic ratings I still had no idea of what I was in for. Gone girl has to be one of the best, well directed, well casted films I have seen all year. I thought the dialogue was very unique, the acting was very convincing and it left me speechless when the end credits finally came up. 'Gone Girl' is a very good example about how people are treated in the media on a regular basis, and the way people are shown to the world and judged and how intimidating attention from show hosts, reporters and journalists can be and how it changes the way you look at people in the media. This is the first time I have seen Rosamund Pike in a film and I thought she did a brilliant job of recreating Amy. I loved the relationship between Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike and how well they created it for the big screen, both of their characters where extremely convincing and even though you feel like you shouldn't care about Nick near the start of the movie, as it gradually took off I really did care about Nick and that does say something about his character. The storyline was very unexpected in some cases, it was very gripping and interesting there was not one moment where I felt like it dragged or took a while to build.<br/><br/>I seriously do not recommend watching this film on the first date though, but otherwise I think it is a film defiantly worth sitting through."

","Mild spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Some guys wakes up, goes to a bar that we later learn he co-owns with his twin sister, gets a call from his neighbor, goes back home, finds that it looks like there was some attack and his wife is missing. It's the day of their anniversary. He's lucky enough that assigned to his case is the most dedicated detective ever, who spends 24/7 on this case--apparently it's the only one she has. Her side-kick officer insists that they should arrest the guy immediately. Quickly they find clues--letters from her wife as clues for him in their yearly anniversary raunchy scavenger hunt.<br/><br/>Now we learn how they meet in voice-overs from the missing woman as she reads her diary entries. She's a Harvard chick, he's some regular Missouri guy, they met at a party and hit it off immediately. Like most Americans they have a neat personality, but not much else. Everything goes well for a while. They have their own language, she wants nothing more than to be his wife. When his mother is diagnosed with cancer they move back to his town where she doesn't feel at home. Then the financial crises of 2008 hits and both end up without a job. Her parents are also in trouble and take almost all the money from her trust fund. What little is left, she uses to buy him the bar.<br/><br/>Back to the present, the guy looks like a jerk but plays along with whatever a guy in that situation is supposed to do--appear on TV, appear on events, candle-light vigils, etc. The American media is enthralled with the story as they often are when a blonde woman vanishes.<br/><br/>But then, after we start sympathizing with him, and even more with his cool sister, we learn that he has a mistress. And we learn that the woman knew as well, and how she meticulously planned her disappearance and made it look like he killed her. According to her side of the story, he ignored her, the marriage became hell, he became abusive. And she predicts he will kill her. The final clue they find is the partially burned diary.<br/><br/>We catch up with her on the day of her disappearance and how she ends up changing her appearance and driving to another town/state and checking into some motel, where she meets some ordinary couple. When they find out that she's got a bunch of money, they rob her. That changes everything for her. Now she can't conclude her plan, which involved ditching the car and maybe killing herself or making a body appear somehow so that her husband gets the death penalty.<br/><br/>Now she's forced to resort to an high school flame of hers, whom she hurt as well. But he's filthy rich and takes her in. When her husbands appears on TV, something which his lawyer recommended, he gives her signals based on their private signs. And somehow she finds again her love for him, or something like that. But now she has to deal with the rich guy and will try to recover her family somehow.<br/><br/>The first hour of so of Gone Girl is very strong, exciting, thrilling, since we don't know where this will go. It's unusual because it doesn't present some adolescent view of some perfectly good people vs. some perfectly evil people. It obviously manipulates the audience, to feel for the guy, then to dislike him, while liking her but then starting to dislike her. At some point you think you know what how things will turn out. That's when this movie seem another entry in the Wild Things series of movies, but this one far less sexy that the others. But things don't go that route either, in fact they don't go anywhere. After and hour and a half the movie starts progressively losing steam and concludes with the worst, most dissatisfying ending I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Along the way, the movie has some interesting things to say about marriage. Clearly the author must have had some very nasty experience, as is becoming the rule when marrying an American woman. There are some mild criticisms of the media culture as well, that hypes these stories, that sells the comic view of the world, demonizing he perceived villain, while glorifying the always innocent victim.<br/><br/>There is some ridicule of the Harvard-type people who are so arrogant and full of themselves they simply aren't equipped to handle criticism in any socially-acceptable way but rather become viciously vengeful. While it's not at all clear what on earth the motivation is for the woman flipping out, but it seems to be something along those lines. She was meant to be successful in her mind, but this ordinary guy ruined her life and on top of that cheated on her, while using the same moves that she thought were exclusively for her.<br/><br/>You keep waiting, hoping for a twist that never comes, something that would give this movie some meaning. They marketed the movie as having some secret, but really there's nothing there. Just as the people in the movie, the movie itself is happy to manipulate the viewer and lead him nowhere."
"rs9017720","6","1","4","16 February 2015"," The biggest mixed bag of 2014
","I had high hopes for this movie, but that was probably because I knew nothing about it. I thought it would be a neo-noir, but in the end it plays out more as a thriller. In the first act, Nick realizes his wife, Amy, is gone and believes she has been kidnapped. He seems unshaken at first, which was to make the audience think he killed his wife. This is quite odd however, since in the end it was revealed that he had nothing to do with his wife's disappearance. As this goes on, his wife's diary entries are shown on screen which gives the audience an insight into the couple's past. At this point, I was still looking for small hints and clues in the text, but my attempts were all for naught. The press is outraged at Nick, and believe him to be the killer, but things get more complicated when it is revealed that Nick has been having an affair. This seemed out of character for our ""everyman"", and I first saw it I raised an eyebrow, but its far from the least believable thing presented on screen. That would come when, halfway through the movie, it is revealed that Amy is alive, journal entries war lies, and she wants revenge on her husband for cheating on her. The movie wanted my jaw to drop, but instead, my eyebrow was raised. Her plan is to frame Nick for her murder in the most complicated way possible so that he goes to jail. Instead of just killing him, or whatever. Nick eventually realizes his wife's disappearance was a clever ploy and hires a lawyer, who gets people to track her down. This plot point is only addressed like, one time though, and never comes into play. However, while Amy is away, she is robbed and the pair who did it realize that there is something odd about her. This should have happened a long time ago since the two have watched reports of Amy's disappearance WITH HER IN THE ROOM but this plot point is also swept under the rug. Amy goes to a casino and, by pure coincidence, stumbles upon one of her exes. He takes her into his house because he's an idiot, and she slowly begins her plot to frame him as her kidnapper. For some reason. Seriously, her motivations can be pretty much summed up as ""I was CRAZY the whole time! (except when I wasn't)"". Meanwhile Nick wins over the press and people for apologizing for cheating on his wife. Amy see this and suddenly doesn't hate her husband any more (again, CRAZY! (maybe)) and kills the guy she was with. She then returns home and everyone believes her story, despite holes that even Nick points out. Even his lawyer and the detective working on the case just leave, fully knowing the truth about Amy. Amy then tells Nick she is pregnant with his sperm from the sperm bank and Nick decides to fake his love for her to rise his kid. Then one of the worst endings of all time happens. After all this buildup, the complicated plot, the suspense it ends. The movie just, cuts off. This is not an ending you have to think about, either. the writers just didn't know how to end it, so they just did. What the hell. So the plot is full of holes, the characters change their entire personalities in the blink of an eye, and it's on the whole the second most overrated movie of the year (second only to Interstellar), but it is extremely suspenseful, well acted and beautifully shot with great music and a disturbing tone. On the whole, it really is the biggest mixed bag of last year's cinema."
"jasonpfaff23-240-274112","8","1","4","15 February 2015"," Fincher doesn't make bad films
","I find David Fincher's films based on fiction (like Fightclub) more imaginative versus his non-fictional projects (Social Network), and I'd put him alongside today's top directors like Aronofsky and Nolan easily. Gone Girl (adapted from the novel by Gillian Flynn) touches on marriage/relationship themes like other notable films (Revolutionary Road, American Beauty, Eyes Wide Shut), but with deeper satire and an 'up to date' stance. Fincher has a way of reflecting the more interesting parts (and dark corners) of the collective consciousness (especially Americans) in a humorous way, sometimes veering towards an artistic activism of sorts (but its just 'entertainment' and simply pointing out issues will not magically make them go away). I wasn't sold on Rosamund Pike's performance until later in the film and it was nice to see a more raw and fanatical version of her than usual. This film's attitude and satire reminded me of films by Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), plus older films like Heathers (Michael Lehman) and Natural Born Killers (Oliver Stone). Gone Girl is ambitious in that it reaches for a wider audience in obvious and more subtle ways, infusing the 'law of reflection' to play with our minds (notably challenging our perception of who the antagonist is)- there are no 'winners', just human beings perceiving from their own experience (nicely balanced male and female point of view), resulting in a zero sum score. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide an appropriate and subtle soundtrack."

The story starts when Nick cheats on his wife and try to leave her as he was a total loser and when she finds this, she decides to punish him. By applying her superb planning, acting and killer instincts she finally makes him realize his mistake ""that you should never get in relationship with girls who have greater IQ than you, specially when she is insanely hot"" and then makes him live with her happily ever after. This movie gradually moves from suspense, romance, Thriller and at last horror and also this movie kind of reminds me of Shutter(Thailand) original one with the only difference that in shutter the guy has to live with his dead girlfriend on his head and in this, the guy has to live with his wife who is a living hell."

","It is difficult to tell a lot about the plot without spoiling it. The film features Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, with all other actors merely supporting, in a thrilling story about the private lives of people and the ugliness of the media trying to pry them open, but also mystery and crime.<br/><br/>Both Affleck and Pike played well, but it wasn't outside their usual roles and acting range. I felt that the film was a bit too long, it lasts for two hours and a half, but it did need more time in order to show all sides of the story. The problem appeared somewhere in the middle of the film, where it felt like someone wanted to finish it there, but others wanted it continued. The last hour and specifically the ending felt contrived and pushed too far for the sake of artificial drama.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I don't get where all the hype is coming from. I've seen similar stories and movies released for TV only. None of the qualities of the film are worth placing it above many other movies and I don't think it deserves the 8.6 IMDb grade. It's not a bad movie, but not a great one either and I find it difficult to recommend it to anyone."
"samarthan_mahaviran","4","1","4","4 January 2015"," Wafer-thin plot..
","Gone-baby is master movie-maker David Fincher's latest offering. It is an adaptation of a book of the same name where a supposedly happy family is shattered on the day of their 5th anniversary by the disappearance of the wife. The plot dwells on a search hunt for the missing person, character assassinations, mudslinging and ""reading between the lines"" by the media. <br/><br/>The premise is brilliant, the cast is perfect, the director is a genius, the trailer a real humdinger, but, the movie is a real let- down. I read somewhere that a movie with a bad script is unsalvageable and this film is a perfect example. The number of loopholes in the movie that are left untouched are astonishing and make a mockery of our intelligence. I have no clue how this movie is a hit and how the rating is this high in an intellectual e-society such as the IMDb.

","The idea of a wife disappearing and framing her husband for the murder really has a lot of potential. And the idea of the wife getting back to him after all that, even more. Unfortunately, this film didn't make the most of it, mainly because the plot is rattled with holes. Even if the police and the FBI agents were complete idiots, there are things that make the story extremely unconvincing. The diary didn't burn entirely. After the wife appears in the end, there are no signs of wounds that would have caused such excessive bleeding consistent with the marks in the kitchen. And I don't think people get released from the hospital all covered in blood. Amy's story in the end, when she talks to the police in the hospital makes absolutely no sense and it is really hard to believe the FBI agents accepted it just like that. These minor details all add up to make the movie seem entirely unrealistic and sloppy.<br/><br/>Overall, it was too long for what it has to offer. It could have been a suspenseful thriller with a double plot twist, if only the details were thought through more carefully."

","Gone Girl stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, as the weirdest couple I've seen. Ever. This movie is really good, I was very excited to see it, more so because it's in Fincher's ""area of expertise"", the suspense/murder genre, though it has some pretty hilarious parts. And the excitement paid off.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne, a regular guy who one day comes home to find that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. A big search begins, etc. and Nick sees himself under media scrutiny when people begin to think he might have murdered her. Other important characters are Desi Collings(Neil Patrick Harris) an ex-stalker of Amy's, who is still in love with her, he's like crazy obsessed with her, Tanner Bolt, Dunne's lawyer (Tyler Perry) and Margo Dunne, his sister (Carrie Coon). I thought the cast was absolutely amazing, really, everyone's acting is spot on, but special props to Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and Tyler Perry, those 3 were beyond amazing, hopefully no one else will think Affleck is a bad actor, because he was really good here, probably because he has been under media scrutiny for a good part of his life, and Tyler Perry, guy was incredible, I honestly didn't think he had it in him, due to all those Madea movies. And Pike, holy nuts, that woman, wow, Oscar contender, for sure. She just creeps you out, it's on some other s***.<br/><br/>The movie's script is great, every piece of dialogue makes sense and is in the right place, as the story unfolds it leaves you wanting to know more, everything that happens in the wake of Amy's disappearance is very intriguing, and that's pretty much what a movie like this needs to have, intrigue, but it has a lot more. Gillian Flynn managed to put in some nice humor, which felt in no way unnecessary or stuffed in, and it gives the movie a bigger entertainment factor. Another incredible thing in the movie is the soundtrack, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross did an amazing job, like they did in The Social Network, which has their music as well. The script and the soundtrack help each other grow as the film progresses, giving more depth to the story, along with the great directing by Fincher, every scene is complemented by the sound, the dialogue and the cinematography. <br/><br/>The story is truly very interesting and exciting. The ending though, really really bad. It made no sense to me, and was completely incoherent. Also, there were quite a few things that were not realistic at all, and a lot of the story didn't make sense. It's still very intriguing. Despite the crap ending, and a bunch of incoherent stuff, I hope this film gets a few Oscar nods, etc. because it's a good film and has some things worth nominating."

Fine acting, great background music by Trent Reznor, good photography, but a story that is so ridiculously exaggerated that I was waiting for the next twist so that I could witness how much more absurd the story could become, and there were several of them.

Next came a flash back of the drunk with his face between the legs of some slutty pickup whom I assume would be his future wife. Great choice, Buddy.<br/><br/>The scene was not erotic, only pathetic.

"ad_upclose","9","2","13","6 October 2014"," Fincher sticks close to his idiom and creates something exquisite & memorable.
","Gone Girl marks a kind of evolution in David Fincher's filmography. It's possibly his most provocative film along with Fight Club; one that will lead to the most conversation and filled with the most humor (the darker kind of course). It explores relationships and the media circus as well. Other than that you see what Fincher has delivered for most of his career; an engrossing, uneasy, and at times horrifying storyall making for an exceptional drama.<br/><br/>It starts off as a conventional missing-person story but midway the 'mystery' is uncovered; the story has way more up its sleeve. What follows is a deliciously twisted cat-and-mouse game between characters that are going to be amongst cinema's most memorable. There is an addictive brand of insanity which unravels in Gone Girl that's previously unseen in Fincher films.<br/><br/>An expectedly sinister mood hangs over the story which is substantially heightened by Trent Reznor's music which is largely understated but piercing in the right moments. Apart from that, the film is an exhibition of Fincher's expertise; adding layers of drama & texture leading to a climax that fulfills and even exceeds expectations.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck gets an excellent role and displays how effective he can be given the right character. But it is Rosamund Pike who steals the show. Her performance is a revelation of sorts; playing a character that is a mere presence initially but then takes command of the story and lures us in. The supporting cast is also notable and plays to the film's advantage in many stages; Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, and Tyler Perry excel in their parts.<br/><br/>Overall, Gone Girl is an outstanding exercise in characters taking charge despite the concept of mystery at its core. Fincher sticks close to his idiom and creates something exquisite & memorable."
"jamesissuperawesome","9","2","13","5 October 2014"," A perfect start to Oscar season.
","Gone Girl is directed by David Fincher and stars Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry among others. It's based on the 2012 hit novel by Gillian Flynn (who also wrote the screenplay for the film), and follows Nick Dunne, a man whose wife suspiciously goes missing on their fifth wedding anniversary. Going into the theater, my heart was racing with excitement, and I had no doubt in my mind that this would be another fantastic hit from Fincher.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is one of the best films of 2014 and an excellent start to Oscar season. This movie is intense, dramatic, but also refreshingly hilarious and mildly self referential and never takes itself too seriously. Affleck is great, but Rosamund Pike is a show stealer, and I predict an Oscar nom. Tyler Perry is perfect for his role, and I know this guy has talent, and should do more films like this. My only flaw lies within the acting and that is the character of Desi, played by Neil Patrick Harris. Was he bad? No, but I found it very hard to see him as anything but Neil Patrick Harris, with all his mannerisms and such.<br/><br/>Gone Girl has twists left right and centre, so I was never bored during the 145 minute runtime. The dark, creepy tone is achieved by beautiful cinematography (as expected from Fincher) and the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is still disturbing me as I write this, five days later, and I am certain it's their best score for a Fincher flick yet. By the time the end credits rolled, I was provoked to think hard about how media and press can effect one's life, and I felt like I was almost a little more socially informed. With the creepiness of Zodiac, lively screenplay of The Social Network, and twists and turns alike to Se7en, Gone Girl is a feast of Fincher goodness and I implore you to see it."

I was very engaged throughout the film... you don't really know who to feel sorry for.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed PRISONERS, with Hugh Jackman, you will enjoy this too (yes, both films are almost 3 hours long, so if you can't sit still, it's not for you); they're both equally gripping, but it is more shocking.<br/><br/>I felt some 50 Shades of Grey... There is nudity and sex in the film, so if you can't handle that, it's not for you. <br/><br/>I have not read the book or knew anything about the film, so everything was fresh to me... <br/><br/>Amazing performances and excellent casting. Rosamund Pike as AMY is perfect. Ben Affleck is good. Neil Patrick Harris... Wow, that was some interesting character... <br/><br/>People like these DO exist, and that is what makes it frightening... Not zombies or ghosts. <br/><br/>This movie blew me away. The story, performances, editing.... <br/><br/>This film proves amazing films can still be made today!!<br/><br/>This film is scary in a whole new level. It's definitely a movie that will leave an imprint on your brain and want to keep discussing about the film. <br/><br/>Highly recommended. It is a DARK film - it is a HEAVY thrill-ride experience.

","David Fincher's new mystery thriller Gone Girl shares many identities. The way it brims with cultural ideas characterises it as a social critique, while the elaborate structure of the narrative deconstructs and subverts the murder genre it purports to be upholding. The same ambitions strengthening Gillian Flynn's screenplay, adapting her own novel, crafts a very long and complex film, which is uneven in the way it displays brilliance but also some stretches of tedium. An early surprise in the film is how reservedly Fincher approaches the genre. He rarely moves the camera, focussing strictly on the actors under the dim and minimal lighting. The pacing of the film is also extremely leisurely, particularly as multiple endings prolong the film's duration. The understated approach commits the film and Fincher's admiration for genre filmmaking. Yet as a filmmaker appreciative of the brooding, bleak corridors of crime stories like Se7en and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Fincher is not reputable for his funny side. The first major risk of Gone Girl is stretching outside the genre conventions, reaching for satirical targets and humour, painting the media as caricatures, which tonally jars with the seriousness of the story. After all, this is a morbid portrayal of a corroding marriage between Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) who were once in love but lost their jobs and their money in the economic downturn and became angrier with each other's shortcomings. Their relationship is shown through two threads: Nick's interrogation by the police as he helps them follow clues Amy has left for him after her disappearance and flashbacks to the start of their relationship, narrated through Amy's diary.<br/><br/>As a satire on news and media scrutiny, Gone Girl isn't new or insightful but adds media and truth to a laundry list of large topics it wants to explore. The film doesn't flinch in blaming talk shows for manipulating news stories without facts and addresses hysteria by including a television show host as part of the film's slightly jarring comic relief. These targets contribute to the cleverest aspect of the film, unearthing the script's postmodern meta structure, showcasing an exercise in craftsmanship, with story beats themselves encompassing notions of truth and lies. The film's two major threads appear to be separate timelines but the information conveyed in one alters the other, aiming to shifting our allegiances towards Nick and against him about whether he killed his wife. At first we confidently know Nick did not kill Amy, but learn he was aggressive to her in their past and she grew increasingly fearful of him. Character in this film isn't merely revealed, it is exposed. Another fine use for the theme of manipulation is the way the film subverts existing film genres, growing into a mystery seemingly without a body, a clear killer or villain, and the clues have unusually been left by the victim herself. I won't reveal what emerges in the second half of the film but the way this film twists and turns and subverts the murder genre is both imaginative and absurd. Some twists are so elaborate and overly calculated, revealed through Saw-esque montages, you can kiss credibility goodbye.<br/><br/>The way Gone Girl continually stays a step ahead of its audience, adding new dimensions to characters we thought we knew, deserves praise for continually blindsiding us. There are also some highly suspenseful scenes in the second half which do not always unfold as we might expect, with the fates of the characters constantly twisting. Adding to the film's bizarre pastiche of ideas is the humour, finally landing in the last quarter of the film. The darkly comic absurdism targets marriage itself as a crazy bond between two people who can't stand each other but will do almost anything to remain together. Some of this I found hilarious as it satirises American life in the suburbs and celebrity. The performances are generally good, particularly the different layers Rosamund Pike brings to her character, including an atmospheric voice actor. But Ben Affleck while predictably stern, does not seem overly stretched, lacking intensity in the first portion. Neil Patrick Harris has a small but pivotal role though as a seemingly creepy ex-boyfriend, still obsessed with Amy. There is an implied, understated menace in his acting, which is extremely haunting and another welcome surprise. Qualities like his performance are difficult to explain in detail given the intense delicacy of not spoiling the film. The film is about a failing marriage and likewise it is the relationship between subverting the genre and not always being happy with what we discover under the surface. The film is a deceitful, lying partner, who can tell a good yarn and while we're not ready to believe all of it, we hang on for the ride anyway."
"GeorgeRoots","10","2","14","7 October 2014"," David Fincher Firing On All Cylinders.
","With a director like David Fincher, you can expect a few things. The man has a speciality for creating extremely effective thrillers, and he's also very good at adapting and being faithful to source material such as 2011's ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"". ""Gone Girl"" is a best-selling novel from 2012, written by Gillian Flynn (Who also wrote the screenplay, and stated that it deviates from the novel). I can confidently say it has been a long time since I've gone to the theatre and been captivated by an entire movie. Sure there has been some stellar pictures out this year, but to actually sit down and be absorbed into a 2 hour 30 minute film and want more from it by the end is very impressive (Considering a majority of the year's biggest movies appear during awards season).<br/><br/>Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) seem to be the ideal couple. From humble beginnings to a whirlwind engagement, at face value no one could doubt how flawless a couple they seem. Eventually on the day of their fifth anniversary, Amy goes missing. Nick calls the police who do their duty, yet after studying the apparent home invasion remain suspicious. Her disappearance creates a media frenzy turned witch-hunt, and Nick's behaviour and surfacing lies surrounding the marriage are interpreted by the media and public as characteristics of a sociopath. Did Nick kill his wife? And just where is Amy?<br/><br/>Two words easily sum up ""Gone Girl"" for me, Riveting and Haunting. American suburbia is turned upside down, and the many clues left behind for Nick become more engrossing as he remains one-step ahead of the everyone. Nick and Amy are the kind of characters that will jettison an actor into a household name. Ben Affleck continues to do extremely solid work these past couple of years, and with that said this is easily Rosamund Pike's finest hour and if there's any justice she is easily going to win acclaim for her performance. It's good to see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry leave comedy behind once in a while, because if this is the result then I was also wonderfully engrossed. Finally Kim Dickens, Missi Pyle and the screen debut of Carrie Coon complete this casting jigsaw puzzle. David Fincher always gets the most out of his cast (According to producer Ceán Chaffin, Fincher took on average as many as 50 takes for each scene), and everyone just feels natural.<br/><br/>What is left to say is that the music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastic, and Fincher's camera work is as sublime as ever. Shadows and light help blur how events unfold, many shots look good enough to go on a postcard and the way how your support and opinion of a character can change as the movie progresses baffles me how they pulled it off this well. Even though the finale may be a big turnoff for some people, it ends ambiguously enough to never set the future in stone and doesn't betray such an impressive atmosphere the film has continuously grown from the beginning.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: I really liked it, and I don't how I could make that fact more clearer. Gillian Flynn does justice to her work, and the result is probably one of 2014's best thrillers AND could possibly be my favourite film of the year so far. It's always great to see a David Fincher movie be so familiar and so well crafted to the level we've come to expect from him. 10/10."

","Don't it always seem to be that you don't know what you've got till David Fincher has taken the subject and transformed it into something so much greater than you could have ever envisioned? No? well that's just what happened with Gone Girl.<br/><br/>Kidnapping movies, and missing persons films are rare, I mean real ones, not like Taken but real old school kidnapping thrillers are rare, and that's because it's hard to write a film people haven't seen before, they are too formulaic even for Hollywood; women is kidnapped, man either pays ransom or not, done. So why has Fincher gone out of a limb and made a thriller kidnapping/murder mystery? David Fincher is a director who you always have doubts about, you don't mean to, but you do. You start to watch the trailers for his movies and see the promotional work and you let yourself look forward to it, then there is a moment when you wonder if it actually will be as good as you want it to be, and that's where it starts; doubt. I was wrong to doubt Fincher, he is much a master of cinema as Spielberg or Nolan.<br/><br/>In Gone Girl David has given us a unique gift that won't be soon forgotten, he has made a compelling and unexpected thriller that holds us in the palm of it's hand for the full (close to) 3 hour run time.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is the only film this year that I would call ""addictive"" because on you start watching, you can't stop, not until the final credit passes you by. The film is pumped with so much adrenaline that you dare not look away in case something crucial happens in the seconds where you blinked. Here is a movie that is confident in it's won abilities and that's a plus.<br/><br/>With David Fincher directing you always knew the film would have a level of confidence to it, and once the cast was announced the matter was settled, Gone Girl was going to be a movie to watch out for, and it didn't disappoint. The interesting thing about Gone Girl is that looking at it now I can't imagine a single combination of actors or directors that I would have improved the movie, everyone is set in their perfect position.<br/><br/>You know a lot of people laugh at Ben Affleck but for the life of me I can't think why, he is a talented actor who has brought out a wide variety of roles much like his counterpart Matt Damon, both are established men who's body of work speaks for itself but yet still people laugh. They won't be laughing at the end of Gone Girl, because in this film Affleck truly found his inner demon. Because the key to the movies success is that Nick Dunn is not a likable man and is surrounded by other unlikable people, but all of them accept his wife. Amy is perfect in every way.<br/><br/>Rosemond Pike portrays Amy in what could be a career defining performance, I think in truth Gone Girl is much like Vertigo, it is a film that redefines what our previous conceptions where of actors, Fincher uses our own prejudgements against us. It is so beautiful.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a sophisticated thriller that keeps you guessing right up until the final climax, David Fincher is the new Hitchcock, and this is the movie that proved it."

With so much dreck being wheeled out - we got stuck with a couple of turkeys in as many weeks - it is a delight to be in an audience that leaves an auditorium where they have been greatly entertained.<br/><br/>A first class thriller which has you talking about it hours after viewing.

","Do you agree? <br/><br/>My review: <br/><br/>For the most part, critics have been good with their ratings this year with a few exceptions. However, this is not one of those cases. I don't get the critics sometimes. Giving ridiculous movies like Maze Runner, Lucy, etc., good reviews is mortally wrong. They gave this a 59%, barely rotten, but should be higher. It's not Antoine's best work but it surely dishes out a blood justice good time. It's bloody, violet, meaningful (whatever rotten), and shouldn't br taken too seriously. This isn't as masterpiece or Denzel's best work, but it's clearly should be fresh. If you're going into this movie thinking it's going to be nothing but a fun movie, then you're setting yourself up for a bad time. It has its smart moments, but it's basicaly the rated R version of taken, which I loved. Overall I loved this movie, not for the smart and master piece of a movie, but for the violet and action packed movie. 8.5/10"

","David Fincher is a master craftsmen when it comes to the thriller genre. As a lover of the novel, I have to say the movie not only stays true to it's material, but also enhances the mood. Through his lighting and shadow techniques, he shows inner turmoil and degradation. Fincher cuts through scenes like a butcher, but the beautiful cinematography makes the cuts precise. His yellow-sepia to black and white contrasts are breathtaking. Without any dialogue, you could follow the film completely by color and lighting alone. But the film doesn't stop there. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create, ""creepy elevator music"", that eats at you and makes you cringe at every scene like ""nine inch nails"" on a chalkboard. The acting is also superb. Rosamund Pike delivers a performance that will be talked about and analyzed for years to come. She could start a whole new outlook on female roles forever. Affleck has never been better, and is the perfect casting choice for the ""average"" guy. Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris, and Carrie Coon are possibly the best supporting cast I've witnessed yet in a modern thriller. Overall, this movie has a lot of hype and a lot of pressure forced upon itself, and it delivers on all it's promises. It also makes you think twice before getting married."

","Gone Girl is a future classic. Gone Girl will become another Citizen Kane and or Raiders of the lost Ark. All of Gone Girl's characters are believable. Director Fincher creates a narrative of empathy, understanding and dread for the missing woman. Gone Girl's writer brilliantly plays on the viewer's assumptions, and creates a sub story where the media, and public can be fooled by an intelligent, ruthless, vengeful sociopath. The only people who were not fooled was the lowly poor white Southerners, who figured out a con compared to the rich suburbanites; another sub-story about assumptions. The director, and story writer weave together a brilliant/shocking ending, which makes Gone Girl a movie classic. I personally love a story/film where after each scene the viewer is left wanting more! I give Gone Girl a ten out ten."

","Nick (Ben Affleck) comes home to find that wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has disappeared and there are signs of a struggle. Or so he tells police. As events unfold in real time and flashback, we discover that there is more to this than meets the eye, that Nick has been less than Frank, and that it begins to look increasingly as if Amy is no longer alive as Nick's trial by media begins.<br/><br/>That synopsis gives you what you get in the trailer (and this movie has been particularly heavily trailed). It is fair to say that the trailer teases but does not spoil, and that is my attitude too, because this film does not deserve to be spoiled. After the first 40 minutes or so it goes in some directions which, for me, were completely unexpected, and I loved being confounded by a film which had appeared superficially to be a routine murder/disappearance movie. It is not, and this film gives us one of the most memorable movie monsters (in a non-horror sense) for many years.<br/><br/>The story unwinds at some leisure – the film is two and a half hours long – with a number of intertwined strands (the disappearance, what lies behind it, the police investigation, the role of the media, the relationship between Nick and his sister, to name but several). All the players are excellent, but Affleck is first rate, and Pike shows astonishing range and delectable buttocks. I'm not sure which I liked more.<br/><br/>This film is thoroughly recommended."

Her skill with dialogue, though, is excellent.<br/><br/>The story has so many genre echoes (SUSPICION [1941], MARNIE, FATAL ATTRACTION, BASIC INSTINCT etc etc) that in spite of the plot's twists and turns it still feels as if it's treading old ground. The pace is often unhelpfully leisurely, whilst the last fifteen minutes feel over-compressed, as if all concerned wanted to make an even longer film but realised the thriller element would suffer if any extra length was added.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher (SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB, ZODIAC), known for his dim, dark, moody shots, treads a line between style and stylistic tic. Personally I thought the look of the movie was needlessly indistinct.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck ambles pleasantly through another of his Ordinary Guy roles. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry offer competent support. But the film really belongs to three excellent women who shine in a trio of succulent roles: Carrie Coon as Mr Affleck's twin sister, Kim Dickens as a smart detective, and Rosamund Pike as the wife with hidden depths.<br/><br/>In truth Ms Pike's bravura performance is the main reason to see GONE GIRL.

","'Gone Girl' is the big-screen version of Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name, and I must say, justice was done here:)<br/><br/>1. The mystery begins with the untimely disappearance of Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike), and the looming assumption that she was murdered by her estranged husband Nick (Ben Affleck). The first hour is basically the mystery and investigation of Nick on whether of not he actually murdered his wife or was she coincidentally kidnapped. Affleck plays the role well, where he keeps you guessing and scratching your head wondering if he's guilty or not. His misleading and painted smile, as well as his calm demeanor throughout, leaves everyone a bit skeptical about Nick. I know critics have a devious hard-on for Ben Affleck's acting, but it would be a lie if I said this role didn't suite him.<br/><br/>2. With the help of (the surprisingly entertaining Tyler Perry) high-powered lawyer/investigator Tanner Bolt, along with his devoted twin sister Margo (Connie Coon), Nick discovers that Amy is actually alive and devised a psychotic plan for revenge which included staging her own murder. Rosamund Pike is quite a twisted f#ck as Amy, plain and simple. Things soon turn into a game of 'Cat & Mouse' when Amy eventually realizes that Nick has become aware of her plan. Enter....Neil Patrick Harris, as Desi Collings, an ex-boyfriend and sociopath, fixated on Amy. Harris portrays his character with the persona of a boarder-line psychotic who's in love with Amy, however, he ends up being a pawn in Amy's deadly game.<br/><br/>3. There is a pretty hot but ultimately disturbing sex scene between Amy and Desi during the last third of the film. Amy slashes Desi's throat where he inevitably bleeds to death while having sex so that Amy can stage a rape scenario in which she can portray the victim. The cinematography is awesome, especially when capturing the more thrilling and intense scenes. The entire tone of the movie has the similar feel of the dark mystery it initially sets up. My only complaint however...is the conclusion. Amy returns home which proves Nick's innocence to the Press, but she still schemes her way back by inseminating herself with Nick's sperm, ensuring that he can't leave her. Justice (literally) isn't done here.<br/><br/>David Fincher outdoes himself here giving audiences a thrilling film in the same vein as his previous one; 'Fight Club & Se7en' especially.

Fincher's entire body of work, which also includes Fight Club and Se7en, is punctuated with moments of physical and emotional violence used to contrast cultural mores.

","A lot of people mistake the troubled act of Amy Dunne for an extraordinary and authentic payback. The decisions she made and the follow-up when plan A didn't succeed was something more than impulsive decision making. It is not Nick Dunne who 'changed' her or incited the troubles into her reality. He is merely a small detail in her transition from the 'All American Girl' to a complete psychopath. <br/><br/>First of all: Ben Affleck is Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike is Amy Dunne. They strive to become a couple they don't want to end up as, but fail as Amy caught Nick red-handed with a younger woman, specifically, his student Andie. Over a year Amy endures the knowledge, while making time worthy by planning a disappearance of the most outrageous kind. <br/><br/>She stages the crime scene; accurately, fakes a pregnancy, drain herself of about half a quart of blood, befriends her not so bright neighbor and writes over three hundred diary entries. I don't feel as if it's something anybody could do, or even think of it, it's surreal to the verge of becoming comedic. So, she goes through all of that to revenge him. She even wants him dead. It's rather an immoral view on how to react to marital infidelity than an ingenious plan. Her determination is clear but her motive is just utterly extravagant. <br/><br/>And the story continues with the questions of her whereabouts and who killed/abducted her, until we meet her perspective. We finally get a grip of what's going on and we start to admire her. ""Oh yes, give it to him Amy! He cheated on you he deserves to die in prison!"" Because who does all of that for a husband who forced her to become 'one of those couples'?<br/><br/>Amazing Amy. <br/><br/>As you think the story caught the end, Amy Dunne ticks the last box off to be confirmed as the complete psychopath. She murders Desi Collins, the ex-boyfriend, easy manipulated, clueless, rich and spoiled but also troubled human as she vigorously slices his neck off. During a, also staged, intercourse. <br/><br/>She returns to her cheating husband, because she has killed a man in cold blood and is going blank on eventual misdeeds. She's in need of the attention. Allegedly raped and tied by her wrist yet she managed to hide the box knife under the pillow, get loose and cut his neck. All the drama for: the media circus, an even greater hatred from Nick towards herself and an indigenous payback. <br/><br/>It only confirms that the problems lie in Amy Dunne and Nick Dunne is an asshole for not dealing with the troubles when they occurred and instead saw the escape in his student. <br/><br/>Second of all: Gone Girl is the typical victim of a sloppy and inaccurate screenplay. Noticeable and annoying mistakes, such as the fact that Nick Dunne took a stroll down Sawyer Beach, but was only seen at The Bar after he took the trash out. We don't know for fact as we didn't see it. The fact that any hospital would never release a patient who's covered in blood, and wearing scrubs. Amy Dunne staged the scene with ounces of blood yet there was no injury indicating the wound as she was fully examined when she returned to the hospital in Missouri. A wound that would be visible to her head as she was bashed with the wooden stick that was later discovered by the police. And to lose so much blood would only make her weak, not ambitious about her leave, but we see her all smiley and energetic as she drives her car. Several slips from the usually precise director. A vision that surely didn't reach out to perfectionists such as myself. However, he did manage to make it an exciting and absorbing watch, adding the soundtrack and lights to press the tension in every scene. Without the second to last climax when Desi Collins takes the blame, it wouldn't be as fcked up. And that fcked up feeling is what's worth watching. <br/><br/>Charlize Theron and Natalie Portman were considered for the role ahead of Rosamund Pike, but both declined. I wouldn't want to see either of them as Amy Dunne, as they would've lifted the movie to become a better one than it deserves. Rosamund Pike was nominated for an Academy Award at the 2015 Oscars for her performance, but was outrun by Julianne Moore for 'Still Alice'. Fairly without doubt, Moore captured the audience on another level. The acting from Rosamund Pike is dull but consistent with its long-winded and exact expressions of contempt, indifference and false smiles which covered her outlook as the story unfolded. You don't particularly feel the pleasure of her success. If she doesn't, how could you?"

","I went to see this film with a group of friends and just... Jesus Christ. This was the first movie in which I was legitimately squirming in my seat as I was watching it. Seeing Gone Girl for the first time was when I truly understood the concept of 'sitting on the edge of your seat'. While the movie starts off kind of slow it soon picks up. And when it picks up... you'll be in for a hell of a ride. It soon ends up taking you to a place you wouldn't think it would. The advertising for this film don't really do it justice. While it may first come across as just a typical chick-flick drama--believe me. It is SO much more than that. This film is truly amazing and made me realize that I admire David Fincher as a director.

","To quote Abraham from the walking dead... ""loose ends make my a.. itch."" and this movie is no exception. To execute a perfect double jeopardy (flashback to the movie from yesterdecade) one would have to make sure that story and all the nuances are tied together. First there has to be a way to collaborate the plot line, then producers have to cross the t's and dot the i's. <br/><br/>If you look at a movie such as Predestination you will be met with inevitability of major plot holes that could not be left alone and so producers of that movie watched the cuts to and from until they got it right. <br/><br/>Gone girl... well there is a lot of gone and a lot of girl but girl is surely not gone. Gone is my patience when movie came to a screeching halt. <br/><br/>Beginning of the movie seemed slightly out of place. Here comes a scruffy looking guy standing over by the trash cans. Problem is that trashcans were not at the end of his driveway where they normally would be. No... they were up a 45 degree slope, over the 3ft stone wall conveniently placed in such a way to make a sweeping shot of the actor moving from starting position to his house. I should have known it then... that producers were not being careful. <br/><br/>And so they have this nearly perfectly executed story line until about 1 hour and 20 minutes into the movie, at which point it all turns sideways. They should have stopped then but no siree bob... they wanted to tell the other side of the story. And so they had this intelligent woman with a certain attention to detail befriend some questionable characters and her entire master plan falls through like a house of cards. And then we boomerang back to some filthy rich guy that comes back into her life and she turns from a mastermind into a murderer. Rest of the story just does not make sense. <br/><br/>And bear with me folks. It does not make sense because producers looked at the length of the movie and figured that they were already 2 hours into it... and figured they could wing it. Entire story of her return and supposed loose ends just did not tie into cleverness of the movie at all and the FBI and police just stood back like a bunch of buffoons acting like a clueless bobblehead even if story appeared even more ridiculous than the story of her murder. <br/><br/>To start off there were no injuries on her that would rectify the whole being hit with a blunt object to bleed profusely all over the kitchen. Then... who err... has a credit line of 117,000 smackaroos, especially if they are both unemployed and out of money? All the gifts were conveniently stacked in one place in a barn and knowing of the gifts neither husband nor the sister did anything to remove them from said barn even with ample amount of time. And then there is an issue of money. Completely broke... husband ""hired"" the lawyer who chargers ridiculous fees. And then there is a wife who is estranged and got what she wanted... a whole bloody mansion all to herself and a man that would worship her at her feet... but no she manufactures this thing about being continuously assaulted, even though it would appear in footage only once and I mean I can be at it all day... you know like saying that there was no evidence of hot stud muffing driving his car to her house or anything tying house murder scene to him but well.. the guy is dead... killed by a box cutter by a woman who was supposedly starved and tied up entire time. <br/><br/>If they had an alternative ending... that is to say they scrubbed a whole half an hour from the tail of the movie and gave it some good Agatha christy twist... this movie would have been a very respectable 8/10... instead I am giving it a 6 but really wanting to give it a 4 for sloppy writing."

Its like the movie shook hands with the devil. An innocent soul murdered having no justice. Even in the end. Plus that woman Amy. She was so gorgeous in the beginning but began to annoy me later as hell would annoy heaven. Yeah. She was supposed to be the bad girl. But she was cast so horrible. Her character was later disgusting I actually wished he killed her. This movie went all good and seemed so promising until it revealed to have no justice.

The casting was good The cinematography was good Editing and VFX were up to par But it just lacked a story, There are many plot holes and it just didn't work. Usually you see good things coming from these people but they just didn't do it this time. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing. When I watch films I want to be inspired, excited, moved. But I just didn't feel anything for this.<br/><br/>I did like the camera work, hats off to that, they pulled of some good shots. The look and feel of the camera movement was really good, it didn't feel like most other films were they are getting shots that just are too far pushed. Sound could have been better, Im not sure if it was the cinema that i was in but it felt like it was stereo (not surround).<br/><br/>The ending was a bit naff as well, I think that the script should have been reworked a bit more before being shot (no spoilers) but it was a bit too convenient the ending, like everything just magically fell into place."

","People who likes this movie only watch TV-series and expect that everything should be told in that manner. I suspect that especially girls/women rate this movie very high, because they see everything from a perspective of TV-series. But don't be fooled, this movie is stupid, unbelievable, full of plot holes and way to long. Gone Girl is trying very hard to be like the overrated Prisoners (2013 in the way the story is told and the way it looks. I hate this ""new"" slow quasi absurd way to tell stories; portrayed as real/believable and at the same time totally unreal/unbelievable. This is a hopeless and a boring ""new"" trend in Hollywood at the moment. Even though I thought Nightcrawler (2014) was an okay movie it follows the same boring concept. In my book either you try to tell a believable ""real"" story or a fictional story. You cannot be both, it is simply impossible. This is no new trend, Tarantino and others have use this method of telling stories for a long time. So don't be fooled by the good reviews, this movie stinks on almost all levels."

Neil Patrick Harris' character moments when he brought Amy to his house should have been the killing point to Amy (what I mean is that she should end right there), but okay. Amy is an intelligent psycho and manages to trick through.<br/><br/>With all the damn flaws in this movie half-way until the end, I will accept it. If the ending, where Nick should have told the entire truth, literally banged Amy's face at the last interview in their house and flip-flopped everything and got her arrested; I would have been so damn satisfied with the movie.<br/><br/>But no, what they do instead is bring it to such a bad ending. Seriously, scat off with such freaking movies, complete time-waste. Producers should really have a thought of what people want. This movie would have received a much more positive feedback & reviews if only the movie's ending was good (Amy gets arrested, her parents move on, screw her parents, the detective kind of like Nick; Nick's sister is happy and opens the bar again; like whatever good ending would have worked honestly)."

","From the the beginning the plot is incredibly predictable. Anyone who has ever seen Double Jeopardy can guess that the wife isn't dead and that she is framing Affleck. Yet, it takes over an hour for the film to confess this fact, even though everyone already knows. <br/><br/>Then, after meeting back up with the wife who is supposed to be dead, the film walks us through her ""masterful"" scheme. which is foiled by getting her cash stolen. Which could have been avoided. you would think that someone capable of all the other preparation would have been able to avoid being robbed by two ""junkie"" looking folks. The robbers can spot that the wife doesn't respond to her fake name and the robbers spot the wife's fake glasses but seem incapable of recognizing her from television even though she looks practically the same. Dumb Dumb Dumb. <br/><br/>Anyway then Neil Patrick Harris kidnaps the wife when she goes to him for help. she murders him and escapes returning home to her husband who for whatever reason doesn't just start screaming about her lies and trying to get her thrown in prison. To this point you still see everything coming. predictable predictable.<br/><br/>No man would have slept in that house with that woman. and then just when you think you're going to get the smallest amount of satisfaction from this story by fleck inflicting some sort of clever revenge on her , the story takes its first unpredictable turn which is fleck deciding to stay with his wife who framed him for murder and then became a murderer herself just because shes a few weeks pregnant. Get a divorce. let her have the baby in prison and then take it. is this some sort of republican wet dream about the sanctity of marriage and pregnancy? <br/><br/>The silly life lesson would be: Even if your wife frames you for her own murder, murders someone else, shows back up at your house, and then behind your back uses your frozen sperm to get herself pregnant, you should stay with your wife and not abort that baby. <br/><br/>The whole movie was just so stupid. nobody could be that angry and that forgiving at the same time.

I had my expectations and even having seen the trailer, I was surprised by quite a few things that happened in it.<br/><br/>Performance wise you get more than great work. Ben Affleck might have gotten a lot of backlash, because he got cast as Batman (his Daredevil stint might have to do a bit with that and his Gigli movie), but he's showing here that he can act. The movie also shows us depths of human behavior we wish didn't exist, but we know they do. This really does go out there, with (some) nudity and violence, so it's not for the squeamish.

","If many movie goers considered Left Behind that starred Nicholas Cage up for the race the worst movie of the year in 2014,then Gone Girl definitely one up for best movie during that same year.Based on Gillian Flynn's novel of the same title and the same screenwriter of the film,David Finch provides us another seemingly effortless directorial effort in this complex and complicated crime thriller which seemingly is disguised as a dark comedy despite the fact that the comedic scenes are far from being overt and obvious. <br/><br/>Gone Girl features Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike together with Neil Patrick Harris,Carrie Coon,Kim Dickens, Missi Pyle and Tyler Perry.Set in Missouri,it tells the story of a Nicholas Dunne and the events that goes on after her wife has gone missing on their 5th wedding anniversary.It was a critically acclaimed film and a commercially successful movie that made $368 million at the box office.Pike got an Oscar nomination playing the wife,Amy Dunne.Also,it comprises thematic elements such as unreliable narratives from different characters like Nick and Amy;our media culture especially when it defines what it means to be ""popular"" and ""guilty""; and the detective storyline that provides surprising twists and turns that maybe classified as similar to films made by Alfred Hitchcock.Added to that,it also provides a theme of manipulation wherein different characters manipulate each other and how the media manipulate the public by providing a public broadcast on how people should view public personalities involved in the news.<br/><br/>The main story as I have stated earlier is about the disappearance of Amy and the events that happen.There are two segments initially told in parallel in the first half of the film.One segment provides a narrative wherein Nick becomes worried after learning that her wife is missing and the events that ensues.The other segment is the narrative provided by Amy in the entries of her diary which updates us from the time she and Nick first meet together until the problems of their marriage arise when they transferred from New York to Missouri when they both lost their job.Then things become exciting and unsettling on the third narrative wherein the truth is revealed wherein Amy is apparently not killed and has decided to frame her husband for the unhappiness and unfaithfulness he brought her into their marriage. We get to see different media personalities.We get to see some resolution to the some of the events that happen.Finally,we get to see both Amy and Nick brought back together under one roof.Many viewers felt disappointed that it never offered a clear resolution and conclusion at the end.But it only made it what it was supposed to be: unsettling.Just like most of the events that happened in the story.<br/><br/>The performances were definitely good.That includes Ben Affleck.Although he will always be an average actor to me in my opinion,he definitely did not good work as the average and weak husband,Nick.Rosamund Pike was obviously outstanding as Amy as she convincingly played the smart wife,Amy.Special mention should also be given to Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens as Nick's sister,Margo and Detective Rhonda Boney respectively.<br/><br/>As a crime thriller,this definitely does not follow the same trend of many movies of the same genre of that being predictable and by- the-numbers.It may have delivered what is supposed to be expected somewhat early that probably affected the progression of the story.But nevertheless,it still managed to provide joy and entertainment as it was creative,imaginative and inventive in its latter parts especially with the surprisingly unrealistic actions of the characters involved and the unexpected decisions that they later make towards the end.<br/><br/>To conclude my review,watching this movie will definitely provide tons of satisfaction to the viewer."

","Apparently I missed all the hype surrounding this movie. I came into it half-blind and was just expecting a decent mystery thriller. What I got was a classic film that kept me interested all the way through to the end.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is clearly in the prime of his career and played the role of Nick perfectly. All of the supporting cast and co-star Rosamund Pike do amazing jobs with their characters as well. Trent Reznor's score is also a masterpiece as usual. All around the production is superb.<br/><br/>The plot is also intriguing and takes a new approach to a well-traveled genre. Even when predictable at times, the twists aren't made the focus. There are no ""a-ha"" moments, just ""oh sh*t"". The movie switches from mystery to thriller to psychological horror seamlessly, intertwined with elements of dark comedy. My main criticisms are really just two things; The abrupt ending which left me feeling hanging, but is forgivable since it makes for a solid horror element. And the character of Amy turning from passably human to glaring sociopath immediately following her reveal as a manipulative psychopath (despite speaking several times in front of an apparently detailingly observant and critical public).<br/><br/>I've read through several of the low score reviews on this site and it seems that most people who didn't like this movie because of the (supposed) plot holes simply weren't paying attention. Almost everything can be explained by a few key points:<br/><br/>1) Amy, while not being perfect in her methods, was very meticulous in her planning. She got Nick to take a walk on the beach alone in order for him to have no alibi for the time of her disappearance, and was very good at predicting the behavior of other people, as good sociopaths do. Nothing was done on a whim until she makes her first mistake and has to resort to desperate measures.<br/><br/>2) Amy was much more poetic in her plot than she was careful, and the police (particularly Rhonda) were always suspicious of the convenient evidence. Ultimately, the police only reacted on the solid evidence they had, and put the loose ends on the back burner. Then before they could really address them, the investigation quickly became outside of their control. Once Amy decidedly returned, she eliminated the suspicion of foul play on the part of Nick and everyone called it case closed. The loose ends didn't really have to be explained, and Amy just handwaved everyone with the tragedy of her kidnapping. (Side note: Amy saw her whole life as a fictional story, since her mother wrote her as one starting as a little child. She chased her fictional counterpart almost to the letter, and in adulthood decided to write her own story which she creates for the public. Her handwave is a commentary on the acceptance of the reader's suspension of disbelief.)<br/><br/>3) The press were camping outside of Nick's and Margo's houses. While Nick could occasionally sneak out on his own, this would have made it impossible to move all the ""gifts"" in the shed without anybody noticing.<br/><br/>4) None of the cameras at the lake house were pointed indoors, they were all security cameras watching potential points of entry. Amy knew this because she could see all of the cameras. This made it perfectly convenient for her to play it up for the cameras by scuffing up NPH's character and faking her rape. Her explanations for all of this is a bit farcical, and make up some of the dark comedy of the movie, but is not horribly outside the realm of possibility.<br/><br/>While I'm sure there are some legitimate plot holes, they were hidden well enough that it did not break the suspension of disbelief (at least for me). And for a genre almost comically characterized by ridiculous plot holes (see: basically every movie from the 90's) they did an extremely good job at covering these up. I employ those who had issues with the plot to go and watch the movie again and pay attention to the all-important details."

Five years after originally meeting, Nick comes home to see that his wife disappeared. From here on out the media begins to blame Nick for the disappearance.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, everyone on screen feels well placed, however I don't think Neil Patrick Harris was the best choice for his character, he is by far the weakest point of the movie, although Tyler Perry is great, absolutely amazing choice. The cinematography is wonderful, you've come to expect that from a Fincher film, the score does justice to the experience.

The mood is somewhat eerie, thanks to the directing, cinematography, and music. Then, the answer to the mystery is revealed and it all goes downhill from there. It spikes slightly after a bit, but then the last 20 minutes or so are so bafflingly stupid, embarrassingly idiotic, and difficult to watch... like Lifetime movie psychotic. None of the characters are likable. None of the characters are intelligent. I cannot think of a single movie with more plot holes. I will not list any of them so as not to spoil the film for those of you brave enough to watch it, and also because so many previous reviewers have eloquently laid them out. <br/><br/>I am not going to give this movie a 1, because I can't say there were no positives. It looked nice throughout. Ben Affleck's performance was solid. Rosamund Pike definitely did not deserve an Oscar nomination. I enjoyed the scene involving a box-cutter, because I am a sick and morbid f*@k. The beginning of the film was enjoyable enough... but that's about it. So I gave it a 5.

Not as good as I'd hoped, but still worth watching thanks to some tour de force acting from its strong cast."
"brizosdream","8","1","5","30 December 2014"," Good Movie with a Bad Ending
","Gone Girl was for the most part an interesting mystery wrapped around the personality of a disgruntled wife, who goes out for revenge after learning her husband is having an affair. The story line has many twists. First you meet a loving couple who you think have the perfect marriage, only to learn that underneath all this is a very dysfunctional couple. The shocking part comes when you learn just how psychotic the wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) is. Her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) is no saint. He has an affair, doesn't want children and moves his wife from Manhattan to Missouri to take care of his ailing mother without asking her. He loses job and veggies-out playing video games, uses her money to fund their lifestyle and his business failures. However, even with all of this it is Amy that really shocks us with her duplicity and just how far she's willing to go to get revenge against those she feels betrayed her. <br/><br/>Rosamund Pike does a great job displaying this duplicity. She's another one of those great UK actresses that can carry off both sides of Amy's personality and have it be believable. Ben Affleck does a decent job playing the shocked and duplicitous husband as well. Neil Harris kept the suspense going, not knowing why he was after Amy, and in the end paying for his obsession with her. I thought Tyler Perry did a great job as Nick's lawyer. <br/><br/>If I had a problem with this film it was with the script. The ending was pretty stupid. After all that goes on with Amy and Nick, even after he realizes just how psychotic she is; knowing that she is a murder and knowing she tried to have him killed as well for her phony murder, he decides to stay with her? Really? Not very believable in my opinion. <br/><br/>It's a shame the ending was so bad for most of the film was pretty good. As I'm always reminded good actors can only do so much, the script and directors really can make or break a story. A much more believable ending would have been to have the police detective who was pushing the case to find evidence that Amy was really culpable for the whole set up. She deserved justice for her actions and never received it."
"Maya_Jackman","8","1","5","24 December 2014"," What a great thriller!!!
","We watched this movie last night and I really enjoyed it. It was suspenseful and kept us engaged the entire time. There are a few flaws in the plot that would never happen in real life (specifically regarding crime investigation procedures), but this is fiction and I find that it is rare for crime thrillers to not have such flaws. The challenge for film makers is to know which types of flaws are forgivable by the audience. I can forgive flaws as long as they are not so fundamental that they interfere with the flow of the main storyline. I thought this movie was really well casted and well directed. Great thriller in my opinion!"
"smoke0","Null","1","5","15 October 2014"," Read the book first
","Read the book first, as this movie works as more of a companion piece than a true stand-alone story.<br/><br/>In some ways the movie is an improvement over the book, particularly the tighter last act, but in other ways it loses some of the rationale for some of the irrational behavior.<br/><br/>The acting overall is fine. The peripheral characters succeed better in the film, as they were never fully fleshed out in the book and really come to life in the movie, but the main characters, perhaps intentionally, left me feeling uninvolved and almost disinterested.<br/><br/>Very few films can improve upon source material, and this really isn't one of them. Gone Girl certainly isn't a bad film, but not a great one, and veers a bit too closely to a Lifetime movie feeling, rather than an immersive dark psychological study or even a true popcorn thriller."
"Latvic","5","2","18","9 November 2014"," David Fincher's weakest film to date
","So, I went to see Gone Girl in theaters a couple of weeks ago. In Mexico. In Puebla to be exact. First time seeing a movie in a Mexican theater for me. And wouldn't you know it, Spanish subtitles are not as distracting as I feared they would be. And I've been lazily sitting on my notes since then. But enough of that nonsense, let's get to the review, shall we?<br/><br/>If you're a casual reader, chances are that you've heard about or have possibly even read Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. You know which book I am talking about, it's the novel that that one roommate of yours can't stop raving about. Skeptically you read it yourself, and wouldn't you know it, it's quite the page turner. And then you hear that it's being adapted into a film by none other than David Fincher.<br/><br/>Now about David Fincher. He's a strong contender as my favorite contemporary American director. With an oeuvre that includes Zeitgeist-capturing milestones like Fight Club and The Social Network, and modern crime classics like Seven and Zodiac, you cannot help but get excited for any new film by him. So then what do you get when you pair an exemplary director with the hottest book adaptation of recent years?<br/><br/>Unfortunately the answer is way less than what you would have hoped for. And the reason for that is very much related to the source material. Gone Girl's plot revolves around the disappearance of Amy Dunne, and how her husband Nick tries to uncover what happened to her. I really don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read the book or seen the movie because, SURPRISE, there's some twists along the line. But together with the twist comes all the other baggage from the novel, everything crammed in and rushed through to such a degree that entire subplots become convoluted and incomprehensive. Less would really have been more in this case.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with the story per se, as an avid reader of the book I am simply astonished how safe the movie plays it in terms of plotting and doggedly retracing the novel's footsteps one by one. There's next to no changes to the story, and that turns out to be a problem because, face it, the mystery, its explanation and solution are beyond ridiculous. When you're reading the book that's not really a glaring problem, simply because the characterization worked so much better on paper that you forgot how heavily everything relied on far fetched assumptions, crazy coincidences and convenient story short cuts.<br/><br/>Gone Girl, the book, works because its characters are three dimensional and believable. Gone Girl, the movie, eventually fails because its characters are too simplistic to function in that complex of a plot. I don't want to blame it on the actors, as they try their best to make it work. Being let down by the material is really not their fault. Even main actor Ben Affleck, someone who is not widely known for great acting, is well cast as Nick Dunne, his emotionless stare fairly effective to keep us guessing whether he is somehow involved in his wife's disappearance. Rosamund Pike as Amy, his wife, is only allowed to play extremes. She does it clearly delighting in the task, but that doesn't help to give Amy any shred of realism.<br/><br/>The other key players are a little hit and miss. Tyler Perry is actually doing a really good job as Nick's defense attorney, something you wouldn't have suspected from the star and creator of the Madea movies. Neil Patrick Harris, on the other hand, as one of Amy's exes is stiff and theatrical in all the wrong ways, a bad miscast here.<br/><br/>But these are petty little complaints as the film clips by really fast, given its runtime of two and a half hours. So yes, it is entertaining. But it's by no means a remarkable film. In fact, I think this is David Fincher's worst film to date. Everything that happens can be taken at face value, there's nothing deeper going on other than just racing through the plot of the movie. Even Fincher's failures, films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or The Game had something going on in terms of visual inventiveness or pure atmosphere that would allow an interesting rewatch. Not here. Gone Girl is pedestrian in its execution and that's its biggest offense. No technical marvel, no standout acting, just checkmarking and shoehorning in all the plot points of the novel. See it once and you've seen it all, there's nothing that's tickling the mind afterwards. There are some attempts at slight satire of the media's witch hunt of Ben Affleck's character, but every time something of substance and interest seems to be forming it gets crushed by the plot. Gone Girl is really just hollow popcorn fare without much soul."

","Review: I really didn't like this movie because it doesn't really offer me anything. It takes way too long to progress and there are way too many variables. The direction and screenplay aren't terrible. The casting and acting are terrible. Especially by Rosamund Pike as the wife and the supposed villain who orchestrated her disappearance. I didn't buy Rosamund Pike's performance because there is no real method to her action or then she is unhappy and he husband is cheating. All in all I would give this one out of a possible five stars."

","I read the book and absolutely despised it, mostly for its cookie-cutter characters and the bizarre overuse of sexual dialogue coupled with an incredulous mystery that was more silly than engaging. I was hoping maybe the film would be a bit of an improvement but nope, not a bit. If anything the film is worse. Too many long, dull and badly-lit shots, too many stupid and weird lines (""cool girl presents her mouth for f*cking and shaves her p*ssy"", what the hell?? Now there's one quote that you won't see up there on the 100 Best Quotes Times Magazine List!), too many characters who you wanted to strangle, from the psychopathic yet pathetic wife to the whiny busybody nerd friend. A serious lack of imagination and a serious injection of pretentiousness that just comes across as very annoying more than stylish. Somehow this waste of Kodachrome (or whatever film stock they used for it) has an 8.1/10 rating, higher than masterpieces like ""The Killing Fields"" (1984) and ""Christine"" (2016)? How on earth did that happen? Is the review system rigged? If not completely horrible, Gone Girl is at best terribly overrated. I was not a fan of most of the actors' jobs in this although I think they were just trying to work with whatever material there was. The soundtrack is totally unmemorable and boringly flat, as flat as the characters and scenery. Gone Girl could have been something better than this, but it tried too hard to be profound and ended up just coming off as shallow, petty and pointless."

The ever decreasing amount of space alone, would surely cramp their extra-marital activities.<br/><br/>Finally, miraculously reappearing and accusing someone else of kidnapping her, and by chance no one has seen him at all in those two weeks.

Why spend all that money to tell this type of tale? How does this ""story"" help make us a better society? There are several subplots that would have been interesting to develop...Nick's father or mother, Amy's mother and father, Nick's sister, anything would have been more interesting than what was given the second half of this movie. And while I'm at it, why so much foul-language? How does this move the story along. You may say, ""Well, that's the way people talk nowadays."" but really, it isn't. It seemed as though the writers went overboard trying to get as many curse words in the movie as possible. I wonder if any curse words made it to the cutting room floor at all!

This is what Hollywood has become. This is the bottomless pit into which acting and film-making has fallen.

","It could have been the best movie of 2014. The direction was great (David Fincher's name is enough), acting was great and the atmosphere was brilliant. This movie was heading in the right direction, but then they decided to ruin it. It is full of plot holes that even a child can notice. I think most of the people didn't notice them because either they were shocked or they were mesmerized by Rosamund Pike. Lets talk about the things that did not make any sense i.e; plot holes in Gone Girl.<br/><br/>::::SPOILERS:::::<br/><br/>1- She somehow convinced the police that the guy kidnapped her right and the police wont go there to check. ? There were cameras and when she entered the house with Desi, it must have been recorded. There must be the recording of first few days.<br/><br/>2- Why would the guy try to burn the diary in Ben's father's apartment and how does he know where his father lives ? It raises questions..<br/><br/>3- She says that she lost a lot of blood in the kidnapping process but the police didn't check for wounds. There must be wounds all over her body. (in real there aren't because she faked it)<br/><br/>4- she said that Desi kidnapped her . what if he was in his office or in a bar with some other guy. It will work as an alibi. She didn't even know where Desi was ..and the police didn't even check.<br/><br/>5- according to her, Desi kidnapped her and then cleans the blood off floor. It must have took 20-30 minutes but he couldn't wait 5 more minutes to see if the diary is completely burnt ?<br/><br/>6- She came home covered in blood, then they went to hospital but the hospital guys didn't wash the blood off her and she comes back home covered in blood ? WTF<br/><br/>7- Ben found the stuff in the woodshed, why didn't he move it if he knew it could raise questions? he knew that police will arrest him if they find it. If he wanted them to find it then why didn't he tell them about it.<br/><br/>8- She purchased the stuff with Ben's CC, god that is a lot of stuff, Nobody saw it when it got delivered? She hides it in Ben's sister's apartment and Ben's sister didn't notice?<br/><br/>9- There might be fingerprints on that stuff..They didn't even check.also who signed the receipt when it got delivered? It wasn't Ben.<br/><br/>10- A girl who is a complete psycho, tries to frame you for her murder, kills another guy in process by slitting his throat and you choose to live with her? What the F**k.<br/><br/>I am not saying that the movie was bad. Everything was good except these flaws and these are serious plot holes. I can not expect these kinds of flaws from a guy like David Fincher. If someone can explain these things, I might watch it again to clear my doubts. I have given it 5 stars because of brilliant acting and direction."
"cppguy","1","1","6","17 May 2015"," Gone Girl... fated for a lower rating?
","I hesitate to write yet another review of this since there are so many. I generally get very frustrated with so many reviewers giving films a 1-star rating because I think to myself ""Really? 1? You thought it was less watchable than 'Manos: the Hands of Fate?'"" Well, there, I did it; I gave it 1-star. I thought it less watchable than ""Manos.""<br/><br/>So many positive reviewers ask ""how can anyone possibly think this movie stinks?"" Well, then let me explain: story-trashing plot holes. The first part of the movie had some awkward moments that others have complained about in other reviews, but I'll let those go for the sake of a review. But mid-way through the film (the point most of us are fussing about) all brains go away.<br/><br/>If you watch anything like CSI, that's how the police are at the start. It's really needed for the plot for them to have some brains. That's the first part of the movie.<br/><br/>If you watched ""Manos..."" you might recall a scene where there is someone firing a gun at someone else outdoors. In the next camera shot, you see two police officers standing on either side of their squad car. They walk forward to the front of the car, peer into the distance to see the source of the gunfire, then look at each other, shrug and return to get in the car and carry on like nothing happened. ""Manos"" had the excuse the it was an amateur production with a camera with only 30 seconds of film time and lighting that only illuminated to the front of the car. It was inadvertently comic. However, this generally is how the cops take to behaving in the second part of the film.<br/><br/>I'm avoiding film details, but you can read about all plot holes in other reviews, but suffice to say I started saying out-loud ""that can't happen"" or ""in what universe is this supposed to be taking place?""<br/><br/>I'm not going to toss out a lengthy review of the acting (it's mixed in other reviews, but I thought it was OK). Nor did I find a problem with the directing and filming. I DID notice a trend among 10-star reviewers in that they felt need to mention Fincher's many other film triumphs as if to say ""Gone Girl"" required a superb rating (perhaps even given without actually watching it).<br/><br/>It's shocking that this film is in the top 250... not that there are others in the list I don't care for, but at least I understand why they are there. I think (hope) that over time this movie drops out of the top list. It simply doesn't belong there. And maybe those of use reviewing this dog so badly scared off people that they never watch... and then never vote. Time will tell."

","Living up to parents' expectations can be tough. Imagine if your parents published a children's book, based on all your accomplishments as a child. Now imagine that all of the accomplishments in the book were better versions of what you had actually done. What a way to find out that everything you did wasn't good enough for them. Being judged by others is just one of the many themes depicted in Gone Girl.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is the film adaptation of the 2012 award winning and best selling novel of the same name, written by Gillian Flynn. When Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) feels the unrelenting gaze of the people around him judging the worth of his marriage, judging his worth as a husband and as a man. Societal pressures on a man to be the provider and the disapproval for women to be successful are some of the subtleties that make Gone Girl so complex and engaging.<br/><br/>This is an ugly story about the decay of a marriage and how other people push their way into our lives, be it disapproving bystanders or talk show hosts shepherding public opinion. The depiction of trial by media in Gone Girl also includes a need for lawyers to engage public relations' strategies with talk show hosts in order for justice to even be possible in a courtroom. It's those kinds of elements that make this psychological thriller a horror story.<br/><br/>Very few films have been able to pull off a non-linear storyline, but when it happens, those films stand out in the crowd. Gone Girl is one of these films. All the actors do a stellar job at revealing emotional layers of their characters, but it's the auteur direction of David Fincher (the man behind Se7en, Fight Club and one of the executive producers of the US adaption of House of Cards) that shapes this film as a whole with the assistance of a musical score composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Fincher challenged the pair to create a soundscape that created a soothing façade that put the audience on edge because it was inauthentic, and it's the soundtrack that makes Gone Girl a see-it-in-a-cinema film, where you can be enveloped by the soundtrack in a cinema's high end sound system and in a controlled environment. <br/><br/>As much as I really want to love this film, I cannot ignore that it ultimately depicts misogynistic myths and fantasies relating to rape and domestic violence, and by doing this it validates them. Yes, this film does talk about victim blaming, the scorn women can have for other women that they see as better than them, the scorn society has for women that are victims of abuse at a time when they need support the most, and that (according to the film) the number one killer of pregnant women is domestic violence. But Gone Girl also depicts the myths of rape and domestic violence that frankly do not need any help to be sustained; that women ask for it, that they did something to provoke it, that they deserve it and the ultimate misogynistic fallacy: that women will lie about rape and domestic violence, and that it's men that are the real victims of these accusations.<br/><br/>At just over two and a quarter hours, Gone Girl is just long enough for us to have a two part story, without it being a deep vein thrombosis experience. Just when you think that the film has come to a conclusion and you're left wanting more, Fincher and Flynn unravel the story further to reveal more complexities, consequences and manipulations, right up until the moment that should have you going, ""NoReally?  I can't believe they're going there.""<br/><br/>Overall, worthwhile female roles in a male-centric narrative, masterful composition, cinematography and direction are all the hallmarks of an excellent cinematic experience and the film is worth seeing for that expertise. Just make sure that you make time to have coffee with men that don't subscribe to these outdated myths, and make a donation to a women's refuge after you're done."
"tomgillespie2002","9","1","6","16 February 2015"," Fincher's finest work since Zodiac
","David Fincher has made a career of showing us his extremely dark vision of the world in which we live. Even his films that don't call for such an approach, such as 2010's exhilarating story of the forming of Facebook, The Social Network, are infused with a grimness that combines clever editing, flawless cinematography and a twisted score (here by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) to achieve its purpose. Gone Girl, an adaptation of the best-selling novel by Gillian Flynn (who also adapted it for the screen) is no exception. It's seemingly formulaic tale of a girl gone missing starts with all the familiar genre tropes, but soon turns into something infinitely more contorted, unsettling and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Academic underachiever Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home to find his coffee-table smashed, a blood smear in his kitchen, and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) gone without a trace. He's generally a laid-back sort of guy, but his lethargy soon puts him under suspicion by investigators Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer Gilpin (Patrick Fugit). A media frenzy soon descends upon him, as his inability to act appropriately in front of the prying cameras and the mounting circumstantial evidence leads to a social media witch-hunt. Support from his twin sister Margo (the excellent Carrie Coon) leads to ridiculous allegations of 'twincest', so Nick is forced to reach deep into his pockets to hire superstar defence attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry).<br/><br/>Around the half-way mark, a major twist is revealed. It isn't that hard to figure out, but this isn't the point. It is merely the next stage of Flynn and Fincher's dark vision of the sanctity of marriage. Peppered throughout the early scenes are flash-backs involving Amy's romance and eventual marriage to Nick, with Amy's narration of her diary entries providing the memories. It's here that Fincher toys with us the most, placing doubt into the reliability of the narrator, causing you to question our belief in everything we see. But this is no cheap narrative trick. It's been said that Gone Girl has the power to break up couples, and with the way the movie places doubt into audience's mind as to how much they truly know their partner, it's not difficult to see why.<br/><br/>For an actor who has experienced a difficult time at the hands of the press of late - until he reinvented himself as a director (and an Oscar winning one at that) - Affleck surpasses all expectations and puts in the performance of his career. He is perfectly suited to a character who is in no way totally likable or even sympathetic - he cheats on his wife and has become a layabout due to money troubles) - but his mixture of smugness and disillusion makes him a perfect and easy target for the witch-hunters. But the film belongs to Pike. A brave choice given that she's mainly used in supporting roles, she is a mixture of the beautiful, intimidatingly intelligent, and just plain terrifying.<br/><br/>As the credits roll, you may be staring open-mouthed at the screen trying to figure out what the hell you have just witnessed. One shocking burst of violence especially jolts the film onto another level. The film stayed with me for a long time after, and it seemed implausible, glossy and almost like a soap opera. But Fincher pulls apart the idea of the happy, all-American family in a similar way to David Lynch. It may all be smiles and expensive lunch dates on the surface, but if you dig deeper, you may just find something horrifying. It's a commentary on America's tendency to put people on a trial by media, the loss of privacy due to social networking, the laughable idea of the 'nuclear family', and just a bloody good story to boot. This is Fincher's finest work since Zodiac (2007).<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

It doesn't rely on gimmicks, it never tries too hard to pretend it's better than it is, it's simply a finely crafted, professional work of art. David Fincher proves once again that he is among the best at what he does, and it's clear that everyone involved in this production brought their 'A' game. The writing is excellent, the cinematography perfectly captures the mood of the piece, the editing is exquisite (especially in one particularly gruesome scene, which I won't spoil here), the score is haunting and fits the images like a glove.

Although everyone is entitled to their opinion, to me, this movie is one I could watch over and over again and I HIGHLY recommend it. It's perfectly written and the acting is right up there along side the amazing script. The movie flows together, you're never wondering what's going on or have to worry about getting confused because it's so detailed and thorough! Not to mention Ben Affleck serves as a nice piece of eye candy through out the film :) for those of you second guessing watching this movie because of the many Debbie downer reviews on here, just give it a chance and come up with your own opinion of this film."

","I did enjoy this movie when I watched it. I was hoping it would be better than it turned out to be. When I said I enjoyed this movie, I meant that I was intrigued. I wanted to know ""what is going to happen next"".<br/><br/>This movie was too bizarre and disturbing for my taste. It was so messed up, it frightened me. Amy Dunne reminded me of some women I have had the displeasure of knowing. It also had some movie errors that made the movie seem poorly done.<br/><br/>I did not like how quickly the movie changed and events happened. This movie reminded me of prisoners and criminal minds, but more twisted, less mystery. <br/><br/>Once I finished watching it, I decided I will not watch this movie again."
"markabarrancos","8","1","6","18 January 2015"," Alongside Birdman, Gone Girl blows the standards for 2014 out of the water.
","I knew in the hands of a master like Fincher this couldn't have possibly failed. The man has always had a knack for choosing great books to turn into films (Fight Club), as well as setting the environment for very dark stories.<br/><br/>Gone Girl has various high points: the acting is of a very high grade (Pike is brilliant at playing the ""psycho bitch"", Perry has a lot of charisma to his character, I enjoyed Affleck as Nick, and even Neil's short-lived performance is still impressive), the score is chilling in this harrowing yet amazing way and fits the dark aura of the story like a glove, the script is clever and ceases to disappoint, and just the overall story (Yes, I think the ending is great and makes sense) in general is better than nearly every film out there this decade. The concept may not exactly be innovative or even original, but it's the manner in how it unfolds in which I believe it sets itself apart from the rest, making it all seem brand new even though you might have seen something similar before.<br/><br/>What was most particularly clever about the movie (turn back here if you haven't watched the movie yet because I am about to enter into spoiler territory), were certain pieces of dialogue (the anniversary riddles, and the scene near the ending where Nick realizes he is back where he started, and it's basically all the same, ""That's marriage"") and how Flynn was able to throw the audience off on the truth by placing Nick into situations in which he would lose his temper in (which we find out was orchestrated by Amy), as well as the one frame of reference to Nick and Amy's early relationship being Amy, forcing the audience to essentially trust her, just to find out we were duped and that she is so mentally off that she wrote a fake diary for years. Of course it is far-fetched, but in this instance it's absolutely fine, it's completely brilliant to be far fetched in that situation because the lack of plausibility just adds more shock. And the ending, you people need to understand that Amy was too smart for Nick that she put him into a corner. By being pregnant, and faking the rape, she was hailed as an angel by everybody in society, and if Nick left her his life would be ruined unless he moved out of the country, which we know that he can't afford to do anymore. Think, people, think, or watch an other movie because Fincher doesn't cater to the imbecile. Another couple of points, the time between her killing Desi and returning home is a couple of hours, so obviously she tampered with the tapes enough before she came back (the ride is only 2 hours) so she would look like the victim. Why else would she tell them to ""please find the tapes"" if she didn't carefully edit and plan out everything before returning home? No plot hole, people just need to learn how to think. Also, I found that although the movie is highly centered around Nick and Amy and is very story driven, I found it to say a lot about society. It's very depressing, but truthful also that our people today are so ignorant to believe that the controlling and abusive one can only be the male. Setting aside Amy's intelligence, a lot of her plan and actions were just exploiting societal flaws. I also observed its subtle message that essentially said society is so shallow that it more of the time tries to exploit the current situation for themselves rather than empathize or sympathize with it. It sounds like over-analysis, but just pay attention to the little aspects of the movie, such as: 1. Ellen Abbott excessively talking about the story to garner more views while she just jumped on the bandwagon which held the popular opinion, 2. Much more subtle, but as Nick passes by The Bar, he sees that it is now incredibly crowded, and a lot of people are talking selfies and other pictures with it. They thought ""Hey!, living near the bar where that wife-killer works makes me so lucky and special!"" and felt the need to take advantage. I'm highly sure Gillian Flynn put this all in there to just paint the background of society as the drama unravels, it seems really intentional to me. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, Gone Girl is a masterpiece, only rivaled by and a bit below Birdman, but otherwise is untouchable. Don't listen to the people trying to bash it in and create flaws that aren't even there... just because it's popular doesn't make it mediocre (talking to you, hipsters).<br/><br/>Twisted, gruesome, creative, different, and enthralling.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Oh, and before I end this review, I'd just like to say I very highly recommend the book. It stomps the film into oblivion and just might help you find that closure you need if the movie just didn't meet your fix."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","6","16 January 2015"," David Fincher's Success Streak Continues...
","In a career spanning just over a couple of decades, David Fincher has garnered a very strong reputation as one of the finest auteurs working in the film industry today & certainly the best one around when it comes to thrillers. One can always expect Fincher to come up with a story that's at the forefront of quality, be it the narrative, performances, visual n sound design or entertainment & so far, this master storyteller is yet to disappoint.<br/><br/>And his success streak continues with Gone Girl for his latest is a fascinating exploration of the dynamics of marriage, a ruthless exposition of media sensationalism & a biting examination of our morbid curiosity plus attraction to the scenes of tragedy. The story concerns a guy whose life is turned upside down when his wife's sudden disappearance becomes the focus of an intense media circus which turns on him when he's suspected of her possible murder.<br/><br/>Directed by David Fincher, Gone Girl is a thrilling piece of work from start to finish for the plot is structured in a manner that keeps the viewers guessing, technical aspects leave nothing to complain about & even its twists n turns occur at just the right moments, which makes the experience more enriching. Also, as pure an exercise it is in suspense, this story is tailor-made for Fincher's talents & he does an excellent job with the material provided, yet again.<br/><br/>The screenplay is penned down by Gillian Flynn herself; the author of the book, & it's quite an impressive work from the first time screenwriter. Cinematography has always remained perfectly in tone with the story in every Fincher film & Gone Girl is no exception. Thanks to tight editing, its 150 minutes of runtime is never felt, and the score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross wonderfully captures the essence of the story being told & seamlessly integrates with the unfolding events.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, leading from the front are Ben Affleck & Rosamund Pike in their given roles, especially Pike who steals every scene she's in, commands the screen with sublime finesse, exhibits complete control over her character & her chemistry with Affleck simply works. Neil Patrick Harris, Carrie Coon & Kim Dickens deliver strong performances too but my favourite from the supporting cast is Tyler Perry who plays his character with remarkable confidence.<br/><br/>The film is a thought-provoking look at the hardships of matrimony, shows that it takes more than love to make a marriage work, and that the fall in economy can play as devastating a role as lies, dishonesty & infidelity in triggering the downfall of long-term relationships. But where its hammer falls hardest is in its unforgiving representation of the devious nature of media & in the process, it also ends up making a statement about our very own obsession with such materials.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Gone Girl is an incredibly smart, highly sophisticated & immensely satisfying thriller from David Fincher which exquisitely balances the director's artistic ambitions with audience's expected entertainment, thus offering a cinema that delivers on all fronts. Brilliantly directed, deftly written, beautifully photographed, smoothly edited & effectively scored, Gone Girl is definitely amongst the best films of the year & comes strongly recommended."

"joetufano882","10","1","6","5 January 2015"," One of the most Earth shatteringly amazing films in recent years
","This movie has stuck with me since I saw it opening weekend, as I'm sure it will for many of it's viewers. David Fincher is someone I've come to admire as a filmmaker with his movies like Se7en and Social Network, so I obviously was interested in seeing this especially after watching the first trailer. Fincher and his marketing campaign made a smart move in not showing any big plot points in the trailers, yet managed to keep you intrigued. Not something you see a lot of these days in movie trailers. <br/><br/>Since this is a spoiler free review, I won't go into too much of the details, but this is probably the best performance I've seen from Rosamund Pike, and the same for Ben Affleck. I first noticed Pike in movies like Jack Reacher and the World's End and now I have a lot more respect for her as an actress. Ben Affleck I've always liked as an actor before even in his directorial efforts, and this I'd say is one of his best performances. Tyler Perry, who I've felt indifferent towards really impressed me here as the lawyer who helps Ben Affleck's character face the accusations against him. Neil Patrick Harris on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable, in the wrong way. Nothing against the guy though, but I don't think he was the right choice for the character he played. <br/><br/>Gone Girl does an excellent job of showing you how a person's life can crumble to the ground based on a few lies the Media throws around just to bump up the viewership ratings, and how a lot of us tend to believe everything that comes out a reporter's mouth without considering that they're might be more underneath the surface than what they're showing you. It also stands as a harsh and cynical commentary on marriage and how it falls apart based on how you treat your spouse, and (without giving anything away) the marriage portrayal in this film makes me never want to get married or have a relationship. <br/><br/>Put this in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, Gone Girl wouldn't be getting the response it's gotten. It's pretty clear that Fincher is sitting behind the camera with his bleak tone, dark color palette and how pessimistic everyone feels about life in general. Combine Fincher's direction with the screenplay by Gillian Flynn, the author of the book of the same name there are so many twists and turns that suck you right in trying to figure out what happens next, and has one of the most shocking scenes that'll blow your mind.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a film that people will remember for a long time myself included, and I'm willing to call it one of the best of 2014. I look forward to whatever David Fincher does in the future."

I really liked Affleck from day 1 and I was convinced that his wife was the crazy one, but still, the way it all turned out in the end, was just breathtaking. <br/><br/>Although I would have loved for her to be caught and thrown into jail, the ending that took place after all, was even more appealing and ""just"" in a way.

Movie is based on the novel of Jillian Flynn with good acting crew with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. <br/><br/>We have here disappearance, potential murder, mystery, police investigation, movie is also about marriage, its positive and negative sides, about nowadays society, about media and influence of media, how they create heroes and victims of everything. So from this point of view, quality is very high.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike did brilliant job with cold, brutal, psychopathic Amy. On the other side, Ben Affleck's acting was negligent and nonchalant. Impression was that like he was not interested much and I expected much more from him. Personally I like him but he could've done much better job with this.<br/><br/>As a thriller fan, I enjoyed watching this movie. Movie is good, but far from excellent. It's pretty predictable, not much mystery in it and probably most important and what disappointed me the most was police and FBA investigation, it's a joke. And they should have payed more attention to it. That was the key-missing piece.<br/><br/>So, I would recommend watching this move, good thriller but nothing more than that.<br/><br/>My rating is 8/10."
"Avwillfan89","7","1","6","13 December 2014"," The book was better
","This is a really brilliant film, and was in good hands with David Fincher, but I couldn't help remembering how utterly fantastic, thrilling and scary the original book by Gillian Flynn was. How for the first time, I actually felt unsafe reading a book due to the massive twist in one of the first person narratives. <br/><br/>One of the flaws in the film is that the character of Amy (played in an intensely creepy and brilliant manner by Rosamund Pike) was not given all the details of her past, her life and relationship with her parents, and more into her relationship with Nick, to fully explain why she did the things she did. <br/><br/>Nick comes off quite quickly to the audience as being the unlikable bastard the public in the film believe. And also, the relationship with his dad is just hinted as being ""strained"" in the film and doesn't explore why they don't like each other much.<br/><br/>The ending, unfortunately, is pretty poor compared to the one in the book, using only ambiguity.<br/><br/>Although the movie is well shot and acted, finally giving the typical Hollywood audience something new and engaging, it simply didn't carry enough of the urgency and depth that the novel had."
"st-shot","8","1","6","3 November 2014"," Fun house satire, suspenseful but lengthy.
","Ben Affleck's wooden ways work to his advantage in this suspenseful missing wife tale based on the bestseller of the same name.

Upon arriving home one day he finds she has disappeared with evidence of perhaps a struggle. He reports her missing to authorities but becomes the focus of a possible murder investigation instead as he contradicts himself and evidence he can't explain pops up. Meanwhile Amy makes herself as scarce as possible by going trailer park chic as Ben squirms before authorities and the bright light of the media with a vile Nancy Grace type (played with unctuous relish by Missi Pyle) leads the attack. When the resourceful Amy runs into a road block with a couple of low rent operators she is forced to restructure her diabolical plan and works a former paramour into the scheme (Neil Patrick Harris), raising the stakes.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is part Gothic horror part parody of todays rabid 24 hour news cycle and internet village descending on a befuddled working stiff being pummeled by a comely harridan who has done her homework with a vindictive zeal not seen around these parts since Glenn Close boiled the rabbit in fatal attraction. Affleck's vapid acting chops work well with his clueless character as he fumbles over his alibi again and again as the focused and out of sight Amy makes life a living hell for him. While Affleck garners audience sympathy it is Pike's ruthless Amy that fascinates and lights up the screen with energy and venom.<br/><br/>Director Fincher's deliberate style lags occasionally and the plot reeks of incredulity at times but with logic suspended he delivers more than a fair share of powerfully edited tension filled scenes balanced against a sardonic take on media and society. When combined with a villainess for the times Gone Girl is one fine entertainment."
"bowmiyaofficial","10","1","6","2 November 2014"," OK. Two words, one acronym. TWISTED and UNNERVING. WTF!!?
","So even though I sit here chuckling as I write about this film, it is actually just a nervous attempt to mask how chilled I actually feel thinking about this storyline. The extent people are willing to go, in order to present a perfect version of ourselves to the world and to hide our ugly truths. Yes, i'm sure we are all guilty in doing this, Social Networking sites for example; very few of us share the bad things that are going on in our lives, understandably. However, Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel, which the story is closely based on, surely goes one step further and delves into a darker, deeper side to the human need for social approval, love and the degree one may go to have it.<br/><br/>David Fincher does a good job in building admiration for couple Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike), two writers with great chemistry. They seem to have a fun and engaging marriage until we discover Amy has gone missing all of a sudden and Nick doesn't know where she has gone, nor does he seem too bothered or at least behaves as if so. This is where the supposedly blissful relationship takes a turn for a murderous and soul-destroying showdown. We warm towards Amy through most of the film as she narrates her diary entries, and she conveys herself as the only victim and Nick comes across a little suspicious. Other love interests get thrown in the mix when we discover Nick is having an affair and Amy misleads, and manipulates a secret admirer who she uses in her vengeance plan, and then brutally kills off. It is her intelligently crafted revenge plan and ruthless attitude that shows us how extreme and seriously dangerous she actually is! I sure would NOT want to be messing with her! #CRAZY Lol! As their story is front page news and the talk of the town, more facades and lies are created to deceive family, friends, neighbours, the media and the detectives involved. They both go to great lengths to win the hearts of everyone, playing with each other's minds, faking events and emotions and they both play the game well Too well that in the end, they live a lie and are forced to suffer by upholding a pretend happy marriage when really, they probably both lock their bedroom doors at night fearing that they may be killed off by the other! FORGET.THAT! So folks, i'm just saying, you think you know someoneyou don'tespecially if you're rubbing them up the wrong way, don't do it! Lol!<br/><br/>I really enjoyed watching this film.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","6","8 October 2014"," It's all about perspectives . . .
","No one would blame you if you approached David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best seller Gone Girl with a bit of trepidation. In most cases a hugely successful book turned into a movie leaves its faithful audience with the feeling of ""Did they even bother to read the book?"" It is a relief to report that Gone Girl doesn't have that problem. Fused with a cinema artist's great skill and a screenplay that is as tricky and fearless as its source material, this turns out to be one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>It was a difficult book to translate. Gillian Flynn concocted a brilliant and complex pot boiler that seemed to move in at least five different directions, shuffling a dozen different characters around like pieces on a chess board. In terms of narrative, it walked the knife-edge, veering close to becoming convoluted but never losing focus. The movie works just as well as the book (and in some ways better), and the fact that the author wrote the screenplay – which I always champion – is probably the reason why.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a complex story that opens one way, and then turns another way before turning into something completely different. The story is all about perspectives sprung from the story of a marriage that never should have happened in the first place. We meet Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), a college professor who, years ago, married Amy (Rosemund Pike) and was happy as long as their marriage was padded with money and hot sex. Then the recession hit and they both found themselves out of work. Without the cushion of surface comforts, it is revealed that their marriage was as joyful as a cupcake made of arsenic. The mask hiding the bitterness in their union is seen by everyone else as a match made in Heaven.<br/><br/>Then one day Nick comes home and finds Amy missing. There some broken glass and an overturned ottoman in the living room. There's some drops of blood on the kitchen cabinet. All curious, but the cops seem more interested in Nick's demeanor – he seems more irritated than upset. The case becomes a community effort to find the young woman and then blows up into a national media frenzy. The whole country begins to wonder if Nick might be involved in her disappearance. Was he beating her? Was she pregnant? Was he cheating on her? The answers to all of these questions ultimately have at least five or six answers. Nothing in this story is ever as it seems.<br/><br/>More of the story I cannot reveal without giving too much away. This is a complex story despite its simple premise. It's one of those fun thrillers where you're constantly second-guessing what is happening – just when you think you've figured it out, the screenplay peels back another layer and the mystery of Amy's disappearance gets more and more bizarre. What starts as a singular idea spirals down and down and down, opening more doors yet somehow all connecting them together. This is one of the most sadistically brilliant thrillers in a long time.<br/><br/>It is appropriate that Gone Girl is directed by David Fincher whose films always seem be about ordinary people who, through circumstance, find themselves in the sadistic arena of inhumanity. This was the theme of Fight Club, Se7en, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Zodiac, The Game and Panic Room. Fincher never stoops to making his characters likable, and in Ben Affleck he's found the right actor to play Nick. Affleck is not afraid to look like a jerk and we admire him for that. He's cocky, yet there's something about his questionable union with Amy that gives us a measure of sympathy for him even when his guilt seems to be staring us in the face.<br/><br/>Affleck shows the strain of a man who slowly begins to realize that he is married to a woman that he never really knew, and begins to come apart at the seams under scrutiny from the cops, his sister, the media, Amy's parents, the public, and his own attorney. Everyone has a perspective on the case; everyone has a point of view that makes Nick look guilty of something no matter whether he's done anything wrong or not. This may be the timeliest film of the year."

Yet, the pacing seems off and the payoff extremely muted. Even though I've never read the book, I knew exactly what was happening right from the start. There were very few twists and turns that challenged me but it was interesting to watch it all play out nonetheless. The media circus mockery and satire are perfection.

"TheSeaLion","10","1","7","18 March 2015"," Quite possibly Fincher's best
","""Gone Girl"" is director David Fincher's tenth movie and his fifth that I've seen and dare I say it might be Fincher's best film. The movie is not just an intricate mystery thriller film, but it has interesting, realistic characters, a well thought-out story, and a well done undertone theme about public perception.<br/><br/>The best part of the film are the characters of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) Dunne. Amy has faked her death and left an awful story behind that paints Nick as a villain. What did Nick do? In most films, Nick would have been an innocent guy who was just with a crazy girl, but not this movie. While a lot of the stuff Amy said about Nick was a lie, he was cheating on her, which set off her intricate revenge plot. The movie is not asking you to like or even sympathize with one or the other. It's just asking you to understand them. Nick started to have an affair after he felt like he and Amy weren't working out, which led Amy to her revenge scheme.<br/><br/>The movie's thematic undertone dealing with public perception had two different levels to it, one level being in terms of the movie and the other being in terms of the cast. The movie is about the disappearance of Amy Dunne and the investigation that ensues. During this time, Amy, who's undeniably in the wrong, is painted off as America's sweetheart while her husband Nick, who did do something wrong but doesn't deserve what's happening to him, is turned into the most hated man in the country. But wait, it goes farther than that. At one point, a journalist asks Nick to smile for a picture, which he does so and immediately earns backlash for it. Then, when the girl (Emily Ratajkowski) he's cheating on Amy with comes forward, she dresses, as Amy puts it, like a babysitter, to look as innocent as possible.<br/><br/>The idea of public perception and not knowing the full truth is done so even with the cast. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry, who both do great jobs in the movie, are more well known for comedic work and, this being a serious drama, you'd think they wouldn't be cut out for it. Then, we have Rosamund Pike, who gives the best performance in the whole movie, who is a fairly unknown actress so we don't know what to expect from her. Then, there's Ben Affleck, who is an actor that for reasons I don't understand, people hate. So, there's an actor people seem to really hate being a victim, an actress we know nothing about that the audience figures out what to think about her as the movie progresses, and then there'r Harris and Perry, who are comedians in a drama. All of these people have public perceptions of them that are challenged by this movie.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is just another movie that proves David Fincher is a fantastic and talented filmmaker. The movie does not become a jumbled mess even with all of the twists and turns in the script, the acting is all really good, the characters are interesting, and the public perception angle is handled superbly. If you haven't seen it, I would strongly advise you to check out ""Gone Girl"" immediately."
"grantss","9","1","7","14 February 2015"," Brilliant thriller
","Brilliant thriller, filled with all the usual David Fincher twists, mind games and clever manipulations. <br/><br/>Great plot. While most stories give you a feeling that there is some way out for the ""good guy"", here the ""good guy"" seems doomed, once the wheels are set in motion. Furthermore, you are never sure who is the ""good guy"" and who the ""bad guy"". Even once the twist is revealed, you feel there may be another in store. Very un-Hollywood ending too, which is good.<br/><br/>Superb performances by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, especially. Pike well-deserved her Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination (maybe win too - Oscar ceremony hasn't occurred yet, at the time of writing this). A searingly brilliant performance by her.<br/><br/>Good support from Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens.<br/><br/>Only negatives, I feel, are that the big twist came too soon. I would like to have been kept in suspense for a while longer. Plus, knowing Fincher's other work, especially Seven and Fight Club, I was expecting a big twist near or at the end. When it came it was gradual, and felt a bit flat. Still a good ending, but it felt like I was being brought down gently, rather than with a jolt."
"pavan12323","10","1","7","2 January 2015"," What a twist and triller !!!!!!!!!!
","I thought this as any other ordinary movie , but this movie has greatest twist and ending is extraordinary, Never thought Ben Affleck Could act like that, Total credit goes to David Fincher and writer Gillian Flynn, Again I have to say this movie is more excellent, Basically seeing the trailer we could assume the killer is Ben, even I thought the same thing, Story is so good and excellently executed, I liked one part where Credit card records gets pulled and he would purchased a Robot Dog, there is no way you can tell there is a blank in story nor in logical explanation, Because it so neatly executed and also based on story you can watch this movie twice without getting bored. I'm hoping to see same or different type of movie from David Fincher."
"filthy_morphine","10","1","7","1 January 2015"," Human psyche borehole
","First of all - I absolutely love this movie. However I don't view it as a thriller as much as a deep psychological drama dealing with a wide range of issues faced in ANY human relationship. It's just dressed as a ""mystery/thriller"" which in its own way is a master pun as well.<br/><br/>I have heard many of my friends dismissing this movie as a little above average mystery thriller evaluating it along the lines of slow and predictable, yet usually entertaining. I think this is a huge misconception of this work of art, the thriller/mystery thing is just the outer layer, there are many more layers underneath in each and every scene and I'm very surprised people miss it. We are reminded about it at the very beginning by the first scene. The movie deals with the 3 simple questions posed at the opening scene. It actually is trying to unspool the brains of the main couple and get to the bottom of human relationships, not necessarily a marriage.<br/><br/>If you try and watch the movie through this prism, which is I think what the creators intended, you'll find a deep, thought provoking probe into the peculiar and intertwined web of little human actions of which human relations are made.<br/><br/>I don't want to go into any details here but I think everything (and I mean everything from camera angles through cats to the colors) has it's own purpose and meaning along the above mentioned lines. <br/><br/>Yes, human relationships, marriage, friendship, fleeting love affairs are in fact thrillers because we are always a mystery to each other. And that's what this movie is about.<br/><br/>p.s. and the workmanship is awesome - directing, music, acting ... everything fits, one of the rare cases where deep substance is met with perfect form."

"BeneCumb","7","1","7","17 December 2014"," Just OK, not more - considering the names within and behind
","David Fincher in cooperation with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike... The result should be pleasing and taut, but when the credits appeared, I just shrugged my shoulders. I can't say it was boring, but the overall length, trivial ending and conventional characters did not bring along any wow-effect. Well, directing and performances were good, but all of those people have been involved in much better movies, and the plot was not so angled and winding that they could all show their skills in full. Hate, revenge, adultery etc strong feelings have been better covered in other movies, e.g. A Perfect Murder.<br/><br/>That is why, it is difficult to agree with some viewers and critics as for the script and book behind it, that they are somewhat conceptional, interesting and tense. At least I did not find those elements there and, mildly speaking, I do not fully comprehend its huge box office around the world."
"harsh-kabeer","10","1","7","1 December 2014"," A necessary antidote to our misplaced modern love!
","Gone Girl is fascinating, and an interesting and amusing take on a dysfunctional marriage (Aren't all marriages dysfunctional?!). I would rather recommend that one should not approach the movie as a mystery suspense or thriller movie. Because that is secondary. The real story is the functioning of a couple, the real genre is the marriage. When two people, passionately in love, come together to tie the knot and say their ''till death do us part'', what happens? Are those fairy tales we watch real? Do we all live happily ever after? The brilliance of the movie lies in its surreal story that is told in an unambiguous, definitive way. There is not a shadow of doubt to as what happened in the movie, but the story itself comes somewhere from the dark recesses of the emotional labyrinthine, a thought we dared not to think, an idea killed at its inception. That is what Gone Girl does. And that is exactly what Fincher loves to do. Tap the darkness. But its darkness is also why sometimes movie indulges in excesses. It is as if Fincher just couldn't get enough of it and overdoes it. Like a child bestowed with the toys he had wanted all along, Fincher just couldn't let it go. Also up to three fourths of the movie, the scale seems to be nicely balanced between Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck, but after that Ben Affleck seems like a victim and the wife as the abuser which many may think to be misogynistic in portrayal, but for me it was just unfair and a blot in otherwise a brilliant take on marriage. In spite of these flaws, Gone Girl is a fantastic movie. Gone Girl ridicules the notion of true love set by the standards of our happily ever afters and the happiness in marriage that this society preaches. Our insatiable diet for the happily ever afters. But then the movie also talks about the beauty of it (as both confess they bring out the best of each other), and it is what makes it so twisted and self destructive. A deal with the devil! Apart from love and marriage, the movie also sets out to give light to the illusory nature of perception propagandized by the media. The movie in the first half is itself ripe of manipulation and debauchery feeding off the ideas that we are too eager and judgemental to make. And how Fincher mocks at us! Brilliantly acted by Rosamund Pike with an able support from Ben Affleck and rest of the cast, it is a must watch. I loved it. And the ending was perfect. Any other ending would have just spoiled the whole movie for me. For me, the blood stained Rosamund Pike in the arms of Ben Affleck with Affleck whispering 'bitch' in her ears while the crowd applauds true love will remain the most iconic 'romantic' scene ever. That scene in itself is an antithesis to all those stories of soul mates and happily ever afters- a necessary antidote to our misplaced modern love!"
"SpaceRain","10","1","7","23 November 2014"," Everyone involved did a great job
","That includes Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and the unknown actors in the rest of the cast. Affleck and Perry really surprised me and Pike could get some serious Oscar recognition for this. She played the Amy I pictured from the book so well it was scary...she made such an unrealistic character feel so REAL. I'll be surprised if she isn't nominated and if Ben doesn't get some recognition too. I still can't believe how much I liked Tyler Perry in it, he was fantastic. <br/><br/>This was pretty expected but David Fincher really did the book justice. He gave it the same respect he showed Dragon Tattoo, although this was a bit more faithful to the source material, and he emitted the perfect tone of darkness that was needed. He really knows how to take a twisted, disturbing novel about the demented side of human nature and make it feel real. Given the right cast (with Rooney Mara in Dragon Tattoo and with Rosamund Pike in this) he just knows how to make it scary and skin-crawlingly real. I know it made my skin crawl."
"khanbaliq2","8","1","7","22 November 2014"," Gone Girl is disturbing, yet undeniably entertaining.
","When going to see this film I had no idea what it's about or what it'll be like. I only knew that David ""Seven"" Fincher is the director of the film. Two things become clear when you're watching Gone Girl - it's surprisingly entertaining and it's for adults. Only adults will appreciate the clever humor and characterization in this film. Most people have been raving about how good Rosamund Pike is in Gone Girl. She's definitely good but, in my opinion, Ben Affleck is the one who provides the best performance. In fact, casting him was a brilliant move. Affleck does expert work as the ""lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious"" Nick Dunne. With his excellent performance Affleck carries most of the film, especially the first half. The scenes that Affleck shares with Carrie Coon, who plays Nick's twin sister Margo, are some of the best in the film, easing the tension that's been building up. Coon is very good, as is the rest of the cast. Rosamund Pike, playing Nick's missing wife Amy, sure does deserve the praise that she's been given by critics. Pay attention to her facial expressions, especially in the second half of the film. Her attention to detail is commendable. She practically makes every second worthwhile. I've watched the cast interviews on the internet, and author/screenwriter Gillian Flynn has pointed this out too. I generally like British actresses, even if they are from the establishment. Pike looked terrific in her first film, the entertaining but ridiculous Die Another Day (2002), and she's delivered good performances in other films, like Barney's Version (2010) and Pride & Prejudice (2005). Pike is bewitching in the film, especially in the first half, but when it comes time to show ""amazing Amy's"" or rather ""pretending Amy's"" mental imbalance she's frightening. Even Tyler Perry delivers his first solid performance as Nick's attorney Tanner Bolt. The plot of Gone Girl is similar to a number of Alfred Hitchcock's films. In this mystery thriller a man is accused, maybe falsely, of a crime. What follows is compelling and often unexpected, as Fincher and Affleck examine dishonesty, the media, the economy's effects on marriage, and the way people perceive one another. For some time I couldn't figure out what the establishment message of Gone Girl is. But when I was writing this review it finally hit me - the message is that marriage is a difficult and unpleasant affair, especially after the initial ""good"" days have passed. Still, I recommend this film even if it does have this anti-marriage message. It's Fincher's most entertaining release yet."
"Zulfmanauthor","10","1","7","22 November 2014"," Great translation from page to film !
","David Fincher has achieved with his brilliant adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel, what very few have done before him. After reading the novel, I headed to the cinema days later to watch the movie. I was astounded by the depth of Fincher's direction, pace and vision of a novel so highly rated. What also helped was the author of the novel herself wrote the screenplay. This movie was everything the novel was and even more in my opinion. It was chilling and dramatic with each actor cast perfectly in their respective roles. There is no doubt in my mind that in the world of cinema, there is no other director that can bring audiences onto the edge of their seats the way David Fincher can. I loved his adaptation of 'Fight Club' and 'The Girl with the Dragon tattoo', but this was even harder. He had an even more complex story about relationships and betrayal, which had to be told from the perspective of both antagonists. Finally, high praise for Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike who could not have been better or more convincing as the flawed couple. Along with 'The Green Mile' and 'Mystic River', this adaptation of 'Gone Girl' is the best page to screen translation I have seen."
"secondtake","7","1","7","22 November 2014"," Tightly made, slow to get going but then it gets going in classic thriller fashion
","Gone Girl (2014)<br/><br/>First a warning—don't read any (ANY) reviews about this movie unless you want to have at least a little of the plot surprises ruined. I've tried hard to not say too much here, but it's impossible to be perfect. Read on, here and elsewhere, with caution.<br/><br/>On the surface, ""Gone Girl"" is a common thriller formula. A husband and wife are having a tense time of it, one of them seems to have committed a crime, the main character seems to be wrongly accused. And then some facts pop up in the wrong places and the story gets more creepy and complicated. This is what thrillers do—set up a murder, set up a likely perp, have the facts lead us in circles through lots of spooky territory.<br/><br/>On those terms this is fairly straight up story-telling. Yes, there is a sort of big twist an hour into the film, though you see it coming. But there are bigger twists in better thrillers. And yes there is some chilling psychology at play, both with the leading man, Ben Affleck, who plays a very regular guy with almost too much regularness (he's sometimes a bore), and with the leading woman, Rosamund Pike, who keeps it in check beautifully.<br/><br/>So what does actually make this movie hum along so well, once it gets going? The filmmaking. The formal, technical aspects of a movie make it good, in that slick David Fincher way (remember ""Fight Club"" above all). Transpose this plot into a film noir setting with sparse, contrasty black and white and much faster editing and, well, you have a better movie, perhaps. But you have the same result—a movie that uses drama in the camera, editing, and sound to propel the twisty plot. <br/><br/>There are some good commentaries out there about the roles the men and women get, and how they reflect on society. There is the chief detective, a smart and wily woman without the coy maternal edge of McDormand in ""Fargo."" There is the African- American lawyer who lights up every scene (this is none other than Tyler Perry, and he's great) and who is maybe the only one who gets what's going on outside of the couple themselves. And there is the wife, about whom I can say nothing.<br/><br/>So, yeah, get past the opening half hour which is kludgey and slow. Smell the quickening plot in the second half hour, and then hold on for the real stuff, the final three half hours as the conflicts actually clash and cause smoke and fire. To call this a post-modern thriller that wears its clichés proudly on its sleeve might be an excuse for using so many clichés, but it's all well done, very well done. See it."
"squirrel_burst","10","1","7","11 November 2014"," One of my favorite movies of 2014
","""Gone Girl"" is the most exciting thriller I've seen in a long time. I'll be shocked if it doesn't end up my 2014 ""Top 10"" list. Before you go see this one, you better apply ample amounts of deodorant because it is the kind of movie that will shake you and make you sweat, a lot. It begins on a strange evening. Nick (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) are celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary, but when Nick gets home, his wife is not there. The front door is open and there are signs of a struggle inside. In the ensuing media frenzy, the public fall in love with Amy and everyone frantically searches for her. With all eyes turned towards him Nick begins acting suspiciously, or at least not the way that the media thinks he should be acting. The media turns on him in an ever increasingly torturous descent filled with devastating revelations.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is filled with so many twists and turns that I'm not going to be able to tell you much about the plot, but I can tell you what my viewing experience was like. Imagine that you are walking down a dark alley in a seedy part of town. You see someone hurriedly running through. Out of their pocket a ticket falls out. You pick it up and on it reads ""The most dazzling show on earth! Unforgettable! It will shake you to your core!"" You notice the price on the ticket reads $100 and that the show is nearby. You yell out to the stranger, but they are already long gone, so go take a look. Inside is a massive amphitheater, but only a few people are attending. None are in the front row and everyone seems to be keeping to themselves. You sit down and notice that the stage is set up like a magic show. A nervous-looking man enters, fitted with a straight jacket and led by a beautiful femme-fatale-looking assistant. He is thrown head-first through three rings of fire and into a glass coffin. The coffin is slowly being filled with acid while walls adorned with spikes begin closing in. You're awfully excited to see how this guy is going to get out of it when you hear a blood-curdling scream in the row behind you. Someone has fainted. You ask yourself why a show this grandiose and elaborate isn't being attended by more people. Then it dawns on you that maybe there's a reason that guy in the alley was running so quickly. Maybe the gentleman who has been thrown into a seemingly escape-proof solution isn't meant to escape at all...<br/><br/>That's what this movie is like. It's a nightmare that scares you but is addictive so you can't turn away. You see our main character getting into a situation that just keeps getting worse and worse. Sometimes it's his own fault, sometimes it isn't. It would be a dreadful, depressing experience if it wasn't for two things. The first is that there is a way out of this, or at least in theory there is. You don't quite understand what happened here, but you know that it's only a matter of time before this whole thing blows over and our hero sets the record straight... right? The second is the mystery. What did happen? Where did Amy go? What part did Nick have in her disappearance, if any? Who is responsible, and why? As the film plays out, you will be treated to one devastating and head-spinning revelation after another. Every time you think you have something figured out, a new wrench is thrown in the mechanism and it begins to crumble all over again. To give it a whole new level of intensity, the film is incredibly realistic and air-tight in its developments. The characters feel genuine and have real depth to them. The moments of incredible tension are often broken by moments of nervous laughter as the characters involved try to steel themselves against this nightmare they have found themselves in. The script and the story are razor-sharp in their wit and intelligence (Gillian Flynn, the author of the novel did an incredible job). As an added bonus, the performances are super intense. I have unfortunately come to associate Tyler Perry with wooden performances, unless he's in a dress, but he is very good in this film. Everyone is really good in this film in fact. You will see the cast list at the beginning of the movie and you will barely be able to recognize some of the actors because the roles and performances they are showing off here are unlike anything you've seen before. I also really admire the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who did a terrific job in David Fincher's ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and once again amplify the eerie and tense atmosphere of the film without distracting you from the action or resorting to cheap musical cues.<br/><br/>This film lasts over two hours and it left me wanting more. I didn't see the time fly by at all because it is never slow. In fact, it only gets more intense as the minutes tick by. And that ending... absolutely perfect. I was all sweaty, nervous and fearful when I left the theater, even though I had a friend to reassure me that everything was going to be perfectly safe. I don't know what else I can tell you about this film. I give it my highest recommendation. There is a reason why every time I went to check this one out at the theater, it was full to the brim. This time, I decided to bite the bullet and grab some crappy seats near the front just so I could finally see it. It was worth it. ""Gone Girl"" is so intense that I absolutely have to watch it again, and soon. (Theatrical version on the big screen, October 18, 2014)"
"da_zapata","10","1","7","10 November 2014"," An Electrifying Thriller That Delivers Hard
","Adapted from Gillian Flynn's best-selling suspense novel, Gone Girl is a film sealed with dramatic intensity and highly intellectual storytelling. Its manner of plot development is highly intricate and always has a sense of morbidity lying underneath. Every plot twist is so well crafted that it is never seen coming. That is, of course, unless you've read the novel. Gillian Flynn wrote the screenplay herself and has made few changes to the big-screen adaptation, so fans of the novel won't be surprised by the story. However, they will undoubtedly enjoy watching this mind- consuming and grisly tale come to life.<br/><br/>Directed by the iconic David Fincher, one can already expect broodingly dark undertones and gorgeously vivid cinematography. He has a taste for grim tales about death or deception, such as Se7en and The Game, and this extends to the book adaptations he's directed: Fight Club, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Zodiac. Being the well-seasoned director that he is, it was inevitable for Gone Girl to be anything but gripping and cinematically exquisite both at once. <br/><br/>Discussing Gone Girl feels like having to slowly peel a story apart without taking too much away. Even events that must be mentioned feel like spoilers in-and-of-themselves, and as any reader, you're only getting about half the story unless you've already seen the film. At any rate, Gone Girl is a fast-paced thriller that keeps you glued from the start and also manages to make a statement on gender roles, marriage, and psychological instability, all underlying the complexity and psychopathy of the tale.<br/><br/>We first meet Nick Dunne on the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary. He starts his day off by going to a bar and drinking with the bartender, whom we soon learn is his twin sister, Margo, and the two co-own the bar—named The Bar. Oh, the meta-originality. Nick seems tense but keeps a mundane composure around his sister. He then receives a phone call from a neighbor warning him of an occurrence at Nick's home. He rushes home to find the door open—with his cat sitting patiently outside—and enters cautiously, calling out for his wife, Amy. She is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>Nick soon enters the living room in which a glass table is overturned and broken, alarming him as he immediately calls the cops. He cooperates with them as they arrive and is truthful about his morning and the events leading up to Amy's disappearance. After an interrogation in which he reveals that his wife has no friends and is a distant person, he advises her family of her disappearance. Vigils are held with large posters claiming ""MISSING"" in boldface, with a smiling Amy underneath along with a hotline number. It is not long before the media becomes engrossed in the case, with one female news anchor in particular bashes Nick for his apathetic looks at the vigils, implying he is careless about Amy's disappearance and may have well murdered her.<br/><br/>It is now important to discuss two details regarding the film. Firstly, as a tradition, Amy would leave three clues for Nick to find his gift on their anniversary—a treasure hunt. For investigative purposes, the police follow Nick through the treasure hunt to retrace Amy's steps before the attack took place. A riddle has to be solved at each location, where there are clues on clearly marked envelopes: Clue 1. Clue 2. Clue 3. The second aspect of the film is that it is told in two narratives. We follow Nick and the chaos that ensues from his inner demons as the media swoops in and tears him apart. However, from the start, we are also following Amy's recollection of her marriage to Nick in the form of a diary. We see her retell everything from the day they met, to their marriage troubles, to her eventual fear of Nick harming her. The cops, of course, find this diary as evidence.<br/><br/>And alas, this is as much as I can give you of Gone Girl. At the end of it all, it is a stunning film that has easily made my top-5 list of 2014 favorites. There is never a shot wasted with its darkly beautiful scenery, and every detail is presented before you and knows exactly where it is taking you. Gone Girl is a disturbing yet effective film as a social commentary on commitment and how far we are willing to stretch our morals.<br/><br/>(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)"

","Truly horrifying and disturbing yet so riveting and suspenseful that you can't help but keep your eyes glued to the screen. David Fincher directs with such care and accuracy and keeps his actors focused and attentive that every detail is obsessed over and nears perfection. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike both turn in excellent performances that are both intense yet natural at the same time giving their characters subtle and conflicting inner emotions that aren't always clearly shown. Considering the very lengthy runtime of 149 minutes the movie rarely gets boring. Gilliam Flynn's (also the author of the book) script is filled with rich character development and is full of references of the human condition and a person's capacity for violence.<br/><br/>Overall, Gone Girl is an extremely well made movie but only lacks in the actual story and the ending which can (understandably) leave many feeling unsatisfied."
"rajdoctor","7","1","7","4 November 2014"," Gone Girl - Good Execution rendered with Pot Holes
","Gone Girl<br/><br/>By Raj Doctor<br/><br/>The movie was consistently rated 4 or 4.5 out of 5 by most critics. The IMDb rated it quite high at 8.5 out of 10. The Director is David Fincher – of Seven, Panic Room, Fight Club, Zodiac and Social Network fame. Gillian Flynn (resembling a bit the movie actress Rosamund Pike) the author of the 6-million plus copies sold ""Gone Girl"" was on New York Best sellers' list for more than 10 weeks. Does it get any better – not to see this film?<br/><br/>David Fincher has made movies on various subjects and is considered master of adapting books and novels into movies. It might be his phase of life where he wanted to explore couple relationship and he found an apt book through Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl.<br/><br/>The story– Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) discovers his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) missing, and reports to the police. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) investigates the case and the audience is taken into exploring the case clues – that somewhat point to Nick's hand in the disappearance of his wife. In flashback it is shown Nick having relationship outside marriage and having bad temper – thus becomes the unassuming suspect in the eyes of police, audience and to some extend Nick's twin-sister Margo (Carrie Coon) who supports Nick in every way. Just around half-time we know that Amy is alive, and she is the one who has orchestrated the disappearance act to take revenge on unfaithful husband Nick. How Amy returns back to Nick forms the rest of the story. <br/><br/>The movie is surely about issues around modern couples and their relationships within marriage. Not one partner is true – there are lies, cheating, hate, deception within their interaction, yet they are together. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck is effortless and does not have to do much in terms of acting, and yet he justifies his role and the mystery around his cheating character. Amy Dunne plays a very contrived – so called referred (in the movie) as sociopath – and she brings much nuances in her role with her expressions to understand what goes in her mind. The remaining star cast is okay. Kim Dickens role as a detective reminded us of Fargo's Frances McDormand, but Kim's role did not have that much depth.<br/><br/>The first hour of the movie is just a built up and slow. Nothing much is happening. The second half picks up and holds attention. <br/><br/>I could not fathom why a wife should go to such an extend to take revenge of her husband by enacting her own disappearance and murder? (Sociopath?) <br/><br/>I would not say that there was anything wrong with the film's execution. I have read that Director David Fincher has been very faithful at the adaptation of screenplay which is also written by the authoress of the novel - Gillian Flynn.<br/><br/>I think there is a problem in the plot of the novel itself. It may be well written and surely liked by people – as it is a best seller. But there are BIG pot holes in the story itself. I would not dwell into it – one can read the IMDb hated reviews to understand those.<br/><br/>Ending is one point that is discussed and debated a lot – but I do not find it worthy to discuss much. It is this - husband and wife continue to stay together within the marriage knowing each other's dark sides.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was okay. Well directed – but bland. As what happens now a day to most of the movies – it is over-hyped and under-delivered. I found Gone Girl suffering from that psychosis. Nothing amiss if you miss seeing it and nothing to give such high rating! <br/><br/>(Rating 6.75 out of 10)"

","1 Line Review: A must must must watch. <br/><br/>Yes, you saw it right. Its a 10 star rating. Could not have been anything else. Its a deadly cocktail of 10 star story and 10 star acting. Before anything I would like to confess that I bought the book almost 6 months back and read only 50 pages and got busy in life. Am not much into fiction, I only repent I should have read the book. FYI - A book paints a much awesome picture than what any movie can ever do. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is another such example. Thankfully I read the book and saw the movie. Ya, in that order. <br/><br/>Back to Gone Girl. As the title suggests, its a story of a girl who goes missing. And this girl AMY (played by Rosamund Pike) is Nick's (Ben Affleck) wife. What really happened to her? Did someone kidnap her? Did Nick himself kill her? Did the marriage go bad?<br/><br/>Phew, the story take such interesting turns that I cannot tell you anything beyond this. Frankly, storyline makes or breaks a movie. This book written by the great Gillian Flynn will only make you think hard how these people can write such stuff! How can you think of such complex plots! I wish I had more imagination to write such beautiful suspense stories! :) <br/><br/>Ben Affleck is considered one of the best actors in the Hollywood and rightly so. Have you seen 'ARGO'? You better watch it if you have not, if you have already done it, you should watch it multiple times. I do that. He is a genius. This movie will go in my library of frequently watched movies. <br/><br/>Just so you know, 'Gone Girl' has been directed by David Fincher, the same person who gave us 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' (its a masterpiece, you should watch it), 'Social Network' (again an awesome movie) and the blockbuster 'The curious Case of Benjamin Button'. David is a super director. <br/><br/>Every department in the movie gets a 5 star! Lets talk about the girl herself who goes missing! Rosamund Pike is a phenomenal actor. I remember her from 'Die Another Day' and 'Jack Reacher'. Her acting in this movie is unparalleled. If I tell you any more, I will be dishonouring the disclaimer above! :) <br/><br/>Go watch this two and half hour epic. If you sit relaxed for even a minute during the entire movie duration, I will pay your ticket money back. Yup, that's how good it is. <br/><br/>Bonus: You will get glimpses of Vidya Balan's Kahaani and the Barney avatar from How I Met Your Mother, with his gadget laden house! <br/><br/>Let the awesomeness begin!"
"maxholtman1","7","1","7","19 October 2014"," Changing Perceptions
","+Clear, crisp cinematography +Beautiful score +Engaging Story -Unacknowledged plot holes -Questionable ending<br/><br/>If you are familiar with David Fincher's work, you are well aware that his films can be dark, seducing, and engaging. Gone Girl is no exception. Similar to Fincher's previous films such as Zodiac and Seven, there are twists and turns all around the bend with this one. It is only lackluster in some areas of the film that (while I am not spoiling here) the movie itself appeared to ignore. Mostly what I suggest is contained in the final hour of this film. It is as if the movie only ignored these more than likely probabilities when a certain character took serious action. <br/><br/>DELIVERY: Fincher yet again pulls his audience in with a beautiful score of ambiance by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. It fits the storytelling style of cinema better than ever. Every shot in this movie looks smooth which gives a clear delivery to the viewer of the modern day dilemma Affleck faces in this more than bizarre crisis. All of the acting feels spot on. Rosamund Pike gives a standout performance.<br/><br/>STORY: The two and a half hour run time might feel like a push for this story in particular, but it feels necessary due to its story arch. While it is difficult for me to describe the specifics of this story without giving out spoilers, it uses a flashback system for basically the first half of this film. This film benefits so much from this story because the perceptions viewers have on the characters. I have never felt my opinions and anticipations change so quickly in a film. While it is on the longer side, the conflict of the film changes so instantly. It is almost unbelievable. In fact at some points, it is unbelievable. While this is a fantasy story and a situation of this magnitude has never occurred in today's society, some events that take place might pull the viewer out of the story and think ""How could the film possibly ignore this?"" It basically leaves these problems behind and transitions to another issue before you can blink. <br/><br/>ENDING(NO SPOILERS): The ending of this film may make happy ending lovers walk out empty handed. Fincher is known for not tying a happy bow on the end of his films (for the most part), and Gone Girl has probably become the best example of his films to date in this department. Not many times does a movie watcher question the protagonist's actions at the end of the film, and this movie really makes me question Affleck's logic before the credits."

Carrie Coon's performance as the sarcasm and tough twin sister was super hilarious and well done acted, she could also take a nomination.

","""Gone Girl"" is a very well-made film with a deeply trashy story. It has some near-flawless acting, cinematography, editing, and staging, all in service of a story that isn't just pulpy, racy, and kind of silly, but may well be borderline misogynistic. That doesn't necessarily mean the story is bad, as it's certainly exciting, engaging, at times funny, and full of surprises, but it left a strange aftertaste for me.<br/><br/>Don't take that to mean it's not worth seeing, though - it's a stunningly gorgeous, exciting, funny movie with some great acting, even from such unlikely sources as Tyler Perry and that girl from the ""Blurred Lines"" video.<br/><br/>I do hope David Fincher gets over his strange obsession with trashy airport novels at some point, though."

","As a huge David Fincher film, I liked it. However, I felt that it never really was able to successfully get its feet underneath itself. Mood seemed to be one of its major problems. Secondly, the character of Amy was brilliantly portrayed by Rosamund Pike. BUt too often I thought the character was a bit over the top. Many times I found myself whispering to myself that there was no way a person would go this far to reach the goal they wished to achieve. On the directing side, Fincher never disappoints with shot selection and lighting. He is a master of lighting or there lack of. I though this was more of a tight script than say Zodiac, his worst film in my opinion, but nowhere near the masterpieces of Se7en, The Game or Fight Club."
"antoniotierno","6","2","24","23 December 2014"," excellent story for the most part but with a too unlikely ending
","Little doubt that David Fincher's propensity for too long films has reached its highest point, because Gone Girl, for the most part, feels like an excellent thriller trapped within the confines of a bloated drama. The movie has a thoroughly lethargic pace holding the viewer at arms length for much of its 149 minute (too long) running time, with this vibration certainly supported by an opening hour suffering from a scarcity of electrifying moments. It's certainly clear that the flick benefits from David Fincher's typically meticulous sense of style. There are, it has to be said, a few stretches heightened by Fincher's directorial style. However the prolonged finale ultimately confirms Gone Girl's place as an entertaining but relentlessly padded-out piece of work, and it is now difficult to imagine that Fincher's output will ever again reach the heights of early efforts like Se7en and The Game."

","Little did I know about America's taste for surrealism in the year of grace 2014 yet I have to concede that this movie gave me an unique experience, not knowing the end half an hour before ending and being reminded that introspection is still an art. The Gone Girl is a beautiful sweet and sour satire to the modern family in which the institution of marriage is observed and analyzed from a cold and ironic angle. The whole movie is a trial in which each character is analyzed and over-analyzed only to show the absurdity of doing this thing in the first place. No wonder that Kafka novel is called ""The trial"". The book/movie shows the beautiful and sacred mission of marriage which has been transformed by our natural imperfection (craziness included)in a show for a given audience (mass media, family, neighbours, etc.), a peer pressure factor that gives out sentences in the name of everything but reality. The movie/book is about acceptance. The domestic blame that the author beautifully is moving around for us to accept is only the bait that will take us nowhere. The author is kind of saying us, ""grab a mirror""... and use it. Even the ""escape"" of the female character in the lake house retreat is just a metaphor for the fact that there is no escape from craziness but another Kafkaesque/Freudian mined land."

"bloodclay","10","1","8","7 December 2014"," A Near Perfect Film
","""Gone Girl"" is fantastic. There, I said it. It's one of the most thrilling American movies I've seen in the past five years. However, I can't say I'm surprised. David Fincher is known for bringing us milestones in cinema (being responsible for classics such as ""Fight Club"" and ""Seven"") and you can easily add his latest film to the long list of spellbinding and transfixing movies he's been a part of. Not only is it a genius piece of art, but it's daring in its storytelling, especially considering how wide of an audience the film has.<br/><br/>Set in a small Missouri town, it centers around Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), a man who may or may not have killed his wife. At least, that's what everyone's trying to figure out. His wife goes missing, he's suspected, and we watch things unravel from there.<br/><br/>It's riveting, strangely creepy at times, and isn't afraid to show sexuality (which most mainstream films are too afraid to touch). Not to mention the exceptional performances from the whole cast, mainly our two leads (Affleck and Rosamund Pike), but also from other standouts like Tyler Perry and Kim Dickens.<br/><br/>One of my favorite aspects was the little splices of comedy that seemed to break up the more tense moments, showing how impeccable the writing is. And you when you couple that with the beautiful cinematography, you have a near perfect film. I urge you to the see this. It may split audiences, but I enjoyed it endlessly and can't wait to see it again. It's a prime example of what cinema can and should be."
"s_m_r_b","10","1","8","3 December 2014"," The only disappointment was that it had to end...
","Gone Girl begins slowly, with a lot of questions and clues, and progressively ramps up until it grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go.<br/><br/>This is not the first glowing review for Gone Girl, nor will it be the last. It's an odd mix of thriller, mystery, and drama with enough giggle-worthy dialogue thrown into it to make it truly unique. It is gripping from the very beginning and hangs on to your attention until the credits roll. Gone Girl's running time is 2 hours and 29 minutes but it never feels forced or dragged out. In fact, the only disappointment was that it ended at all.<br/><br/>Aside from Affleck, who is perfect in his role of the lost husband making all the wrong moves in the ensuing media storm, the cast of females in the film is what gives it it's punch. Rosamund Pike is truly amazing, and saying anything else beyond that would be giving too much away (it is a film that relies on suspense and genuine shock, so providing any more details in a review would be a disservice). Supporting actress Carrie Coon takes on the role as the bold, tell-it-like-it-is twin sister ""Margo"" and Kim Dickens is the bright lead detective assigned to the case. Both are very compelling and often funny as ""Nick"" slowly pieces everything together surrounding his wife's sudden disappearance.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a best selling novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn, and one can only imagine how good the book is based on the success and reception of the film so far. Given the detail in the movie, it's hard to believe there could be more to the story that just didn't make the cut.<br/><br/>The instant buzzing of discussion and the looks of pure astonishment and joy on the faces of the movie-goers once Gone Girl ended said it all. It's still early, with Oscar season right around the corner, but this is easily the best movie of the year (so far)."
"reece-beale","10","1","8","15 November 2014"," What a flawless film.
","The best part about Gone Girl is that the plot is so immersive, it can make you easily forget about the subtle details that add to this masterpiece. I had to go see the film twice just to appreciate these details put there by David Fincher. That, and simply because I loved the film.<br/><br/>Gone girl represents the hardship of any relationship; to the extreme. Nick's undoubtable feeling of being not good enough for his wife is something a lot of men can relate to, whilst Amy's feelings of isolation can be easily be related to by a lot of women. No doubt, Rosamund Pikes stellar performance also helps to bring these hardcore feelings to life. Ben Affleck also played a major part in this with his believable portrayal of Nick Dunn.<br/><br/>You can also peel back these marital themes and see the other side of Gone Girl as well. The idea of anchorage in the media, no doubt, plays a major role in the film, with Ellen Abott representing Nick as a horrible, pathetic excuse for a man, and also employing the idea that Nick had incestual relations with his sister. Both of which were not true, but made selling the story to viewers easier.<br/><br/>Fincher also puts in subtle instances of foreshadowing. When Nick is at his dads house, he say's something along the lines of 'I'm just checking the place hasn't burned down'. Later in the film we find out that Nick's dads house was where Amy had burnt her diary. Furthermore, when Desi is driving up to his house with Amy in the car, there's a quick shot of his front door that seems out of place, this is to highlight the fact that the front door holds significance in Amy's staged rape (Desi walks out the front door after Amy messes up his hair and clothes) and to, understandably, foreshadow this scene.<br/><br/>I would recommend Gone Girl to anyone, I believe it's easy to resonate with the characters, the plot is incredible and the entertainment value of the film is second to none. Kudos David Fincher."

","In Gone Girl (2014) Nick Dunn (Ben Affleck) comes home on the day of his 5th anniversary to find his wife, Amy (Rosemund Pike) missing. Naturally being the husband of a missing woman, Nick is suspect number one. The police investigators and media begin to dig in for clues as we learn that the picturesque marriage of Nick and Amy is not what it seemed. This film is an excellent pot boiler mystery for fans of the genre. Great edge of your seat entertainment. The movie is based on the book of the same name by Gillian Flynn, who also adapted the screenplay. The story and subject matter raised by Flynn's book says a lot about marriage, current societal morays and the evil nature of mankind. So what better Director than David Fincher, his first film since Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011) given his House of Cards break into television. He reteams with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the score. A score much more understated and less noticeable than their other collaborations. Ben Affleck is a very solid choice in casting, given his own real life back and forth media love hate relationship; gambling, cheating. He can turn on the charm and shut it down much better than he could earlier in his career. His range as an actor is improving with each film, which is key in a film that requires the viewer not to be sold on his guilt or innocence. Rosmund Pike, is hauntingly beautiful as the wife. I think this role will make the British actress more of a house hold name this side of the pond. The casting for this film had a lot of front runners in pre production; Maura Rooney, Natalie Portman and even Reese Witherspoon who ended up with a production credit. I think with the past roles they have played none of the other actresses could have pulled off the character of Amy as effectively as Pike. They have all played too sweet, that sugar would mess up the recipe for this film.<br/><br/>******SPOILER ALERT, DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM********<br/><br/>I can not help but compare this film to David Fincher's now classic Fight Club (1999). Amy is to Edward Norton's nameless character in Fight Club as Amazing Amy is to Tyler Durden. This novel appeals to the anti establishment, anti hero women secretly want in the same way. Amy's rant in the car about the different types of girls seems similar to Tyler Durden's rants on society with a female perspective. Amy takes on Amazing Amy when her diary begins to narrate her version of the story. Much in the way her parents children's book Amazing Amy was a better version of her. In the end the two halves join back when the blood is washed off and she returns life back to the comfort of her version of a happy home with her husband. Fake a pregnancy, killing a guy all justified in her mind to get her family unit back in order. Much in the way Tyler Durden blows up the bank buildings to get us all back to the comforts of living debt free. I noticed a similar reaction from men leaving the theater after Gone Girl's credits began to role. What?! He stayed with her?! That ending sucks?! Much like the women I noticed leaving the theater scratching their heads at the destruction in the end of Fight Club. We are not so different men and women, we struggle to communicate and that's why most relationships fail. We both have a dark side that can scare and confuse the other and that's what I think Fincher is saying in both films.<br/><br/>If you liked this review check out my blog at yourturntopick.com"

","When Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, was over and the lights in the theater were starting to slowly brighten, I was unable to get up from my seat. What had just occurred in front of me was, well incredible. I had never seen a film before that was so predictable but not. The mystery drew me in but the intensity is what kept me there. With every passing minute I was clutching my seat, widening my eyes, and waiting (very impatiently) for events to be explained. The movie starts with Nick Dunne (Affleck) starting the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to his wife, Amy Dunne (Pike), at a bar. There he talks to his sister, the bartender, about the struggles he is experiencing in his marriage. When he gets a call from one of his neighbors that his cat was outside of his house, he rushes home. There he not only finds the cat but the front door is open with nothing in the house to be found other than what looks like a struggle in the living room with a broken coffee table and flipped over furniture. When Nick goes looking for his wife in the house he cannot find her and automatically calls the police. As the police start to uncover hidden details in Nick and Amy's life, including Amy's diary of secrets, the finger is pointed at Nick. As the film goes on you cannot help but try to solve the mystery that writer Gillian Flynn set up, however the plot has so many twist and turns that it is nearly impossible to keep up. Director David Fincher uses a lot of key lighting to enhance drama and suspense. The use of color in Amy's diary to represent different entries is also very telling in the long run. This film is the best film I have seen all year and it is because of the strong and intense actors, Affleck and Pike, and also because of the production and delivery of the film its self. It was clear that every detail from lighting to sound to camera shots was put together with precision and thought. I find the scariest films to be about what could really happen in what seems an ordinary life, and for Nick and Amy, the nightmare has just begun."
"eli-brill-unicycle","10","1","8","24 October 2014"," Gone Girl
","If you're looking to feel uncomfortable in the best possible way, look no further. <br/><br/>Gone Girl follows Nick Dunne, whose wife Amy has presumably been kidnapped while he was away. The story deepens as the media start to direct their attention to the story and portray Nick as a murderous husband. The film's first half pans out similarly to most murder mysteries, as the audience is made to wonder whether or not Nick has killed his wife. As the film unfolds and more and more information is revealed to the audience, we're steered through several jarring plot twists, not knowing who to route for and kept on the edges of our seats. Eventually it's clear to the audience that what we're watching is unlike most other mystery stories. In fact it takes an abrupt shift and gives the audience a completely different feel in its second part, which follows Rosamund Pike's character Amy Dunne (who in my opinion is the real reason to see this film in the first place). The solemn soundtrack is the perfect supplement to the masterful shots, and the movie gives off the exact feel it likely intended. If you're looking for a film with wonderful camera work and a soundtrack to guide your emotions perfectly through all it's twists and turns, this is it. All the actors fit their roles, with Rosamund Pike giving an exquisite performance as Amy Dunne. The film left everyone in the theater silent at its conclusion, a true testament to it's power over the audience's psychology. <br/><br/>Gone Girl is one of the most intense and thrilling movies I've ever seen, and although some suspension of belief is required to have an enjoyable experience I'd absolutely recommend this film."

"shawneofthedead","8","1","8","23 October 2014"," A thriller with lashings of murder, mystery and mayhem that thrills in more ways than you'd expect.
","David Fincher is a great director - but not really one you would associate with the notions of marriage, romance and love. His name is more characteristically attached to dark thrillers exploring the depths of human depravity: the way a serial killer relentlessly hunts his prey in Se7en, for instance, or the curdling of friendship through the creation of a billion-dollar enterprise in The Social Network. Why, then, has Fincher turned his attention to Gone Girl? Because this tale exploring marriage, romance and love - adapted from Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel of the same title - tucks itself perfectly into his wheelhouse. Fincher brews an intoxicatingly bitter stew out of Flynn's characters and ideas, blending tragedy, loss and even farce into a fascinating film that's as shocking, bleak and entertaining as it is thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) wakes up one day to find that his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has mysteriously disappeared. It's perhaps ironic - or fitting - that he spent the morning complaining about their upcoming fifth anniversary to his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon). Soon, the police are investigating Amy's disappearance, and clues start quite literally popping up that suggest she might very well have been kidnapped... or killed. As details of his souring marriage begin to come to light, Nick finds himself morphing from desperate husband into potential murder suspect in the blink of an eye and the turn of a media cycle. But Amy's side of the story yields new suspects, including her obsessive ex-boyfriend Desi (Neil Patrick Harris), and twists that go deeper and darker than anyone would expect.<br/><br/>These days, films emerging from Hollywood fall easily into categories and genres - but not Gone Girl. The first half of the film is a taut, tense thriller, a grim whodunnit which colours details and doubt into the mystery surrounding Amy's disappearance. Nick and Margo speak of Amy with a surprising callousness, whereas Amy's diary entries paint a picture of a fairytale romance gone awry. We watch Nick kiss Amy in a sugar-storm outside a bakery, even as it becomes harder to believe in his innocence after she disappears.<br/><br/>Then, as more clues are unearthed and the plot deepens, Fincher spins his film into the realm of satire. Before he even comes to trial, Nick finds himself sorely tested in the court of public opinion. He flashes an awkward smile next to a poster of his wife, and is immediately branded as a callous murderer by gossipy news anchor Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle). He charms his way through an interview with reporter Sharon Schieber (Sela Ward), and somehow manages to wrest back the sympathy he's lost. It's a delicate game of styling oneself for public view - a notion all the more relevant in the media-obsessed era of Facebook and Instagram in which we now live.<br/><br/>That's not all, however - the finest, and possibly most disturbing, element of Gone Girl is the strain of pitch-black humour that runs right through it. Nick and Amy are tied - nay, trapped - together by their personalities, their choices, their circumstances; strictly speaking, it should play out as a tragedy. Instead, Fincher almost effortlessly finds the horrible, dark comedy of it all. In the midst of this strangely effective blend of high melodrama and bitter farce, Fincher even hits upon quite a few home truths. He may be painting an extreme portrait of a dysfunctional marriage in Gone Girl, but the myriad ways in which a far less unusual pair of people can trap each other in love, lust and lies come through very clearly anyway.<br/><br/>Fincher is known to be a taskmaster with his actors, but they'd probably agree it works out for the best here. He teases a remarkably sensitive and ambiguous performance out of Affleck, who plays the shadows that lurk within Nick with just enough charm to have anyone believe that he's maligned - or very guilty indeed. It's a fine line to walk, but he pulls it off. Pike, who's spent much of her career drifting beautifully through films while never quite giving away too much of herself as an actor, delivers a career- defining performance as Amy. From the well-bred socialite of her parents bestselling' 'Amazing Amy' books, through to the sad, bitter wife who wants more from Nick than he can give her, Pike plays every shade of the character - from light to dark - with astounding skill.<br/><br/>The final film can feel disjointed and inexplicable to some. What, precisely, is Fincher trying to say with this film that flits from genre to genre? It's not a straight-up thriller, and its social commentary comes so wickedly barbed that it might be missed completely as the layers of crime and mystery are peeled away. But take it for what it is - a dizzying, occasionally brilliant study of the institution of marriage, taking to terrifying, hilarious extremes the question of whether we can ever really trust the people we claim to love - and Gone Girl is a thrilling, electric and very unusual treat."

"Voeim","8","1","8","19 October 2014"," Great Thriller
","What more could you want in a thriller? Gone Girl is bold and seductive, dark and shocking. It is filled with misdirection. The audience is instantly gripped by the lives of married couple Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and ""gone girl"" Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). The movie offers insight into their lives before she went missing. Did he kill her? It is easy to believe he could have. If you don't suspect Nick, then you are left wondering who took her, and whether or not she is dead. If you already read the book and know everything that happens, then you are left thinking just how well done the movie really is. <br/><br/>Director David Fincher is no stranger to psychological thrillers, having directed favorites like Seven, The Game, Fight Club, and more recently, The Social Network. Come Oscar season, I wouldn't be surprised if Fincher again gets nominated for Best Director along with Rosamund Pike for Best Actress and Gone Girl as one of ten Picture of the Year nominees. <br/><br/>Two stories are told in Gone Girl; one centering around Nick and one centered on Amy. It is then vital to the film's success that the performances of Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are believable. They go beyond expectations. Affleck shines and Pike gives an Oscar- worthy performance. Gone Girl overall proves to be well-cast and well-acted, with convincing and memorable performances by all who are involved. <br/><br/>I love a good thriller, complete with twists and turns, especially done in the style of David Fincher. Naturally I would recommend Gone Girl to anyone else who does too."
"sledgehammer86","8","1","8","19 October 2014"," Twisted tale about what's happening beneath the surface
","With Gone Girl, I think Fincher has created his most thought-provoking work yet. It certainly created a buzz, with most people who walked out after the movie heavily discussing what had all happened. It's a movie that stays with me too and leaves me pondering too, even prompting me to see it twice.<br/><br/>The thing is that this movie works wonderfully well on a level below the narrative level. The narrative, the twisted tale of the girl gone missing, is entertaining well on its own, with some cool twists in the story. But what makes it far more interesting is that this plot is also just a device to bare the world beneath it. The plot is in a way ridiculous, but its masquerading for the strange mechanisms of couple synergy that this movie is really about. The movie works hard to tell what's happening under the surface: the superficial sheen a couple portrays to the outside world, the ebb and flow of a couple's relation.<br/><br/>Not just the plot is a device used as a substitute to tell about the inner workings of this couple. The soundtrack is actually continually reminding us that things are off, that things are at work, that something is rippling below the surface. The soundtrack literally tells us that there are severe cracks forming. The 'inspirational seminar music' is surely intentional, giving off a superficial polish that seems insincere. The low rumblings suggest horror, that things are being ripped apart. Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross' soundtrack, for which I've got nothing but praise, is outstanding on its own, but how it's actually integrated into the movie, almost becoming a voice in the story is impressive. Fincher and the soundtrack team have really found each other here.<br/><br/>Although surprising in some of its plot twists, Fincher has opted for a more subdued tone for most of this movie. He's extremely controlled though. The camera work and cinematography is completely in line with the mood that every scene needs to have, completely serviceable. There's a very controlled tension throughout. He's just less in-your-face about it than in some of his other movies. And when he finally does go all-out, Fincher proves that he can be uncomfortable and disturbing when needed. Specifically, one scene near the end is outstanding, and highly controlled in its almost micro-delayed way of releasing tension, where you see something happening, are held prisoner for a micro-moments and it hits you a second later what you're actually watching."
"SeanBatemanJr","8","1","8","17 October 2014"," Master director elevates familiar material
","The most interesting thing about ""Gone girl"" for me is the fact that underneath all the director's mastery is kind of a typical twisty thriller that in other hands could have left much weaker impression (you can see ""Perfect stranger"", for example, to help you imagine how it could look).<br/><br/>This film truly made me think that David Fincher can, if needed, elevate any material, make a very impressive movie almost from any script and, like a magician, make us not see most of its flaws. I'm not saying the source material here is bad, but its screen adaptation certainly could look much less convincing and fresh, much more problematic. <br/><br/>In one interview David Fincher said that he shot 500 hours of footage for this film and this is probably one of the keys to how he does this magic - squeezing everything he can from the cast and the crew. <br/><br/>This is one of David Fincher's best movies although on paper it kind of shouldn't be."

"markgorman","8","1","8","14 October 2014"," A fantastically plotted thriller that's as good as the hype. More magic from Fincher.
","David Fincher doesn't do bad movies, what with Fight Club, Thee Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Se7en, Zodiac and, for those that liked it, Benjamin Button under his belt<br/><br/>Of late, neither does Gone Girl's star, Ben Affleck (Argo was awesome, although I'm not so sure how good I Killed My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her on a Meathook, and Now I Have a Three Picture Deal at Disney was).<br/><br/>So it was no real surprise that Gone Girl really does live up to its hype. <br/><br/>I've not read the book but I'm reliably informed that it's very true to it (perhaps not surprising given that the screenplay was by the novel's author, Gillian Flynn).<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil the plot here because it's very much plot driven with more twists than Chubby Checker, but in my opinion it's a right riveting two and a half hours; yes two and a half hours!<br/><br/>Essentially it's a did he (Affleck) didn't he, murder his wife vehicle in which the possible killer's motives and evidence veer massively from 'of course he didn't' to 'of course he did' and back again several times. <br/><br/>The action unfolds in four acts, each slowly releasing its story before you hit a ""did that just really happen?"" moment. And Fincher is the perfect guy to handle this as a proved master of plot development. The result is that you are slowly but surely drawn deeper and deeper into its labyrinthine construct as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is led by Rosamund Pike who, as the Gone Girl, gets a lot of screen time but fails to clear the bar set by Affleck. There's something miscast about her, she just isn't all that attractive as a person - that would be my only real criticism of the film. <br/><br/>Aside from her there's affecting performances by Carrie Coon as Nick's (Affleck's) twin sister and Kim Dickens as the main investigating cop (a bit of a nod to Frances McDormand in Fargo in the way she plays it). Tyler Perry plays a neat part as the defence lawyer although it's a relatively small part.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie. Although whether it retains its place in IMDb's top 80 movies of all time for long remains to be seen."
"Figgy66-915-598470","8","1","8","13 October 2014"," Thrilling, yet disturbing but totally watchable
","13 October 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Gone Girl. A lot of people knock Ben Affleck and I'm not completely sure why. He was very watchable in this quite long but very gripping mystery thriller. On his fifth wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Affleck), reports his wife Amy missing (played by Rosamund Pike) and what starts out as a seemingly ordinary disappearance is pulled apart by a media circus and very soon Nick is being accused of his wife's murder. It's easy to see how stories get out of hand when you watch how the media manipulate things to their own design and this film was scarily realistic, telling a tale from the husbands point of view, but not without a little manipulation from another source. Pike was a master in her part, and the supporting cast were well chosen as their mannerisms matched the script with varying amounts of disbelief and cynicism. Look out for Neil Patrick Harris, recently starred in A Million Ways to Die In The West but was famous at the end of the 80s for playing little Doogie Howser MD. As I said this film was long but well worth staying in your seat. Another interesting thing to note is that one of the producers is none other than Reese Witherspoon."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","8","13 October 2014"," Another memorable, exciting, challenging thriller from Fincher
","Directors don't become synonymous with genres as often as they used to in Hollywood's Golden Age, but play the word association game with ""David Fincher"" and you're bound to get ""thriller"" back as a response. There's little doubt that if you're producing an intense, dark, mystery-driven film, Fincher's your first choice, and he proves it yet again in bringing another popular book to the silver screen in ""Gone Girl."" For those who know nothing about the novel (as I did), Fincher's involvement should be your first clue that this is beyond run-of-the-mill mystery stuff, that somewhere in this story of what appears to be a ""did-he-or-didn't-he"" murder case lurks a sinister and sadistic turn.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, ""Gone Girl"" stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne, a writer/professor and co-owner of a bar living in the heart of Missouri, whose marriage to Amy (Rosamund Pike) has been rocky of late. When Amy disappears, the search to find her becomes a media circus, and before long, all eyes turn to Nick as her most likely killer.<br/><br/>Under Fincher's direction, the entire film is covered by an unsettling fog, with a good portion of the credit belonging to his collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who scored ""The Social Network"" for Fincher and won an Oscar. He creates a bleak portrait of what most would consider a quaint Midwestern setting and creates doubt and intrigue at every turn, while also satirizing Middle America and mainstream media.<br/><br/>With its crystal clear premise, ""Gone Girl"" holds its audience captive, inviting you to see if you can figure out what really happened, confirming a few of your suspicions here and there until suddenly you have no idea what happened to the movie you had bought a ticket to see. It's not a radical or misleading transformation from the first act to the second, but one that will remind audiences that the truth isn't exactly black and white in the way most movies would have you believe.<br/><br/>It's weird to call Affleck perfectly cast in this movie, but he has just the right balance of sympathy-worthy leading man qualities and totally unlikable smugness. Normally George Clooney is your guy in this case, but Clooney would be too lovable and handsome to play Nick. Affleck's reputation, having gone from pretty-boy movie star to tabloid fodder to esteemed director, definitely works for him in this film. You see bits of the ""Argo"" actor you really enjoyed rooting for, and bits of ""Daredevil"" and the cocky, dumb Kevin Smith roles. ""Gone Girl"" wants you to question and scrutinize Nick yet also feel like there's no way he could be a murderer.<br/><br/>On the other side, few people will forget who Rosamund Pike is after seeing this movie. Although she's been in a fair number of films and always been a good actress, ""Gone Girl"" showcases the true extent of her range, and is finally the perfect storm of a film to elevate her profile. Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister, Margo, is another great casting find; the Chicago-based actress will surely see more big-time supporting work in the future.<br/><br/>With Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris rounding out the supporting cast, it's safe to say this is one of the more unusual ensemble casts for a big adaptation in recent years.<br/><br/>When it comes to differences between the book and the movie, only so much criticism can be leveled against Hollywood as this is a very (very) rare case in which Flynn – on her own – adapted her book for the screen. Obviously she doesn't have final cut, but most of how the story plays out on screen can be attributed to her. Given the movie is totally enthralling, she obviously has screen writing chops. You could argue that it's a bit long, but otherwise, the movie never feels hindered in the way that overly loyal adaptations tend to do.<br/><br/>Most thrillers operate using a formula that ends with a twist or an epiphany that ultimately satisfies the viewer. ""Gone Girl"" doesn't work that way, which is both a great strength and a great weakness. On one hand, it will simply be too weird and dark for many people; on the other, it uses conventions to highlight issues and ideas that go well beyond the scope of what other films in the genre ever dream to accomplish. More than a great thriller, ""Gone Girl"" speaks to the challenges of the modern marriage, issues of the victimization of women, the media's tendency to sensationalize stories and more. It's a trade-off that makes ""Gone Girl"" pretty unforgettable, regardless of personal opinion.<br/><br/>~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit my Movie Muse Reviews site for more"
"Seraphion","8","1","8","12 October 2014"," A ping-pong play at the viewers' assumptions and a sudden slam mid-way through
","On their wedding anniversary, Nick finds his wife Amy missing. Investigation indicates she may have been murdered, thus Nick becomes the prime suspect. It gets more incriminating to him with his unfaithfulness and his debt history after both Nick and Amy lost their jobs, thus having to spend Amy's trust fund. The case gains media attention, putting Nick under the spotlight. He hires a lawyer who then coaches him through the public opinion control, and even booked a TV interview to clear his name. Nick's own investigation reveals Amy is a cunning mastermind of framing people. Meanwhile it turns out that Amy is still alive and on the run. She faked her own murder and pregnancy and frame Nick with it to get back to him. She did a very meticulous and thorough job; faking her journal entries, staging her blood spills, stealing a pregnant woman's urine, and even changed her looks to avoid recognition on the run. <br/><br/>She casually watches the media frenzy on Nick and befriended a local girl Greta. But after Amy slipped up, Greta and her boyfriend rob her blind. Penniless, Amy contacted her ex-boyfriend Desi, who still longs for her. With Desi, Amy watched Nick's interview, in which Nick asked Amy to come back home. Some time after, Amy tricks Desi into having sex with her. Amy tells him to go rougher, but as Desi enjoys the moment and is off guard, she slashes his throat. She goes back to Nick, with all the media on them. Amy tells the everybody she went missing because Desi kidnapped her. Nick, knowing Amy's capability to frame things on people, confronts her. She presses him to conform to the public opinion that they're happily reunited. Nick is terrified that Amy can kill him too. Seven weeks since returning, Amy shows Nick she's pregnant bearing his son. Nick denied this saying he never touched her since she got back, But Amy reveals that she took his semen from the fertility clinic. Nick then forcefully goes back to his marriage, to the horrors of his twin sister.<br/><br/>I watched this movie without prior information about the book. And after watching I think that the story is very nice. It manages to make a ping- pong play out of viewers' assumptions toward the main characters Nick and Amy. The movie opens hinting that Nick may be facing a possible kidnapping or murder. But soon the ping-pong starts as Nick's flaws are revealed little by little. But then hints of Amy's possible past faults are also shown, making us question Amy's voice-over allegations to Nick.<br/><br/>Then the shocker comes as the movie slams the truth about Amy staged th whole disappearance and murder thing up. Watching this online, I wondered why did the movie open slam this big part of the mystery and keeps a big chunk of runtime behind? The following twists with Greta and Desi are just magnificent and really complete the movie as a classic frame and betrayal story.<br/><br/>The mystery aspect is nicely very thick in this movie. That assumptions ping pong play just really keeps the viewers' curiosity going. What's good is that it doesn't end when the truth of Amy is slammed onto the viewers' face like that. The drama on the conflict build up, side by side with that ping pong play, did great in emphasizing the conflict seeds and made the romance part look better.<br/><br/>The thriller part isn't really much. It's just there to dramatize more on the police investigations and the suspicious minds. But as the fowl play of both Nick and Amy is revealed, the thriller part moves more in holding up the suspense and curiosity of what's going to happen next, particularly after the sudden revelations of Amy's truth.<br/><br/>The acting department is a great overall. Ben Affleck nicely grasped every aspect of Nick; his confusion at first, his try to hide his side of the problems, his conviction on standing his ground of denying the murder, and his eventual fright to Amy. Rosamund Pike also did great, reviving her career to the spotlight. She really used her experiences, such as the cold traitor Miranda Frost, the sanguine Sam Chamberlaine, and the tough Andromeda, and blended them together into acting her role here. Other mentionable performances include Tyler Perry's in-control lawyer role, and Neil Pattrick Harris' long time ex-boyfriend role.<br/><br/>For me Gone Girl (2014) definitely deserve an 8 out of 10 score and a a recommendation to go see it in the theaters. It's a mystery movie that offers not the traditional case-build-to-twist-to-ending ordering. The unorthodox approach of viewers' assumption play and the sudden revelation midway will bend your mind over."

","Here's a fun movie. If you think you are in a bad relationship see what Nick Dunne has to endure.<br/><br/>There are a few problems. How did the cat get into the bedroom? How did a supposedly tied up Amy get that box cutter? Why would the successful Neil Patric Harris character have no life? They don't have showers in the hospital?<br/><br/>A similar ""bad girl"" in ""Body Heat"" had more motivation. Here the leading lady was more like a female Norman Bates.<br/><br/>The movie has a great setup. The flashback of the leads meeting and romancing with the sugar cloud makes both character likable. As things progress you are yanked around by a clever story and your attitude towards the characters changes.<br/><br/>At two and a half hours it is a tad long. There are giant holes and some things feel forced, but it is entertaining. It plays well in the dark on the big screen. See it in a theater."
"mmaggiano","6","2","27","6 October 2014"," Plenty to discuss, yet difficult to rate
","This is a difficult movie to rate because its strengths and weaknesses are tangled together. I have not read the book, and I'm reviewing the film as its own entity.<br/><br/>The movie's worth seeing, if only because of the twists, the character of Amy, and the post-movie talking points that are meant to provoke a battle of the sexes debate.<br/><br/>I did enjoy Fincher branching out in a new direction, and I wouldn't say that it's the wrong direction for him as much as it was a difficult tone to hit for anyone. The movie sets out to mix melodrama, realistic satire and absurdism. Though I love weird tones and shifting tones, to me the tones in Gone Girl don't always land well or mix well.<br/><br/>Worse still, there's inconsistent acting, and wobbly story logic. The movie isn't deliberately unreal enough (whether absurd or dreamlike or mythic or farcical etc) to get away with the wobbly story logic.<br/><br/>I'm not sure the actors are always successful at staying in the same movie together. And Affleck (as A-lister personality actors often do) seems to be so intent on 'playing a character with a backbone' that it's basically frigid, unflinching acting where his 'character' doesn't really change or have an interior. We're left watching Affleck bring the role to himself so entirely that he's not really doing anything. It's just flat acting that has about the same tone all the way through. (And it's not unlike the frigidity that Casey Affleck has in Gone Baby Gone, directed by Ben Affleck) I think this is partly dismissible by the character's degree of narcissism and shallowness, but not entirely.<br/><br/>But I have toyed around with the idea that Fincher and Flynn are jazzing around metafictionally here. I'm not convinced that they are, or that they did it well if intended. But at some point, two intelligent artists may have discussed how a man is to direct a woman's novel/screenplay of this sort.<br/><br/>IF they baked a metafiction joke into it, the setup clearly runs through Affleck's under-emoting, under-engaged acting that undermines the story, and through the way that nearly every story logic problem serves to make Amy more amazing. And the meta-joke, if there is one, only plays if you see the characters as puppets, more or less: The psychopathically overengaged, self-justified modern wife who gets to always be right, and the self-centered, resentful boy-husband who takes her just barely seriously enough to subtly manipulate back and stay alive.<br/><br/>Yet... I'm not sure I want to give Affleck the benefit of the doubt that his practically unchanging tone and lack of interior were all just a brilliant meta-joke."

","I had to do this just because these people with the negative reviews don't actually know what in the world they're talking about. <br/><br/>SPOilers<br/><br/>Once amy shows up bloody in the hospital the whole diary thing is is irrelevant. No it doesn't mean daisy put the diary there to burn. it means she coulda tried to burn it whenever she wanted and she could simply say I was not myself and under the influence while writing it and decided to burn it. It is a non issue at that point. Also Amy had the capability of deleting any videos at daisy's house except the ones she wanted kept and could have easily gotten away with the murder. The only hole was when she arrived from the police station covered in blood, if it wasn't for that scene the movie is almost believable. So if you people are gonna write bad reviews of this masterpiece the least you could do is write something accurate."
"hou-3","1","1","9","23 April 2015"," Disappointing
","All reviews are subjective but I think it applies with especial force to this movie, and I can see why opinions are so polarised. If you are happy to leave your brain at the door and go along with the roller-coaster ride then you're in the right hands - a very skilled director and script writer, good actors and no expense spared in production. Start looking at the plot holes and the whole experience becomes risible - even for a thriller this one is totally over the top. That said, there are a number of specific reasons why I found this movie beyond annoying. One is the absence of emotional engagement on the part of the cast, because disengagement is part of the character of the two protagonists. The result is that the viewer looks forward to the appearance of the secondary characters, like Affleck's sister and the detective, simply because they offer a minimal amount of emotional input. A second issue is the long recapitulation of events narrated by Pike about a third of the way into the movie, which is basically telling viewers they've been fooled and stalls the action for, what, about ten minutes? Also incredible is the idea that a woman capable of such intricate and sustained planning could be hoodwinked by the trailer park villains - it was pure plot device. I could go on. Suffice it to say that this is the cinematic equivalent of a page turner, superficial in the extreme and really disappointing for fans of the director's movies."

We watch Nick battle himself & review his relationship over the years with Amy. You watch a man being broken into pieces, just out of perception & the bashing he receives from the media, who now have become monsters themselves, to run their channels at any cost. <br/><br/>Flynn's Adapted Screenplay examines dishonesty, the media's reckless behavior, the economy's effects on marriage and appearances. It captures many themes, which in turn, becomes a deliciously twisted thriller. <br/><br/>Fincher is a master storyteller & with 'Gone Girl', he's scored a home-run. His treatment to this tale on human-horror, is perfectly creepy & also vast. Jeff Cronenweth's Cinematography is mesmerizing. Each & Every moment has been captured, impeccably. Kirk Baxter's Editing is razor-sharp. Original Score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross is haunting. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Ben Affleck & Rosamund Pike are at their finest. Affleck is pitch-perfect as the man in question, delivering a performance that is raw & real. Pike, however, steals the show with an unforgettable turn. She's spell-bindingly chilling in her portrayal of an estranged wife. She is definitely up for an Oscar-Nomination next year! Carrie Coon is terrific. Neil Patrick Harris is exceptional, yet again.

","Gone Girl is David Fincher's tenth film, and it definitely shows. His directing is as subtle and refined as it's ever been and the man still clearly knows what he wants out of every shot. The films a bleak joy to look at. The colour pallet is comprised of muted blues and blacks and yet I would happily hang a still of any shot in the film on my wall, we have Jeff Cronenworth to thank for creating such an oddly beautiful looking film. The soundtrack by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor is, like the cinematography, this odd beauty. The minimalistic approach Ross and Reznor took on here works wonders for the film, every scene is doused in music and makes every second feel relaxing and uncomfortable at the same time. <br/><br/>The acting from Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick and Amy is exceptional. Pike I smell a best acting nomination for and I thought she played Amy to no fault. Affleck surprised me to no end however, I love the man's directing but he was never really much of an actor in my eyes, this performance blew me out of the water in how subtle it was, no big Oscar moment or anything just a brilliant nuanced performance. Supporting cast was excellent in their roles as well with particular praise to Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt who became my favourite character in the film because of his laid back, cocky portrayal of the lawyer.<br/><br/>The films a perfect adaptation of Flynn's novel. I think the fact Flynn was able to take her novel and condense it into a two and a half hour film is extraordinary. The fact she also crammed in many of the the little details from the book is also incredible. If you've read the book then what your going to get is a dream film, a perfect adaptation. If you haven't read the book then your going to get an amazing film, by an amazing writer and directed by one of the best in the business."

","David Fincher – *sigh*. What to do? I was taken with Fight Club, though I now suspect that was more Cronenweth's visual style (three condoms floating in the toilet bowl, Ed Norton's immortal self-abuse, etc – all rendered in sterile whites and tonsured browns). Zodiac confused the hell out of me – now, I admit, many Fincher fanatics will defend Zodiac 'til they're blue in the face – but it wasn't my style. I considered 'The Social Network' a return to form – yes, perhaps not the cerebral psycho-thriller that 'Fight Club' was, but certainly an examination of a parallel pathology. <br/><br/>Many have been debating 'Gone Girl' on the grounds of misogyny, questioning whether it is a feminist film or not. Though I have not read Gillian Flynn's eponymous novel, I have read secondary material on it that has convinced me that her opaque and sinister Amy has a much more complex motivation behind her than Fincher gives her credit for. And indeed, this was what was missing for me most in this film – where is Amy's third act? She barrels out of the gate with her 'Cool Girl' speech, the first time we see her on screen, but then by the end she's just cold knives and blood spattered bedsheets. Ben Affleck's salt of the earth Nick is an unconvincing dolt, and I find it hard to sympathize with his character whatsoever. Overall, I'm interested – but I wish that Fincher had given me a bit more OOMPH to these characters. Something a little more to love, but maybe that's the cynical point."

It would have been perfect if it actually ending with closure, rather than leaving it open and letting the audience decide the conclusion.<br/><br/>It worked well with Inception, Memento, Fight Club etc, but with this movie, I feel like it needed a proper ending to fully close the story. Still a great movie, definitely worth watching. 9/10"

","I hadn't read the book before I saw the film. Many of my friends who had read it told me that its one of the rare films that is actually as good as the book is. I found myself experiencing a brilliant work of art that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through.<br/><br/>The story tells itself and you can start to put together pieces in your mind as the story progresses. Ben Affleck gives a brilliant performance and really fits well with his surroundings and events that are going on around him. Lets not forget Rosemund Pike, a stunning performance from her which, combined with Ben Affleck really gives you a great film to watch.<br/><br/>The film itself doesn't take long for you to be drawn into and once you are, its a hell of a roller-coaster ride from there! All in all a great film that I highly recommend you to watch as you will be talking about a lot after you have seen it."

","This was a great story with several interesting twists. The casting is great with Ben Affleck in the lead and Roseamund Pike in the supporting role. I think it's one of Affleck's best roles. It held my interest throughout the movie with a reasonable pace that didn't lag.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed with the ending (I didn't read the book so don't know if it departs from it). I also saw two logical goofs that grabbed my attention for a few minutes which is why I rate it 9 out of 10 stars. The director needs to pay attention to all of the details, not just most of them. I won't speak of the goofs because I don't want to be a spoiler."
"cathey-127","9","1","9","16 October 2014"," One of Fincher's best
","This is one of David Fincher's best movies. Yes, we're talking about the person who made Fight Club, Se7en, The Social Network, and other awesome stuff. This is one of his best works.<br/><br/>The plot, the planning, the execution, the editing, everything was perfect. The acting was really good too. I had problems with Amy in the beginning - she seemed too graceful to be normal. But as the entire story unraveled I totally got it. I think we're looking at at least an academy nomination for her. And I'll be surprised if this film doesn't get at least a nomination for best picture. The score was just right for the tense and creepy atmosphere.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, so I do think there are some plot holes. Amy's entire plan, though terrifyingly brilliant, was full of flaws. When she returned home she didn't have any major wounds to explain all the blood in the kitchen. Desi's CCTV tapes doesn't exactly work in her favor. The thieves had a pretty good chance of finding out who she was and ratting her out. And even if she didn't have to execute this plan B, how would the police fail to track any of her financial records and transportation methods? She had a car. If it was her car, the police would have figured that the car doesn't just disappear with the person. If it was a new purchase, the records from the automobile sellers / renters would have retrieved the data. Also if she was carrying like 100k with her, her bank account would have shown a pretty big withdrawal as well. And even if she executed everything as planned (her suicide), her body would have revealed that her time of death was a couple of days past the time Nick contacted the police.<br/><br/>So it doesn't really make sense that she won in the end. By the way how would she be able to impregnate herself? It would require some damn complicated medical procedure that doesn't have a close to 100% success rate to do that. And Nick could have taped some conversation between the two of them. In all, to all the crazy people out there who got inspired by this film and want to frame their spouses of murder, don't do it. As smart as Amy was, it's a miracle she won.<br/><br/>But anyway, these flaws doesn't ruin the film a bit (I realize I'm talking about them too much for a film I gave 9/10, but I guess I'm just that nerdy). It was very intriguing watching Amy's plan execute through, her plan B execute through, and her final triumph. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat and the ending gives the perfect haunt. It's definitely one of the best films of 2014 (I have to see if Chris Nolan's Interstellar can beat this) and I'll be looking forward to when this comes to DVD."

","For a start 9/10 is generous, this movie is worth perhaps a 7.5/10. Let me state for the record i have read the book and seen the movie a record 3 times and while it is the most exciting movie of the year thus far, and the most thrilling by far, It is not without its unfair share of pitfalls.<br/><br/>First of all besides good performances from all actors and actresses (the standout being Tyler Perry and Carrie Coon) who are able to remain subtle and convincing unlike our main actor/actress (Affleck, Pike), and as well as good direction (expect no less from a pro), this movie falls entirely apart due to the script. A wise man once told me, a good story told bad can still be a good film. But a good story told terribly will be a bad film. This movie walks the fine line between the two. It makes promises but does not come through with them at pay off stages and the result is you are ultimately left with a sense of inertia, disappointment and annoyance. <br/><br/>Dialogue: Gillian Flynn, who penned the script, is no Joel Coen, is no Tarantino, is no Raymond Chandler, and yet there's something about this fact that hardly matters. In trying to describe how very awful some of the dialogue is look to some of the TV shows on ABC and CBS for an idea. However, it is clear to see she has tried very hard, but in trying so hard falls terribly short of terrible. Cliché-ridden, many of the lines descend into eye-rollable territory and many lines will leave watcher's feeling embarrassed, uncomfortable for said writer.<br/><br/>All in all, a decent movie, and it is clear Ms Flynn was going for unpredictability rather than plausibility of narrative. I watch movies for entertainment and this certainly entertained, however i couldn't help but feel slightly letdown by the Master of Dark Thrillers."
"SpitztheGreat","7","1","9","14 October 2014"," 2014's Mystic River- prepare for suffocating tension
","Gone Girl is 2014's Mystic River, a beautifully crafted, powerful, memorable story that leaves you thinking, and yet ranks painfully low on the ""entertainment"" scale. I'm hard pressed to find a real flaw in Mystic River, just as I am in Gone Girl. That doesn't mean the movie is perfect, I could parrot some of the points raised elsewhere, but in totality I think Gone Girl is a damn fine film.<br/><br/>And I can never recommend it.<br/><br/>This is an insanely dark movie for a major Hollywood production- if this was a smaller film without famous actors I think it would be one of those movies that IMDb members talk about when they're discussing ""disturbing movies"" like Caligula, Gummo, and Happiness. To bring it back to the Mystic River analogy I would like to turn the attention to Clint Eastwood's follow up Million Dollar Baby. This was another dark movie that I found very challenging, but unlike Mystic River there was enough lightness to it that it felt more balanced, that life wasn't just three hours of being kicked in the balls. I found those small rays of sunshine refreshing and helped add contrast, perspectives, and layers to the ending. Mystic River and Gone Girl never makes the attempt to add contrast in this way, they hammer away at the inescapable darkness of the narrative. Both movies are so packed with impending doom, and suffocating tension, that the viewer never has a moment to relax and enjoy the really well crafted film that is being shown.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to argue that there should have been more comedic moments, they would have been out of place; but even the most serious movies can take their foot off your throat long enough for you to breath.<br/><br/>I'll give the movie a 7 out of 10 and be glad to never watch it again."
"JackCerf","7","1","9","13 October 2014"," Sardonic Black Comedy
","This is definitely value for the money. It's a black comedy of American manners, and the ending gets increasingly funny as it gets increasingly ghastly. Evelyn Waugh would have loved it. So, perhaps, would Jane Austen (who gets a shout out that is also an allusion to one of Pike's early roles), who had a sharp eye and sharper tongue for bad behavior.<br/><br/>Of the two protagonists, Nick Dunne is all surface. What you see is what you get – a guy who tried to make a career in New York, failed, and is settling himself back into his old home town' where his shiny New York wife doesn't fit his new life, and auditioning a replacement who might. Human, but perfectly familiar.<br/><br/>Amy Elliott Dunne is much more complicated and interesting, not simply the psycho bitch that some critics have made her out to be. The key to Amy is her parents. From their brief appearances, we can see that Amy's mother was definitely the dominant one in that marriage. She's a classic frustrated stage mother, or in modern terms a thwarted tiger mom, who – in the manner of upper middle class parents – desperately wants her child to be exceptional. Frustrated by her real daughter, she had poured her perfectionism into a fictional counterpart, Amazing Amy. It turns out that Nick Dunne is not the only character with a twin sibling. Amy Elliott is Amazing Amy's mediocre twin sister, and she has spent her whole life failing to measure up to that image of perfection. She dropped out of childhood pursuits and, we learn, misbehaved in prep school. To be sure, she got into Harvard. But, as the saying goes, everybody at Harvard got into Harvard. Real Amy didn't distinguish herself there, and she wound up in a glib and trivial New York job for superficially bright liberal arts graduates, writing personality quizzes for checkout counter magazines. She is still unmarried when her parents are about to give her perfect twin the perfect wedding.<br/><br/>At first, it looks like she has finally matched, if not surpassed, her fictional sister by marrying Nick. When she tells him, ""We're so cute, I could punch us in the face,"" she is saying that he and she look like the ideal young bourgeois bohemian married couple in what they don't know is pre-Crash Brooklyn. When they both lose their media jobs and Nick takes them to small town Missouri, Amy is enraged to find that without the trust fund Amazing Amy gave her, she is, in fact, perfectly ordinary and, though intelligent, not at all exceptional. Her plot against Nick isn't just the culmination of her rage at her downward mobility. It is her last chance to excel the Amazing Amy by pulling off a perfectly executed scheme, and she throws herself into it completely. But she fails once again, when she runs up against the kind of people she has never known, didn't plan for and has no idea how to deal with. In desperation she improvises one last, horrifying attempt at salvage. She pulls it off because of her total devotion to creating the necessary appearances and, most importantly, because of the credulous sentimental idiocy of her audience. <br/><br/>At the end, we're looking at the opening chapter of Amazing Amy Becomes The Perfect Mom. God help the child."
"cultfilmfan","9","1","9","13 October 2014"," Gone Girl
","I was eagerly awaiting the release of Gone Girl, with high hopes and expectations based on the reviews that I had read, plus also because of David Fincher's very impressive body of work. All in all, I would have to say that I liked the film very much, but I did not love it. I think one thing that may have impacted my decision a little bit, was through no fault of the film whatsoever, but of online movie critics. I was reading different reviews of the film online (some of professional critics and some not) and I just found that in the reviews that I read, too much information was leaked out and spoiled about the movie, so that when I went to watch it, there were certainly plenty of surprises, but all in all I mostly knew where the film was going and I now wish I had entered the theatre knowing nothing about the film and that probably that might have made a bigger impact on me then. The style and satire of the film was also something I had to get used to. The constant media coverage surrounding the characters and the events in this film and the police who were profiling to the point of actually being obnoxious, to me at first was kind of aggravating. As the film went on however, I noticed that this was some tongue in cheek and almost satirical humour from the point of view of the writer and director. Just the fact that today's media and news outlets control so much of our thoughts and perceptions about certain events and news stories and there is always some sort of media bias, or slant to each situation. Here in Canada, we have the network broadcaster, CBC, and I can only truthfully watch some of their news programs because I find that so much of it is slanted and biased with a more liberal, or left wing style approach and while that may be fine for some, I find their politically correct and skewered way of doing the news often annoying, not truthful and not to my way of thinking, or my attitude towards world events, or politics. I only watch the station sparingly. It does seem you get that kind of bias from whatever news, or station you watch and just some of the bias is more obvious than others. So, I appreciated the film's jab and poking fun nature at this subject as it has long been a beef with me as well. I had to get used to the obnoxious cops and newscasters in the film, but when I did I appreciated the satire all the more. A few other complaints about the film revolve around certain events and sometimes it almost did seem very implausible and unrealistic. After you have seen the film (no, I am not giving anything away), you look at the film and start to wonder why certain things went to such measures of the extreme to pull off other things and it just baffles the mind. Should one be impressed by this type of storytelling? Repulsed? What was the message, or theme that they wanted to get across to us the viewers? The film was interesting on a level where we break down the characters and try to analyze them and figure out why they are doing what they are doing, but in the end there was fascination on my part, some disbelief and just plain some stuff that I did not get. The film's length did not bother me, but I did feel that certain scenes especially towards the end of the film could have been trimmed down a bit and overall were just not necessary to the film, or to the plot. There were a few plot holes in the film that I had a little problems with, but now on to what I did like about the film. As a whole, Gone Girl, was in very capable hands and the filmmakers did mostly succeed in doing a very good film. The acting from Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and the entire cast was all excellent and almost certain to cause some acting nominations at next year's Oscars. The film was slick and stylish with it's lighting and creepy, but atmospheric music. The film did keep and hold on to my interest even though it was a longer film and it awakened a whole bunch of emotions from me while watching the film. I always think that if you watch a film and it makes you feel at least something, then the filmmakers have succeeded on their end of the spectrum. While the film is far from perfect, it is still a very powerful and chilling film that is very well done and worth watching, I just would not recommend reading too many if any reviews on the film before you actually decide to go and see it. I will be curious to know what The Academy Awards will make of a film like this. It certainly is a warped and very different film, but could that lead to Oscar gold? I look forward to when the nominations come out to see for sure. As for Gone Girl, it was very close but not enough to be a masterpiece, or a perfect film, but it still is very good and worth seeing at least once."

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>On the day of their anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) missing. Following her disappearance Nick is overwhelmed by the media circus and police dissecting every aspect of his marriage. As the lies are uncovered the spotlight grows brighter on Nick as the prime suspect for his wife's murder. Director David Fincher strikes again with yet another incredible movie to his already stellar filmography. Calling Gone Girl a murder-mystery is underselling it. This movie is a deep terrifying study into sociopaths, relationships, and strive for perfection, delivered in a slow yet engaging pace. While Ben Affleck is incredible, Rosamund Pike's performance will leave you speechless. I'd be shocked if this movie is not nominated for Oscars.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Fight Club are all movies that I love from David Fincher. So of course I was excited to see Gone Girl, and I left the movie in love once again. Although not the type of love portrayed in this film, that'd be crazy. I should mention that I never read the novel the movie is based on, so I won't be able to comment how well it was adapted.<br/><br/>You may notice that run-time of this film is almost 2hrs 30mins, so it is relatively long movie. Nevertheless I didn't want this movie to end, I wanted more. You are drawn in by every scene and that's testament to the slow burning pace that keeps on building momentum till the final crescendo. I'll admit that half way I needed to go to the toilet but I held back because I didn't want to miss a single thing. I'm glad I stayed because it felt like every scene was vital to moving the story along. In most murder-mystery thrillers, the big reveal is the highlight and everything after that has little intrigue. However, in this case even after the truth is revealed you are aching to know more, and that is where the movie becomes most interesting.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck was really great in his role. The nuances in his acting added to constant audience doubt and questioning of did he or did he not? Even rest of the supporting cast such as Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, surprised me with how different the roles they played were from what they are usually known for. But the absolute show stealer is Rosamund Pike. At first I wasn't too sure about her performance because it felt a little bit robotic, but as you come to understand her, you start to see Pike revealing all the layers of her character. I think there is not one person who wasn't stunned by her hauntingly beautiful performance. Once again I must say Oscar nominations are much deserved, especially in her case.<br/><br/>I would rave more about this movie but that would entail going to spoiler territory. All you need to know is that the acting, pacing, story, characters, everything about this movie is excellent. You will be thinking about Gone Girl for a few days after viewing it the first time. It will affect you.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

","If you split this movie into it's components, i.e. Story - Direction - acting etc. then it is a mixed bag of goodies. - The Story starts off as a typical ""chick-flick"", then (thankfully) it turns dark, and then a welcome mystery is introduced. Up to here it was very good, but from here on, it goes south, badly! I do not want to ruin it for you, just in case you want to watch it, so I am not going to put any spoilers in, just enough to say, the second half of the story lacks believability, it almost insults your intelligence and indeed those of the law enforcement officers. - Direction, is good - you quickly get to know who is who, and can easily follow the story and the characters, though you just as quickly get to guess what transpires afterwards (and scratch your head in disbelief at the end )! - Acting, is solid, if not brilliant, Ms. Pike is certainly the queen of this movie, though Ms. Coon is a very close second. Mr. Affleck plays his usual ""look at me, I'm stoooped"". Over all enjoyable enough to watch, ultimately let down by the story, which goes daft half way, if only more thought was given on it."

It's pointless to write it and all you're doing is wasting other people's time! It is beyond annoying, when you're reading reviews, and you keep seeing the same synopsis repeated over, n over n over again. Another thing...we know who it's directed by and who the actors are because IMDb puts all that information on the film's title page! You don't need to tell me that! I know it already! You're not professional critics, just write what you thought of the movie and be done with it! <br/><br/>Onto my review. I didn't read the book so I didn't have any preconceived notions going in. But once I saw that it was directed by Fincher, I knew I was going to be in for one helluva ride. For the most part it was very suspenseful. Kept me on my toes the whole time and it kept me guessing many possible outcomes. It really threw me for a loop when it came to the spin. Totally caught me off guard. And the performances were top notch. I did think Affleck's character could've used some more brains. A couple times I wanted to yell at the screen because he was just so damn dumb and way too passive, especially towards the end, but for the most part he was pretty good. Rosamund Pike was phenomenal! If she doesn't get an award out of this, then we'll know for sure the Oscars are rigged! Overall...It was a damn good film. I'll probably even see it again, just to see if I missed anything."

","If there's one life lesson that is more important now, especially with the advent of social media is that appearances can be deceiving. Your over at a friends place and you might see a set of photos on the wall. What's portrayed in these memories? A happy wedding? Possibly a Halloween where the kids have smiling faces and a bag full of candy? We come to accept the information given to us from the evidence that everything was fine that day. We don't think about what really goes behind those scenes such might question the material itself. Maybe the kids weren't as excited on that Halloween or maybe the couple getting married was never happy to begin with.<br/><br/>It's becoming harder for optimists like myself to see the world in a better light. We come to expect bad news when we tune to CNN, but when were struck with shocking revelations from our close ones, we'll do everything to deny it. We never want our wholesome images broken down, but when we hear something about a rape or a burglary, depending on the draw, we'll either get an immediate sympathetic human being or the darkest mind to set on foot that becomes the victim of a witch-hunt. Suburban identity and bogus media assumptions are such subjects of Gone Girl. <br/><br/>Bar owner Nick Dunne (played by Ben Affleck) returns home after an outing to discover the scene of a struggle and no trace of his wife Amy (played by Rosamund Pike). The police arrive and start to trace small clues and bring Nick to the station for all information about Amy. His first press conference goes well until a photo of him smiling next to a missing persons poster makes him out to be someone wanting attention. <br/><br/>Nick's twin sister Margo (played by Carrie Coon) allows Nick to stay with her as he tries to piece together what happened. Through the course of the movie, we get flashback's from Amy's journal about how she and Nick were writers living in New York until his mothers illness forced them to move to Missouri. Further evidence has suggested that the marriage had become bitter and Nick had increasingly become more aggressive. Several news outlets, including a morning host Ellen Abbott (played by Missi Pyle) make Nick out to be a psychopath and starts to create more hate for the guy. Even after speaking with Amy's ex boyfriend Desi Collings (played by Neil Patrick Harris) and attorney Tanner Bolt (played by Tyler Perry), were not so sure how much of a reliable narrator Nick may be.<br/><br/>What I've described was about the first half of Gone Girl, as I won't spoil the second. The best part about the movie is that it goes in directions you would not expect. Each idea about our two leads constantly shifts from how we want to see them to their exposure of who they really are. Gone Girl dwells into several territories including identity within a suburban setting and how media can have more control then we realize.<br/><br/>As in most David Fincher movies, this has the familiar dark and stylish tone we've come to expect. In terms of subject matter, I don't consider this his best work. The film perhaps takes a tad too much time building out our two leads and I honestly got board before we learn more about Amy. For a movie that already makes it clear were not going to get a clear answer, it likes to stay put. <br/><br/>As is, both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike excel as our doomed couple. At first I questioned about why Affleck was casted to play himself, until I realized that most people on the news that are accused of killing their spouses have a smug look upon them. Affleck fits the role perfectly as someone who would have a hard sell as a honest Joe. Though I cannot give away why, Pike may have now given us one of the most frightening personas of the year. Here's your latest Hollywood monster for your Halloween parties.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight breaking news notices out of ten. Though I wish Gone Girl was trimmed and structured a tad smoother, it's actors carry the unnerving scenario all the way to make you consider married couples and the sacrifices they make to keep up with status quo."

","""Gone Girl"" is the first most anticipated movie of the Oscar Season to be released. Based on the popular novel, Nick Dunne's, portrayed by Ben Affleck, wife Amy, portrayed by Rosamund Pike, disappears. Nick, the focus of intense media scrutiny, becomes suspected of murdering his wife. The first part of the movie flashes back to Nick and Amy relationship, meeting five years ago, until the present day. Both the characters are writers, and the theme whether they are being their real selves with each other plays out. In regards to Amy's Disappearance, you know that only 1 of 2 things is possible – Which it is – That is revealed half way through the movie. Positives – Carrie Coon's performance as Nick's Twin Sister Margo, whose character adds good humor and or spirit, while a lot of the other characters are often dry, and for the most part Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit's performances as the detectives investigating Amy's disappearance. I like Ben Affleck, I think he will make a great ""Batman"" - for this movie, certain scenes I would say he nails it, and certain ones, I would have wanted another take – so an uneven performance. While Rosamund Pike isn't bad, I would not call it a ""Breakout – Oscar Worthy"" performance, as I have heard it hyped. In the end, while the movie keeps you interested in terms wanting to know what ultimately happens, I have to give it a slight thumbs down, and the end of the movie I found particularly unsatisfying. I checked, and the critical response is so far very good. I predict this will be one of those films where critics and audiences for the most part are split, and in terms of the critical reaction, I will think of it as ultimately overrated, and not in the it was Good, not Great way. 2 ½ out of 4 Stars."

","Sometimes it feels good to be manipulated. Gone Girl, adapted by Gillian Flynn from her bestselling 2012 novel, delights in yanking our sympathies back and forth right through its 149-minute running time. It's all about Nick (Ben Affleck) and ""Amazing"" Amy (Rosamund Pike), an apparently perfect marriage of creative people. One day Nick comes home to find signs of a struggle and Amy gone. He calls the police. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) kicks off an investigation that will start with a missing person, before transforming into a kidnapping and murder enquiry.<br/><br/>But who's murdering who? And where's the pesky body? The story of how we got to this mysterious place is told by Amy via her diary entries, and by Nick living in the aftermath. One is an unreliable narrator; the other an unreliable suspect. It's the basis for a cruel, classy morality play, with hints of Polanski nastiness and De Palma salaciousness.<br/><br/>The film earns its generous duration by covering a lot of genre ground. We have the domestic drama between Nick and Amy in the form of flashbacks to their crumbling marriage; police procedural; media satire; courtroom conversational; black comedy; and even horror. Fincher mostly gets the balance right. Tyler Perry's hotshot lawyer comes close to cracking a smile and breaking the mask, though I get the feeling that with further viewings the whole film may emerge as some sort of strange, dark comedy. As the satire broadens – Neil Patrick Harris is introduced as a scarily controlling obsessive who could have come from the pen of Stephen King – the humour loses some of its subtlety. But that's no different to the way The Shining winked at the start and then went postal in the final act.<br/><br/>The script is full of wicked wit, and is deliciously precise. The level of detail is matched in the cinematography and the meticulous performances. Director David Fincher is on low-key, efficient form – certainly none of Panic Room's virtuoso swooping, despite a late shift into domestic schlock. The look recalls The Game's uncanny pristine sheen, as does the playful nature of the narrative. Outside the Fincher-sphere, tonally it reminded me of Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects, another melodrama whose increasing silliness is directly relative to its tightening grip.<br/><br/>Affleck is impressive in the main male role. It's a perfect piece of casting, trading on the actor's easy access to smarm as a means of casting constant questions as to his guilt. But the movie belongs to Pike. As if throwing off the shackles of being miscast in so many movies (Jack Reacher, anyone?), she revels in the role of a girl who was a celebrity in childhood and becomes a china doll in adulthood. We get to see what lies beneath, and it isn't nearly as pretty as the façade. It's the sort of Oscar-worthy performance that'll never get the Oscar.<br/><br/>It might not have the mythic depth of Zodiac or the brain-scarring boldness of Seven, but in a sense this is Fincher's scariest film, set as it is now, here (kinda), in the ostensible safety of lovely homes. Given its page-turner appearance, some may argue that the film is 15 minutes too long. I'd say that's simply a matter of time management. Gone Girl is a mainstream movie with genuine thematic depth, exploring the gulf between marriage and love; the way that different crimes are treated by the image-obsessed media; feminism in the 21st century; and the nature of guilt. Few multiplex blockbusters would ask: What is murder? It climaxes with satisfying ambiguity, with an ending that will divide and inspire debate, while we recover from witnessing the birth of a very modern monster."
"mappman728","7","1","10","23 October 2014"," Amazing Amy
","A film of two halves. The first half is a quite gripping police procedural narrative with frequent flashbacks, all of which turn out to be untrue . (Shades of Hitchcock's ""Stage Fright"", although that only had a single lying flashback. ) The second half - still highly watchable - is not as convincing, with a succession of unlikely events, characters and coincidences. The film becomes less and less plausible and by the time it finishes, belief is completely suspended. It's well acted by all concerned, although the two leads are hampered by minimal characterisation. Ben Affleck is handsome but naive and fairly dumb. Rosamund Pike is attractive but homicidally devious - a near relative of the Sharon Stone character in ""Fatal Attraction"", perhaps, though she favours a boxcutter over an ice pick... <br/><br/>The film's publicity has made much play of the source novel's great length, pointing out that some 300 pages had to be cut. The missing pages presumably would resolve some of the implausibilities - Amy's ability to gain access to both her husband's office and her sister-in- law's woodshed in order to plant incriminating clues without either of them noticing, for example. A mini TV series might have been more satisfactory for the audience and done the book more justice."
"valadas","7","1","10","20 October 2014"," A complicated story
","Complicated but well told. Nick and Amy started a love marriage between themselves which lasts 2 years before becoming disharmonious. On the day of the marriage 5th anniversary Amy disappears leaving behind her a scene that suggested she could have been violently kidnapped. This is object of a criminal investigation by the police during which several odd aspects of their marriage are revealed including Nick's infidelity with a young girl. The investigation leads to a murder suspicion falling upon Nick. But from a certain moment on the movie unfolds itself in two alternate sequences in a vivid rhythm: one around Nick and the investigation and the other one around Emy that is alive and running away to disappear and revenge herself by creating a scenery that would lead to Nick's conviction for her supposed murder. This is well told in images and dialogues and has good dramatic scenes and ends up more or less suddenly with a real murder committed by Amy on a former lover which she misrepresents as legitimate defence of a sexual assault. This changes her revenge course and the movie ends with them back together though not in a very harmonious mood. Not a very good ending according to normal moral patterns but this is a movie and not a moral lesson. Not a masterpiece but a movie worth to be seen anyway."
"crijon","7","1","10","15 October 2014"," Underwhelming, but has its moments
","I didn't hate this movie, but I can't say I really liked it either. I hadn't read the book, but I was interested because of David Fincher. I wasn't disappointed, just more underwhelmed.<br/><br/>The issues I had mostly lied with the movie wanting to be too cute and clever with all of the twists. It was like the movie took turns just for the sake of it and on a few occasions they were just absurd. The casting of Neil Patrick Harris didn't work for me. It's nothing against him as an actor, that's just not a role for him. He just felt uncomfortable and out of place in this film. Last but not least this thing really needs a trimming. Easily 20 minutes too long and maybe even 30. It really didn't know when or where to end. Just when you thought it was closing they added on another 10 minutes. Some of that trimming could include some ridiculous scenes like the library sex scene or the TV news sequences of which there were way too many.<br/><br/>I can't believe I'm going to type this next sentence but a bright spot of this film wasTyler Perry. That is the first and last time I will ever give Tyler Perry any type of recognition, but he was quite enjoyable here. Rosamund Pike did put in a great performance, probably worthy of an Oscar nomination. Her voiceovers that appear throughout the film are chilling. As for Ben Affleck, I really don't really have an opinion one way or the other. He bothered me at times in this film especially in the first act. Although the ""smiling"" incident next to the missing poster was morbidly funny for me.<br/><br/>Gone Girl will most certainly be up for awards, all the parts are there for this to be an Oscar nominated film. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it's nowhere near Fincher's best work. While I'm hearing that they stayed very true to the book, maybe that's not always the best thing. Gillian Flynn wrote the book and the screenplay so it's easy to understand that she wanted to mirror her source material, but I felt like Fincher really didn't put much of his spin on this film. Which could be why I was so underwhelmed."

","Gone Girl has been one of the most anticipated films of the year and it surely did not disappoint. Gone Girl's director ,David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en, The Social Network), delivers another slick, powerhouse mystery-thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat from the word 'GO!' Gillian Flynn, author of the best-selling novel, gives an impressive screenplay debut that stays true to it's original source. If you have read the book I'm sure you'll love the film, if you haven't read the book then you're in for a treat.<br/><br/>The film follows Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), after his beautiful wife, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) disappears on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary. Over the course of the next few days, Nick's strange behaviour and evidence gathered leads the nation to ask the gruesome question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? <br/><br/>This may sound like a typical mystery film. Right? But think again, this film has more twists and turns than a roller-coaster at Thorpe Park. Although the film focuses on the disappearance of ""Amazing Amy"", we soon learn about the relationship between Nick and Amy, from the day they met to the day she disappears. Their relationship, up to Amy's disappearance, echoes some relationships across the world and is one that people may relate to.I couldn't help but feel like it was a satire of married couples. I was not expecting this film to be so darkly comical. I found myself and the rest of the audience laughing out loud at a couple of scenes. These comical moments often appear in scenes that we should be feeling remorse,sympathy or frightful. There were also scenes that were purely dark and horrifying. There is one scene, in particular,that may be the most disturbing, scariest movie scenes that I've seen,that tops any horror film for it's thrills and fright.<br/><br/>All the acting was great in the film and I couldn't think of a better cast. Ben Affleck, often put down for his acting skills, is brilliant as Nick Dunne. Affleck is one of the best actors to play Nick,a man who is unsympathetic, blank faced and someone who the audience isn't sure whether they like or not. Rosamund Pike, in her break-through role, is amazing as 'Amazing Amy'. Look out for these two actors at the Oscars next year. The supporting actors were also very good with a lot of lesser known actors involved. It was strange to see Neil Patrick Harris, who's character is Desi Collings, play such a serious, sinister role compared with Barney in How I Met You're Mother. Carrie Coon, who plays Nick Dunne's twin sister Margo, was also exceptionally good and is someone who I'm sure we'll see on our screens again. <br/><br/>Fincher has fantastically directed this masterpiece that shakes us to our very core. Fincher's precision and visual style comes across throughout the film and I couldn't think of anyone better to direct Gone Girl. This precision is a necessity for this film as it's complexity is made easy for the audience to understand. The dark, eerie cinematography is slick and stylish and plays off of the film's dark nature. The screenplay is also wonderfully written and shows us that Gillian Flynn is not only a great author but also a great screenwriter. <br/><br/>I'm sure that Gone Girl will be a big contender at the next Academy Awards. I honestly think this is one of the best films I've seen in a long time and I highly recommend it to anyone. I especially recommend it to David Fincher fans, fans of the book and anyone who loves a good thriller. Gone Girl will leave you stunned and silenced!"

","The answer: THIS.<br/><br/>My review would be a spoiler filled review so if you've not already seen the movie, shut your laptop and go see this movie. This has to be Fincher's finest movie since Fight Club, at least for me it is. When I went in I thought all I am going to see is a missing wife story and how Affleck is framed for that, the media frenzy et all, boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>The story starts with Nick Dunne(Affleck) coming home and finding his wife to have gone missing. Nick files a missing person report and what follows is a media frenzy. This is where the movie strikes gold. Nick is effectively framed, cleared, framed and cleared again. The main culprit it turns out is Amy(Rosamund Pike), or ""Amazing Amy"". Halfway through the movie and you get the big twist, she's alive. I frankly thought that was it, boy was I wrong. Amy's machinations would make Alex Forrest(Fatal Attraction) & Catherine Tramell(Basic Instinct) take notes.<br/><br/>The performances are, as you expect from Fincher, top notch.<br/><br/>This is a solid 9/10.<br/><br/>P.S. Do not make a mistake of taking a date to this movie, as I did."
"Chrismeister","8","1","10","5 October 2014"," The Media has Full Control.
","Gone Girl, it truly captivated me from the very moment it began. An intriguing, engaging and enthralling ride from start to finish. The performances were excellent across the board, Ben Affleck is an actor that continues to shake any doubt from my mind about his talents both in-front and behind the camera. He shines here in a role hand picked for him by David Fincher, as Affleck is familiar with media scrutiny himself. But the real powerhouse performance was by Rosamund Pike, playing the missing wife. She goes to places I would never have expected and continued to shock and surprise me as the film progressed. The entire film builds up and up, the darkness filling every shot more and more. What appears to be a classic hunt for a missing loved one turns into something far more disturbing and sinister. So much of this was helped by a brilliant ad campaign. This managed to reveal very little about the films twists and sub- plots, while remaining entertaining and peaking my interest.The atmosphere created in this film was largely fulfilled by the score. The music was so ominous and dark, it really helped to add to the disturbing and uncomfortable sequences. David Fincher has always been a director who can create incredibly detailed and rich narratives, and his dark, brooding cinematography really adds to the original source material. Gone Girl is one of Finchers finest films, it is one that will remain in my head for many months and perhaps even years. It will be one of the true greats of 2014."
"Andy-296","9","1","10","4 October 2014"," Terrific thriller with a great performance by Rosamund Pike
","A terrific thriller by David Fincher. Twisted and manipulative, in the best sense of the word, this two and a half hours film is based on a very famous book I have not read. Ben Affleck plays Nick as a quintessential average guy. Some years ago she met the well-off Amy (Rosamund Pike, in a stellar, award worthy performance) while living in New York and they eventually married. When his mother got sick, they return to live in his Missouri hometown, where despite their successful facade as a couple, she feels understandably bored by living in a small town. So as the movie starts, we have Nick return to their home in the day of their 5th wedding anniversary, to find Amy has disappeared and there are violent signs in the house. He calls the police, and soon enough, despite his protestations of innocence, incriminating evidence starts appearing against him. The case becomes famous nationally, the media starts to hound him, and soon we know that their marriage was far from picture perfect. But was this enough for him to kill her, in case she is really dead?<br/><br/>In this kind of movies, the reviewer must say as little as possible about the plot. But I have to mention the only problem I have with this film (SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD): I wince during the middle part of the movie, as a particular plot by Amy to exact revenge from her husband is revealed. Without saying anything about it, it seems wholly implausible (I know most thrillers are hardly realistic and work by suspension of disbelief; it just that during that part my disbelief wasn't suspended). The third act which closes the film, though, is great and makes you leave the theater with a smile.<br/><br/>There are some supposedly serious messages in the movie about the nature of marriage and relationships, the perfidy of modern media or the hypocrisy of small town society, but I think you can just enjoy this as a great thriller in the Hitchcock-De Palma tradition. Also with Neil Patrick Harris, Carrie Coon and Emily Ratajkowski, among others in the large cast."

","The book is always better than the movie. So, lets just go ahead of that.<br/><br/>You will be discussing the movie for several hours after. You will regret you didn't read the book first and all your friends have. You will just wish not to have a person like one of those few main characters (of the movie) in your life. But, most essentially, you will hope YOU don't become like one of those. That is how dark and stimulating David Fincher's latest thriller Gone Girl is.<br/><br/>It primarily shows how far we, as human beings have reached. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), a jobless writer finds one morning that his over-indulgent wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. The motor starts making noise just after that, as skeletons start falling from the cupboard, from the heater, from inside the bed, from the warehouse, from a jar in the kitchen, from the tiny nail cavity. Soon we learn what marriage can do to people, if not handled properly. It reminded me of several fictional stories which say that the tiniest matters the most. Imagine the wife Amy as an evolved version of YOURSELF. With few doses of insanity, discipline, and sociopathy.<br/><br/>It throws light at the ranges of sanity and insanity in the world, all at the same time. You may not feel for the characters much after what they do to themselves, but it does become sumptuous food for thought for us. Would you be able to carry out any similar things like those shown in the film? Perhaps not. Gillian Flynn has written a contemporary story about marriage, delusion, and sweet (or bitter) revenge.<br/><br/>Fincher has added the right ingredients in the adaptation, and I am truly impressed with Trent Reznor's score. At the same time, he has missed certain points; the result being a whole different recipe. Gone Girl falls in black comedy genre, which disappoints me. Yeah, add humor, lots of it, but when its proportion surpasses that of the main theme, things go wrong. The book is equally comic if not more, but it never mixed, the hard and soft.<br/><br/>I am in awe with Ben Affleck. His air is fabulous and now I cannot think of any other actor for the role. From that smile in the trailers to his nuanced actions - they all so blend nicely with the story, oh, I cannot stop praising him and helping him chafe the highly earned prejudice off. Rosamund Pike is the showstopper. She is perfect as Amazing Amy. Her eyes spoke all that Flynn might have wanted to convey through the silver. Perry and Harris both are good. Carrie Coon is better.<br/><br/>The score makes you want more, but I am upset they didn't use any track except BOC's ""The Reaper""; the screenplay may not be the best but it suited. Fincher directs his cast brilliantly. The art department has to be lauded for creating a gleam ambiance that fits with the plot. Overall, the film has been handled averagely well with respect to the book.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: May not be THE film of the year, but definitely the thriller of the year. A person MUST watch the film and indulge in the character's insanity, for it will be a difficult affair to experience it in real life. Go ahead and experience no-frilled insanity.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO<br/><br/>TIP: If possible, watch it anywhere but India, for the censorship ruins the film."

","Not to be confused with Affleck's 2007 feature-length directorial debut GONE BABY GONE, this outing is based on Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel of the same name, examining such themes as appearances, dishonesty, marriage and the media. Affleck seeks missing wife Pike, while the press, investigators, friends and even family go from being supportive to suspicious of the worried husband. A story that mirrors the ""Missing white woman syndrome"" clichés with very unconventional results—but not as unpredictable as intended—much of which is told and revealed through a non-chronological timeline.

"CowherPowerForever","7","1","11","18 October 2014"," For Better or Worse
","Gone Girl is a pretty gripping story that tends to carry on too long towards the end of the film. With a run time nearing two and a half hours many will question whether or not this film can keep your attention. I found this the longer run time to be pretty useful, minus the dragging on during the last twenty to thirty minus. With the film dragging at the end and some question decision by some of the characters, it prevents this supposedly Oscar type film from being what it should have been. The following is my review of Gone Girl.<br/><br/>The film was written by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the novel which this film is based off of. This is her first effort at writing a script. For the record, I want to admit that I did not read the book before I watched this film, so I do not know what exactly is changed by this writer/director team. I heard some things were change, but I never looked into for fear of spoilers. Now onto the story. The story itself is very deep, with some very interesting characters. With a long run time, a film like this desperately needs characters that are deep, and that can be carried for a log ride. The film also throws out a few twists throughout the film. This really brings you into the story, as you do not know what is going to happen next. For the most part the writing and the characters are fine. For the most part. There is a good bit of lazy police and detective work going on during this film. Almost like an episode of Law & Order if you will. There are a few instances where you wonder to yourself if the writer and director are even paying attention to what is going on during filming. These instances bring down what could have been an Oscar winning effort. Gillian Flynn, for the most part delivers a very interesting detective story about a husband trying to help find his missing wife. Even though there are some deeper problems, I don't feel they are big enough to call the film bad.<br/><br/>The film was directed by David Fincher who is known for films such as Se7en, Fight Club, and more recently films like The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I generally felt Fincher delivered a great detective story if you will. He is really a fantastic director, even if I don't enjoy all of his films. Adapting a book to the big screen is often a hard challenge. Having the author of the novel help you out is a key aspect to this film. Fincher excels in keeping our attention for a pretty log run time, with some good twists and turns that are delivered amazingly. As I mention above the film is not without its faults, and at certain times it will leave you wondering if anyone was paying attention on set. Fincher is a fabulous director, but top directors need to catch simple mistakes that he missed. The acting is in fact great. Word before the film was released was that it would be a contender for film of the year, and in turn some acting nominations as well. Ben Affleck delivers a strong and effective performance alongside Rosamund Pike who in my opinion is generally underrated in the acting department. However, in my opinion, Tyler Perry steals the show among the secondary actors. I never enjoyed a movie with Tyler Perry because of the type of films he generally does. However, Perry fits this much more serious role perfectly. Fincher falls short of greatness because of some glaring errors that should have been an easy fix, however the story along with his fabulous directing for the most part still makes this film overall a good film. Just not award winning writing.<br/><br/>The film was scored by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Both have worked with David Fincher on films like The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I generally felt the score was very deep, and compelling. It added some nice depth to the film. I wouldn't consider it to be one of the best of the year, however the effort from Reznor and Ross is pretty good overall. The score is not memorable, but it still adds some much needed depth.<br/><br/>Overall, Gone Girl simply falls flat when you take into account the huge hype it has been receiving. The story unravels in a few areas, like an episode of Law & Order would, but with some fantastic acting and nice shooting by David Fincher, this film is still a good effort overall. Those who like a good detective story will be interested in this film, and those worried about the long run time should put that worrying aside as the film delivers some nice and effective plot twists.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Gone Girl was a thought provoking thrill ride that was quite enjoyable but falls apart when closely examined. <br/><br/>The performances by Affleck, Pike and Coon were spot on; from the very first scene they were believable.

I have seen that performance by him many times before. <br/><br/>The directing was great; Fincher did a great job of not revealing any of many twists and turn that movie takes. I was sucked in emotionally from the start. At times it was difficult to understand the dialog; I think a sound editing problem. <br/><br/>The reason I gave it 7 out of 10 was the major plot holes, which I believe was the writing. For example, Amy purchasing the Craig's list car, Amy making the ""tip"" about the woodshed, Amy's drive home covered in blood...also as the movie progressed the police became more and more inept closing in on Keystone Cops levels. <br/><br/>Despite writing problems, I recommend seeing Gone Girl just for outstanding acting performances"

","What a discussion starter. Fincher is back with another mystery thriller and it is an insane success. It has its share of flaws, but nearly everything about it is crafted so well. <br/><br/>From the trailers, a series of questions arise: did Nick Dunne murder his wife, Amy? And from that, the journey begins. Right from the start of the film, I noticed that things are different. As he has been doing for his past few films, Fincher's style has been slightly changing each time. The editing and cutting of this film is quite interesting; it's easy to notice the difference as it's so much more fast paced than usual. It works for the film but I am curious to see if there is a longer director's cut in which the editing is different. <br/><br/>Besides that, much of Fincher's visual and atmospheric style is visible as usual. Beautifully shot and colored, the feel of the film is strange, almost ephemeral, fitting the mysterious tone. Fincher and his team by this point are masters at their craft, and they excel in giving us the right shots to tell the story. Trent Reznor returns to work on the soundtrack (from The Social Network) and once again adds that final, chilling piece to the scenes. Every time a score begins, everything intensifies in an unsettling manner. <br/><br/>Technicalities aside though, the stars of the show surprise in a great way. Ben Affleck plays Nick superbly, providing us so many layers in his character that are revealed one by one as the scenes progress. Still, Rosamund Pike surprisingly takes the spotlight in the best role that I've ever seen her in. Not usually in these types of films, I was impressed with her performance in playing such a delicate and complex character. Along with the help of the writing of the film, these two are so perfectly likable and hate-able at the same time. Simply put, their situation is captivating, and that's where the film succeeds. <br/><br/>The mysteries of this film, as I said before, are discussion starters. Hour by hour, Fincher reveals more and more to the audience. It has nothing to do with surprise twists really, but the content itself is often so shocking and raw that it keeps you hooked and wanting more. That results in the hardest part at the end, not because the ending in itself is bad, but because it leaves me wanting so much more. <br/><br/>Of course, we won't get it. Fincher has left us with an incredible piece of filmmaking, mystery, and questions. Oscar nominations for the cast and the film's technical aspects would not be a surprise. ""Gone Girl"" comes highly recommended. RATING: [8.7/10]"

","I've always loved movies that are morally ambiguous - they lead you to places Hollywood usually avoids like the plague. In ""Gone Girl"", director Fincher and writer Gillian Flynn boldly go there - deep into Hitchcock territory. ""Gone Girl"" a throwback dark mystery in which a flawed alpha male butts heads with an icy, manipulative blonde... In other words, it's Fincher's ""Basic Instinct"", which was Verhoeven's ""Vertigo"".<br/><br/>Like the aforementioned films, you should read as little as possible about plot or storyline, and just go see it. At the least, you'll have an opinion about it. Even if it's not a perfect film - Fincher's style gets a little too exacting at times, obscuring deeper layers - it's my top movie of 2014 so far, boldly dark and always unpredictable. The entire cast excels. It's not often 149 minutes fly by.<br/><br/>Oh, and a fearless prediction: Rosamund Pike will win an Academy Award."

","My second review this week is on yet another book translated into a movie. In what is sure to be the leading movie in the box office this weekend, this next film is all about drama, suspense, and thrills. Pre opening reviews showed promise for this thriller, most critics stating how good the production of this film is. Can it be true? Have we actually achieved another good rendition of a book? I'll do my best to not spoil everything, as I review Gone Girl. <br/><br/>In a thriller, we expect a certain quality to hook us into the tale. Unfortunately, many movies either go so extreme that the story is ridiculous, or lose our interest because they can't keep the flames alive. Not the case in Gone Girl. This story grabs your attention from the get go, forgoing a prolonged introduction and diving right into the scene at hand. We've all been hooked into movies with missing people, the inquisitive mind wondering if that person is alive and what nightmare they are going through. In addition to this curiosity, Gone Girl does something else that keeps you into the madness; it slowly reveals the aspects of the plot. Scene by scene we are treated to another piece of the puzzle that sets up the history of the characters and the secrets they hold. The order to which they present is logical and strategically planned, culminating in a mass of scenes that are well designed and emotional. For this reviewer, all the scenes made sense, and all of them were relevant to the story, a thing that is very rare to see these days. Of course the brilliance of this movie is the changes in direction this movie takes. Not too drastic a turn, Gone girl's plot elements are fantastic for keeping you involved, changing up just enough to keep things interesting all around. I think what I loved the most is the cleverness behind the entire movie and the strategic plot development that takes place. Those who have read the book know what I'm talking about, but for those who haven't I assure you that a majority will be pleased. <br/><br/>Of course the drama is only one aspect of this movie, in truth Gone Girl's tale is truly brought to life by the acting. Ben Affleck surprised me greatly in this film, for once not annoying me with his choice of style. Young Affleck plays the part of sociopathic disturbance quite well, bringing about a quiet intensity and intense edge. What I thought would be a rather boring role was a surprise with the emotional roller coaster his character goes through. Sad, angry, mortified, all of these qualities are nicely mixed together in his performance, and well acted to the point where I believe he is this character. Playing his opposite is Rosamund Pike who also surprised me in this role. Pike's sexy voice is seductive, smooth and elegant yet strong enough to induce doubt in the relationship. She also did a great job playing a character I really hated, the flashbacks of her enough to drive me crazy and define her as the five letter word for a female dog. Pike made a great commitment to her role, bringing all of her qualities to life with a natural flare and edge. Tyler Perry steps out of his Madea dress, and back into the serious role as he plays the ace attorney. No surprise, Perry is good at playing the stereotypical expert lawyer, filled with arrogance and overzealous discipline to keep the game of strategy going. <br/><br/>However there are a few things about this movie I didn't necessarily like. First thing is some of the over the top dark moments. I appreciate the dark humor in this movie, the movie showing the fickleness of humans one of the most entertaining aspects. Yet, they overstep their boundaries in a few scenes, going into the land of the demented and gruesome in some of the characters behaviors. One scene in particular is rather graphic, the blood covering the scene in a rather disturbing display. Those who love such an edge, such as what is seen in Game of Thrones, will be desensitized to this madness, but others want to be prepared for the carnage. A second weakness is the length of the movie. Again I state that all of the info presented fit well into the movie, and most if not all was needed. Did it need to be over 2 hours long though? I don't think so. At times you don't feel the length of the movie, but there are some points that bring the fatigue on. Some editing would have been welcomed, but I can live with the extra scenes if I had to. Finally the language is not my favorite either. I know I'm a bit sensitive when it comes to language, but this movie said a word that I can't stand, and even though it is completely appropriate, it still gets me a little bit. <br/><br/>Overall Gone Girl is a fantastic tale, filled with an engaging story that keeps you on your toes. Fantastic acting helps bring the world to life and the dark elements to it are more than welcome. However, it is almost a two and half hour investment and a bit long winded at points. Worth a trip to the theater? I think it is, though there really isn't any quality to this movie that is augmented by the bigger screen. What are my scores?

"Quinoa1984","10","1","12","11 November 2014"," A story about one thing, but also (or really) about something else
","Gone Girl would appear to be, from the book by Gillian Flynn (also the writer), about marriage, and love and trust, and what happens in a marriage after that trust is broken and people can't be together the same way again. One has seen this before - one of Fincher's influences, Kubrick, certainly had that with Eyes Wide Shut in a way - and will again in movies and fiction. But what's startling and makes Gone Girl much more impactive is that Flynn and David Fincher are out to look at something else (and something Fincher has in small part before): the media and perception. <br/><br/>But both sides are compelling, and the merging of the two topics on display in the film, of the twisting of relationships and twists of the media screws, make for a helluva movie experience The film is split in two parts really, and the divider has to do with what happens when (SPOILER) Amy Dunn explains what her whole plan is to the audience. Before this, we only hear her thoughts from her diary. This is chronicling her relationship with Nick (Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck respectively), who first meet in one of those clever meet-cutes that isn't super cute and shows how each is quick-witted and good at talk, almost like Fincher doing a bit of 30's screwball (which he's done, in his cool-quirky manner in Fight Club). And they do love each other, and each other's bodies, as Amy even says ""We are so cute together"", and then... things happen, jobs are lost, money goes, they have to move back to Nick's hometown in Missouri, and little by little, what's the line: love fades.<br/><br/>Or does it? Amy basically decides to take revenge against Nick, who in her diary she claims abused her (if only briefly) and neglected her. Clearly, neither side is all peaches and cream in the marriage - by plotting an entire narrative, which we see unfold via traps set and stages set in the first act, for Nick to be framed for murder. It's one of those turns of the plot that had me lean forward and get far more engaged than I even was before, and the first act is entertaining and dramatic and well-acted and all-that-and-a-bag-of-Fincher-Chips enough. In a way it turns into a ""movie"" arguably, along the lines of a trashy De Palma thriller where the woman is an iceberg-cold femme fatale who will get her 'Average Joe' any way she can.... only here's the catch: she is plotting everything for the cops, but it's the media that she never really thinks of, at least in much depth.<br/><br/>Really, it's in the TV shows, especially the likes that we see with the Nancy Grace clone who plots every step of the Nick/Amy marriage and all of the little beats - i.e. the 'best friend' Amy makes so cheekily (and hilariously in a dark way) because she's 'dumb' and doesn't know any better - and can speculate up the ass and... create perception. Gone Girl explores what happens in rather chilling, pitch-black comic detail what happens when people have to bend to what all those cameras, all those vans and reporters and interviews and the ""public"" face do to people. And, most interesting of all, how it even twists the one pulling the 'strings' as it were. <br/><br/>It's interesting to note that Amy's previous messed-up relationships - one involving a simple heartbreak (but not quite so as we find out, Neil Patrick Harris!) and another with a testing-ground for what happened with Nick - don't get interviewed by the press. Why not? Story hole? Perhaps more was in the book and left out the film. Or, you know, it doesn't work for this story.<br/><br/>This all may not be quite as deep or meaningful as some of Fincher's other great films, Fight Club and Zodiac especially and maybe Social Network to an extent, but there is still a lot to chew on just by what characters do, how they react, how they're trying to think and move steps ahead, or back, or forward. It's a devilish chess-game of a story, and the actors are completely game - even Tyler Perry, who for me was a super wild card given his past films - with Ben Affleck totally convincing as a man who we aren't totally sure about (is he true to himself, or us, or to anyone, or is he just totally exasperated like any number of husbands out there), and Pike just about perfect as this calculating woman who changes before our eyes.<br/><br/>And this all may be totally manipulative for us too, not simply how the characters become manipulated and twisted by the narratives spun and perceptions made. But for me, I couldn't tell where this story would go from scene to scene, and the mistakes the characters make are very human, stupid errors that make them more... is endearing the word? Just entertaining I guess. Fincher's made a long, occasionally VERY violent and sexy, and maybe dangerous movie. And it does what a lot of movies that last can do: be about more than one thing, and keep the quality to a top level."
"matthewssilverhammer","7","1","12","11 October 2014"," Too Big and Imposing an Effort to Ignore
","To describe the plot of Gone Girl as ""nuts"" would be more than precise. Starting as a fairly rudimentary mystery, it becomes a twisting, twisted study of marital vows that keeps you guessingand rarely accurately. Do not be fooled, however; GG has problems. First, its identity: Is it a tense mystery, a comedic satire of media, a critique of the American family, or a messy mix of all of those? Second, its message: To say that the film has a pessimistic view of marriage is an understatement. Nonetheless, when focused on its strengths (enigmatic plotting, tense character arcs), GG will twist your heart right into your throat. The plot is impossible to fully describe spoiler-free. At its base, it's the story of a husband reeling from the disappearance of his wife and his own accused involvement. Other than some jarring overacting (ie ""Nancy Grace""-inspired pundit, crazed neighbor), the performances are strong. Affleck is a protagonist that's hard to root for, but I'm not sure we're really being asked to. He does a commendable job, leading us to analyze his every decision. There are stellar performances by Coon as Affleck's sister, Dickens as the detective, and Perry as the Cochran-like defense lawyer. The breakout however, and clear Oscar front-runner, is Pike, turning in a complex and disciplined performance as the titular Gone Girl. Fincher is a darkly-visionary director, and his murky eye is ever-present in this brooding universe. It only falters when he reaches to play in sweetness and wit, confusing the tone. Overall though, GG is a dark, foreboding crime-thriller that is much too big and imposing to ignore."
"j-madej","10","1","12","5 October 2014"," ""Gone Girl"" is a refreshing breath of fresh air, through perspective on genre that needed oxygen for quite some time.
","Whenever I hear a rumors about an Oscar contention about a movie that I haven't seen it yet and I do not feel any type of interest after watching a trailer, I always come to a screening unsure what to expect and often my assumption is, that probably I will not like the movie. Specially if two main actors playing the leads do not belong to the group of actors I normally would spend the money to see. Mostly mainstream entertainment can be quite shallow, directed to mass audience which often is interested in form of easy going escapism rather then intellectual pursuit. I knew that ""Gone Girl"" was directed by David Fincher, director whom I deeply admire for his body of work, but anyone can have a bad day or a movie in his case. Fincher started in the commercial world and was known for his unique sense of visually narrative style that eventually translated in to a big Hollywood feature film career, arguably becoming top 5 best director in the business. Ben Affleck on the other hand is not my cup of tea. I always felt that he is overrated as an actor (his brother Casey Affleck in my opinion is much better actor) but got a second chance as a director and I think that is were he can develop further considering his earlier directorial success with Gone Baby Gone, The Town and specially Oscar winning Argo. Based on the casting alone I really thought that I will hate ""Gone Girl"" but how wrong was I. I underestimated intelligence of David Fincher and his understanding of the fact that movies are made in casting. What I mean by that, is that if you hire suitable actors to play a characters that in some way might be a part of who they are in real life they will be able to bring that persona to life and create a performances that are not forced, but rooted in truth, honed by the director who slowly becomes observer instead a parent figure that has to teach them how to act, or safe their performance in editing room. Rosamond Pike might get the nomination. The fact of her giving up on her vanity will help with that.<br/><br/>""On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife?""<br/><br/>To be accurate with assessment of this film one word can describe in detail and that is SMART. Yes indeed!!! For movie that is 150 minutes long and you enjoy every minute of it, in fact you want more, that is success in itself. I will not write in-depth about the twists and turns of the story to not spoil the experience for you, but all I will say is that ""Gone Girl"" is arguably the smartest and most complex character driven story of this year and if that is not worth the Oscar contention then I don't know what is... The acting is superb from all the ensemble, developing reach and multi layered characterizations, staring with snobby yet charming Rosamund Pike who shows her dimensions in more way then one, possibly stealing the movie (and maybe getting Oscar contention in the process) in terms of performance. The support cast shines too but only serving the purpose of helping to unveil the complex story.<br/><br/>David Fincher's directorial taste needs to be credited with handling some of the most intense scenes with doze of huge technical know how using sound design and editing pacing of how to stimulate the senses of the audience without venturing in to the territory of the a bad taste. And indeed Fincher might be as Alfred Hitchcock 50 years before him a king of knowing how to build up a tension without reviling to much and keeping the audience guessing till the final scene. Big credit should also go to the editor Kirk Baxter who lets the scenes just run enough and stops them almost before most editors would, creating sense of anticipation and hight state of tension. This is why the pacing is just right and in general you can see that Fincher has a musical ear having music video background. By watching ""Gone Girl"" another Fincher's movie comes to mind The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which is a remake of 2009 Swedish drama thriller based on the novel of the same name by Swedish author/journalist Stieg Larsson (Män som hatar kvinnor – literally – Men who hate women) Indeed both films have a lot in common and that is the antipathy towards women. I don't know Fincher's family life, but judging from the movies he is selecting he might have some scorn towards female kind. Judgment aside ""Gone Girl"" is truly a movie that will surprise you and make you wonder were is the story going in the age of remakes and scripts written by the numbers. It is a refreshing breath of fresh air, through perspective on genre that needed oxygen for quite some time.<br/><br/>For more of my film reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"
"estebangonzalez10","9","1","12","7 October 2014"," David Fincher does it again
","""What are you thinking? What are you feeling? What have we done to each other? What will we do?""<br/><br/>David Fincher has exceeded my high expectations once again with this brilliant thriller starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. I have so many things to say about Gone Girl that I simply don't know where to begin. First of all, anyone who loves movies knows how stylish Fincher's films are and how meticulous he is with each project. He creates interesting characters and he knows how to set the right mood for his films. In Gone Girl he does just that creating a tense and moody thriller which all of a sudden switches gears on us with unexpected twists and genre shifts. In one moment you are watching a suspenseful thriller and then all of a sudden you find yourself laughing at the dark humor presented in the story with each new dark revelation. It is a unique experience for the audience and I enjoyed every second of its 150 minute runtime. It is very close to being another masterpiece from Fincher, although Se7en and Fight Club still remain my favorite from his rich filmography. Bringing back his usual collaborators for the musical score, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, also played a key role in the success of this film which helped improve the mood to an already suspenseful and eerie atmosphere. Jeff Croneweth's cinematography also stands out in Gone Girl making every shot gorgeous to look at. <br/><br/>I've given David Fincher a lot of credit for his work because he is one of the most talented directors in Hollywood right now, but I also have to give praise to Gillian Flynn's wonderful screenplay adaptation of her own novel because it is outstanding. A lot of the success this film is receiving is due to the wonderful narrative structure Gone Girl has. The way it is presented in non-linear fashion is beautifully paced together. The first half of this film begins like your ordinary forensic mystery investigation where you try to guess what may have happened or what motives were behind the disappearance of the female lead character. As the investigation goes on, we get flashbacks narrated by this missing person where she explains how she met her husband and how everything unraveled after those first few years of marriage where everything seemed perfect. The less you know about this film before going into it, the more you are surprised by it. I am glad I hadn't read the novel before because it was a pleasure to experience how the narrative structure of the film unfolded before me with every twist and shift of tone. Flynn has written a crazy novel which plays out as a satire and a social commentary on marriage and the effect the media has on public perception. It is a story about perceptions and how we put on masks to pretend we are something we aren't in front of others. It has a few things to say about marriage and how couples try to change each other or pretend to be something they aren't in order to win the other's affection. As you watch Gone Girl you can't help but imagine how much fun Fincher and Flynn were having as they dissected some common problems couples have in marriage. Of course everything is overblown in this satire and you will find yourself laughing at several of the situations presented (especially in the second half of the film), but it does have an underlying message and a purpose. I thought it was quite a witty commentary on marriage and society, and for that I have to give Flynn credit for the wonderful story she has written, and of course Fincher takes advantage of that and creates a stylized and fun trashy film that is beautifully shot and edited.<br/><br/>When you go into a Fincher film you know you will get great performances out of him because he brings the best out of his actors. Ben Affleck and Rosemund Pike are superb in the lead roles. He is perfect as this enigmatic husband who is lacking empathy in the publics eyes. Pike gives an icy and memorable performance as her character is hard to decipher at first and our perception of her shifts as the movie moves on. She is simply great. As much as I enjoyed the lead performances, I have to say that what really surprised me here were the secondary actors. Who would have thought that Tyler Perry could have pulled off his role as the charismatic lawyer so well. He has several funny scenes and he was a great addition. My favorite performance in this film came from Carrie Coon (who I really like in The Leftovers series) who plays Affleck's twin sister. She had some strong dramatic scenes and had great on screen chemistry with Affleck. I hope she receives a nomination for her role here because she absolutely pulled it off. Kim Dickens who plays the detective in charge of the investigation was also great. These were all interesting characters who played key roles in the success of this moody thriller. Many people complained about Neil Patrick Harris's performance, but I think the main issue I had with him wasn't his performance, but his character. There are also some over the top violent scenes that didn't work too well, but for a satire Fincher pulls it off just fine because he knows that this is an exaggerated pulpy film and lets the audience have fun with it. Gone Girl was one of my most anticipated films for 2014, and after watching it I have to say it exceeded my expectations; I had a crazy fun time with it and it deserves all the praise it's getting."
"MovieDude1893","10","1","12","6 October 2014"," A twisting and twisted popular entertainment
","Full disclosure: I've read the book and think this is more than a cracking adaptation-- It's a near total improvement across the board. That said, I became so caught up with the shape of the adaptation that a second viewing will better clarify the meanings at work.<br/><br/>What GONE GIRL is about more than mystery, misogyny, money, or any other m-word: If you think you have ""truth"" on your side, you're clueless. I spent so much of it grinning from ear to ear. The humor is as pitch black as you've heard, with one punchline near the end that's way too easy (you'll know it when you hear it). But still, Fincher's in fine form; he and editor Kirk Baxter massage the 2.5 hour runtime into a steadily compelling thriller. Affleck and Pike are both excellent, each walking the emotional razor's edge that Fincher and writer Flynn have established for them. The script is a marvelous adaptation in the sense that it keeps so much of Flynn's original text and improving on it in more than a few cases. Still, if there's a reason GONE GIRL can occasionally strike its points a little too explicitly it can be linked to the script. These instances are few and far between, however. The lasting impression of GONE GIRL is that it's a twisting and twisted popular entertainment likely to see few equals on American cineplex screens this year."
"jannghi","10","1","12","6 October 2014"," I absolutely loved it!!!
","I read the book on which this movie is based in February and could not wait till the movie came out. For the next few months I watched trailer for the movie and was even more excited for the movie to come out. When it came out this past weekend, I went in excited and left enjoying it. I believe Ben Affleck was perfect for the male lead. And though I'd seen Rosamund Pike in only a few other movies, I though she was great as the wife. And the rest of the cast was great, too. It was a very suspenseful movie as was the book which I'd read in five days. It's been some time since I'd seen a movie that was two-and-half hours long, but this was worth the long running time. After months of waiting to see this, I was as pleased as I'd hoped I'd be. I will definitely be getting the DVD of this one. if you read the book, you must see the movie."
"Joe_Chadowski","7","1","12","6 October 2014"," A heartwarming romance for the whole family!
","Never have I been badgered so hard to read a book in my life. It's amusing how bookworms crawl out of the woodwork when a film adaptation of their beloved book comes out, defending the art of reading as if film is the enemy. And to be honest, I think most of them are full of hot air. And they miss the point. Comparing a film to a book is like comparing a yacht to a private plane; Sure the literal purpose and end result are the same, but the means and the experience between Point A and Point B are built to appeal to different tastes. Besides, if you compare the two you'll end up faulting the yacht for its inability to fly....<br/><br/>Of course, it helps that Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl adapted by the novelist herself, making it mostly true to the book. Gone Girl is the dark, twisty, neo-noir tale of a suburban man Nick Dunne (Gigli's Ben Affleck) who is thrust into the spotlight after his beautiful wife Amy (ex-bond girl Rosamund Pike) disappears one day. It's cut-and-dry murder mystery stuff until suspicious clues are discovered, hinting Nick may be the guilty party. And his less than normal antics in the wake of his wife's disappearance don't help either. Did he do it? What happened to her?<br/><br/>More on Flynn's script and story later. Fincher is in his element here. And if you don't know what that means, it means Gone Girl is a perfectly cast (yes, even Tyler Perry and Barney Stinson), darkly toned, sharply spoken, agonizingly suspenseful foray into the scum of white-collar America. The performance from the cast is phenomenal, everyone in front of the camera absolutely nailing it, especially Rosamund Pike and Carrie Coon. The camera-work is vintage Fincher; he keeps things up close and personal, giving us a choking feeling of intimacy with the depraved story. With a lack of wide- angle shots, Fincher uses quick, calculated camera cuts to point your attention exactly where it needs to be. A lingering mind is not an option here.<br/><br/>Taken at surface value, it can seem like a Godsend to have the screenplay for a film written by the author of the novel the film will be based on. Yet it's gone wrong more times than not, because it is extraordinarily difficult to jump between storytelling mediums, regardless of your talent in either one of them. But Gillian Flynn's adaption of her own novel is the best screenplay-by- the-author I've witnessed. It's suitably dark, intriguing, ambiguous and witty, but it still isn't the best it could have been. It lacks flow, instead of the seamless buildup of suspense it was capable of. Gone Girl has jarring tonal shifts that abruptly up the suspense, and misplaced punch lines sprinkled throughout that snap you out of the trance the story puts you under.<br/><br/>The remainder of my criticism remain so small and nigh-on- insignificant, they pass at pretentious rantings of a wannabe film critic with deluded with the hollow satisfaction of smearing an otherwise incredible film. But I can assure you my size 10.5s remain firmly on the ground. Gone Girl does not have the gut-wrenching heft, or hyper-concentrated precision of best thrillers of its kind. In fact, especially when compared against Fincher's other work, Gone Girl gives off a mainstream vibe that is slightly off-putting. A vibe that gets more apparent after the mid-film climax. And, while 90-95% of the film has Fincher's discernible directing style and feel, there are moments where Gone Girl looses it's way and feels generic. Again, I'm nitpicking here.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a brilliant, twisted masterpiece of a film. Flynn's script exploits your threshold of what you're willing to put yourself through, drags you through hell, and still doesn't make you regret taking the tour. In fact it's so amazing I needed two paragraphs just to explain what keeps it from perfection. Such is the quality of films in the league Gone Girl is in that perfection is the benchmark. Gone Girl is an achievement in cohesive filmmaking, once again proving what makes a film immortal is not a standalone feature, but when every element of filmmaking rises in unison to the same level of brilliance. Fincher, you son of a bitch, you've done it again."

","When Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), returns home one day to find his home trashed and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing, he realizes something isn't right. Immediately he contacts Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit). As the two begin to investigate the home, they begin to sense something peculiar about the break-in, as well as Nick's behavior. He then turns to his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) for support as the case begins to escalate and the media strongly begins to believe Nick has something to do with Amy's disappearance.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the film's screenplay, director David Fincher brings this dark and mystery-filled story to life. The film goes back and forth between the present, and flashbacks shown through Amy's diary entries that lead up to her disappearance. The film runs at two and a half hours, but the film hooks you right away and never lets go. The story begins to build just as much as the evidence does until it leads to many twists and turns. It is also very excellently filmed, much like Fincher's previous films, he wants to bring the viewer into the world that characters live in by really focusing on the setting and the character's themselves. But what stands out the most in the top-notch performances by the cast. Every single actor/actress in the film gives it their all. Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit do a great job of representing the viewers as the two cops divided. Dickens does a solid job of showing her conflict of whether or not she wants to believe Nick. Whereas Fugit brings a lot of humor as the skeptical character who doesn't believe Nick for a second. Carrie Coon who plays Affleck's sister in the film, provides us with the most likable character. She's not afraid to say what's on her mind, she's blunt and hilarious, but she's also the shoulder that Nick needs in the end and we really sense the bond between the two actors. Ben Affleck gives the performance of his career as a man caught in a web mystery. He gets so into character by showing two sides of his character that leaves the audience baffled of whether to believe he had something to do with his wife's disappearance or not. Finally, Rosamund Pike gives the best performance of the film as Amy Dunne, a wife who at first found herself deeply in love, but slowly beginning to grow unsure of her husband and his motives. The character of Amy herself is also so complex and Pike sells it to us all the way.<br/><br/>Overall, David Fincher's Gone Girl, is easily the best film adaptation of a novel that I have seen thus far. It has much to thank from the novel's author and screenwriter Gillian Flynn, the perfect direction of David Fincher, and the spot-on performances from its entire cast. It is top-notch mystery thriller that keeps you reeled in until the very last scene.<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10"

","Director David Fincher has made a fantastic career out of making us uncomfortable with ourselves. He's exposed our love of materialism (Fight Club), our inherent ""need"" to be successful in the eyes of others (The Social Network), he even made us visualize what we would look like as old.....man babies (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). Now he brings us his latest entry into his collection of the the shamefulness of man, Gone Girl.<br/><br/>Gone Girl surrounds Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who returns home one day to find his home broken into and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. The police are called and we are set off on a journey to find the ""Amazing Amy""and complications arise as evidence begins to build up and we are to think that perhaps Nick isn't as innocent as he appears. We learn about who he and Amy were and how the developments of their relationship have led to her disappearance and the ensuing case.<br/><br/>For anyone that has read the novel version by Gillian Flynn (who also penned the screenplay) you will be deeply satisfied as the film is a truly loyal adaptation and worries over the news of a changed ending should be dismissed immediately. Affleck does an admirable job portraying Nick, but to be fair, this wasn't a particularly challenging role to play. That isn't taking anything away from Affleck because he did exactly what he had to do to be a convincing Nick. He had to be good looking, likable, a ""good old boy"" from Missouri who enjoyed a simple life with measured aspirations. There isn't anyone who could have played Nick better and when you see the film, you can't picture anyone else playing but Affleck. Similar to Mark Wahlbergs role in ""The Fighter"", Affleck serves as a vehicle for the meatier supporting performances of the characters around him.<br/><br/>That brings us to Rosamund Pike and her star making turn as Amy Dunne. Now, Amy is not a supporting role by any stretch, although you could argue she is in the first half, because if there is a true leading performance in this film it is her as Amy, one of the most interesting and complex female characters in recent memory. Pike has been around the business, but she falls under that category of ""that girl from that thing"" as she doesn't necessarily have any distinguishing features that set her apart from the other stunningly beautiful actresses of Hollywood. That is why she was the perfect person to play Amy. Amy Dunne is an enigma, the image of perfection and someone who has always managed to blend in anywhere and with anyone. She has been brought up to believe she was perfect (her parents profited off of her with a series of children's books known as the ""Amazing Amy"" series), and it has become part of her D.N.A. to manipulate herself around different people and different environments so she can never shake that image. Pike gives the right amount of sexy and sadistic...beautiful and bat sh** crazy.<br/><br/>We also get good work from Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry (surprisingly) but it all comes back to the man behind the camera, Mr. Fincher. Fincher just seems to do things differently from other directors and that's what has set him apart from others and why many of his films have come to have cult followings over the years. It is also why he has become one of the most wanted directors, not just by film companies, but by actors. People have recognized Finchers' unique ability to read an audience and know what to do to give them not only what they want, but what they need to see/hear/ and feel with his films. This is why he does things a little differently then others. This is why we see the likes of Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who both won an Oscar for working on a previous Fincher film, The Social Network) because he knows they provide the ""right"" feel and sound for the film. This is why we find ourselves laughing throughout the film, not because what is happening is funny, but because it's uncomfortable and awkward and it's the only way we can find ourselves reacting to what happens on screen. This is why we do find the curious casting choices like Harris, Perry, and others. Not because he knows they will bring people into theaters, that is what Affleck is for, but because they are right.<br/><br/>What Fincher has done to us in this film is question the whole idea of marriage. This is the most dangerous date movie ever made because you will walk out of it forever questioning the intentions for your significant other. Anyone who is married knows that they have roles to play here and there and as the marriage goes on and you become used to your mate and their tendencies, where do you go from there? It may seem obvious because you would think that it is your mate and their tendencies that made you want to marry them in the first place, but does it all become an act after awhile? Is marriage merely a competition between two people to see who can not disappoint the other. Do we create these standards for marriage that see us always trying to perfect ourselves so that our loved ones don't begin to resent us and feel superior. ""Gone Girl"" makes marriage seem like a constant dick measuring contest and that it's really two people always trying to one up the other to prove they are the better spouse. It's exhausting to witness and think about....which makes it so....damn...good.<br/><br/>Hope the rest of your date goes well!....."

","I did not read the book of know anything about Gillian Flynn beyond the fact that she adapted her book for the movies screenplay. Therefore, I did not realize that this would be more for my money than an excellent suspense thriller or a did-he or didn't he movie. This turned out to be such a clever and meticulous spider web of plotting and counter-plotting, that it was difficult to keep up with all of its twists and turns. What made it especially difficult to keep up with once we were an hour into the film was that I kept laughing from the pitch-dark American-values comedy that flowed naturally from the situations and character's motivations. <br/><br/>If you enjoy intricate plots that are perfectly executed and a thinking person's thriller, you will not be disappointed. If you also enjoy movies that comment on the absurdities of society and marriage and the needs to please the masses, you will be even more happily surprised. And if you like movies with great co-star performances and great supporting performances all around, you will love this movie. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if you want a reality escape where the good guys are all good and the bad guys are all bad, skip Gone Girl and go see The Equalizer or A Walk Among the Tombstones. This movie requires all of your gray matter to appreciate it."

","GONE GIRL (2014) ***1/2 Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, Patric Fugit, David Clennon, Lisa Banes, Missi Pyle, Emily Ratajkowski, Casey Wilson, Lola Kirke, Boyd Holbrook, Sela Ward, Scoot McNairy. Filmmaker David Fincher once again plumbs the murky underpinnings of America in his excellent adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best seller about a young married couple (Affleck and Pike working expertly in shades of grey and dare I say Oscar worthy turns both) in the throes of unraveling particularly when the beautiful wife suddenly disappears on the day of their 5th wedding anniversary, leaving handsome hubby in the breeze (and under the microscope) by the local authorities investigating and the media pricking new wounds for the masses to savor. Wickedly clever and full of unexpected twists and turns (not exactly Hitchcockian but then again) thanks to Flynn's adaptation of her own novel that cheekily runs rampant with the institution of marriage, fidelity and other mores socially adept. Fincher keeps the tension taut and knotty but plays fair with flashbacks and fade outs when things just start to become boilerplate pot boiling innuendos and secrets and lies. While the film easily could've whittled here and there (admittedly I may be the only one on the planet not having read the source book) the resolute ending may be just to good to be true. Then again maybe not."

","Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) lives in the small, riverside Missouri town that he grew up in. It hasn't always been so. For a number of years, Nicky worked in Manhattan as a journalist, where he met his brilliant wife, Amy (Rosamunde Pike). Also a writer, Amy grew up in the area, with two somewhat famous author-parents, who concocted a young lady's series of books called Amazing Amy. But, the economy took a nosedive and both young marrieds lost their jobs. At the same time, Nick's mother got breast cancer so the couple decided to move back to the Show Me State. Nick opens a bar with some of Amy's trust fund while Amy ponders her next move. One morning, alas, Nick is called home by a neighbor, who has seen his cat outside. When he arrives home, Nick sees signs of a possible break-in at their abode and Amy is missing. That's right, she's gone, girl. Meanwhile, there are scenes of Amy writing a diary, telling the details of how they met and how blissful early married life seemed. She also notes that the Missouri move has troubled her. But, now, she's missing. The police have few clues but believe a media event to ask for the city's help in finding her would be the best way to go. Reluctantly, Nick calls his in-laws and they rush to town, where they make a televised appeal for Amy's safe return. All too soon, Nick is attacked as ""not sorry enough"" and is fingered as the likely individual responsible for his wife's disappearance. The only person in Nick's corner at the moment is his twin, Margo, who co-owns the bar. With an increasing media frenzy, Nick is in the hot seat. But, there's more. There are secrets by the dozens to be uncovered, some for Nick and some big ones for Amy. What appears to be a kidnapping may be something else. Will she be coming home? Will Nick be sent to the slammer? This brilliant, engrossing thriller cannot be talked about in detail; otherwise, the twists are revealed. Let's just say ""what lies beneath"" may not be pretty. The cast is stunning, with Affleck and Pike doing grand work while Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens, and all of the others are fantastic, too. The watery setting is likewise intriguing. But, its the story, script, and direction that towers above everything else. Gillian Flynn, who wrote the novel, has fashioned a script that mirrors the book and is quite wonderful. As for the direction, David Fincher (with great editing, too) keeps the relentless pace and mystery in every moment. Equally good is his camera shots, opting to fade in and out with visual power. So, add it up and the sum is one fantastic flick indeed. As Mikey said long ago, oh yeah, she's gone and viewers wouldn't want it any other way."

","Clearly this is critic and/or personal opinion-proof. By now it's probably made its neg cost several times over. The overall impression is that there's an awful lot of 'borrowing' going on. Novelist/Screenwriter Gillian Flynn has clearly been frightened by Harlan Coben who is genetically incapable of writing a straight-ahead novel. He gives the impression that if he ends a novel and realizes it doesn't have at least eight 'twists' minimum, he bins it and starts another. Nothing particularly wrong with this. I read and enjoy Coben. Trouble is all the twists tend to merge into one large twist and in a bookstore/library I often find myself taking a Coben novel I've already read. Time will tell whether or not Flynn will turn out Gone Girls like cookie cutters. Fincher, on the other hand clearly enjoys nothing more than holding Joe Wright's coat whilst genuflecting as Wright aims yet another few thousand feed of celluloid directly at the 'Festival' circuit. Gone Girl is watchable. The performances are adequate; I don't feel short-changed BUT, a couple of days after seeing it I'm having trouble remembering it."

","I went to the 6:30 PM showing of Gone Girl yesterday evening. A very enjoyable 2 hour and 29 minute theatrical experience. I even ate a big bag of buttery popcorn - which I usually reserve for special occasions like this. I got there early, watched the preshow, the trailers, then the lights dimmed and the curtains moved to give a 2.35 to 1 aspect ratio. The rush of excitement kicked in again.<br/><br/>Gone Girl opens with a closeup shot of a woman's blonde hair. ""When I think of my wife..."" the voice-over says. ""I think of her head!"" I exclaimed, but not too loudly. Then the voice-over finished the line, confirming my educated guess. Just like the opening of the novel! I assumed it would be, since the author, Gillian Flynn, also wrote the screenplay.<br/><br/>It is about a wife, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike), who goes missing on the day of her fifth anniversary, with an ensuing investigation as to her whereabouts and the possibility of murder. The husband, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), becomes under police scrutiny. He is also under the media's microscope, perhaps even more so than that of the investigators.<br/><br/>Oh look, Nick is smiling in a cell phone photograph shortly after his wife's disappearance. What a psychopath! No Empathy! Amy's diary is found in a wood stove. There appears to have been an attempt to burn it. Must've been Nick! Why? Inside the diary it describes him as abusive, and so scary that Amy believes he will kill her. Amy bought a gun out of fear of her husband! And what do you know? Nick's been cheating on Amy with one of his college students! Definitely a suspect. Amy's blood was also all over the kitchen floor, as evident with Luminol.<br/><br/>But maybe is isn't Nick who's responsible? Amy's former boyfriend, Desi Collins, has had a scary obsession with her for many years. Maybe it was Nick's twin sister, Margo. After all, she seems unusually close to her brother, and doesn't seem to like Amy.<br/><br/>Gone Girl will definitely keep you wondering, and the above are questions and thoughts that may enter the viewers mind. They didn't enter my mind, because I've read the novel last year, but it was still awesome seeing it on the big screen.<br/><br/>There was even some laughter in the theatre. I always enjoy being in a busy theatre room so I can hear the reactions of the audience. I find it adds to the experience. Leaving the theatre, I overhead many commenting on the viewing experience of Gone Girl. ""I didn't like the movie, I guess I'll have to read the book."" I heard one woman say. In the lobby, I heard a medical doctor I know say ""That was different,"" but in a humorous way, and with a smile that made be think he enjoyed it. I think that those who didn't like it may have not understood the ending. There isn't one plot hole that I can think of.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that I think Gone Girl is the best film of 2014. Yes, the year isn't over yet, but I'm guessing that it will be nominated for an Oscar, at the very least. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide an amazing soundtrack for Gone Girl. The music used in the bloodiest scene in the film - a throat slashing scene - completely wowed me. The directing, the pacing, and the writing were all excellent. To bring such a meticulous mystery and thriller novel to a two and a half hour film is no easy feat, but the cast and crew done amazing work to do so.<br/><br/><ul><li>Justin Tobin</li></ul>"
"jboothmillard","9","1","16","9 November 2014"," Gone Girl
","From Golden Globe nominated director David Fincher (Se7en, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Social Network), this film was recommended to me, I read bits and pieces of what it was about, so I was lucky to catch it at the cinema when I did. Basically Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home, it is the day of his fifth wedding anniversary, he finds his home wrecked and that his wife Amy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Rosamund Pike) has gone missing, she is the successful author of the popular Amazing Amy children's books, her disappearance receives large press coverage, especially for Nick who is suspected of murdering her, due to his awkward behaviour. Flashbacks reveal that Nick and Amy's marriage had been falling apart for some time, they moved from New York City to Missouri after the recession caused both of them to lose their jobs, Nick became lazy, distant and unfaithful, Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) uncovers evidence that there was financial troubles and domestic disputes, Amy wanting to buy a gun, and a poorly concealed struggle at the crime scene, it is also discovered that Amy was pregnant, Nick denies knowledge of this. Nick decides to hire defence attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), who specialises in defending husbands accused of murdering their wives, they work to improve his image with the public, including potential interview questions, answers and expressions. Nick starting doing his own investigation to find why Amy disappeared, he meets her ex- boyfriend Tommy O'Hara (Argo's Scoot McNairy), who claims that Amy framed him for rape, and after the discovery of many anniversary presents in the garage Nick realises what has happened, through flashbacks it is revealed that Amy faked her own murder. Amy had been planning for some time to get away from her husband, she formed a fake friendship with a local woman to form a convincing story of abuse and talk of her fake pregnancy, she fabricated a diary describing her fear of her husband, and on the day of her disappearance she left behind incriminating evidence and deliberately clumsy mistakes Nick would make, Amy then changes her appearance and goes to live in a campground. Amy is convinced Nick will be convicted and executed for her murder, but she has her money stolen by two residents of the campground, the only person she can call to help her wealthy former boyfriend Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris), who Nick previously spoke to, she filed a retraining order on Desi for stalking, but she convinces him of her fear of Nick and agrees to hide her in his luxury lake house. Nick's twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) is convinced of her brother's innocence, Nick's student and mistress Andie Fitzgerald (Emily Ratajkowski) does reveal her affair with him to the press, this cause concern for his interview, but Nick uses his interview skills he has learnt appearing on a talk show, where he apologises for his failure as a husband, and he swears he is not a murderer, his public image is improved, Amy is watching his performance on television rekindles her feelings for him. Amy plans to return home, so she seduces Desi to have sex with her, during she slits his throat with a box cutter, she returns home covered in blood, claiming that she was kidnapped and raped, Nick calls her a bitch for her actions, but he is cleared of murder, Amy tells him the truth, saying also that the man she watched on television pleading was the man she wanted to become again, Nick tells Boney, Bolt and Margo about all this, but they have no way to prove Amy's guilt. Nick intends to leave Amy and expose her deceit, but then she reveals that she really is pregnant, using Nick's sperm that was stored at a fertility clinic, he reacts violently, knowing that the press will bury him if he leaves her, feeling responsible also for the child, and despite Margo's objections, he reluctantly stays with her, Nick and Amy announce the pregnancy on television, it ends with them in bed, him wondering what she is thinking. Also starring Patrick Fugit as Officer Jim Gilpin, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Missi Pyle as Ellen Abbott and Casey Wilson as Noelle Hawthorne. Affleck is terrific being charming while hiding resentment for what is happening, and Harris proves himself a credible serious actor as the mildly sinister old flame, but Pike takes the film with her superb exceptional performance as the psychologically disturbed bitch who will do anything to get her own way. I was told this film may not be to my taste, that could not be more wrong, I found it one of the finest films I have seen in years, filled with dark modern relationship problems and invasive press coverage to keep you gripped, and many unsettling twists and turns that will make your jaw drop, it is a brilliant mystery thriller. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay and Best Original Score for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Very good!"
"sinanonline","7","1","22","7 October 2014"," Good movie, but is it enough to pass the Bechdel Test to be a feminist piece?
","The movie serves as a drama and a crime mystery while criticizing daytime TV and marital relations in the US.<br/><br/>The movie opens as a drama. The soundtrack and audio cues have the making of a drama. Reasonably bold camera angles are reminiscent of recent popular dramas - akin to Boyhood (2014), if you watched that.<br/><br/>And just as you are about get to bored with the drama, the movie takes a different turn, and begins to unfold as a crime mystery. It still succeeds at retaining the drama quality in all aspects, but the story becomes captivating and interesting. The twists in the story are not heralded with blatant cues, but they are many. You find yourself more and more drawn in as the story keeps hitting you with new twists and dark witty humor.<br/><br/>You could think of it as Insomnia (2002) meets Se7en (1995).<br/><br/>I marked it down for a feminist critique: As my girlfriend pointed out, the movie is based on one female-specific trope. The movie just does not work if you replace the genders of the main characters. It is based on a gender-based stereotype. In fact, the storyline is based on a number of well-founded stereotypes, including those about certain states and regions of the US. Some behavior is so stereotypical that it is just unrealistic.<br/><br/>Still, an entertaining use of your two and a half hours."

"lisa_thatcher","7","1","24","5 October 2014"," Gone Girl is Fincher reaching out then pulling back.
","David Fincher is no stranger to bringing a beloved pop/pulp novel to the screen while it is only just sliding off the top of the best seller lists, so there is a disarming confidence at play before we even get to the film, that it will be good, faithful to the novel (despite adverbait suggestions that the much loathed ending has changed) and able to satisfy both readership fans and newbies alike. This is a tougher ask than The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, because the film is a very different creature if you have read the book, the category I fall into. It's a book famous for its twists, and there are many, so Fincher had his job cut out for him when pinning down the reasons for making the film in the first place, which are not entirely answered – which turns out to be the greatest problem with Gone Girl, even if shying away from making a statement has become something that we who love Fincher automatically know to associate with all his films. In my previous Fincher reviews, I've called this struggle the adman versus the creative – perhaps auteur is a better word there. The very choice of Gone Girl as a subject piece for Fincher tells us he has placed the auteur on the back-burner and he's out to make one of those Fincher films that seems to be saying something meaningful at its surface, but in reality is doing nothing more than adhere to a zeitgeist. He's done this with his last three films, including Gone Girl, a thing we critics fumblingly call ""style over substance"" but is more the thinking adman's ability to zero in on what we want to watch on our big screens (and subsequently small ones – both of which are comfy Fincher territory) even if its tricky to know exactly what it is that he is selling.<br/><br/>If a music video is the perfect post modern combination of both the advertisement and the product, then Gone Girl might fall into that category, being nothing more than a process of convincing you the film is worth your time, attention and above all money. There is none of the camera turning Fincher achieved in his masterpiece Zodiac, no statement about ""society"" or ""humanity"" or even (hugely disappointingly for this Fincher fan) ""marriage"" which the novel is pregnant with and never properly gives birth to. In this way, the source material more like the Zodiac books than The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo which is a fully realized airport novel with its message sledgehammered throughout, and exhibits the same frustrations that plague Se7en – that the story is begging to make a statement Fincher is too timid to evoke. Gillian Flynn touched on many exciting subjects, only going deeper into a couple of them, and a Fincher film that chose to turn his clever cameras eye on marriage, interspersed with Flynn's (very poorly made) commentary about the media provided similar fertile ground to Graysmith's Zodiac, a serial killer story Fincher brilliantly turned into a film about our obsession with serial killers and how that plays itself out in the media. But Fincher does none of this, instead opting for a very beautiful, very well performed retelling of the story in toto (with only very few small changes) which does beg the question, why make the film, especially while we're all still talking about the novel and it is so fresh for so many of us? It gives the film the hovering problem of that ghost written novel that comes out after the successful film that exists solely for the purpose of extracting more cash from fans. An understandable goal, but surely a little beneath a film maker like Fincher?<br/><br/>However, given Fincher's talent for societal-pulse-finger-placement, Gone Girl has more to say about the pointlessness of contemporary film making than any of Fincher's previous works (except perhaps for The Social Network) and the passion we have for watching meticulously made, meaningless entertainment. We talk of the sophistication of the contemporary viewer, but that reaches only so far as to impact on disembodied pieces of the entertainment product perfected in spite of the meaningless of the whole. Gone Girl is competing with television here, and perhaps the YouTube-esque phenomenon of on-line video, in the same way Panic Room did, but was too clunky (and perhaps we were a little too discerning back then) and didn't have the script Flynn has come up with here. Fincher is combining a great script (very important to him), impeccable performances, a ripping yarn, and his flair for emotive design to create a showcase of talent in which the parts are greater than the sum of the whole. If he's selling the talent of his team – there's suddenly a point to Gone Girl. In Gone Girl the viewer, who is now making their own films, music and novels at home, is watching for craft as much as they are switching off to enjoy a story. The fact that over six million of the viewers will have read the book hardly matters in that case, and they are certainly not interested in having a director presume to point the camera back at them and make insightful statements about ""Marriage"" or ""The Media"" – conclusions they will draw on their own based on their own insights."

","I saw ""Gone Girl"", starring Ben Affleck-Argo, Daredevil; Rosamund Pike- Jack Reacher, Johnny English Reborn; Neil Patrick Harris-How I Met Your Mother_tv, Undercover Brother and Tyler Perry-all those Madea movies, Star Trek_2009. <br/><br/>This is based on a book that was written by Gillian Flynn. I have not read the book but this is a very good and suspenseful movie. My only problem is with the ending and I can not go into details here, without spoiling things. In fact, the whole movie keeps you guessing about who did what-and why-up until you find out exactly what is going on. Ben and Rosamund are a married couple that are coming up on their fifth wedding anniversary. Ben comes home to find his wife missing and signs of a struggle. He calls the police and things get interesting. Questions are asked by the police and the media-did Ben murder her, was she kidnapped? The story goes back and forth from the present time, where Rosalund is missing and everyone is looking for her, and then jumps to five years in the past, and how she met Ben and their life leading up to the present. Neil plays a former boyfriend of Rosamund's that shows up to help look for her and Tyler plays a lawyer that wants to defend Ben, in case he should need a good lawyer. Like I said, it is an excellent story, with plenty of twists and turns that will keep you guessing, but that ending? I remember hearing the disappointment, not only from myself but from other movie-goers when it was over and it was not a pretty sight. It is rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 28 minutes. I enjoyed about 95% of the movie and I would probably buy it on DVD. Maybe the DVD will have an alternate ending."

","Greetings again from the darkness. One of the benefits of seeing so many movies is the ability to readily ascertain whether the appeal is to specific movie-goers (teens, romantics, et al), to mass audiences, or perhaps only to film critics and cinephiles. The downside is that when one of the rare mass appeal thrillers hits theatres, my enjoyment of the twists and surprises tends to suffer. Such is the case with director David Fincher's version of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel.<br/><br/>Whether or not you are a devotee of Ms. Flynn's novel, you are likely to find guilty pleasure in this pulpy, neo-noir thriller featuring Ben Affleck as the man who may or may not have killed his missing wife (Rosamund Pike). This is less ""whodunit"" and more ""did he do it?"". When Nick (Affleck) returns home to discover his wife (Pike) is missing, we hear Amy's voice guiding us through her journal as we go from blossoming romance to crumbling marriage. Nick's perspective is derived from his work with the detectives (Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit).<br/><br/>This story-telling structure is beautifully executed, and when combined with director Fincher's fascination with the dark side of people (The Social Network, Zodiac, Se7en, Fight Club), and the terrific camera work and lighting elevate this from a technical filmmaking standpoint. Watch how Fincher uses lighting and shadows to change the tone of the film as the noose tightens on Affleck's character.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the performances of Affleck and Pike, so I'd prefer to focus on a couple of others. Carrie Coon steals every scene as Nick's twin sister Margot. She is the moral compass of the film, and gives the absolute best performance. Kim Dickens provides the necessary screen presence and wry humor to prevent the stereotypical detective role from emerging. This is a real person working a complicated case. Also of note, is Missi Pyle's obnoxious Nancy Grace style TV reporter clearly attempting to build ratings by guiding the sheep. Lastly, and most surprising, Tyler Perry's slick and slimy headline-grabbing defense attorney provides a punch when the film needs it.<br/><br/>The second half of the film transitions from mystery to anatomy of a scheme, and features one of the most brutal and bloody on screen murders you will ever see. It also provides more excellent support work from Lola Kirke and Brad Holbrook as a couple of trailer park opportunists, and Scoot McNairy and Neil Patrick Harris (against type) as Amy's former lovers.<br/><br/>The wicked fun in this movie is derived mostly from the misdirection and personalities of Nick and Amy. It's nice to see a female lead character with some real scene-chewing, even though I believe many actresses would have been better picks. When I hear talk that it could be best movie of the year, I certainly hope that's off base. This one is at the level of other mainstream thrillers as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct, and it's not difficult to imagine Michael Douglas in the lead, were this 1988. Adding to the fun is the satire and social commentary ... especially on the current trend of media speculation. So enjoy the twists and ask yourself just how much you really know about your spouse."

A little foreshadowing would have done the plot a lot of good.<br/><br/>Luckily, the story picks up when Detective Rhonda Boney, played by Kim Dickens, enters the film to investigate the crime scene. She is the best actor in the movie followed by Patrick Fugit, of Almost Famous, who plays second fiddle Detective Nick Gilpin. Rosamond Pike is at times brilliant but not always believable as Amy Dunne and Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne is flat. His best acting is when Mr. Dunne is called on to act the phony. It's sad that Affeck's best lines are when he plays phony. Carrie Coon as the twin sister Margo Dunne is much better than Affleck. Pike does the best with her awkward lines, so props to her. Tyler Perry proves that he should do more serious roles, perhaps as a lead as in his Alex Cross films. How Neil Patrick Harris got into this film is a wonder. He is only under-acted by Affleck. Suffice to say, the cast got little help from an at times hackneyed script.<br/><br/>The grand plot twist at the beginning of the second act was predictable. They did play this twist well, until a supposedly clever and brilliant character does something incredibly dumb. Smart characters doing dumb things doesn't fly with me.<br/><br/>Rating: Matinée <br/><br/>There are just enough good parts, twists and good acting to make this film worth a view. The plot is fascinating, but played poorly. Unfortunately, Ben Affleck could not portray the conflicted nature of his character to make us believe his actions. The film needed a better lead, such as Josh Brolin (only for years the senior of Affleck), to make it work. Affleck only has his looks to rescue him, but no one is that good looking. Moreover, if the relationship's beginning had been left out of the film and more about their marriage years put in the movie, it could have been a better film. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"

","Just saw this and it was powerful! Does it have some flaws?? Of course it does. And the points about the blood covered woman in a hospital with Feds not making sense are right-but, about those things...<br/><br/>The biggest points of this film have got to be about fake vs genuine, about a jury of popular opinion; people inability to humbly accept that relationship are complicated and should not be dictated by the media-but unfortunately they are. One other HUGE one to appreciating the message of the film is that our ideas about relationships are pretty messed up. This was an allegory for people who stick in toxic relationships. It is a timeless message and particularly needed. Like Affleck suggested: Why do people choose to stay in something where they hurt And control one another instead of just accept that they are not right for one another???? Pressures-mostly EXTERNAL pressures! Judgements of friends, family, media, etc! Equating a failed relationship or marriage to have a loser and a winner-when they could easily both be winners if they don't set it up as a contest.<br/><br/>This was the deeper underlying message. And I think it is silly that there are people underrating this film because of a few details. I think the message just hit a little too close for comfort for many.<br/><br/>If you are in a relationship that is not one of full compatibility and consent-start making a peaceful and honest exit strategy.

I already knew where it was going, of course, but it still kept me just as enthralled as the first time I ever saw it. This is a testament to what an incredible filmmaker Fincher truly is.<br/><br/>The screenplay was phenomenal, the camerawork was expertly handled, and I also really loved the sound design. This element, combined with the musical score, added to the tension of the film.

","Rosemund Pike gives a Joan Crawford-type performance in this mystery thriller also starring Ben Affleck. But make no mistake; Pike steals the film away from Affleck with the greatest of ease. Although not in the same category as Meryl Streep as an actress (she just does not have the sincere believability that Streep has). Pike is a formidable actress. She is good-looking (better looking than Crawford or Streep), sexier than Crawford or Streep, but not as genuine or believable as Crawford or Streep. Crawford was a great actress purely based on her iron will which was clearly present on her screen persona; Pike has that commodity in common with Crawford. Crawford and Pike are both chilling and threatening; Streep is not. We as an audience believe that Streep is vulnerable, but would scoff at the idea that either Crawford or Pike had even the remotest chance of being vulnerable. And that is what separates Pike from other actresses of this era. She is incapable of being vulnerable. No one would believe for a second that she could be vulnerable. It would be like being asked to believe John Wayne in a lead role of a gay-oriented film is vulnerable. I've seen all of Pike's films and am continuously fascinated with her persona, even though she gives exactly the same performance time after time.(just like John Wayne). And ultimately, she is a very bankable star."

After marriage, her discontent has been fermented due to his husband's indifferent attitude. Her diary counted the process in which their happy union gradually turned sour. While everyone was suspecting that the husband might have murdered the wife and afterwards made a rather clumsy attempt at disguising it as an abduction, the storyline took a drastic turn. It turned out that the wife orchestrated the whole incident to set up her husband.

","A bizzare piece of suspenseful masterclass. The psychological thriller that gets you shivering and leaves that halter hanging around your neck even after it's done, just in case. A movie that, with it's weird dysfunctional ending where Amy(Rosamund Pike) returns to Nick(Ben Affleck), keeps you thinking, wondering and questioning the happenings.
Portraying this bizzare and gripping plot, full of twists and turns, where morality is thrown out of the window, are the wonderful performances of the two lead actors, especially Pike's ghastly and loathsome performance as Amy Dunne. A wonderful side cast to got along with it, one that complements the two beautifully and no matter how little the screen time, makes their presence felt (Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris, Nick's sister, Go, Amy's parents, the Police Officers, etc.).<br/><br/>All through this gripping plot that keeps you engaged, vital questions on:
1. marriage problems
2. effects of the recession on families
3. cancer awareness
4. adultery
5. dysfunctional relationships
6. pregnancy problems
7. sensationalization of news by the media
8. effects of social empathy<br/><br/>are also highlighted. Overall, the movie is probing work of that ticks most boxes of a good movie with strong social messages and nice portrayal of the contemporary society, enveloped by the preposterous psychopathic saga of the couple. However, the uncertainty about the ending, no matter how intentional, leaves a sour taste in the mouth and certain feeling of incompleteness to the story, a cliffhanger of sorts that is never resolved (unless there's supposed to be a part 2!)"

"DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine","8","0","1","11 March 2019"," A silver screen adaptation, equal of the titular novel's level of quality and intrigue.
","''Gone Girl'' is one of those rare type of films which are at the same level, in terms of quality and character, with their original source, that is the novel. Gillian Flynn's ''Gone Girl'' is her third, in chronological order, novel that was published, after ''Sharp Objects'' (won the 2007 Ian Fleming Steel Dagger for the best thriller) and ''Dark Places'', a book which was also successfuly adapted to cinema film in 2015 by Gilles Paquet-Brenner, starring Charlize Theron. ''Gone Girl'' received wide praise and many compliments, and it is considered to be Flynn's tour de force, a crime/mystery novel narrated by -more or less- unreliable characters' point of view, a fact that makes the viewer to remain vigilant for the 2 hours and half that is -approximately- the movie's running time.
The story revolves around the two protagonists, Nick and Amy Dunne, a married couple which seems to be totally in love with each other at the beginning of their relationship, only to find out in time, that they fell in love with an illusion of the other that they built themselves. The intricate, though not hard to follow, plot of the film begins to unfold when in the day of their fifth's wedding anniversary, Amy (Rosamund Pike) disappears from the house and seems to be gone for good. Her husband, Nick (Ben Affleck), is shocked at first and seems to be willing to day what is necessary to find out the truth behind his wife's action, but slowly it becomes obvious that Amy had set him up for her -supposed- murder. Through Nick's conversations, mainly with his twin sister, Margo, the viewer discover that things were not what they seem and the marriage of Nick and Amy was far from being ideal. As the days pass and Amy is still missing, the police begins to unearth the clues that Amy had left them in order to incriminate Nick and after finding the -possibly- murder weapon they arrest him.
This is a -condensed- synopsis of the film's first one hour and the following 90 minutes has a lot of twists and turns in store for the viewer who must not lose his focus in order to fully enjoy the viewing experience of one of the best crime films of the year (2014). ''Gone Girl'' is a film, having two truly shady characters as protagonists which are hard to like, much more to identify with, but this doesn't mean that they are not brilliantly outlined and fleshed out, as well as alluring and enthralling. Rosamund Pike's performance is a great one but unfortunately Ben Affleck's acting is below expectations and perhaps with another actor in the role of Nick, ''Gone Girl'' would be irresistible. David Fincher's direction is impeccable -as always- and guarantees an unforgettable artistic achievement, a movie that the audience will remember for the years to come as on of the iconic flicks of the crime/mystery genre.
If you still haven't watched it, do it without giving it a second thought. You will be thoroughly entertained and intrigued by this fabulous storyline and plot."

Part of the problem in Hollywood is that dialogue never reflect anything real. It's for the most part written like writers would like to talk like, but never how people actually talk like.<br/><br/>Then, there was some of the situations and casting. What's with hiring foreign actors to play American parts? There are no actresses in Hollywood that can do the job? Hint, Rosamund Pike, Lola Kirk .<br/><br/>When you call the cops about a potential break in or foul play, detectives don't show up. Regular cops do, but not here. The young attractive mysterious lead woman detective and the sceptic side kick with nothing to say. Did I say cliche? Cops don't interview people together, like Nick and her parents in the same room.<br/><br/>Amy writes out her plan on postage notes and puts them on a calendar? Who on earth would do that? You have to be a complete imbecile to do that. Only in badly written movies does that happen.<br/><br/>Just the overall behavior of everyone was totally unnatural and inauthentic. That is Fincher's fault. The accents were too over the top. Felt like they forced them too much. And Emily Ratajkowski was supposed to play a 19-20 year old? But she is 30 and she looks that. Why not get someone who IS American and actually that age.<br/><br/>If you are interrogated by the cops, you don't force yourself to look guilty. You do the opposite, unlike Pike, her acting was so winking into the camera it was hilarious.<br/><br/>I wish it was better. The premise was good, just the execution and writing of it was not."

","Okay , The movie had an average start even very slow then very quick rhythm giving away what was planned by the wife at once just before the middle then only focusing on that psychopath wife and the rest of the plot when an unplanned accident happened in her plan and then preparing for the ending which was a complete mess with lots of plot holes and unreasonable behaviours especially when both married couple had everything cleared the cards were exposed. The movie had a slow scheme then rising slowly till the end then collapsed with that mess that I felt you were afraid that the days would end before you finish the ending!. I am not trying to have a different opinion about that critically acclaimed movie but really the total scheme flopped from our director who only focused on bringing the wife to the screen with the more than good performance by Rosamund Pike and was a mess in the rest of it even the music didn't add anything to the scenes.

Rosamund Pike was indeed good as the titular gone girl, but I thought Kim Dickens was exceptionally good as Detective Rhonda.

"NormanCroucher","6","0","1","22 October 2017"," Cold and methodical thriller that goes on too long
","Not having read the book, I experienced 'Gone Girl' cold. And that's pretty much how it left me come the end – cold. Perhaps that was the point but I suspect the ambitions of the film were aiming higher than simply provoking indifference. David Fincher has always been an expressive visual artist, painting sumptuous and richly textured images for us to be enveloped by, but what many of his film experiences lack is heart.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike give it a good go though, playing a rather unlikable pair that become even more unlikable as the story unfolds. Affleck plays it nice but icy and Pike plays tightly coiled angst, and their relationship retains the interest namely because of the machinations and turns of the plot. It's a good mystery that takes its time to simmer before boiling over a little too much in the final third but it has a couple of devilishly good twists that flip the narrative on its head and play with your perceptions/expectations in extremely interesting ways.<br/><br/>However, take away Fincher's visual craftsmanship and you're left with a rather stretched and staggered plot that wobbles under the weight of its own running time. Why so long? I suspect the only real answer to that question is – Gillian Flynn, who adapted her own book and was perhaps a tad overly precious in translating her material to the screen. The result is a bum-numbing 150 mins for a story that only really deserves approximately 110-120 max. This is a thriller after all, not a socio-political epic. Its ending is also so contrived and inexplicable it fails to deliver the sucker punch promised from its first two acts - an ending which I imagine played much better in the book.<br/><br/>'Gone Girl' has aspirations of something greater, asking to be taken seriously as an exploration on the nature of the media, celebrity and gender politics but it never really rises above the pot-boiler intrigue of its original source material."
"areatw","4","0","3","2 September 2017"," From intelligent to absurd
","I can't remember the last time I went from thinking a movie was great halfway through to thinking it was absolute trash when it finished, but that's exactly how I feel about 'Gone Girl'. The storyline goes from being intelligent and engaging to just plain ridiculous. The second half of the film just jumps from one far-fetched scenario to another, and the big plot twist at the end is frankly absurd.<br/><br/>Even without the many plot holes and unanswered questions, a storyline like this was never going to be remotely realistic or believable. I'm afraid the hype around 'Gone Girl' is completely unjust. It tries to be too clever and the end result is an illogical mess of a film. The fact that they ask for two and a half hours of our time with material like this is insulting."

","It's quite amazing how many people can be seduced by a little style and a few reasonable scenes. After an initially curious beginning 'Gone Girl' then tries to be so 'cleaver' it falls over its own foolishness. It has that look, sound, and feel, of so many other 'deliberately controversial' productions that come and go endlessly. Writer, Gillian Flynn has fashioned a yuppie story - then crammed it with yuppie dialogue, as if trying to outdo the crass situations and vile language of many others that went before this over-baked trendsetter. Her central characters are all unlikable, self-obsessed 'it's all about me' types and much, much worse. Her partner in crime, director David Fincher (House of Cards) attempts to squeeze so much nasty sensationalism into each sequence that it leaves the thinking viewer wanting to run from the room screaming...the whole thing then drags on for almost 2 ½ hrs with barely enough story to cover 80mins max. The too-dumb-for-their-own-good situations and unbelievable grisly murder set-ups are too dark to even write off as black humour – they're simply terrible. <br/><br/>Just two examples of foolishness: In these days of endless social media, the 'grieving' husband (and prime suspect) poses for a smiling selfie with a perfect stranger, then says to her ""whatever you do don't show this anywhere""! – weak in the extreme. The wife, who is admitted to Hospital in the midst of a full-on police murder investigation - is let out a day or two later, still covered in blood! Simply laughable. Do audiences check their brains in at the ticket counter when attending these movies?<br/><br/>Way too many other vulgar situations in this ugly nonsense to bother with - let alone the lame ending. Don't take my word for it - you will find there are many other reviewers from around the globe who have summed it up perfectly (that is, in between the promotional people, the immoral, and those who just don't want to think)<br/><br/>Why did it take so much money? well, as so many others point out: 'you don't know what you're seeing till you've handed over your hard earned money'!"

Hopefully this review can save others from wasting their time like I just did."
"dzhealy","7","0","1","11 June 2017"," Doesn't do the story justice
","I immediately watched Gone Girl after finishing the audio book, which I loved. The characters were so well developed and the plot left you guessing after every chapter. The book has so many scenes that bring the story to life so well. Unfortunately the film is severely lacking the life and energy of the book. <br/><br/>The story moves very quickly and doesn't give any time to flesh out the very important plot points that the book establishes so well. As a reader you are hooked on the storytelling of Gone Girl and it pulls you in so well that you feel like your part of the story but when watching the movie you feel like an outsider.<br/><br/>One of my biggest issues was the lack of Nicks father in the movie. The book uses him much more heavily and gives Nick so many more layers that make you care about him as a character, the movie doesn't even bring up his relationship with his father.<br/><br/>I did find Rosamund Pike's performance as sadistic wife Amy to be fantastic. Just like the book you meet 2 different Amy's. You see diary Amy and crazy Amy. Pike does both characters so well and makes them both so hauntingly believable. I also found Lola Kirke's performance as Greta to be outstanding as well. Both women feel like they are brought straight from the pages and onto the screen, which is what I was looking for.<br/><br/>Overall I think Gone Girl is a fine movie that is very well directed and showcases a near perfect performance from Rosamund Pike but I don't think it is the best way to experience a story as good as this. I recommend the book."
"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","18 May 2017"," When the 'weaker' sex is strong enough to play the 'weak' card... and win the game...
","Voice-over narration that sounds like post-coital whispers, opening credits the size of an ophthalmology screen, non-linear fuzzy editing ""Gone Girl"" isn't just a slow starter, it has an irritating tendency to give you the wrong idea. I can say in all frankness that after twenty minutes, I was contemplating the idea of getting to bed and finishing the film at the morning and the 'performance' of Ben Affleck didn't help. But the story grabbed me enough so I could make it as far as the middle section, and then, all the negative vibes were gone.<br/><br/>And not only did I love the film but retrospectively, what I saw as flaws actually made sense and even enhanced the appreciation, and that includes Ben Affleck's performance. We already suspected something was going wrong, quoting Lisa Simpson paraphrasing Churchill, what we had was ""a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma"", if you consider as the ""riddle"" the little game played by Amy, Rosamund Pike in a gusto performance, consisting on leaving many clues to the Police, and a few incriminating ones in the process to accuse her husband Nick, the mystery about her absence and the enigmatic personality of both Amy and Nick, a couple that had everything to be happy, except the propensity for it. Near the end, Nick's lawyer, played by a scene-stealing Tyler Perry, tells his client that they're the most twisted couple he ever met, that's an understatement.<br/><br/>But this feeling is also the emotional reward after a build-up that needed to be long, to let the viewers make up their own mind, to be suspicious toward Nick who doesn't seem that upset when she shares his feelings with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon), to feel that he's hiding something until you understand why his acting was so subdued. This is a man who obviously doesn't play in the league than his wife, she's an intellectual New-Yorker, an uppity Annie-Hall-like broad without the sweetness, he's your average handsome Joe who wanted to get a girl better than him, that he succeeded was a splendid achievement, but what she saw as a beginning, he saw an ending. She followed him to Missouri and realized that marriage was asking too much in terms of sacrifice and compromises to even indulge to it.<br/><br/>But instead of filing a divorce and getting the hell out, what she did was far worse, but in terms of creative storytelling, far more intelligent. Indeed, there have been stories of vanishing persons in the past but not as twisted and smartly pervert as David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"". It is twisted almost in the literal sense of the word as there's no plot event to be taken for granted, just when you think this is taking some specific direction, the writers find the right way to derail the plot and increasing your interest. And it is smartly pervert because it highlights some deep and usually repressed aspects of human psyche, to start with the most 'evident' one, giving the film's theme: ""haven't we all dreamed to vanish, at least once?"". I dare any married people to say they never did.<br/><br/>People get many notions of suicides mixed up because there's no specific word for that, but there should, speaking for my own personal experience (and yes, I was particularly responsive to the film) and from what many friends shared with them, we, humans, do sometimes wish to simply vanish from existence, become someone else and never coming back. It's a way to escape from the burden of the past, the responsibilities, without any harmful self-infliction, a sort of victim-less suicide. ""Gone Girl"" would have been clever enough to tackle that subject but it goes beyond, this is no victim-less suicide, but a victim-less murder, a woman simulating her disappearance to accuse her husband and earn him a sentence (since this is happening in Missouri). Now, can it get more twisted? <br/><br/>Apparently yes, and I like that, I like that a film is hardcore enough to feature one of the most Machiavellian villains of recent history, in the Amazingly manipulative Amy, but the plot doesn't stop at that. Over the course of her diabolical project, she meets a few obstacles but she always have a trick under her sexy sleeve. And Nick is smartly played by Ben Affleck as the not-so-smart cool easy going guy, who married the wrong girl. It's all about a ""He"" and a ""She"" with a ""She"" too sophisticated, too New York for his Midwestern taste, but he wanted his trophy wife and he had to pay for his treacherous seduction. The thing is that this ""He"" and ""She"" don't quite match the general perception of the public and that's how a genius she is. She's strong enough to play the weak card.<br/><br/>She knows it's not just about leaving, it's about leaving marks that clearly accuses the husband, traces of blood, hints of pregnancy, a diary, everything is so neatly elaborate that you wish people could be as organized for benevolent reasons. I don't know if it's a personal fetish from Fincher but his movies have the tendency to feature the most beeped up masterminds, from John Doe to Tyler Durden and even counting ""The Game"" corporation, the plans are so far-fetched and yet never ruin their effectiveness whatever the effect. But that Amy one is really one of a kind, she looks a darling for feminists, then she's the total antithesis, by using her intelligence and boobs as weapons.<br/><br/>More than ever, our society lies on such polarized perceptions that you can't go beyond what the world wants to see. The woman gets away with everything, which is maybe the way to compensate the blow on feminism it makes, within its own wicked intelligence, it plays fair with the denounced archetypes and I would say about ""Gone Girl"" what I said about ""Indecent Proposal"", it's pure subversive brilliance."

Now Nick owns a bar bought with her money, she's a loner in the neighbourhood and their relationship has gotten progressively worse. And then she disappears on their anniversary and he becomes the main suspect.<br/><br/>Gone Girl was directed by the legendary David Fincher, the man behind Se7en and Fight Club, and it shows. He has moved from the have-nots of the society to the haves, but it's still very clearly his style and skill behind the camera. Every scene is filled with meaning and every scene has tension behind it. Almost like there's always something just behind the counter. You're constantly expecting the pin to fall, for something to go for your throat, for something to happen. And for a psychological thriller, that's a great feeling. And the film in no way disappoints. I absolutely don't want to spoil the plot to you, but trust me when I say that it's going to take you for a ride. There are so many rug pulls in this movie that it'll leave you spinning.<br/><br/>That being said, I do think that the first third of the film is a bit tedious. You get to know the people involved, there's some backstory told well enough and the initial setup is revealed, but the movie really takes off only after the twist at the start of the second act. Before that you're always wondering where the film is going and whether something is going to happen, but not in a good way. It keeps you waiting too long. It doesn't ruin the film, but it definitely tests your patience.<br/><br/>Still, the second act more than makes up for it, leaving us with a great if perhaps a tad flawed film from Fincher.

The cops get off quite well considering the regular ""robbery gone wrong"" or ""suicide"" conclusions for real life cases. The television opinionaters could have come straight off air with their bloviating b s and the complete lack of consequences for their actions and hyperbole. Having worked in media for over thirty years, I'd strongly suggest not instantly believing what is presented for your consumption, especially if it slots in nicely with your belief system unless there are facts, verifiable facts and actual evidence, not just words and beliefs.

The tone, the editing, the cinematography, and the acting all come together so beautifully to make a near perfect film in the mystery crime drama.

"cdjh-81125","10","0","2","27 October 2016"," A Thrilling Mystery
","David Fincher is the man when it comes to physiological thrillers and Gone Girl is one of his greatest movies with possibly his greatest plot twist. This is a film that is admittedly best on its first viewing for the intense mystery and whodunit that anyone can be intrigued by. The reason it's so investing is because they never rule out Afflecks character as a suspect and through flashbacks you even start to suspect him as well. The flashbacks are used perfectly they fill in the blanks as they should but add to the tension and mystery. The way this movie looks at the media and outside worlds perception of events forces the viewer to think about what they're mindset would be during a situation like this and makes the movie all the more fascinating. Like I said this movie is at its best on a first viewing but they thing that's really going to get people to come back and watch it again are the performances especially Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Affleck is just so believable in this film he's perfect at conveying his characters more scum bag qualities while also being very convincing at portraying the immense stress that he isn't under to prove his innocence. At first Pike seemed like a likable character with some real emotion to her but as soon as we discover what she really is it turns into without a doubt Pikes best performance. Tyler Perry was extremely entertaining as Afflecks lawyer he had great chemistry with the cast and really makes me hope that he'll come back to more dramatic roles like this. The ending of this movie is quite divisive at first i didn't know what to think but I soon realised that were meant to feel that way were meant to feel unsatisfied with the ending because that's how Afflecks character would feel. This movie of course is directed beautifully David Fincher creates for some dream tension and heartbreak throughout the run time. While Neil Patrick Harris was good in this movie I just didn't like his character and was a pretty annoying presence. <br/><br/>Overall I love Gone Girl it's not for everyone but it's a deeply investing and disturbing movie that will go down as one of Finchers best efforts. <br/><br/>95%/A"
"CinematicInceptions","9","0","3","8 September 2016"," Definitely worth watching even though it's unpleasant.
","What I like most about this movie is the social commentary aspect. The story is great and keeps you guessing without confusing you too much, and the characters are all equally pleasing and displeasing. But there aren't many movies that I've seen that make such a great use of their subject matter as a way to put a mirror up to the audience. My parents have been happily married for more than twenty years and they hated this movie for a couple of reasons. I think they recognized the skill that went into it, but they just didn't enjoy it, which I guess makes sense. If you're married or engaged or in any kind of serious relationship while you watch this movie you can't help but wonder, ""how can I trust my spouse?"" It's not a pleasant thought, but David Fincher has specifically told us that he has no problem with leaving people feeling a little bleak after seeing his movies. I'm sure couples don't want to have a conversation about whether one of them is cheating on the other or whatever, but I think this movie is saying that you need to have those sort of conversations or your marriage is going to fall apart.<br/><br/>But it's really not a message, it's a theme that's open for interpretation. Gillian Flynn isn't saying to do this or that; she's just presenting some of the facts that people prefer to ignore and saying ""do with this what you will, but don't you dare think you're exempt."" I listened to most of the audio book, which is pretty long and is equally as good as the movie, but for different reasons. In the book, there is more detail concerning Nick and Amy's past. You get deeper into their characters, particularly ""Diary Amy"". It's actually pretty incredible how they were able to squeeze so much into 150 minutes and retain the quality of the story. In the book, Nick makes a lot of points about how much people's views on Amy's disappearance are skewed by the tropes that they see on cop shows and crime movies. This isn't really mentioned in the movie, but the motif is retained in other ways, like how we get to see the contrast of how characters like Nicole Hawthorne and Andie behave so much differently on camera than they do in real life. Public opinion is so vital to both Amy's plan of framing Nick as well as Nick's quest to prove his innocence. And in the end, it forces them to stay together so that they can be America's perfect but flawed couple.<br/><br/>The pacing was great in the movie. You're pretty much on the same page as Nick and, like him, you're always curious to find out more about the mystery behind Amy's disappearance. It does get harder to follow once you find out that Amy has fabricated much of her diary. In the book, she was more clear on what was real and what she made up as evidence, but that was harder to grasp in the movie.<br/><br/>The execution was fabulous. Rosamund Pike definitely deserved to win Best Actress for her performance as Amy. I'm not really that into Ben Affleck, but he was perfect for the role. He was genuine but shady at the same time. There's so much ambiguity in the performance that it makes you want to like Nick, but there's a definite danger that it's all just a guise that he's putting on to try to avoid suspicion. The minor parts were pretty good too, namely Tanner Bolt and Go. Some smaller characters got diminished from the book like Amy's parents and the woman who takes a compromising selfie with Nick. Fincher made great use of the fade-outs to set the right mood, and once again he plays with the color scheme to create an effect. Whereas in Fight Club he made everything a little grainy and off color in some scenes, here he makes the images sharp and makes all the shadows a little darker.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to most people, particularly married couples. I know it isn't the movie you want to see, but it may be able to help your relationship grow stronger. I will warn you that there are some pretty disturbing and gory scenes. If you like an interesting story, whether plot driven or character driven, this will satisfy. There is only one aspect of the plot that people might find especially implausible, which is Amy's willingness to sacrifice her life to prove a point. I could agree to this, but you have to remember that Amy sees herself as a martyr for all married women and is an expert in the art of revenge against men. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."

","I cannot say that I do not have a remote knowledge of David Fincher's filmography. Out of his ten feature films, I have only witnessed four (Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network and Gone Girl). And I have only seen them once (except Gone Girl) for each. David Fincher is so well tied-up with making movies that anchored to a distinct visual kind and malignant dark themes. His ""The Social Network"", which is largely a biopic, is also dark in its story. ""Gone Girl"" is obviously without exception; his signature movie-making style retains, but this time falls through within the strife of a married couple.<br/><br/>On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home only to discover that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), goes missing. Her disappearance attracts strong press coverage; and after days of investigation by the police, they discover pieces of evidences which only conclude that Amy is murdered. Financial problems and signs of Nick being the abusive husband lead to him being the prime suspect of Amy's murder, although he constantly denies any wrongdoings. But what could have had happened to Amy? Murdered? Kidnapped? ""Gone Girl"" broaches the unexpected. It rarely allows us to expect what is coming.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" boasts interesting images, especially for scenes that were shot indoors. The result for its cinematography matched the common tone that Fincher had brought in for his past works. It is dark, intimidating and undeniably beautiful. The images consistently and confidently suffused throughout the running of the movie. Indeed, cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth understands Fincher's own visions.<br/><br/>David Fincher brought the best out of Ben Affleck, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens in what they could deliver for acting on screen, but it was Rosamund Pike who was triumphing over the stars. She was incredibly convincing in all Amy's different persona – the good wife, the depressed wife and the villain. I dare say, the movie is worth watching for her performance alone. I have not seen her past performances, but I am convinced that her work for this one is one of her, if not, the best. Really, it is like an untainted, near- perfect performance by an actress.<br/><br/>It is uncommon for the writer of a book, which is going to be adapted into a film, to be attached fully during the process of making the movie. Gillian Flynn, the writer, led the screenplay of the film. It was her first time on being a scriptwriter, and the script is a great one; it is smart, but not conceited. The superiority of her screenplay is that it never seems undercooked or overcooked but just right to allow the story to flow naturally.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is slightly a drama and mostly a thriller. The story paints a picture of the life of a married couple, but greater concentration is being invested for the case and its development regarding Amy's disappearance. ""Gone Girl"" is a compelling picture with an impeccable pacing, and features superb performances overall. David Fincher had once again earned himself a fine addition for his superb filmography. ""Gone Girl"" surely an unmissable yarn.<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)"
"joshuafagan-64214","9","0","5","25 May 2016"," Deliciously Disconcerting
","4.5 Stars out of 5 David Fincher is the only director for the kind of story. If anyone else had directed this, it wouldn't have been half as good.<br/><br/>Like all Fincher movies, it's complex, adult, disturbing, mid-budget, and buzzy. It's got the cold colors, the nihilism, and the passionate acting one would expect. It's about a man, played by Affleck, accused of killing his wife, played by Rosamund Pike, a crime which we know from the start of the film he did not commit. In a normal film, if we know someone didn't commit a crime, it makes the film less interesting. Not here. This film isn't about murder, not really.<br/><br/>What is it about? Marriage, mostly. Most every theme in the film, from deception to betrayal to compromise, can be considered to be a part of one big social commentary on marriage, particularly modern marriage. Of course, it's deeper and more complex than that, and there are many different angles to discuss, but this a review, not a reaction piece titled 'What Gone Girl Says About Marriage in America' or something like that.<br/><br/>Like a lot of Fincher movies, it's very narrative and very talky. It doesn't help that the author of the book wrote the screenplay. That's not a complaint, mind you: just an observation. There are a couple scenes I wish had more time to breathe, but the mood Fincher's able to project more than makes up for it. It's not really different from a normal Fincher film in that regard.<br/><br/>As it's so narrative, I won't spoil any more plot details, but I will say the plot is very juicy and very worth digging into. Everyone delivers virtuoso performances. Probably my least favorite performance of the film comes from Affleck, though I will admit that his underacting is a conscious choice and part of the character he's playing. The most surprising performance comes from Tyler Perry, who does a bang-up job as Affleck's defense attorney. I wanted to see more of his character. I would watch a full movie centered around his character.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether Fincher comes off as a cold director because of the films he picks, or if he picks his films based around the knowledge that he's a cold director. Either way, he's extremely good at making the audience feel full but unsatisfied. Of course, one of his movies was based off the Zodiac killer, who was never found (unless he's really Ted Cruz), so that's sort of a prerequisite. You never feel cheated, but you never feel like you get the ending you wanted either.<br/><br/>The media factors into the film. It's made clear that our protagonist is receiving few favors from any outlet, but thanks to the Law of Conservation of Detail, special attention is given to one show run by one horrible blonde lady.<br/><br/>Even if we didn't know that he didn't do it, that show would still make me sick to by stomach. It's like the unholy lovechild of Lifetime and Fox News. Media manipulation has always fascinated me, so I'm glad they included this. I actually hate the media in this film more than I hate any of the mains, and one of them's a psychopath.<br/><br/>If you took The Hunger Games, took out the Hunger Games (the event), and had someone with a cynical worldview write it, the result would look something like this.<br/><br/>When all the Oscar-bait and empty summer blockbusters are busy being forgotten, movies like this cement themselves further into the public consciousness. You can't forget them. They're unique and artful and chilling. They stick with you, <br/><br/>Sharp, well-paced, cruel, twisted, stylish, delightful, and poignant, this is one of the best films of 2014. Give it a watch."

","WOWand nothing short of. Let me start with this, this a romance/mystery suspense/thriller/who- dunnit/ conspiracy/drama movie. OH MY GOD! What a beautiful piece of work by the hands and imagination of Gillian Flynn and a standing ovation and credit for the producers in asking Flynn to write the script based on her own novel, a step I thought was pure genius. To create different-genred stories woven into one whole story was breathtaking, it was like watching three or movies in one, all in a package of two and half never-boring hours. The story was so smartly written that while watching the movie you can kind of predict or guess two or more different scenarios this story could go to and I bet you might just get close to one, you think the story is going in a certain direction that it just completely goes in the opposite or just another way, and then just when you think oh okay it's going this way now, it changes again. <br/><br/>Fincher's marvelous work strides in parallel between a loose method in the romantic scenes and the good old days in the lives of Nick (Affleck) and Amy (Pike) and the more strict, sharp, and abrupt direction and editing in the troubled times that Nick faces, which is even evident in the opening credits, just as soon as any name filters in, it fades out. Fincher keeps up with his style of dark, not-so-lit, dry colored scenes, even the paparazzi and TV show scenes don't look glamorous and that is just one of the themes of the movie, how media destroys your life. ""Marriage is hard work"", is another important theme, when Amy thought their fairytale love story did not need hard work and was not hard work, how wrong was she? Nick cheated on her, abused her with his spending, and simply got lazy after being laid off from work, not only lazy with his professional life but lazy with his love life as well, on the other hand, she too was an uppity snobbish woman who controlled Nick's life, and this caused the major imperfection of their marriage which in turn kick-started this whole conspiracy thing on behalf of Amy to the point of the ridiculous and silly. Nick passes through a humiliating phase, from an employed man who got married to the love of his life to a media circus freak, she goes from a rich woman to a disguised country girl, having to hide out in some motel, conspiring to get her cheating husband not only punished but executed, that is one sick revenge ploy, hehe! which brings me to the most beautiful twist of all to me, the endingspecifically the end scene where Nick and Amy are on that TV show presumably faking their intentions and lives and pretending all is okay, but at the same time, for the very first time since their troubled times, you actually see that they both have matured throughout this horrendous ordeal and journey, they both have stuck around to commit to their responsibilities towards one another as partners and lovers, for the first time we see them after a long tiring and excruciating journey of 'working hard', his responsibility is for the baby on the way and his wife who killed her ex-boyfriend to save him from the inevitable death row and her responsibility for the man whom she still obviously loves. In the end, they both paid pricey and costly for their mistakes for ruining each other's lives, for<br/><br/>not being responsible for not putting the effort to work on their relationship. He certainly paid his due with surviving the circus that the media has turned his life into and she paid hers by killing another man to order save the life of the man she loves, Amy: ""I had to fight my way back to you"". Ultimately they became better people but by all the wrong means."

","Much like The Game, Gone Girl requires you to suspend your level of disbelief by quite a bit in order for you to enjoy it. The events in the movie aren't necessarily impossible, just highly improbable, which can be a problem when you're expecting a realistic and grounded thriller. Even so, Gone Girl acts as something of a swansong to thrillers made in the 90's in which ordinary people were caught in ordinary circumstances and, before you know it, you've uttered the phrase ""they don't make movies like this anymore."" <br/><br/>Twisted, dark and surprisingly violent, Fincher's 2014 offering is a stylish and slick tale that kept me engrossed for around two hours. Some pieces of dialogue felt forced, other actions felt contrived, but overall it's a thriller/drama well worth watching. Despite numerous plot inconsistencies, I found that I came away from the film feeling satisfiedand yet slightly hollow. Maybe the bulk of my negative feelings are towards the last half an hour of the movie, where it really got weird. I heard this was changed from the source material too. <br/><br/>It's pretty funny though, seeing confused feminists rant and rave about the film, unable to decide whether it is pro-feminist or anti- feminist.<br/><br/>Best Scene: Boobs"

"Rickting","7","0","2","10 December 2015"," A respectable adaptation of a superior property
","Gone Girl was an excellent thriller novel; brilliantly written and complex, it built on the suspense before undoing itself with an awful ending. Bold, but too anticlimactic. So it's pretty cheeky to promise the film with have a new ending but then not change anything. Still, Gone Girl is a solid 4 star mystery thriller. Nick Dunne tries to solve the disappearance of his wife, who he had a troubled relationship with, but everyone thinks he did it. David Fincher directs so you know you're in for something interesting. That prediction was correct. Fincher is a stylistic and meticulous director who never fails to deliver on stunning cinematography even in the most mundane scenes. He delivers once again. He and the cast are probably what led to the film being so successful. Ben Affleck is still a little muted, but this is a surprisingly good performance from him. Carrie Coon is excellent as his sister, while even Tyler Perry is surprisingly good. The show is stolen by Rosamund Pike, whose brilliant and chilling villainous performance creates one of the best movie characters of 2014. Simultaneously terrifying and sympathetic, she completely owns the film.<br/><br/>GG is a thematically complex and relevant study of marriage and relationships, and, crafted with typical Fincher pessimism and haunting style, it is one of the ultimate 'Do not watch on a date' movies. There is a shocking scene of violence which was probably alone responsible for the 18 certificate in the UK which is handled very well, while despite the lack of action otherwise suspense is ably maintained throughout. Pulling off the novel's structure on film was always going to be hard, but the film tells the story coherently, although the mid film twist is deployed a little too early. GG is undeserving of its place in the IMDb Top 250 ultimately though. It's too long, it's detached at times and it all feels a bit far fetched. It doesn't always connect with its audience due to its commitment to relentlessly dour visuals and dialogue, while as mentioned earlier that ending is a big anti-climax. I'm satisfied with the movie overall and this is a strong thriller in general that is worth your time.<br/><br/>8/10"

Also to be honest I didn't really like her before but after watching this movie, I think she deserved to win the golden globe award instead of Julianne Moore. <br/><br/>Anyways, this movie was based on the novel Gone Girl, and nowadays we see a lot of movie based on a novel and usually it's not as good as the book. However, David Fincher did a intricate and richly satisfying adaptation from the book. I've never read the book, but still the movie gave me chills! Gone Girl is a psychological thriller movie and my favorite genre are thriller movies which is why I absolutely loved it. I know I keep on reiterating things but you guys should watch it! <br/><br/>What I am impressed about this movie was that everyone's acting was really smooth and absolutely flawless. Ben Affleck's acting is usually composed, calm, and in a way a bit boring. But I think his acting suited the character especially in this movie. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry also did a fine job as well. But I was most impressed with Rosamund Pike. In the movie, she was kind of the smart, self-centered bitch who is actually a freaking sociopath! two words to describe her acting would probably be ""DAMN Girl!""<br/><br/>Finally, before I say that this movie is good and all, the movie may be dull at the beginning, but it gets better throughout the end, so don't give up while watching this film!! <br/><br/>98/100"

I think they are more related to a pet peeve of mine of thinking that things in real life don't go on some directions movie tends to go.

","Gone Girl (2014): Dir: David Fincher / Cast: Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon: Gone expectations. Gone passion. Gone freedom. Director David Fincher creates another dark and disturbing thriller about a marriage void of feeling. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne, husband cheating with a much younger woman. He co-owns a bar with his twin sister. His wife, Amy, is played by Rosamund Pike, a writer known as Amazing Amy. She sees her marriage slipping away and the passion drained. Central plot regards Nick arriving home to vandalism and his wife missing. Speculations circle around Nick's less than sympathetic presentation and a police investigation with baffled reactions. Fincher is one of the finest directors of his generation with films such as The Social Network and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The screenplay is presented in clues, much to Affleck's dismay when dealing with the wayward manner beneath the vision of the law. The ending may be problematic to some seeking a peaceful resolution. Affleck plays off the frustrated persona of a husband restrained by feelings that aren't surfacing properly for anyone. Pike delivers one of her best performances as a wife under change and strain. Neil Patrick Harris plays an Amazing Amy stalker with a past given and a present of opportunity. Tyler Perry steals moments as a hot shot lawyer willing to represent Affleck. Carrie Coon is an emotional centre as his twin sister, a voice of reason who spirals into this tabloid nightmare as well. Its theme regards living with our choices and dealing with mistakes that render all good memories gone. Score: 8 / 10"

I really love all the intricate details he puts in his shots, and gave the cast a certain polish. The cast is all amazing in this movie. The clear star is Rosamund Pike, she initially starts all right and after each plot twist she gets better and better. I also really liked Kim Dickens' character, as she was the sensible person in the story. The only character that seems to be missing something is Desi Collings, played by NPH. He's alright, but I feel like he forgot a dimension to the character. Each character is also benefiting from great writing from the author of the book it is based on. Another thing I like about it is the themes of the press and gender roles. They hammer them home to a crowd not familiar with them. I remember pondering the themes for the next week. I really liked the ending. I can see how people hate it, but if I was in that situation, that is what I will do. Overall I really liked Gone Girl.

Did Nick murder his wife and hide the body, or is this seemingly cookie cutter case way more sinister than it originally seemed. Does anybody really know the person they're married to, or do they only know the person they've been pretending to be? What happened to Amy Dunne? Gone Girl is a phenomenal film with mind warping plot twists, and acting that shatters a characterization developed long ago. <br/><br/>The moment the trailer was released, I remember most people talking about how it is just another ""chick-flick"" and they have no interest in seeing it. When it finally hit theaters, those same people reluctantly went to see it and came out with rave reviews. The marketing was quite brilliant, because while the film seemed to be predictable and already done, people were drawn in and then mesmerized with a new unexpected story. <br/><br/>David Fincher is a brilliant director because as the movie first starts, there seems to be a clear predictable path without any surprise, until the story takes a sudden twist. The plot twist will leave you shocked and wanting to know more about what will happen to the characters now. As the twist unfolds, there is a clear and easy to follow time line to show the two shuttering perspectives of the same story. The story is bolstered yet again by the framing technique which takes the opening scene and uses it to wrap up as the ending, but at this point there is a whole new meaning. Watching the trailer does not do the film any justice, because by the time the movie hits the half way point, your jaw will have dropped to the floor. <br/><br/>The unique aspect about this movie is it completely shatters the ""cool girl"" characterization developed long ago. ""Cool girls"" were the hot, mysterious, and adventurous dames in the movies always smoking and drinking with the men. These girls are the women who are remarkably never angry with their husbands, and are whoever their husbands want them to be. This ""cool girl"" stereotype is on track, until it finally cracks revealing a scorned psychotic woman underneath the facade. Gone Girl unmasks this characterization for what it is, a cleverly disguised ruse.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike delivers a remarkable performance that leaves you terrified of the character's chilling psychopathic tendencies. Pike, with ease, displays that for each of her character's actions, there is a calculated and brilliant plan. Everything she does to mess with your head has flawless dedication and on your feet thinking without breaking character. Pike's thrilling performance will leave you petrified and awestruck. <br/><br/>Gone Girl is a must see film that is certainly not the predictable story it seems to be at first glance. An enthralling story that hooks you in and doesn't let go until you finally piece together the puzzle. Once you've seen the movie, the twisted storyline makes you question who people really are. The storyline is only bolstered by phenomenal performances that leave you in awe, questioning what you just watched and how life becomes this way."

","This movie is really tense. At first it seemed slow but things get more interesting as the plot thickens. I cannot imagine a better person to play the role of Amy, the disappearing wife, than Rosamund Pike. She definitely nailed it. As for Ben Affleck, his expression really fits the movie. He looks clueless, and is helpless with the situation. The other characters were great too. Carrie Coon, who played Affleck's sister, was also great. She helps highlight the plight of Affleck's character, and for a moment, also helped highlight his flaws. It is quite refreshing to see the good guys be totally helpless till the end of a movie that is not a horror movie. To be honest, the situation in the movie is almost like a horror movie for marriage, where the moral is: choose the right person or you will be stuck. p.s. though I rated this movie high, I don't think I will want to re-watch it. It is like the Saw series, enjoyable in the first watch but can't stomach another one. So if you want to enjoy it, make sure you have gotten rid of all possible annoyances."

I was hoping he would have his wife's confession on taper AFTER the shower scene when he confronted her, or the robot dog they were given as a gift had a hidden camera and mic. I didn't like the ending at all. To think they would stay together in such a dysfunctional and dangerous marriage is beyond belief. Of course, Ben Afflect couldn't be the father.

","I remember the first time I saw this movie. I was so excited since it is David Fincher's film, one of my favorite directors. I walked out and I was fully amazed of the story. To me, this is not the first Fincher's movie I rate it 10/10, the girl with the dragon tattoo was the first, and I don't think it will be the last!<br/><br/>When you see the trailer for the first time, it might not really excite you to watch the movie because the story seems kind of familiar. A man who suddenly his wife gone missing and he searches for her and maybe he finds her or maybe not. However, the movie has many surprises and twists you might never guess. It is so twisted that I might spoiler the movie if I continue talking about the story. It is absolutely a smart, psychologic and dark movie with excellent frames and performances. <br/><br/>Although it is a critically-acclaimed movie, it has one well deserved Oscar nomination for a best-leading actress for Rosamund Pike. However, I think the director, the screenwriter, the cinematographer, and the amazing, twisted soundtrack need recognitions. I would never think of another composer other than Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. They gave dark atmosphere to the movie. The movie also might open your eye about the media and how it controls people.<br/><br/>If you didn't watch it go and see it now!!"
"midas-jacobs","10","0","5","28 July 2015"," Fincher did it again
","Before you read this review just keep in mind that I have read the book and that I enjoyed the book and the movie.<br/><br/>So gone girl is about Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick(Ben Affleck). They are a happy married couple for the outside world. one day Amy gets missing and Nick has to help the police to help finding his wife. You get to see the movie from two perspectives: Nick's perspective and Amy's perspective, but Amy's is a bit more interesting than Nick's because Amy's perspective is her diary. Just like the tag line: there are three sides of a story: her side, his side and the truth (my favorite tag line by the way)<br/><br/>Now that I have told brief what this movie is about, I will talk about the acting writing and directing. But first the directing. Like I have said in the title of my review: Fincher did it again. Because he did. The directing was just fantastic. He filmed it with a darker tone, something like zodiac, just a tone lighter. This style really helped with the tone of the movie in general. <br/><br/>The acting and writing of the movie was also amazing. Ben Affleck did a very good job at portraying Nick Dunne. But Rosamund Pike just blew the part, she was the best and just like I imagined Amy. A very dark and psychotic person who framed her husband for her own movie. I really liked the part when the viewer realized that Amy is alive and planed all of this, I of course saw this coming, but it was also very well executed in the movie. Tyler perry was really good and it is his best movie in a while, think about Alex cross, the books were amazing, but the movie really sucked. the actress of Margo (Carrie Coon) was pretty good, just not as I imagined Margo, but still she was good. Neil Patrick Harris was just perfect as Desi. Really liked the scene where he gets killed, because the scene was very well acted, directed and also very, very scary. Here you see again the psychotic side of Amy. This scene is very gory and bloody so if you can't handle bloody parts, you should skip this part. David Clennon was funny as the dad of Nick, and was very accurate if you compare him to the book.<br/><br/>Something that I really liked of the movie was that they stayed very true to the book and I like the characters too. they are all very interesting, especially Amy. This is something that Gillian Flynn didn't keep in her other books ('Sharp Objects' and 'Dark Places') don't get me wrong, I really liked the other books too but 'Gone Girl' was definitely the best book of Flynn's novels.<br/><br/>This movie is also pretty clever. Look at the clues Amy left, and also the plan Amy had. When I was reading the book I didn't see all of that coming and was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>But here are some individual scores:<br/><br/>Directing: 10/10<br/><br/>Acting: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Writing: 9/10<br/><br/>Trilling: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Ending: 9.5/10<br/><br/>That is a total of 47.5/50 which is rounded a 10/10. I really liked this movie and I would definitely recommend this to people who like thrillers who are clever and psychotic."

The one thing about this film that drives is I do not buy the thought process of the Ben affleck character at the end. The entire movie is him hating his wife, seeing her manipulate her, and basically her general awfulness. So that fact that she ends up pregnant, as well as her having one minor monologue, all of a sudden he feels trapped with her. And you can see that when he announces she's pregnant. You can see he's depressed. Why he would stay with her, let alone attempt to make any sort of charge against her. She murdered a guy, it pisses me off. And it is annoying, because the rest of this film is really great. So besides the ending and her general awfulness at the Neil Patrick Harris house.

","This is an example of just how great a film can really be when the original novel writer also writes the screenplay, gets top actors and their dream director. I saw writer Gillian Flynn at Chicago's Lit Fest and had the pleasure of hearing her speak. I heard her say in another interview that David Fincher was her favorite director. And he was more than well suited to helm the making of this very interesting film.<br/><br/>Flynn is a well known member of the Chicago literati and has written many novels. Having read the book, I was anxious to see the film, knowing that it would most likely be exceptional - even though I already knew the storyline and outcome.<br/><br/>This is a modern day tale of lust, greed, selfishness and an emptiness that seems to be pervasive in today's society. We marry before we know people, or even ourselves - often for the sport of it. What results is more emptiness, treachery and infidelity. With a psychopath, this is a dangerous road to travel. In fact, it can be downright deadly. Or much worse - as most will see in this film. Yes, there are things worse than death. Like getting caught in a trap you can never get out of as long as you are alive."

","Ben Affleck is apparently a happily married man who returns home one afternoon to find the living room is a mess, there are blood spots on the wall, and his wife, Rosamund Pike, is gone. The police force of the small Indiana town investigate and find that the kidnapping was staged. Their suspicions naturally fall on the husband and he is battered in the news. Everyone wants a quick solution.<br/><br/>The suspicions are heightened when the wife's half-burned diary shows entries indicating that the marriage was failing and that she was scared to death her husband was going to kill her. Affleck is charged, hires a media-savvy lawyer.<br/><br/>The case has become one of those nationwide incidents like O. J. Simpson's, in which everyone follows events daily and has made judgments about Affleck's guilt -- all to the effect that he murdered his wife, of course. The TV cameras have been rolling throughout and the reporters are an unruly horde. Affleck's personality is dissected by a Nancy-Grace figure on television. The audience is especially gleeful when Affleck reveals that he has been schtupping one of his students at the community college where he teaches.<br/><br/>It's absolutely sensational (but a little confusing to the media's narrative) when his wife finally returns, bloodied but not unbowed, claiming she really WAS kidnapped, abused, and had to kill her abductor to free herself. She's dressed only in a blood-soaked nightgown and she collapses in her husband's arms on the lawn, while the cameras roll and everyone gasps with delight.<br/><br/>Well, the whole plot is really too complicated to explain. It's a somber story and nobody emerges guilt free. On the audio commentary, the director seems self confident, maybe too much so. (""F*** you,"" he announces to some of his critics.) But it's a useful commentary because you learn what the director was getting at, even if it doesn't come across vividly on the screen.<br/><br/>The gap is understandable. The director, like the writer, knows what's going on because, after all, he's READ THE SCRIPT and knows how it will all turn out. But the catch is that, knowing all this, the director is liable to project his knowledge and assume that the audience is more sophisticated than it actually is. In other words, the ""hints"" and forshadowings are minimal and don't get past the viewer's apperceptive apparatus. Dave -- we're stupid.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the malleable and naive Affleck and the manipulative and morally bankrupt Pike. Marriage is like a deck of cards. In the beginning all you need is two hearts and a diamond. By the end you wish you had a club and a spade. Affleck seems honestly in love, while Pike is manipulative. As Jorge Luis Borges said, ""To fall in love is to create a religion that has a fallible god.""<br/><br/>But I'd prefer to read it as a comment on the media. Here is a complex, small-scale, interpersonal event and the media turn it into a morality play that reverses the roles of victims and the perpetrator. Pike, the murderess, becomes the abused heroine of the tale. Affleck, the simple minded dupe, has revealed all of his weaknesses and peccadilloes in television interviews.<br/><br/>Well, as any member of the viewing audience will tell you, he doesn't deserve a wonderful woman like Pike. The audience doesn't even have to think about the moral calculus. It's given to them by the price of a TV dish.<br/><br/>The reason I see this as perhaps the most important ""message"" of the film is that it's happening now, every day, and not just with regard to such personal transgressions and murder and sexual abuse but to issues of fundamental import, like politics. Led on by television, our opinions precede the analysis. I'm for a ""strong"" dollar. And why? No TV personality has ever told me I shouldn't. I like the word ""strong"" when it applies to anything American. Please don't confuse me with a lot of complicated junk about imports and exports. If it's ""American"" it's got to be ""strong."" <br/><br/>I'll give away a part of the ending. Except for the fact that Affleck and Pike will now probably become rich as a consequence of the TV movie and the books, nothing much changes."

","This thriller is based on Gillian Flynn's novel. Not a chick flick; not a thinking man's thriller...but a well acted, well written unsettling drama that follows Nick Dunne(Ben Affleck)being dogged by police and determined media as he becomes the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance. On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick reports that his high profile wife, Amy(Rosamund Pike), known to thousands as the Amazing Amy, is missing.<br/><br/>Amy has lived her life in the spotlight as author of children's books supposedly paralleling her own childhood life. Well-to-do parents always seeming to pull the strings on the stunning woman's life and never a fan of the man she married. Amy is smart as she is beautiful and plays a game leaving clues for her husband to find something special in celebrating their anniversary. These clues become damning evidence that Nick is not actually a grieving husband.<br/><br/>Nick's calmness under pressure from the media frenzy and hounding police detectives begins to crack. In seeps the darker side of the couple's so-believed blissful union. His sister Margo(Carrie Coon), co-owner of their bar, is his only support. Highly recognized attorney Tanner Bolt(Tyler Perry), no slouch when it comes to the media, becomes Nick's defender. Deceit and anger comes to the forefront and Bolt is determined to spin the media on its heals.<br/><br/>Don't let me go any further. An almost perfect crime comes unraveled. Most of the filming is done in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. There is strong sexual content, nudity and bloody violence earning an R rating.

The part where he gives a brief smile while being photographed by the media, is pure genius. But the biggest star is Pike, she had me going crazy (almost as crazy as her), of what is going on. Her contribution to the role of Amy is riveting. I believe the viewers will be entertained up until the last minute of the movie with a lot of turning points and new theory's as to what the hell happened to Amy. Even though the storyline is a grim one, there are great moments of humor as well, which gives the viewers a natural break from the seriousness. Those are appreciated moments. Unfortunately there are some small pot holes (without giving too much away), but you kind of forgive them since everything else is exiting to watch. I give it a good and healthy 8 out of 10.

","Man. Sssssiiiiggghhhh...... I was so excited to see Gone Girl. I'd seen the interviews on Jimmy Fallon. I'd read a few reviews that didn't contain spoilers. I was so ready for the ride. I suppose this should be the point where I let y'all know that I simply don't care for movies, television shows that contain gratuitous violence, sex, foul language, and/or violence perpetrated on children. I realize this severely limits my choices, but not really. The key word here is gratuitous. If the film could be done without it and still be as powerful, it's gratuitous. Gone Girl is the Prom Queen of Gratuity. Ben Affleck isn't my favorite actor, but I really appreciated his character and his performance. I do feel like we have seem this character so many times though. Uninvested husband, selfish, adulterous, and slimy. The character is unimaginative, but purposefully so. However, ""Amazing Amy"" is a character that has depth. The fact that her book series, written by her mother, was an actual toy in the early 90's was very distracting for me. I bought the original ""Amazing Amy"" doll for my almost 23 year old daughter for Christmas in 1996. My daughter's doll, thankfully, couldn't be any further from the character of Amy if she tried. But, it was a distracting point for new throughout the story. Amy and Nick, Nick and Amy. Throw in a twin for Nick (Margot) and an incredibly successful/wealthy sweet if patents for Amy, and the plot is even more boring. Boy from the wrong side of the tracks woos rich, troubled girl looking for a bad boy. But, again, deliberately so. Casting becomes surreal with characters that are supposed to emulate Nancy Grace and other criminal pundits that amass and swarm through any major criminal case in our social media these days. The actress was dead on, presenting the exaggerated persona of Nancy Grace to perfection. Sela Ward and Tyler Perry are bit players without any real issues or merit in the film and could have easily been portrayed by no name actors without taking anything away from the film. Neil Patrick Harris does his best at reprising his creepy fall side; seen for one if the first times in this season's installment of American Horror Story: Freak Show. Harris is creepy. But, again, deliberately so. In fact, the character was presented and portrayed without any real imagination or depth. Just a creepy dude with the hots for a crazy chick . The fact that he was naked, murdered while having sex, is really inconsequential. No one really cared because the man wasn't developed to be Anthony more than used. Murdered? Yeah, well, OK. He was creepy. The very much hyped storyline wasn't one that we've never seen before. Amy is a criminal mastermind. I had it pegged by the time she was ""gone""...showing her methods and steps really wasn't all that imaginative either. She was written to be a psychopathic maniac. And she played it exactly as was written. Her lack of emotion was distracting for me. I know we were supposed to be lead by her good looks, her sexual prowess, and her wealth. I wasn't. Neither was my spouse. We were verbally pointing out mistakes made, every time, like....""she used the Punch and Judy mallet, the cops found it, her prints are all over it. He never touched it. Didn't they dust it for prints? And if they did, did they Luminol it too? Bloody fingerprints on the mallet would still show."" Or,""what about the stupid wood shed? All those purchases hidden in Margot's shed. They ran the financial reports, thought he stashed it all there. Did they dust for prints there? No."" And, one of my favorites, ""There are cameras everywhere in the Lake House. But not in the master bedroom? Ummmm, no. We see the camera. We also see that Amy kills him with the box cutter. But there's no camera leading to or from the bathroom or in the bathroom? No camera leading from the kitchen where she obviously took the wine bottle and knife she used to rape herself with? "" Plot holes a semi trick could drive through. And the wrapped Clear Blue Easy pregnancy test before the interview.....Ummmm, yeah, no. All pregnancy test sticks show positive if left long enough."" This was supposed to be the ""must see"" movie. I bought into the hype. I was ready. We were ready. Our date night movie. The most fun was poking holes through the story. So, I guess there's that. Gone Girl. More appropriate title would have been ""Snapped:The Movie"""
"lucasversantvoort","7","0","1","6 May 2015"," I went in expecting Jagten/The Hunt...
","...and what I got was part that and part tongue-in-cheek winks and nods at those who know their Hitchcock. Yes, watching Gone Girl was definitely a strange experience The film focuses on Nick Dunne whose wife, Amy, has disappeared. He contacts the police and an investigation is started, resulting in a giant search. The film chronicles his search for her with flashbacks to when he first met her all the way to their marriage troubles. This, combined with strange clues in the present investigation, gives plenty of reason to suspect Nick. I'll refrain from saying anything more as I would be giving too much away. I'll be talking about the film's second half from here on, so I've you're intending on remaining spoiler-free, then stop here. Reviewing this film is impossible without talking about it anyway. As such, this review will be both review and mini-analysis.<br/><br/>To state what I liked about Gone Girl isn't really insightful as to what kind of film this is. Yes, the acting and production values are great, there are some really tense scenes and there's a lot of dialogue that's really fun and clever, but that's not the point. What defines this film is its shift in style about halfway in. The first half is more what I expected, a police investigation where you're constantly wondering whether Nick's guilty or not. Then, we discover Amy staged her own disappearance out of spite. This goes back to their failing marriage. This is precisely when the film does a 180 and changes in style completely. What was first sort of a straightforward whodunit has turned into craziness with plenty of nods to Hitchcock and the like. We flashback to how Amy staged her disappearance which involves drawing a lot of blood from her veins while reading a book so she doesn't faint, breaking furniture, but rearranging certain things so that it looks staged (making Nick look suspicious), etc. This crazy amount of planning changes everything. You don't show a scene like that and still pretend you're an intelligent thriller dealing with concepts of 'innocent until proved guilty' and commenting on how the media influence public opinion, etc. Towards the end she stages another escape from another obsessed lover. She returns home all bloodied and embraces Nick outside their house while the media take pictures, obviously interpreting it as the couple being reunited. But Nick doesn't really trust her (and can you blame him!?), but when he says he'll leave, Amy counters by saying how that'll look on national television. So they remain together and put on a good face for the press.<br/><br/>It's only when you've watched Gone Girl that you can fully realize that it's almost like the two halves were directed by different people. The first half is straightforward. You watch the investigation develop, you're alternating between trust and suspicion as to whether or not Nick is guilty and you see how the media affects public perception. This reminded me of Vinterberg's Jagten. But the second half is an entirely different beast. Amy isn't just some poor woman who's gone missing, but a sociopath. She meticulously stages (future) crime scenes like it's nothing, slashing someone's throat with a Stanley knife in one of them and eventually returns to Nick (who reached out to her during a TV interview). Unsurprisingly, he tries to make her a suspect when she's questioned by the authorities, but eventually he's forced to resume his relationship with her. The second half isn't so much about the role of the media and all that, but one big meta-commentary on Hitchcockian thrillers and inside jokes. There's the notion of the perfect murder that's toyed with. There's even a scene where Nick and Amy are showering just after she's returned and the blood on her body is literally seen flowing down the drain. It would make Hitchcock chuckle.<br/><br/>The film starts out as one thing and becomes something else entirely. The problem is that the second half feels really over-the-top and all the nods to thrillers feels tongue-in-cheek, like you're supposed to be in on the joke. The film however remains deadly serious (especially given the first half) and that's the problem. What starts as social commentary ends up as a self-aware exercise in making thrillers. There's nothing wrong with thisif the entire film was like this, but it's not. The second half feels incredibly removed from the feel of the first half and it was hard to take it seriously. I felt like I was supposed to laugh at all the inside jokes, but all the seriousness made it hard for me to do so. Perhaps if the entire film was filled with nods and winks at the audience... In this sense, it's like House of Cards which I reviewed recently and is basically a ridiculous show that takes itself really seriously. The same general critique applies here. What makes this comparison even more interesting is that Fincher directed two episodes of House of Cards and serves as an executive producer. I guess when a character actually uses the word 'meta', you have to anticipate the film will work on multiple levels (like casting Affleck of all people which would make many people immediately wary of Nick). But that doesn't mean the end result is going to be something I will love."

I will not reveal what happens in the end. but all I can just say is it's that it ended badly and even when you think It's not all over and the plot starts getting more interesting they stopped the movie abruptly. which makes everything that you were liking about the movie to convert into....aaaarghh(Sh...t) and it is a pity because I was enjoying it very much, but the end makes me not to like everything I've seen from the beginning. So please make a second more interesting movie with a little bit of action and good ending. Regards"

","Ratings: 8.2/10 from 382,959 users, this is another top film in my collection and since I am making my way down, to the lowest ratings, this has to be watched first. I would rather watch something more energetic but, judging by the high rating of this one, it should entertain me enough. Let's find out! EDIT: Oh David Fincher is the director now I know why do people love it. He made one of the best films I have ever seen: The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999).<br/><br/>9 minutes – it's good, not super good just good, but you can feel the greatness coming out of it and only expect better and better things to come with time <br/><br/>12 minutes – the music is good! <br/><br/>56 minutes – oh my F god! You wouldn't like to be in this guy's shoes, the whole world is about to fall on his head, COMPLICATIONS! <br/><br/>1h 6minutes – lol and once again I have confirmed my suspicions about the music score – Mr Trent Reznor, good job! + I think, I already know what is going on in the film <br/><br/>1h 8minutes – yup, I was right but they have already showed it now so I was kind of late. I have also forgot to mention, how good is Ben Affleck's acting, top notch work! Still, more than half of the film left, and I wonder what will happen next <br/><br/>1h 24minutes – damn what a story! I think, I liked the first half of the film more, everything was so mysterious and unknown but now, they play with open cards. Still plenty of minutes left, let's see what will happen next <br/><br/>1h 39 minutes – COMPLICATIONS! but this time, on the opposite end. I can see where the plot is going and I don't like it but, I freaking enjoy the film! <br/><br/>1h 45 minutes – guess what? Even more complications! Do you like them? Well, you will love this film just like I do! <br/><br/>1h 52minutes – what a mind game, this is like an action film, but all the special effects happen in the acting and the plot <br/><br/>2h 5minutes – holy mother of god! This film keep surprising you at every step <br/><br/>2h 11minutes – if you ever marry a book writer, remember what may happen lol <br/><br/>2h 23minutes – checkmate baby<br/><br/>Damn! What a film!!! I really don't even know how to rate it. I liked it a lot, a lot a lot but I just can't give it more than this.

"sunshinebeachcinema","8","0","1","28 April 2015"," A powerful, suspenseful horror-thriller with great turns by Afflek & Pike
","I saw Gone Girl when I was home for a week last Halloween, a time during which I was watching a combination of old James Bond films and schlocky slashers like Scream (1996) and Freddy vs. Jason (2003) all films which are more cheesy than scary. During my one trip to the cinema that week, Gone Girl was the film which kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a real thriller with horrifying scenes making it almost a horror film itself.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil details of a plot which works best as a mystery, but the premise is that Midwestern everyman Nick Dunne (Ben Afflek) returns home one day (his fifth wedding anniversary no less) to find his glamorous wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. The ensuing media circus then throws Nick into suspicion.<br/><br/>The film's strength is its manipulation of the viewer. We follow and side with Nick initially; Ben Afflek plays him as fairly neutral, a blank slate. Maybe he's too passive in the face of his wife's disappearance. Is he guilty or does he simply not know how to react? He seems likable enough, but there's something just behind it.<br/><br/>During the first act the couple's relationship is told through flashbacks, incorporating segments of Amy's diary, and we gradually begin to side with her. These dual narrative strands are apparently from the original wildly popular novel by Gillian Flynn, who wrote the screenplay. We must be in safe hands.<br/><br/>David Fincher, whose last film was the English-language remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, retains something of the Nordic noir to Gone Girl. The film is full of darkness, sex and violence. Camera angles are sweeping and the scenery both bleak and beautiful. At the heart of the film is an exploration of humanity which is divisive and ambiguous.<br/><br/>Though a long film, it is never boring. There was a point around halfway through when some kind of resolution seems to have been reached, but the film keeps going and the pace and intensity increases. Rosamund Pike's role increases as the story progresses and without giving too much away, her performance is powerful.<br/><br/>Role and image are major themes. On some level, everyone is playing a part, deliberately projecting or hiding behind a facade. Amy has been fictionalised by her writer parents in the overblown, saccharine Amazing Amy books which she has never been able to live up to. She has a place in the public eye and this is why the press descends so rapidly on the case. <br/><br/>As the audience struggles to understand his psyche, Nick is struggling to appease the exploitative media. He hires Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), a lawyer specialising in image and defending suspected husbands. Perry's role is dramatic but played with a much needed balancing touch of humour. Of note too is Neil Patrick Harris's rare straight role as Amy's ex-boyfriend Desi.<br/><br/>The music, from serene yet ominous ambient soundscapes to throbbing electronica was composed by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and his producer Atticus Ross who have collaborated on Fincher's last two films. In keeping with the theses of this film, they have created a score which is simultaneously soothing and unnerving.<br/><br/>I'll finish by acknowledging that there are some plot holes in the decidedly complicated narrative, particularly paper trails, alibis and the possible existence of exonerating security footage. Again, I won't go into too much detail, but at one point a detective begins to question such a hole but is quickly shot down.<br/><br/>Presumably these details would come to light sometime later during the inevitable long investigation. The case ends far from closed. But the film is more than just the plot, which is nevertheless engaging. As a piece of film making, the themes, music and visuals remain powerful."
"hn-49106","7","0","2","27 April 2015"," An entertaining, but not memorable movie
","This movie is based on the novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn. Having read the book, I looked forward to viewing the film. I was disappointed. Movies adapted from fictions tend to be not as good as the originals. This movie is no exception. It cuts so many details from the book that the movie seems to be much shorter and simpler than the fiction. As a result, I like the book a lot more than the movie. <br/><br/>The movie is about the marriage life of Nick (played by Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike). Amy disappeared on their fifth anniversary. All the circumstantial evidences point to Nick as the murderer. Was he the killer? The twisted plot around this question is the interesting part of the movie. However, the movie is too long (2.5 hours), unrealistic, and at time unreasonable. For example, what is the motivation for Amy to commit murder? The conclusion of the movie is as disappointed as the book's. <br/><br/>I didn't have any strong impression one way or another after sitting for two hours and a half watching the film. I didn't remember any particular scenes, nor pieces of music, nor dialogue. <br/><br/>Here are my general scoring. Plot: Average, confusing sometimes, 6/10. Acting: Ben Affleck - good, Rosamund Pike - Very good, 7/10 Cinematography: Good, 6.5/10 Music: nothing memorable, 6/10 Dialogue: good 7/10 Overall impression: Movie is too long. Average to good, boring, 6.5/10"
"sphanish","8","0","1","25 April 2015"," gone girl is an epic drama about vengeance and betrayal put together in a twisted manner.
","gone girl is an amazing movie. through its 2 hours 30 min run i never felt that the movie was drifting off its premise. it had me at the edge of my seat through out and couldn't wait for the mystery to unravel. gone girl had me wrapped like a cold blanket of ice and the soundtrack only helped to make gone girl a chilling captivating experience(would like to take aside and give a thumbs up to Trent reznor and atticus Ross for doing such a wonderful job on the score). along with an amazing story gone girl also had strong hold of amazing acting and i do think that casting in comedy actors like Neil Patrick and Tyler perry who both have starred in strings of popular comedy movies was a pretty dumb thing to do. at the end i guess it worked well because both Tyler and Neil bring nothing new to the table. this is equalized by the amazing performance delivered by Rosamund pike and surprisingly good Carrie coon. who i got to admit did a pretty good job. Ben affleck in this movie is at his average. altogether gone girl is an amazing drama mystery movie with some really good acting and music and is a fun watch. it wouldn't let you down at any moment and you get what you expected. A David fincher classic."

","Director David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" (2007), ""Se7en"" (1995), and ""The Social Network"" (2101) are Great Films but this one Never Reaches that Status but it isn't for Lack of Trying. The Movie is Stuffed and Paraded, Staged and Twisted and Not All of it Works.<br/><br/>It's also bit too Long and some of the Template and Deconstruction about the Media is Overused and Flat. Ben Affleck Mumbles a lot as expected rendering some of the Dialog Difficult. Rosamund Pike as Amy is Better and the Best of the Film is when the Viewer is Inside Her Head as She Softly Rants Her Anger, Disappointment, Insanity, and Revenge.<br/><br/>The Supporting Cast is OK, except Tyler Perry who comes off as a Grinning Goofball and seems Out of Place in this World. Neil Patrick Harris isn't quite as Awkward but Almost.<br/><br/>The Director's Dark Touches are Welcome here and there and the Score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is Ominous and Creepy. The Story Works Best when it is about a Disintegrating Marriage and the He/She Wedges. But, once again, that Media Stuff, there is just Too Much of it. <br/><br/>Overall, a Cerebral Modernism that is Well Crafted, Well Written, and Good to Look at and Try and Figure Out. More of it Hits than Misses, but the Misses are a Distraction. Definitely Worth a Watch."
"jenssen74","8","0","2","20 March 2015"," Classical crime drama
","A classical crime story set in our modern time. The script is strong enough to be held up against the big ones of eras gone by. This film is truly a modern classic in its film noir references, although with a modern take to it.<br/><br/>Afflecks interpretation is believable at almost all the time, so much so that we start distrusting him at a time in the story where we should stop and think. Instead we do as humans - we react with feelings - and distrust. <br/><br/>As a European film-lover, and used to strong scripts and less of a budget, compared to what Hollywood puts out - I'm probably overexposed to US-film, but this is one I truly enjoyed. If you like crime-drama, this is for you."
"gurumattka2","9","0","3","19 March 2015"," Eerily Amazing
","Please forgive my first-time review's shortsighted shortcomings. Getting right to it, Gone Girl is a greater movie. By greater I mean, its flying colors grow will grow brighter over the years. It's an awesome reincarnation of a Hitchcockian idea that never touched paper or second hands. If there's a twilight zone, this is the dawn zone. Assuming you know the movie and it's parts, the ""Miracle on the Mississippi"" is a nice touch for added resonating significance to the everyday existence of kidnappings in the heartland of beautifully ordinary people with assembled identities straight out of catalog Camelot. This film has a cold touch in the likes of Kubrick - a presentation by HAL of a suburban crime drama. The music most certainly helps add a fourth dimensional feel to Amy's experience in the story. I felt like I was in Amy's soul - which the walls of, you don't want to hear talk. I'm big horror snob. I love Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, and the Blair Witch Project. I'm absolutely a huge fan of Fincher's work, I feel like he's an excellent incarnation of being the maestro of maddening madness that can only come from movies where the unseen or the atrocious have a soul-scarring pulse. This movie is scary as sh!t. I think boiled rabbits have become as soft as Cadbury Eggs at this point. Love this movie!"

","""Gone Girl"" is a mystery movie in which we watch a man being the main suspect of his wife's disappearance. And a fight with everyone and of course media starts to prove his innocence. As many clues come up then his position becomes more difficult and that's the point where the reality is starting to appear and everything changes.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because of the plot which was simply magnificent, it had many swifts that keep you in tense and you can not relax even for one moment. This is something that makes this movie so interesting, that mystery can change everything in a movie. I also liked the direction which made by David Fincher and it was very good. About the interpretations I have to admit that I did not expect nothing less than this great interpretation of Ben Affleck who played as Nick Dunne. I also liked the interpretation of Rosamund Pike who played as Amy Dunne and she was equally good. Another interpretation that I have to mention is Kim Dickens who played as Detective Rhonda Boney.<br/><br/>Lastly I have to say that ""Gone Girl"" is a very good movie to watch because it combines very well mystery with drama and the result from this is a perfect movie.

","Pleasantly surprised by this film.

The police seem suspicious but affleck doesn't have a clue why. It turns out the house looks like a cover up has happened, the way things are placed and the way it has been cleaned. They then find traces of blood, money changing accounts and affleck becomes the main suspect.<br/><br/>I wont go into the whole story but the film has you guessing wheter affleck is the killer or not as the evidence points towards him and the goings on prior to the dissaperance all seem very odd.

","""Gone girl"" is a thriller from 2014 full of excitement. I have been watching it with disbelief and frustration. I enjoyed it, it was very good. The leading roles are by Ben Affleck, best known for ""Good Will Hunting""' and Rosamund Pike, who you may have seen in ""Jack Reacher"", for example. The most well-known supporting role for me is Neil Patrick Harris, a familiar character from the series ""How I met your mother"". A good cast, in my opinion. The film takes two and a half hour, and remains enthralling until the end. Excellent work by director David Fincher (House of cards, Zodiac). I'm very positive.<br/><br/>The main characters have been married for five years, when the woman suddenly disappears. It is interesting to see the story from different perspectives, and surprising to see that you were wrong this whole time (I was). This film fits into the list of ""Zodiac"" and ""Prisoners"". If I would want to add anything negative to maintain the balance, it would be (spoiler alert) the police believing the story at the end, while almost everything is unexplainable by her story. However, this keeps the story exciting until after the expiration of the film. It isn't over.."
"insulationed","10","0","4","9 March 2015"," One of the best of the year for me so far.
","Everyone should give this movie a watch, watched it with a family member and we thought it was one of the best of the year. It's like our little inside thing we're constantly referring to. People giving this a one star honestly are being unreasonable, most likely just dislike it because it has really good reviews. You only give a really terrible movie one star, with bad acting and all.<br/><br/>Gone Girl keeps you watching on your toes from the start to beginning. It makes you begin thinking, then you start to piece together how everything makes sense if you paid attention. It may seem like she made mistakes, and they showed those moments, but she always covered them smoothly. It's one of those movies where you think ""even though the girl is psycho, you have to admit that was cool"". <br/><br/>Gone Girl creates a young attractive woman that really knows how to use charm to manipulate people. You see a pretty woman like her covered in blood or in a bad situation, you do not question it, you feel bad and try however to help her. You ignore that some things are unanswered.."
"haris-mumtaz","8","0","3","9 March 2015"," Crazily Dominating
","You can expect anything from Fincher because he is not the one who creates for the sake of creation, but they create for the sake of experience and make themselves part of the audience who are experiencing it. Nothing much to say about a strong story plot and a brilliant screenplay, it's the art of making it that has made this movie special.<br/><br/>For the word go I was not convinced that Ban is fully tailored for his role but then it was like challenging the conviction of Fincher who successfully manipulated the personality of Tyler Durden and made us think even today that Brad Pitt was real.<br/><br/>This movie is a thriller which will start giving you Goosebumps after the first hour, before that this movie will make you busy thinking and jumping to conclusion knowing that what you are thinking is wrong. The power of Fincher is that he has mark in audience minds and has gone above from the level of being predicted. This power has boosted the level of thriller in the movie.<br/><br/>Amy is brilliant and looks convincingly evil with innocence. Strength of her character was her silence which she fold brilliantly in the veil of deception. <br/><br/>Now It's Nolen or Fincher who left audience in an awe when movie ends? I think both have these ability along with other and the best part of this movie is .. nothing is resolved, just like life.<br/><br/>A MUST WATCH if you are Fincher's fan"

","I really enjoyed this film, the length of Gone Girl is a bit risky for people that don't like to go past the hour and a half mark but Fincher made it lovable. One of my favourite drama/thrillers. I have currently purchased the book and I'm thoroughly enjoying it just as much as the film. It has to be said that Amy Dunne is one of my favourite femme fatal of them all, when the film came to an end I felt very empowered as a woman. She was intelligent and witty, brave and so amazing that even Amazing Amy could not beat. Although, she was a bit of a loon she gave (and I quote from most women that have watched this extraordinary film) us a lot of empowerment. The way Ben Affleck's acting made us feel he was the antagonist, when we are introduced to the living Amy, fine and living life freely, we are brought to choose a side. All of the film is a huge disequilibrium (I thought) from one side or the other. It shows that the ideal ""American Dream"" doesn't exist in this film and it certainly shows men we have more power than they thought and maybe they should consider not cheating or this could happen to them! Only having a joke, but it's not impossible. Ben Affleck became this person everyone hated throughout the film and towards the end feel a little bit of sympathy for his character being trapped in a relationship due to the media playing so part, since the media becomes very into the Nick and Amy story, all Amy had to do was subtract herself for a while, create a story to put Nick Dunne in a bad light, reappear and add a baby to lock him into a life of misery. Great thriller/ drama. David Fincher has done it again! Amazing plot from Gillian Flynn, looking forward to the next book she produces. Thank you for reading."

","Nick Dunne's wife has gone missing. He pleads with the public for help in finding her and bringing her safely home. But the evidence clearly indicates that his wife has met a bloody end. Nick can protest his innocence and go through the motions of looking for his wife all he wants. To the police this is a murder investigation and he is the one and only suspect. Evidence mounts, motive is established. To say things don't look good for Nick would be putting it mildly. His only ally is his twin sister but Nick gives even her reason to doubt him. There's a media firestorm surrounding the case. Television loves it whenever an attractive young blonde woman goes missing. And Nick's wife is no ordinary pretty young thing. She's Amazing Amy, the inspiration for a line of popular children's books written by her parents. The police are all over Nick, the media have convicted him before he's even charged. The disappearance of Amazing Amy is the biggest cause célèbre in the nation. And the nation has decided Nick is the villain in this story. And then...<br/><br/>Suffice to say Gone Girl is a film with the capacity to surprise. Things are not always what they seem. Screenwriter Gillian Flynn, working from her own novel, spins a fascinating tale. And in the ever-capable hands of director David Fincher that tale is brought to brilliant cinematic life. This film is captivating from beginning to end, with clever twists and stunning shocks sprinkled throughout. Fincher expertly guides you through a story which goes in directions you never could have expected. It's a story, and a film, with some real intelligence. This is a puzzle which was put together ever so well.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck, playing Nick, provides a solid foundation upon which the film can build. Should we sympathize with this man? Or demonize him? It's an enigmatic character and Affleck does a fine job with it, keeping you guessing until you finally have the information you need to pass judgment on this man. For as good as Affleck is the real standout is Rosamund Pike playing Amy. Amazing indeed. You think Nick is enigmatic? Wait until you get a load of her. She has already gone missing when the movie begins so we meet Amy through flashbacks, seeing the happy start of her relationship with Nick and then the couple's sad spiral as their marriage falters. Ultimately the character of Amy goes to some very interesting places. This is a character who evolves in such a way that it is an extremely challenging role to play. And Pike nails it. An acting tour de force. There are a few key supporting roles, most notably Kim Dickens playing the detective investigating Amy's disappearance, Carrie Coon as Nick's sister and Neil Patrick Harris as a man from Amy's past. But it is Affleck and Pike who must carry the film and each, in their own unique way, proves more than capable of doing so. Their performances draw you into this story, make you emotionally invest in these characters. This is not a film you watch dispassionately, the characters and story grab you in such a way that you feel invested in the outcome. It's a film with thrills and chills, brilliant twists and turns. When the right combination of writer, director and actors comes together you can end up with something quite spectacular. Gone Girl is an example of that. Fascinating throughout this film is one to treasure."

","Overall this movie is enjoyable. It is well made and the performances are all fine, although none of the characters really is as deep as they might should have been. Except maybe for Neil Patrick Harris character, which comes of as extremely bland to me. But I think the main problem with the movie is, that the reveal that Amy is still alive comes before the half of the movie, I think it would have been much more interesting to see him build up as more of a bad guy, because as soon as you see her alive, you know all is a scam and what Ben Afflecks character really did to her is totally unclear. He might have hit her, but he might not. It really felt this was some kind of end of the movie reveal that turns everything around, but then you have still over an hour of movie left and that doesn't make much sense to me. The story in itself isn't too bad, but of course not very believable, to put it mildly. And some of the dialog is hard to listen to because it's just awkward and doesn't work. Overall, the movie is far from totally terrible, but not a masterpiece by any means."

It was portrayed several times that the male main character of the movie was neither in love with her any more nor did he care too much about the public opinion./SPOILER<br/><br/>So basically the final twist was too much for me.

"leonblackwood","8","0","2","23 February 2015"," Brilliant and dramatic movie!
","Review: What an epic but great movie! The many amazing twists throughout the film were well put together and very entertaining. Right from the beginning you are led to believe that Affleck killed his missing wife but when the story unfolds, it really does paint a different picture. As there might be people out there that hasn't seen he movie, I really don't want to spoil the plot for you so I will try my utmost to watch what I say. The plot is about a man whose searching for his missing wife, hence the title, but all of the clues lead to her being murdered by him. He then hires a lawyer to prove his innocence and with the help of his sister, the dark truth starts to unfold. When I saw the length of the movie, I was a bit skeptical about what to expect, but I honestly enjoyed this intriguing film which was well written, with some great performances. It shows how the media can paint a totally different picture than what is really going on behind closed doors and how a woman scorned can make a man's life complete hell. For such a long movie, it could have done with a bit more footage at the end so there could have been an outcome to such a dark situation, but the director chose to leave it open. Before the mystery unfolds, I really didn't know who was the bad guy and who was innocent so you have to put your detective hat on to piece the clues together, which was why I enjoyed the ride. I can totally understand why the critics didn't have a bad word to say about the film so it has to go down as a great watch. One not to be missed!  <br/><br/>Round-Up: Ben Affleck has redeemed his career with the Oscar winning Argo and this brilliant movie. It didn't win any major awards but it made a healthy profit at the box office and it's pushed Affleck back into the big league. Rosamund Pike also put in a great performance and the chemistry between the two main characters was intense and believable, especially towards the end. Tyler Perry was also a great choice by the director but we didn't really get to see him investigate this mysterious crime. The investigating officer, who didn't believe a word that Affleck was saying right from the beginning, fitted in well with the rest of the cast so I haven't got a bad word to say about that aspect of the film. The only person that looked a bit out of place was Doogie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris), who was a weird choice by the director but he played if role quite good. In all I can't say a bad word about the film but I will say that it takes some time to get going. <br/><br/>Budget: $61million Worldwide Gross: $368million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their mysterious/thrillers/dramas about a man whose hunting down his missing wife with the help of a lawyer, sister and the investigating officer. 8/10"

","It should be clear that no person can truly know any other person. Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" dealt with this issue: the main character starts to suspect his neighbor of foul play. David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"" takes it one step further, focusing on a married couple. On the surface, the movie looks at the wife's disappearance and reveals the wife's unseemly side. But the sensationalist media's targeting of the husband is an equally important part of the story. The look at the secrets that people hide, combined with the look at sensationalism, amounts to an impressive movie.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck puts on a good performance, but this is Rosamund Pike's movie all the way. Her performance as the manipulative wife earned her an Academy Award nomination. I haven't seen any of the other movies nominated in that category, so I can't determine if this was the best performance, but it's certainly up there. Among the other cast members, even Neil Patrick Harris - who just hosted the Oscars - puts on a serious performance. I recommend the movie."
"lexusm-246-581851","8","0","2","22 February 2015"," Gender Roles: Nick vs. Amy
","Amy, the female lead of the movie, does not give up on her careless husband or kill him, but she decides to take matters into her own hands and forces him become a better spouse. Usually, the scorned woman's role in a movie is to abruptly plot to kill her filthy husband or to leave him to go create an alternative happy ending. Amy Dunne rewrites the role of women in this theme of movies because she takes control over her emotions and does not make the immediate decision to leave Nick or to divorce him. Instead, she makes Nick truly pay the cost for crossing her, and she even leaves it up to him to decide his own fate; he is left with the choice to possibly face the death penalty for something that he did not do or to live with an actual murderer who will never have to pay for her crime. Rather than to give up her perfect life, Amy finds a way to keep up her standard of living (and her standard of marriage); she coerces Nick into staying with her, and she ensures that the two will have a seemingly happy marriage because there will always be the threat of them exposing each other. Had her character been bound by her gender, Amy Dunne definitely would not have been able to pull of such a dark, clever plot against her macho husband. <br/><br/>Gone Girl's unassigned gender does not just extend to the female role; by the end of the movie, Nick has become the innocent victim of his ruthless wife which is uncommon in the movie world. Of course, Nick is not completely free of any wrongdoings, but, as Etkin puts it, compared to Amy having ""wrongly accused a man of rape and ruined his life in the process, stole a neighbor's urine to fake a pregnancy, manipulated and murdered a man not in self-defense (and lied again about being raped), and faked her death in order to get her husband the death penalty"" Nick is a poor shmuck by the end of the story (""Debating the Complicated Gender Roles in Gone Girl""). Most of the cheating husband characters that are prevalent in Western culture's movies are rarely ever redeemed by any acts of their own or justified by the actions of their wives. And surely, the average movie focuses on the husband's cheating as the main source of conflict in the marriage rather than alternative faults the wife might have. Similarly, Nick wants to have a baby, but Amy does not which goes against the normal expectation for American women (""Til Death Do Us Part': Marriage is the True Terror of Gone Girl""). The male character's desire for children adds to his innocence and softness, traits that usually are taken up by the female leads. Nick, like Amy, is not tied down by the cultural limits assigned to his gender. <br/><br/>The film also takes a huge step in bending gender stereotypes because it does not portray the ""American Dream"" ideal of a happily married couple that we are accustomed to seeing in Western film. While most movies focus on the success, closeness, and parenthood of married couples, Gone Girl expresses financial crises, ""widening gaps in communication and baby drama"" within the marriage of Nick and Amy (""Til Death Do Us Part': Marriage is the True Terror of Gone Girl""). The movie presents an alternative version of society's idea that women and men need each other, through marriage and personal relationships, to balance each other out or to complete each other. Obviously, in Gone Girl, Nick and Amy's relationship has taken such a toll on the two as individuals that she is willing to kill herself to get revenge on her husband, and he is willing to go to jail after finding out how sadistic and conniving his wife is. At the same time, the movie subtly suggests that the only way to make a marriage work is for one person, usually the woman, to lose herself and subdue her desires and needs to those of her husband in order to keep the peace which, obviously, should not be the goal of women or men. Traditional thoughts about marriage are redefined through Gone Girl's Nick and Amy. Gone Girl is impressive because its characters are just people; they do not follow typically assigned gender roles. Only until death will an American marriage part."

","I had high expectations for ""Gone Girl"" due to word-of-mouth, but sadly they weren't really met. This movie has some core problems and is a mixed bag. On the one hand the direction is good, and the acting fairly good, but on the other, the story is a mess and the dialog and chemistry often unsupportable. The movie runs a long feeling 2 hr 25 min and the preponderance of media embedded in the story feels like a nuisance and is annoying. Director David Fincher, who has done both worse and better work seems to have a good idea of what he wants from his camera - editing and picture- work are very good as is the music. Though Affleck and Pike are individually pretty good, their early scenes together do not ring genuine often thanks to far- fetched or cliché-ridden dialog, and late in the movie the story has degenerated so badly that the dialog has little meaning in the final scenes. Indeed the the last 25 min has failed the story. The concept was there, but it got swept away. The resolution was unbelievable and awful. 6/10 for the first 4/5 of the movie despite sometimes poor dialog, but with good points for moody music. Mixed."

Yes, in a way it is the story of a modern marriage which changes (maybe) stupidly 180 degrees but it is also the story of our lives, people.

"barbt1956","7","0","3","19 February 2015"," Missing Critical Aspects of the Book - total spoiler!!
","It is no surprise to me, or probably to anyone, that Gone Girl the movie is not as good as the book. First, it is hard to capture on screen what the imagination has created while reading. Secondly, it is hard to recreate in a couple of hours on screen what it takes 6 or more hours to read. It is this flaw that is a given when you adapt a film from a book. <br/><br/>However, my rating is not a reflection of this given, so much as a concern about the overall atmosphere of the film which leaves out some critical aspects of the book. I joke to my friends that Gone Girl is the first book I have read that I loved despite disliking pretty much every character. I don't think this is clear enough in the film.<br/><br/>In the book, the first several chapters are about the disappearance of Amy and the media frenzy surrounding it. This is true of the film as well, but I don't believe it does as good a job of demonizing Nick as is found in the book. Ben Affleck is just too sympathetic in portraying Nick, and you feel the mounting evidence as the trap it is, rather than convincing you he is guilty, as the book does. The appearance of Amy in the book is quite shocking, whereas it is not so much in the film. This is one of the aspects of the book that made it so popular - you are convinced in the beginning that it is likely Nick killed Amy and is covering it up. The film just does not give you this feeling.<br/><br/>Another flaw in the film is the portrayal of Amy's parents. It is so very clear in the book that Amy has been used by her parents all of her life. She has been a disappointment to them because she never lived up to their ideal of her as Amazing Amy. They are a totally selfish couple, in the book, that use Amy's disappearance as a way to further their own ends - and it helps their books to sell again. They have selfishly stolen her home and her trust fund, leaving her and Nick in a difficult situation. Their selfishness and use of Amy does not come off in the movie at all. They appear to be media savvy parents who are using their fame to aid them in finding Amy, when it is the opposite in the book - they are using Amy's disappearance as a way to push their own agenda and for self- promotion. In the book, these are not nice people. The movie just slides over their selfishness as a sort of ""oh well"". But, this is a critical factor to explain Amy's actions, especially at the end. Did anyone notice that Amy goes back to Nick and just blows off her parents? In the book, you know why.<br/><br/>Another critical aspect of the book that is fairly weak in the film is the relationship of Amy with Desi (Neil Patrick Harris). This is a wealthy man who has always been obsessed with Amy. Amy turns to him in her hour of need and he is thrilled to assist her. This is where the film falls flat - in the book this relationship almost immediately becomes sinister. Desi is not simply taking care of Amy and protecting her, he has her caged in his lake home without any ability to get out. She does not have access to a car, she cannot use a phone, she cannot use the internet, and the entire property is locked and inescapable. In the book, Amy has become desperate and is looking for any way she can escape Desi's entrapment of her. The action taken against Desi is the act of a desperate woman who sees no other way out of her predicament. In the movie it appears much more cold-blooded. In the book she is desperate to escape Desi and return to Nick.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending of the book and the ending of the film are the same, but the motivation is not clear in the film. So many people say they hate the way the movie ended. Well, that is because it is not made clear that regardless of how sick their relationship may be, Nick and Amy have always found that the other pushes them to be the greatest they can be and their lives would be boring without each other. Nick and Amy both reach this conclusion, and it is not just another of Amy's traps, as it appears in the film.<br/><br/>The film of Gone Girl makes Amy appear even more despicable than in the book, while glossing over the egregious actions of the other major players. This was the strength of the book. The film is good, but it just does not incorporate this total sense in the book that everyone gets what they deserve."

","David Fincher's Gone Girl is a faithful adaptation of the widely popular novel of the same title by Gyllian Flynn. The delusional titular characters of Nick and Amy Dunne are portrayed by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike respectively.<br/><br/>The movie retains all the quirks and novelties of the novel as the screenplay from the author herself comes to the advantage. For those who read the novel beforehand the movie seems to be lacking in substance and almost empty at times; yet it rewards nothing less than a spectacular montage of character study.<br/><br/>Both Affleck and Pike are as sophisticated as their fictional counterparts Nick and Amy; two complex and relentless characters who don't dither to go to the extreme extent to win over the other. <br/><br/>The portrayal of Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne gives the impression that the role was specifically written for him. Affleck's character fluctuates smoothly between the claustrophobic and democratic situations as circumstances dictates. <br/><br/>In the novel Pike's Amy Dunne has a slight domination over her husband Nick for which the whys and wherefores are given under specific grounds. Amy is a much more deep and intricate character. But the silver screen manifestation of the character lacks density; the character appears unsubstantiated and more flimsy. <br/><br/>Despite the common inevitable flaws that movie adaptation of novels necessarily inherits, David Fincher's distinctive style bestows the aberrant tale of disturbed marital relationship of the Dunnes family the right platform.<br/><br/>Entertaining and thought provoking , sleek, dark and intelligent (unsympathetically bloody and unemotional at times; that which Fincher movies are no alien to), with a strong cast and brilliant screenplay Gone Girl is Fincher's most ingenious and creative work up till now."

Every scene has a sense of dread and movie has the intended effect of eliciting a chill down your spine and a sense of shock and disgust. The score and picture quality also add a creepy feel to the entire movie. Ben Affleck who plays the husband, strikes the right notes and manages to make you empathize with him. Its Rosammund Pike, however, who plays her mysterious character in a way that is both mesmerizing and chilling. The scenes of nudity could have been toned down a little, but with such a movie, I was expecting it anyway. The controversial ending was one of the main issues I have with the movie. Of course, it's based on a novel and followed the same story, but I would have wished for more closure than what was provided. I was more shocked at how abrupt the ending seemed, than any of the other frequent shocking revelations throughout the movie.The movie is a flawless piece of entertainment that will keep you gripped for its entire runtime and leave you wondering about it for days. If not for the ending, I would be completely satisfied with it. If you have read the book and know the ending, this should be the best movie this year for you.

"mooky-210-917116","10","0","5","12 January 2015"," One of the best thrillers I have ever seen.
","There is nothing I like more than a good thriller. That is, without a doubt, my favourite genre. That being said, it is quite rare that I came across one that really has me absolutely gripped from the opening minute to the very last. At best I have only come across some pretty great ones. however, 'Gone Girl' definitely takes the prize for the best one that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I wish that I had read the book first so that I could comment on how faithfully it has been adapted. However, since the screenplay is written by Flynn herself, I can imagine that it doesn't hold much difference only in the character depth, which is always better developed through the work of a novel. For obvious reasons. What I can say though, is that it certainly was safe in the hands of the brilliantly talented David Fincher. Fincher is simply one of the best directors out there. After all, this is the same man that has given us such memorable gems as 'The Social Network' (2010), 'Zodiac' (2007), 'Panic Room' (2002), 'Seven' (1995) and many more. Simply put, 'Gone Girl' was destined for his spectacular direction. And boy! Did he deliver.<br/><br/>'Gone Girl' is a remarkable piece of film-making on so many different levels. The story itself is one of the most thought provoking and engaging that I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It had me wonderfully gripped right from the off. It's not often that I find myself dissecting and questioning the events throughout the entire thing but, this one brilliantly had my mind rollercoastering all the way through. It twists and turns with such unique and refreshing mastery that you feel like the whole thing is happening around you. 'Gone Girl' is the screen definition of a spectacular page turner and Fincher delivers it with some of the best direction that he has ever done. I can't help but think that in the hands of anyone else, this film would not have been executed with the same quality of impact that the story deserved. This, for me, is one of his best films. If not the best. No small feat considering his fantastic library of work. <br/><br/>A novel adaptation of this calibre though cannot rely purely on the talents of it's director to tell the story. Without a great cast to act it out it is nothing more than a great story weakly portrayed. Fortunately, 'Gone Girl' succeeds in this too. I get pretty sick and tired with the constant Ben Affleck bashing to be honest. I don't think that anyone can deny that he is an awesome director and a talented writer. I'll say that straight off but, whilst he may have been less than awe-inspiring an actor in his earlier years, I'll defy anybody to tell me that he has not improved with age. I think people just need to accept the fact that he is the next Batman and stop being so ridiculous about it, which, is basically what it comes down to. I see far bigger stars that have had much longer careers that don't have the fraction of acting ability that Affleck does. Affleck is so multi-dimensional in the role of Nick Dunne that you really don't know what to make of him as a character. All you can only ever really do is speculate on his guilt and innocence and formulate your own ideas concerning what may or may not have happened. Dunne's cocksure and blasé demeanour is a fantastic shield when trying to determine the level of involvement in his wife's disappearance. If any at all. He is uniquely likable and dislikable at the same time. This is absolute credit to Affleck's performance and capabilities. He completely nails and owns this character from start to finish. That being said, as great as he is, I think the best performance of the film truly belongs in the hands of Rosamund Pike. As Nick's wife, Amy, she is unarguably magnificent. There is not too much that I can say about her character to be honest, only that Pike really does show the strength of her acting skills and I loved every moment that she was on screen. <br/><br/>Overall, 'Gone Girl' is a splendid thought provoking mystery with plenty of twists and turns that will have you gripped throughout. It is a marvellous guessing game and one you will still be talking about long after the end credits have rolled. It is ultimately satisfying and rewarding in its climax and you won't get to the end and question why you bothered watching it in the first place. 'Gone Girl' also has a great supporting cast including Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Kim Dickins, Carrie Coon and Missi Pyle, among others. If you have not had the pleasure of seeing this yet then I highly recommend that you get on it as soon as you can. You will not be disappointed. Easily one of the best films of the year. Stunning."

This film is insane! when you think why the movie is so fast-paced and you thought it was nearly the ending of the movie, YOU'RE WRONG! i thought the movie was reaching the ending when the detectives found the diary, then suddenly... it's amy's scene. i didn't read the book, so I have no idea about the storyline. <br/><br/>the movie was so good that you really wondering what happen next. and surely, for someone that did not read the book, this movie was really surprised me (in a good way, of course). the movie just cant get any better when it decided to show some blood at the end of the scene. i really like the scene when amy kill desi. i also like when amy says this to nick: ""I killed for you. Who else can say that?"" I mean, it really open my eyes that someone can go crazy all the way for something they call ""love"".<br/><br/>i also impressed with the shower scene. i don't know if the impression that i got is what the directors and the story wanted to give, but what i think is: lets just forget the past and the sins between our marriage just like this water wash the blood. i mean, no you cant!! duh!! amy is a crazy psychopath bitch, but the parents made her! at least thats what i thought. <br/><br/>this movie is worth watching."
"shreet-shreet","10","0","4","11 January 2015"," A Little Different Interpretation
","I actually interpreted the ending in a way that no one did and I do not want to feel stupid so I would just share my interpretation of the conclusion.<br/><br/>The opening scene showed Amy's husband rubbing her hair saying some words. Now that same scene is also at the end, re acted though and a little different.<br/><br/>But what I concluded from this was that she was only thinking all this up in her mind to get revenge from her husband for cheating with her and nothing actually happened.<br/><br/>We often think of insane plans and executions in our minds that may not be possible so easily in reality. The same type of plan and its execution is shown the movie. I liked this movie because of this interpretation that Fincher was showing just the tensions and secrets of a marriage through this and nothing actually happened. The same is also visualised in the scene where Amy's says,""That's marriage."", in a way that she just wanted to teach a lesson to her husband and everything was normal again.<br/><br/>Do anyone have the same thoughts?"

","""You married a complete psychopath."" Nick (Affleck) is a struggling bar owner and teacher who hasn't been happy in his marriage for awhile. Amy (Pike) is his wife who is a very successful writer and is trying to keep the marriage together. When Nick comes home and sees signs of a struggle and Amy gone he is worried and wants to find her. When Nick becomes the primary suspect he tries everything he can to clear his name and find out what happened to his wife. This is a movie that you can not talk about too much because it would be an injustice to give anything away. What I can say though is that I have been watching around 7-10 movies a week in order to do these reviews and have gotten to the point where after 5 minutes I can predict exactly what is going to happen and 99% of the time I am right. This is a movie that stayed one step ahead of me the entire time and just when I thought I had it figured out it went another way. That added to the enjoyment of this and I just can not say enough about this movie. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time and I highly recommend this. Overall, a fantastic movie that keeps you guessing all the way to the end. I give this an A+."

","Gone Girl There was a large amount of buzz surrounding this film, already it has won a plethora of awards with more to come this year. Is the film worthy of so many nominations? Perhaps, it all depends on what you want from your films I guess. I guess we have all heard the joke when someone does or say something negative towards their married life ""I'd only get 20 years for murder yet I've got a life sentence with them"" This movie is pretty much that jest put to film. Nick and Amy Dunne are due to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. Nick gets home to find that Amy is gone. Amy is somewhat of a minor celebrity due to her parents writing a series of books based around her younger life called ""The Amazing Amy"", due to this a lot of news reporters ascend on the small town determine to help find Amy. Nick is quickly determined to be the main suspect but without a body the police and services can only accuse him and hope he confesses. A large scale missing persons hunt is arranged, everyone on the lookout for the missing body presumed that Amy has come to her husband's killer hands. As the investigation goes on more and more is discovered about the so called happy couple, more and more it's apparent Nick is guilty but how will the authorities actually catch him out. The screen writer for Gone Girl is actually the same person who wrote the novel Gillian Flynn so you wouldn't expect too much of a difference between the two, but that's actually not the case. There are a lot of things that were in the book that was missed in the film adaption whether that was the directors idea David Fincher (Zodiac, Fight Club) or Gillian just decided they were unnecessary is unknown, either way the film still works for what it is. The film stars Ben Affleck (Jersey Girl, Good Will Hunting) as Nick Dunne the man/husband accused, who actually does a decent job portraying his character. Rosamund Pike (Jack Reacher, Wrath of the Titans) plays the missing victim Amy Dunne and by far is the standout of the film, she is very convincing in her role. Neil Patrick Harris (How I met your Mother, Starship Troopers) plays Desi Collings one of Amy's ex partners for his small amount for screen time his performance is quite memorable. Carrie Coon (The Leftovers) plays Margo Dunne Nicks sister and again is very good in her role. David Fincher is definitely up there as one of my favourite directors directing some of my favourite films over his career and again I can now add this to my list as another job done well. He has a fantastic eye for details and knows how to get the best out of everyone he works with. Gone Girl is a film you can only really see once to enjoy it in its entirety. A second viewing will always be on the cards but there are no more surprises unfortunately so the second viewing is more to pick up their pieces you missed first time around. I can understand why a few people didn't enjoy the film but I think you need to look at it as a whole picture not just segments. There a lot of flash backs which keep you wanting and needing more, there is enough here to keep all thrill seekers happy. Gone Girl again isn't one for the kids due to some very violent and quite disturbing scenes. It is a great film though and deserves a watch at least once."

"Laakbaar","8","0","3","9 January 2015"," What have we done to each other?
","In this modern psychological thriller, Director David Fincher and writer Gillian Flynn explore the themes of relationships gone wrong, obsession, madness and murder.<br/><br/>Our hero in this movie is Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck). He's married to Amy (Rosamund Pike), a woman with celebrity and money. They have a story-book marriage and a great life together in small-town Missouri. However, one morning Nick comes home to find that his wife is missing. The search and police investigation begin. Because of her celebrity, Nick soon finds himself at the centre of a true American media circus. It quickly emerges that Nick is not a hero after all and their marriage has been far from perfect.<br/><br/>Where is his wife? Is she still alive? Everyone thinks she's dead, and Nick is the main suspect. The movie then takes no less than three sharp turns, with a dark surprise ending that no one could expect. This movie was layered, with the director and writer skillfully revealing the next layer at just the right moment. The writing and direction are excellent. This movie is not just intelligent, it's amusingly witty.<br/><br/>This is a rich movie, with lots of detail about American life. ""Perfect"" couples, suburban life and the criminal justice system are expertly dissected. The phenomenon of trial-by-media in the US receives special excoriation. (Is it a trend now for American movies to be so critical of the excesses of their culture?) The acting is superb, from everyone involved. It's difficult to single anyone out, because they were all very good. All of the actors could be praised. Ben Affleck — surely recognised by all now as a peerless A-list actor and director — has found another role that showcases his masculine presence and acting skills.<br/><br/>At two-and-a-half hours, this movie felt a little long. I looked at my watch a few times. However, the end was worth waiting for. Not to be missed. It's worth 8.5. I'll give it 8 for now but maybe raise that to 9 after seeing it again."

","I was so angry I missed watching GONE GIRL at the movies... yet I was happy I lived with what I have read in the book as it was first released. I am a really big fan of Gillian Flynn's three novels and Gone Girl was the one who drug me to read the other three. I honestly declare that while watching the movie at home with my wife yesterday, I was very sure I was seeing the pages turn in front of me as if I am re-reading the book, yet the content was missing. I really liked in the novel the bond of Go and Nick in the movie; the Amazing Amy's psychological disturbance, and the utterly unfair missing link of the twins' father. I must admit that Ben and Rosemund were truly great in the movie however there were things I did not like or did not want to like, since I had such a great passion for the book itself. Amy was evil in the movie but she is a demon in the novel. Nick was a coward in the novel but it showed he was not that much of a coward in the movie. I gave the movie a 7 because of Flinch and the smart directing. I also loved the cinematography and the story telling, where in the book it is different when we see what Nick tells us and then we see Amy's point of view. All in all the movie was good, at least it brought the book to life. I am still wondering about the ending of both the movie and the novel, I still cant decide which has a better one!"
"watsoid","9","0","3","4 January 2015"," Slightly Overrated
","I heard a lot of great things about this film but I just thought it was okay. The acting is great but by putting Neil Patrick Harris and Rosamund Pike before Tyler Perry in the opening credits, you kind of give it a way that you're going to be seeing a lot more of them later. I get that Fincher tried to make Neil Patrick Harris a red herring, but it doesn't work when he is too over the top that he's obviously not the villain. I haven't read the book so I don't know if it is a successful adaptation or not, but as a film I though it was enjoyable, even if it did lose focus around the second act. But like I said, it's a good film and you should definitely check it out if you haven't already"

","First, I really don't get the aggressive negative comment about the plot or its consistency. Compared to let's say 95% of any other American movies, Gone Girl is far ahead. The director chose to focus mainly on its characters and on the storytelling rather than on tiny details, and it worked well for me! <br/><br/>Second, this movie is just good. Great acting, great story, great music by Reznor and great ending. I enjoyed every bit of it and the tension all along the movie is enjoyable. Fincher gives the impression to be playing with spectators. Maybe not the best movie of 2014, but definitely one worth watching."
"magnuslhad","9","0","4","3 January 2015"," twisty, engrossing tale
","A man's wife goes missing, setting in motion a media frenzy that affects not only the husband, but family, lovers, neighbours and law-enforcement. There is biting satire to be had here, most notably on the institution of marriage. Why some people get married, and why some others stay married, defies all logic, and this narrative takes that premise to the extreme. The inanity of our media-soaked culture is also caught in the cross-hairs, as dumb tabloid TV personalities are revered, while peripheral players to the central drama clamour for their attention. Ben Affleck does an outstanding job as the hard-to-pin-down Nick Dunne. A few men will squirm in self-aware discomfort at some of the decisions Nick makes. Rosamund Pike gets to test her range and does not miss a beat, while Neil Patrick Harris takes on a tricky role, making the incredulous credulous. He is perhaps the only character who comes closest to receiving unreserved pity from the audience. The superlative element here is Fincher's pacing. The narrative is a masterclass in setting up and paying off on active questions, with three put in place and answered in each act. And it is the third act that will test the tolerance of some audience members, but delivers, for me, the deliciously dark ending this story requires. As much as we'd love to see pure justice delivered, it is, more often than not, the tawdry compromise offered up here that prevails. One of Fincher's best, and that's saying something."
"lorenzogary","9","0","5","2 January 2015"," The Search for Amazing Amy is Truly... Amazing
","David Fincher's film GONE GIRL is one of the most interesting features I have seen in 2014; luring the audience with a picture of a picture-perfect couple town by a missing wife, only to fill our brains with the deception and horrors of marriage. <br/><br/>My favorite parts of Gone Girl was Rosamund Pike. Hearing she was going to be involved in a David Fincher film, I wasn't as compelled (she just didn't cut it for me in 'Die Another Day'). But, she proved me wrong; performing such a dynamic Amy Dunne who not only stealing the heart for those who have never read the book as well as ripping said heart in the second act. Her actions and psychology not only made me feel pity (""Selfish Nick makes frivolous purchases!""... ""Give her the baby!"") as well as hatred (""And to think I trusted you the entire first act!... ""She literally staged rape?!?!"") for her. <br/><br/>Technical-wise, this is a Fincher film; when has he failed? Even his weak movies are compelling. His collaborations with cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth (since 'Fight Club') and composers Trent Rexnor & Atticus Ross (since 'The Social Network') show a movie that is dark in both the story and the film itself. <br/><br/>My only dislike would be the big reveal of Amy Dunne's Disappearance; an hour into the movie with another hour and a half to go. I felt an extra thirty minutes into the movie would've been a great reveal, but knowing the significance of the events in the second half of the movie I understand Fincher's choice as it would rush near the ending.<br/><br/>My final thoughts on the film is that it is a classic theme of ""Whodunnit?"". But, under the direction of David Fincher, the tale dissects the reality and human nature, the social commentary of social media on big cases, and perfects the balance between the horrors and realities of marriage."

","Dark and twisted by the mastermind director David Fincher. This marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck, 'Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as a mainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audience within the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario. Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which makes 'Gone Girl' a movie full of great visual storytelling."

","Knowing Fincher, and the way this movie starts out, you automatically assume for some crazy twist ending from the start. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pikes' characters are intriguingly weird when they interact together and the first half of the movie is slow and somewhat dull, but keeps you interested enough to draw you in for more, and the second half makes it worth the wait. As the plot thickens, the characters develop more, the intensity increases and it's almost like a whole new movie playing and in the end makes it all work.<br/><br/>I liked the movie because it's just different and the ending was something you just say 'huh' about, but after thinking about it more and more, it becomes so much greater than a typical Hollywood resolution and more about what happens next and keeps you wondering. I thought the cast was great, the directing was very good and the reason why this movie succeeds is because it's finally something different, which is what FIncher is great at."

I did not laugh at any of the comic moments (and there were many throughout) but it raised a few eyebrows and certainly drew a smile.<br/><br/>Suspect that nobody will win any Oscar awards but nominations will be justified. A little bit like 'Prisoners', this was a film where the ending could certainly have been left a lot more open ended and left up to the audience to decide what happened to the husband and wife.<br/><br/>I called it a contrived comedy because I felt the ending was very much tailored rather than one which was in keeping with the pace and mystique of the film.

","This is the craziest film I've ever seen in my life. It's just hypothetical.The reason I say this is because I don't think it'd be possible for a couple to continue their relationship after they have gone through such a hardship. The film also portrays how easy it is for a person to suddenly become a celebrity. The film shows how strong the American media can be. Ben Affleck has a very strong star power since in real life, it had been rumored that his wife was about to leave him. However, I find Julian Pike incredible because of her smart and well-planned murder-pretended revenge to her husband. I also find Julian a good actress."

Then from there it got exaggerated and it was too much.<br/><br/>The film can be divided into three parts. The first part was regular David Fincher cliché. I love the second part most. The final part felt unnecessary. <br/><br/>Everyone's been talking about Rosamund Pike's performance. No doubt it's worthy of an Oscar. But for me all the actresses' performances were strong in this film. In comparison the actors were weak. Honestly this film offers only one noticeable male performance, just Affleck, and he is the protagonist. <br/><br/>The score isn't that very good. The screenplay deserves some nomination. Film editing is another category worthy of some awards.

"chandanr777","9","0","4","31 December 2014"," Thrillingly disturbing and disturbingly thrilling
","I have always loved mystery and thriller movies. So it definitely does not surprise you if I say I am a David Fincher fan. When I came to know that his next movie will be based on a novel which I had not yet heard of, I was tempted into reading the novel and finished it within a week. I was impressed with Gillian Flynn's intelligent writing. I could not imagine any director other than Fincher to bring this script on the screen. I was very glad that he was the choice already. I waited excitedly for the release of the movie.<br/><br/>When I finally watched the movie, I experienced the same thrilling ride which I experienced during the reading of the book. Flynn impressed again with the screenplay. Fincher has once again chosen a perfect cast. Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Carrie Coon, Kim dickens, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris have given precise and effective performances. What starts as a perfect mystery progresses through plenty of twists and turns. Each plot turn is thrilling and equally disturbing. It makes you think seriously about the modern marriages and the media. Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose have yet again provided a memorable score which fits perfectly in various scenes, especially in the most important scene of the movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to those who love surprises and deep thinking at the same time. In my opinion, there has not been a movie which has explored the marriages and the media like 'Gone Girl' has. Definitely among the top three movies of 2014. Fincher has increased his reputation as the intelligent and stylish director!"
"cmvtcivils","8","0","3","31 December 2014"," Another master piece or reinforcing female stereotypes?
","I just needed to know one thing about this movie after which I decided to watch it: It's a David Fincher film and I was sold. Fincher has directed such masterpieces like Seven, Fighclub, Zodiac and The girl with dragon tattoo. His movies demand a certain level of cognitive and attentional capacities to fully grasp the film. But his stories are so engaging that we put that extra efforts ourselves to understand the film-i call this the 'pull factor' of films. <br/><br/>This is in contrast with films like Nolan's Interstellar. This movie was no doubt much more complicated than Fincher's movies. But many audience like me did not connect with the space-cowboy-father or his daughter. We did not emotionally invest in them to bring ourselves to put more efforts to fully understand the movie. Instead we need to 'push' ourselves to getting involved in the movie experience. Fincher's greatness lies in keeping this fine balance of being cerebral and emotional.<br/><br/>So did this film deliver? Oh yes it did. It had the vintage Fincher's attention demanding screenplay. It had vivid and fully fleshed out characters in whom we fully invest and feel empathy for. With each passing scene our sympathies with different characters waver. With in the 2 hour duration, we harbor conflicting emotions over the main characters. By the end of the film, we end up having strong but ambiguous opinions about them. The editing is crisp, without a single boring or redundant scene. The music is gripping with out overwhelming the imagery.<br/><br/>The story is about a missing wife and how it effects the husband and others related to him. We are quickly left with several unanswered questions about the motivations and responsibility of the husband for the disappearance. In the next two hours we are provided tidbits of information gradually which we use to modify and re- modify our opinions about the characters. Acting by Ben Affleck as husband and Rosamund Pike as the wife was top notch, for me Carrie coon as the husband's twin sister was the stand out performance. Also Neil Patrick Harris's character as Desi was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>But i have some peeves with the story itself. Though the film is adapted from a novel of the same name, in Fincher's hands the dark nature of the story gets accentuated. For me the central theme of the film is news channels' over zealousness in fixing responsibility for a crime on some one with out any evidence. This trail by media causes severe trauma and hardship to the accused. However, in trying to expose the wrongdoings of TV media, Fincher uses his media-films to perpetuate some stereotypes against women. I think this could have been avoided by making some changes to the script. <br/><br/>Here are some of the stereotypes the film projects:<br/><br/>1.Wifes are crazy bitches, you do not and cannot know what they are thinking and their actions are unpredictable<br/><br/>2.They are master manipulators who can play with the emotions of 'gullible' men Married men have affairs only when wives are- again crazy bitches. So basically the film is resorting to victim blaming. If only wives are docile, give 'unconditional' regard and satisfy every need of husband, men will have no reason to cheat<br/><br/>3.Do not marry a woman who is more richer and successful than you. This stereotype sees power relations between wife and husband as a zero sum game. This fosters a 'fear of success' in women because of which women lower their ambitions and opt for traditional feminine roles. And men do not encourage their wives to be more successful than them. These lead to women being less successful in professional life which again reinforces the stereotype that women are incompetent.<br/><br/>4.The media personality who jumps to conclusions without any evidence is also played by a women news anchor. In fact many women were shown wanting to rip the husband's eyes out, they are shown acting out of emotion rather than basing actions on reason and evidence<br/><br/>5.As Fox news props up a handful of welfare fraudsters to blame the whole welfare system, this fictional story when directed with such élan, can bring skepticism to any rape, abuse or other women related news.<br/><br/>Not withstanding these criticisms, it is a great film in technical aspects and successfully exposes media's hypocrisy. It seems the character of the woman police officer was designed to bring a balance to the story. She is shown to be more analytical than her male assistant who judges the husband prematurely. <br/><br/>In the end, if your are a feminist or have strong opinion about films' influence over people's mindset, you may not feel comfortable with some of the scenes. But if you watch the movie as just another story, you will enjoy the movie as Fincher takes you on yet another exciting journey in to the minds of his characters."

","A dark, psychologically grisly movie about the hate that can develop between two people, and how it can lead to full-on insanity. I have not read the novel by Gillian Flynn, but her screenplay is beautifully crafted, as if she has been doing this for ages.<br/><br/>David Fincher has had his cult following pretty much since he started directing. I haven't always been a fan of his movies, but considering the nature of this story, he is exactly on point here.<br/><br/>The cinematography has that detached, clinical feel that Fincher's films often do. But, it works better here than usual. The film score by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Raznor is more tonalities than music, but it works for its purpose here.<br/><br/>Beside the primary missing spouse storyline, there is a lot of biting satire about the viciousness of TV pundits and how they so enjoy tearing people apart.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent across the board! Even Tyler Perry is good, for heaven's sake! But, at the end of the day, is it enjoyable as entertainment? No, absolutely not! It's more like a psychological ordeal to endure. I admire it for what it is, including the f**ked up ending that fits perfectly with this f**ked up movie! Regardless, it's more about experiencing this movie once, then wanting to get away from it as quickly as possible!<br/><br/>(MAJOR SPOILERS) Wow! Rosamund Pike creates probably the most loathsome, full-on sociopath ever on film! And, the fact that she enlists the help of a stalker like Neil Patrick Harris, who is almost as creepy as she is, is very freaky. The way their ""relationship"" ends, in an incredible geyser of blood, certainly seemed appropriate! (END SPOILERS)"

","The ironically selfaware aspect of this is not its charm, that we have for example ironically selfaware characters courting each other in a party by making fun of how others around them are that. Faced with an envelope that reads ""clue"" and of course contains one, the detective of a Missouri small town no less quips ""oh nice, very meta"". <br/><br/>It's all of course a way of pointing out the very same selfawareness that is the engine of the story, rival storytellers caught in a fiction they spin that reveals who they really have come to be behind the storytelling guise, scheming spouses instead of the quirky in love New york couple the diary initially narrates to us (itself a fabrication), but there's a thinness to this.<br/><br/>Its real charm, real power, and real study worth contemplating, is of course that we don't know if he really didn't do it and come to mull over our own projections and prejudices, our own narrative, next to everyone else's in that smalltown community.<br/><br/>Affleck's casting is thus vindicated, a wise one; a somewhat glib looking guy who doesn't fully convince in either of the two dramatic roles, anxious husband or calculating murderer, who inappropriately smiles next to a photo of the missing wife for no other reason than a photographer yells for him to, who inhabits that bland stretch inbetween that has kept him from being a worthwhile actor, his own lack of commitment to a role becoming the character's and that as a tentative real life of uncommitment that we know all too well.<br/><br/>So this is potent stuff for a while , all about how we inhabit an intermediate narrative space before any concrete right and wrong, in trying to know one person getting to see how difficult it is to know another, with an ambiguous tension everywhere he goes, say chilling with a beer in his loving sister's home but he may have just committed the heinous crime a few days ago. The clamor around him to be the center of the narrative of finding her again as his guilt that takes life around him; a girl insisting on a selfie.<br/><br/>And then we twist and twist again, a Fincher staple, so that we go from softer edges of truth and as a consequence richer lives to a simpler right and wrong, from how we handle truth to merely waiting to see how he will. People may celebrate this like they did Hitchcock, I miss the richer Antonioni potential; different schools of handling uncertainty these, one aims for thrills, the other meditation. <br/><br/>It comes out on the other end with in-sight again, the unhappy marriage with spouses who have come to mistrust each other under the same roof, the original one that creates the fiction, but lives have been reduced by all the prior scheming, it's schematic metaphor.<br/><br/>Fincher meanwhile triumphs in his quest to be the most classic Hollywood filmmaker, his spatial eye having been weaned of all the quirks in the past now has transparence. He has successfully evaded the pomposity of Kubrick where Anderson will not. It's only a short step to Antonioni now, one that will require less story, but one he is going to take?"
"jeffdrollins","8","0","4","30 December 2014"," High brow pulp - one of the best films of 2014
","In 2012 Gillian Flynn's third novel took the literary world by storm. It became a bestseller with the aid of nothing but high praise from the likes of NPR, The New York Times, Publisher's Weekly and all the other usual suspects book readers look to for guidance. Gone Girl was seemingly the only thing people were reading that summer and yet when it came time to hand out literary awards, it was completely shut out of the conversation. This is likely due to the fact that those awards are rarely given to any novel that is so neatly slotted into a single genre, in this case mystery. But Gone Girl had become such cultural juggernaut that it was inevitable that it would be adapted for a wider audience (read: moviegoers). And so, just two short years after its initial release as a novel, we have our Gone Girl movie and it is better than any pulp mystery has any right to be.<br/><br/>No stranger to adapting bestselling novels, David Fincher (Fight Club, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is really the only director that could have done this film justice. He dives head first into the plot, allowing the thread to unravel slowly, deliberately, but steadily from the get-go. Despite the fact that the plot of Gone Girl boils down to a husband being considered as the prime suspect in the disappearance of his wife despite them having a seemingly perfect marriage, Fincher wisely lets the story do the talking and at a running time of 145 minutes there is, surprisingly, a lot of story to tell. Fincher doesn't get fancy with artistic camera movements, stylized segues between time and place or even establishing shots. Everything is presented as matter-of-fact with a simple line of text that tells us where we are in the story before disappearing into the frame. He also presents to us a world that is cold, sterile and nearly devoid of color – a clever way of letting us see the color of these seemingly lily white and, at first glance, bland characters slowly come to the forefront revealing many fascinating and horrifying secrets and motivations.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, this is a stellar cast. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne as though he is perpetually annoyed at the world not catering to his emotional needs as he sees fit. In her book, Flynn describes Nick Dunne as having, ""a face you want to punch."" If anyone in Hollywood exemplifies that trait better than Affleck, I'd have to see it to believe it. But the real star of Gone Girl is Rosamund Pike as the titular missing person, Amy Dunne. Everything about this character is a mystery not the least being what her fate may be. Pike's physical appearance is at once sexy, yet alarmingly blank. There's something behind those tiny, dark eyes but what is it? Fear? Longing? Either way, this is pitch perfect casting, from the prime players to the supporting cast featuring Kim Dickens, Patrick Fugit and the surprisingly enjoyable Tyler Perry as celebrity defense attorney Tanner Bolt.<br/><br/>Flynn adapted the screenplay herself and because of that, this dialogue flows as naturally as possible, despite its pulp origins. Her prose is tight, self-aware, and always riveting; it urges you to keep turning pages in order to reveal the next shocking piece of the story. Despite the fact that Flynn trimmed a lot of the novel's fat from her screenplay, there are some issues that still remain: an abundance of clunky narration, a couple of characters left flapping in the breeze and what some may feel is a less than satisfying ending. Still, Gone Girl has such a fun, intriguing story to tell, you'll be eager to forgive its sins. Flynn's nearly airtight screenplay paired with Fincher's remarkable ability for presenting a compelling visual narrative treats us to a seamless transition of this material from the page to the screen. So seamless, in fact, that much like the book before it, people will be talking about Gone Girl to one another long after they finish watching the film. And while this isn't exactly high brow entertainment, Gone Girl, in both its book and film versions, is comparable to ordering a cheeseburger at the fanciest restaurant in town. Yes, you're still biting into ground beef but the cow from which it derived grazed on the tallest, most nutrient rich grass in the region and the chef who prepared it has made a career of surprising critics with comfort foods that appeal to the most sophisticated of palates."

","Most of the negative reviews here come from people bringing up issues with the plot. They would be correct - there are some plot holes that could easily get in the way of your enjoying this film. However, I would contend that this movie should not be enjoyed as a plot-driven story. If you want a dark movie that will challenge your thinking and assumptions, while not letting you rest in cliché, this is for you.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS BELOW ***<br/><br/>This film is about the juxtaposition of a leading man's role. After a quick introduction of the protagonist, you are genuinely challenged to believe whether he actually killed his wife or not. If you're used to rooting for a leading man, this leaves you up in the air. But the effect for me was that the tension of not knowing drew me in. Finally, about an hour into the movie, he lets us off the hook with the revelation that Amy is still alive and has staged her murder for revenge. This is where the movie shifts gears - now, we get to enjoy the experience of a leading man in another role reversal. <br/><br/>So many times in cinematic critique, we hear complaints about weak roles for women. David Fincher takes takes that stereotype and smashes it to a pulp. Nick (Ben Affleck), a tall, imposing hunk of near-Batmanesque stature, is completely threatened and dominated by a woman. Not only that, he is defended by a woman in Kim Dicken's Detective Boney. It's refreshing to see the dynamic from the other side, after so much worn-out imagery of abusive husbands.<br/><br/>Yes, there are plenty of plot-holes if you pay attention, but it's worth it to see the creepiness of Amy. Rosamund Pike gives a terrific performance as Amy - she comes across a chillingly frightening, intimidating, yet also brings a confidence and sexiness to Amy. So much so that for some brief seconds, men can actually start to think, ""Ya know, she does bring up some good points there. I'd hit it."" <br/><br/>Every acting performance was strong. Tyler Perry was well cast as the defense attorney, and gave a strong, understated performance. Rosamund Pike was of course fantastic - the female response to Sir Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter. Ben Affleck's performance as Nick Dunne bothered me at first - I thought it was weak until I realized what he and Fincher were doing with the character. I think they deliberately left Nick as a blank slate for the first half of the movie so that he could serve as a canvas for the audience to throw up their own impressions, prejudices, and judgments. Fincher also takes some time to make statements about how much the media can spin an impression of a person or event, right or wrong.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a worthy investment of time and money - it won't leave you the same coming out of the theater as you went in. It will disturb you in a satisfying way. I'd recommend it if you like character driven movies and psychological introspection, much like Prisoners and Mud."

I had to start the video twice - the first beginning sounded as if there was another sound track on at the same time. Second start was successful. It was hard to see such a devious,detestable, deadly woman. The woman who played the detective was believable. I thought the woman who played the sister was very, very good in that role.<br/><br/>I missed seeing this movie when it played in my local theater, I was glad I could see it now - Thanks to Amazon and my Christmas gift card!

"jake-law123","7","0","3","28 December 2014"," Very good, almost great.
","This is one of those films where I like it, but the more I think about it the more i'll probably end up loving it. It's probably my least favorite David Fincher film as of now, but it's still something special that got me thinking hard.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, the film tells about Nick Dunne, who's wife disappears on their fifth anniversary. A break in to their house makes it look like kidnapping, but as the investigation goes on and on, we get back story from the diary of the wife which brings us to different questions and focuses.<br/><br/>Right away the film grabs me and pulls me into the film's story with the characters, which is what I love about David Fincher films. The film gets the plot going before we barely get acquainted with out characters, but ingeniously manages to cause us to start asking question within 5 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>As usual the music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastically tense in each and every scene. That combined with a superb editing job by Kirk Baxter gives you a thrill ride putting you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, a reveal to the plot half way through kind of threw me off balance, it felt like something that should have happened later on. Nevertheless, it kept me enthralled with its story, as I was constantly asking questions. By the end of the film I was satisfied, describing it as sinister. I will say that the ending is sinister as hell in every way. Like I said it's a film that gets you thinking, which is why I feel like if I see this again, i'm going to love it.<br/><br/>For right now, I do highly enjoy it. It doesn't have much suspense but it has huge amounts of tension and that gives you enough to get through it's possible over length. Well recommended."
"k-nicholsrobel","7","0","4","28 December 2014"," What to think...
","So I rated this at 7 but it could have easily been either a 2 or a ten.. I know, that sounds crazy, but that is how I am left after watching this movie.. I was psyched to see another Fincher movie and I went in to it with high hopes but an open mind. It starts slow as molasses and that isn't necessarily bad when it is done well. I think the idea here was to really feel the emotions and the pace of what they were going through at the start of the story. The last hour or so is really great but when I think about great movies I think about movies that keep me entirely fixated for the duration. This movie did not, I could have been cleaning the kitchen while watching this and not stop and just watch. So that is why I say it could go either way. I have really enjoyed Ben Affleck in his last couple movies. He is the kind of actor you love or hate and I don't hate him. The final word is this movie is through and through Fincher, very interesting plot, and long and slow."

This movies really reflect what relationship and marriage's point of view from men and women. <br/><br/>And I like how they chose the cast for this movies. Men would loved Rosamund Pike, and women would loved to watch Ben Affleck. <br/><br/>I even checked here who the director really is. And found out, David Fincher also directed another several awesome movies I had watched before (Fight Club, Se7en, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Zodiac, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). I didn't realize that before. But now, I will be waiting another movies from him."

","More or less this movie for sure has something to offer. Well when I read that this movies is going to be a drama, mystery and thriller, I was expecting something good and lucky more than two hours gave me what I wanted. In the beginning I kind a had feeling that I know what is actually going on and I was thinking , really?! Is it it? But then everything become more and more tangled and with it more and more interesting. Though there were not that much action, I could feel tension from the very first minute of the movie. And all together made my time fly away, I even didn't look at my watch once, so more or less this movie is going to take your attention and will carry you away from everything else. Of course I have to mention, that actors were really good! Well if I would have to rate how well they were I would give 9 out of 10, but overall I will give this time to this movie 7.5 out of 10, because there were few thing what kind a made me think, really?

"akshay-ak-kumar","8","0","3","27 December 2014"," Brilliant but Scary !!
","I'm a fan of David Fincher's works. Starting from Se7en, I enjoyed all his movies. My favorite are Fight Club and Social Network. The thing I like abt Fincher's movies is that they're dark. No character is black or white. He paints each character in different shades of grey.<br/><br/>Well...Gone Girl goes on step ahead. Here the main characters are scarring twisted.<br/><br/>Based on a Gillian Flynn's novel (who also has written the screenplay), the story is not about a husband being framed for his wife's murder but how a couple's marriage is slowly breaking apart as the years go by. It is also the shocking story of the wife who seeks vengeance from her husband. His fault ...for not being the man he was before marriage.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is so layered that most directors would have lost the plot. but Fincher ensures that we the audience are hooked to see how the story ends for Nick and Amy (Affleck & Pike).<br/><br/>And by the time the movie ended, it ran a chill down my spine. Not only mine but my married friend who came with his wife and lots of other men in the theater. And this is thanks to one brilliant performance by Pike. <br/><br/>Pike is fabulously brilliant as Amy. As Nick says..I really want to know what is going on in your mind. She is girl you want to marry when u meet her first but as the movie progresses you sympathize with her and by the time we reach the end..you want to kill her. This performance deserves as Oscar nomination. And I pray she wins it.<br/><br/>Affleck is equally good as the husband whom you hate and for whom you sympathize at the end. Affleck is easy on the eyes.<br/><br/>The supporting star cast starting is great starting with Carrie Coon who plays Affleck's caring and lovin twin sister, Kim Dickens who is brilliant as the Detective and Tyler Perry who in the short cameo is hilarious as Affleck's attorney.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is not an easy watch but a must watch for all movie buffs. Fincher ups the ante once again."
"stubs182","9","0","5","27 December 2014"," Another classic Fincher movie
","Gone Girl - Review (Spoilers)<br/><br/>Gone Girl is the latest directorial outing from David Fincher starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike in the leading roles, based on the Best Selling novel by Gillian Flynn who also penned the screenplay for the film. <br/><br/>Fincher, like all great directors there are a few things we can assume about any project he's attached to before seeing even a single shot. The tone, the look, the atmosphere of the film. Fincher is truly a master of the craft and Gone Girl is yet another great entry into his filmography. <br/><br/>Much like Fight Club and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo before it, Gone Girl once again represents a perfect marriage of source material and Director. A common aspect that underpins all these movies is shared theme of social introspection, a study on the darker sides of the human psyche. Where Fight Club explored the futility a male machismo in modern society, Zodiac presented the dangers of our cultural obsession with the macabre, Gone Girl is very much a twisted view of contemporary relationships, the violent clash of male and female ego. <br/><br/>The plot of Gone Girl cannot be properly examined without going into spoilers which will be expressed from here on, you have been warned. <br/><br/>Gone Girl as is depicted in the trailers revolves around the disappearance of Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) and the following media circus that revolves around her husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck). Nick and Amy as displayed in various flashback have the perfect relationship. They are both intelligent, good looking, affable young people living in New York when they meet and we view their ongoing partnership in stages as it progresses via entries in Amy's diary. <br/><br/>They fall on hard times, Nick loses his job, Amy's parents have financial difficulties, Nicks mother gets cancer which leads to them moving back to Missouri, a point of contention for Amy. Nick is unwilling to work on their problems and Amy's attempts to fix their relationship are only attempts to fix Nick himself, she does not look inward for any hope of solving their ongoing issues. <br/><br/>One day Amy is gone and the resulting police investigation paints Nick in a very unfortunate light and we are lead to believe that he is the worst kind of man. He was having an affair with a younger woman, he paid little to no attention to his wife outside of sexual conquest, Nick got lazy and is punished by the media accordingly. Eventually it seems there can be no other explanation, Nick definitely killed his wife. Only he didn't. <br/><br/>Turns out Amy felt that as Nick was no longer pulling his weight in their relationship she would take matters into her own hands and frame her husband for her own murder and she took elaborate steps to ensure that Nick would be convicted. So we have an underachieving husband who does not appreciate his better half and a wife who takes extremely disproportionate action in response. You see where I'm going with this right? <br/><br/>Now although it would be fair to say that both parties are at fault here we do end up leaning toward Nick, unless you're the type of person who thinks being a bad husband should be a punishable offense with the possibility of the death penalty in which case you would be squarely on team Amy in this instance. Amy who as it turns out is blatantly a complete psychopath, played flawlessly by Rosamund Pike. Honestly I would put her performance right up there with fellow big screen psychopath Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins, Silence of the Lambs). Affleck also turns in a brilliant performance and carries the film on his absurdly broad shoulders (here's looking at you Bruce Wayne) <br/><br/>Believe it or not there are actually still a few twists and turns throughout the film but unlike most movie adaptations of book thrillers this is not a story built on twists it's built on characters and excellent work of Gillian Flynn shines through and goes to show the advantages of keeping the original writer on board for the film version. The story like all great books is built around a novel concept which places the characters into impossible situations and then seeing how those characters deal with them. <br/><br/>I loved this film, like all great Fincher movies it stays with you long after the end credits, not just a throwaway piece of entertainment but a truly thought provoking experience. <br/><br/>☆☆☆☆☆"
"appledreams4","9","0","4","27 December 2014"," David Fincher's another absolutely masterful work
","Well, to be honest, I watched the film because of David Fincher. I was always a fan of him and after watching Gone Girl, my admiration of him only intensified. To be honest I have never read the book, nor any works by Gillian Flynn, so I have no idea where the film would be going. At first I only thought it would be a movie about a kidnapped wife and a hero husband, but I have never been so wrong in my life. <br/><br/>As I've said, Gone Girl basically is about a man, Nick, trying to find his missing wife, Amy. But as you'd expect from Fincher, this movie exceeds this common genre in so many ways. The huge amounts of plot twists will leave your mouth hanging open even 10 minutes after the credits have finished rolling, and I'm not exaggerating right here.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a film that explores a lot of themes. It talks about how marriages can affect a couple's relationship. That particular item is talked about so extensively and so boldly that it seems to be a discouragement of marriages. However, it simultaneously reinforces the importance of honesty and fidelity. Amy's psychotic manipulation of the world of course is bad, but does that mean Nick's infidelity can be forgiven? Nick seems to be the innocent man framed for murder but does that necessarily mean that he is the sole victim of the story? <br/><br/>That's what I love about the movie, that there's no obvious good or bad, it imitates how the world really runs. Unlike other films that clearly states that this is the good guy and that is the villain, Gone Girl masterfully blurs the line between black and white. The question of ""who is the good guy and who is the villain?"" remains unanswered and left for the audience to ponder on their own. <br/><br/>Needless to say, the film is impeccably directed under the sure hands of David Fincher, and I particularly appreciate how this extremely layered and complicated story is told to the audience. And part of that must go the screenplay. Gillian Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the film and I was so amazed by the quality of each line of dialogue. <br/><br/>If you really are going to watch, remember not to miss any single scene, and also, prepare yourself for an adventure that is so crazy yet believable, so original yet so real. And believe me, after the film has finished, you'll start wondering what your other half is really thinking."

The missing draws much attention and there are many loose threads.<br/><br/>The thrilling story brings me back to the movie Se7en. Not strange, knowing the fact that both movies have the same director (David Fincher). Visually, many scenes in Gone Girl reminded me of Joel Schumachers ""The Number 23"".

You find yourself siding with Affleck's character Nick but you dislike his selfish, self obsessed manor which does make you question if Nick was involved in the disappearance of Amy.<br/><br/>Overall it is a wonderfully sophisticated film and is exactly what you want from a crime thriller. All of the characters have huge flaws and although they are made obvious, you cannot help but really care for them. Both Affleck and Pike totally steal the show, they are truly brilliant in the lead roles and without them acting so finely the film would of been distinctively weaker. An excellent film that leaves you mulling over for days. Go watch!"

","When I watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith, I felt that John and Jane both deserved each other. Both were doing exactly the same to each other and yes, that include killing too... Then I watched this movie and I knew that I found The couple in the form of Nick and Amy who has dethroned The Smiths. Both were like soul mates if there are any. As the movie progresses and I come to midway, I just wondered why the hell did they get married. Was it just a one season charm that usually fades away and then we see divorce which is so prominent in western culture? But no... It was just that I was being a little hasty. They were perfect: One being unfaithful and other being the psychopath. And yes, Nick tried the divorce route too but the ending was just awesome."

","Enjoy, think and have fun with Gone Girl, definitely the best Fincher's movie since Fight Club. A story that tries to analyze the usually untold part of a marriage, relationships, media biz. It's like a knife that rip off hypocrisy of modern society and let you see something that you know is almost true and real as all other bullshits that movies and media generally try to tell you about love relationship. All of that, with so much black humor and an unpredictable end that really made me love this movie. it isn't possible to tell you much more without spoil the experience to watch this movie except that the acting is great and some scenes are directed in a perfect Fincher's style."

","It's difficult for me to recommend this movie too highly because I like movies with a resolution at the end. And there is no resolution at the end of this one.<br/><br/>That being said, this is still a fascinating flick – well crafted and well acted.<br/><br/>In a way, this movie is a repackaged version of Body Heat, a classic in the thriller genre made more than 30 years ago. Amazing Amy Dunne, played by Rosamund Pike, is like the Matty Walker who was played by Kathleen Turner in the classic. She is brilliant, far more than anyone truly recognizes including her hapless husband Nick (played by Ben Affleck) who, like the lawyer Ned Racine (William Hurt) in Body Heat, is manipulated and played for the fool that he is.<br/><br/>As it happens in real life, some men marry up. Nick did and as a result, finds himself in a marriage with a woman he doesn't fully comprehend and after a hot, passionate start to their marriage, she becomes weary of Nick. After all, Nick's idea of an ideal evening is playing video games or ""watching a marathon of reality TV with his hand in his underwear."" Adversity complicates the stress in their married life. Both have lost their jobs in the Great Recession. They move to North Carthage, Missouri in order to be close to Nick's mom who is struggling with breast cancer but loses her battle. Now, after 5 years of marriage, both Nick and Amy want out. Nick knows what he needs to do. He needs to pursue a divorce, but can't bring himself to actually carry it out. Amy knows what she is going to do, and has planned her exit in meticulous detail.<br/><br/>Amy disappears. What happened to her? We in the audience don't know. Evidence begins to build against Nick, and he becomes the prime suspect. We are sympathetic to Nick. We know in our heart that Nick didn't kill his wife. Here is a mystery to be solved. And then we learn that Nick is a dog. Now, our emotions begin to shift against the guy.<br/><br/>But at this point, the movie begins giving us more information about Amy, and our emotions shift once again. We come to realize what a cunning and manipulative woman she really is.<br/><br/>And then, something happens in the movie that I really liked because it provides the proof that regardless of how prescient we think ourselves to be, some things happen that just can't be predicted. Amy is mugged and finds herself literally on the street.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away, but let me say that the ending is not really an ending. It's clear that Nick and Amy cannot continue in the situation where they find themselves at the end of the movie, but will Nick do? Or if he doesn't do anything, what will Amy eventually do to Nick? This should lead to some lively speculative discussions among those who have seen the movie."

However, which caught me was that this movie tried to show what media is and what people want to from media.<br/><br/>People don't want to know the truth.

","Gone Girl is a functional thriller. With it exceptional story it will keep your interest up until the end of movie. Both sides of the story open bit by bit and it keeps spectator at loose end. There is one problem though. Story stats very slowly witch is not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that when they start to open the story, movie is almost over and they have to rush the end of the story too much. David Fincher's directing is smooth though a little bit of rigid. This might be the problem of movie's script. Gillian Flynn might be a great writer, but his first script is not as good as it should. Writer knows his story well, but the spectator needs to see a little more to be acquainted with story. Movie script is so much more than a book where you can open story more. Ben Affleck manage his role as Nick Dunne but Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne is brilliant. If the story would told a little better, this would get easily five stars from me, now I give it only four stars. Great thriller even though."

The movie messes with your head which to me is far better than another mindless shoot-em-up, explosion-happy Hollywood time-waster. I suspect the negative reviews here are from the transforming, talking robot with attitude from space, movie crowd who are quick to point out a plot hole in movies they don't like while completely ignoring the massive elephant in the room plot hole in their favorite movie. The actors were superb, especially Rosamund Pike who was a real ball-buster. ""Gone Girl"" is a good movie that keeps you guessing and well worth watching."
"MovieSonic","7","0","3","21 December 2014"," Engrossing and compulsive viewing
","***The spoiler is in the final paragraph***<br/><br/>The film is really long (two and a half hours) but given that there are about three or four stories to tell, it never seems that long.<br/><br/>I say the film is engrossing and compulsive viewing because you definitely can't stop watching it but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is good viewing. I kept trying to figure out what the theme of the film was. At various points I thought the story was about gender equality, then I thought it was about how events become twisted in the media and how people are villainised and scrutinised by the general public, then I thought it was just a murder mystery until finally, I realised that there really weren't any genuine themes to the story. It's completely all over the place and basically a cr*pshoot hoping that something will stick. It's impossible for this film not to generate hours of discussion and dissection amongst some people because almost every theme imaginable has been superficially included.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's character behaved very strangely during the investigation - even if you're not happy in your marriage (which is explained at the beginning) this wouldn't explain his lack of engagement with the police and the lack of emotion he displayed. There was absolutely no shock or sense of urgency on his part and from the way the film played out, it appears that this was the case only to keep the viewer guessing about certain issues. Essentially: some things happened only to enable the script to keep the viewer guessing.<br/><br/>There were a few random women-hating comments thrown in, likely just to kick up a discussion with feminists, yet at no point was this expanded upon and at no point did I feel that Affleck's character was actually a woman-hater so this character flaw of his made no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>Absolutely terrific acting by Rosamund Pike. I thought everyone involved produced some fantastic acting but especially Rosamund. I think she committed really well to every scene. I didn't understand her character's motivations though. Her narration tried to explain them but it didn't make sense and the blanket, and frankly lazy, excuse of 'psychopath' only explains one or two actions she committed, but certainly not one of the planned events on her calendar.<br/><br/>I do feel that too many themes were included making the film a bit of a mess in terms of having a serious point of discussion for viewers, however; after about ten or fifteen minutes, the story is simply too engrossing to worry about any of that and I actually like that the long run time allowed for more story development and crazy things to happen.<br/><br/>The ending did feel a bit like 'ok, two and a half hours is enough, let's leave it there now' because nothing extraordinary or interesting happened at the absolute final scene. In my opinion, it would have been a better ending had Affleck's character had a heart to heart with his sister about doing the right thing, and as a result then practised his speech in the mirror while Rosamund's character then made her big announcement during the live interview at which point, there would be serious tension and a terrific acting opportunity for the main characters whilst Affleck's character decided on how to react.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's a must-see yet instantly forgettable so 7/10."

The main elements that I loved about the movie was that it gave us the urge to investigate the case before the police does and find out a logical solution. But I can assure you that no one can. It was also very realistic in view. It was presented in a way that an average viewer would see a crime investigation at home on T.V news. I can very well say the acting was awesome.

","Gone Girl is one wild ride. The ending itself was kind of absurd and hard to digest at first. But then I realized that I had forgotten what an experience it was. Its portrayal of the extent to which some people go to make sure it is they who are always right is horrifying. David Fincher has be among my top favorite directors ever since I first saw The Social Network. Have seen Se7en and Fight Club apart from that, all three outstanding films. Gone girl is another feather in his cap.<br/><br/>On their fifth wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) finds his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing from his home. There isn't much to see at the first look of the crime scene except a glass table broken. Nick is asked questions about Amy and her life. It seems like he doesn't know her that much well despite 5 years of marriage. We then move back in time and hear Amy narrating the story with a diary of how she and Nick met and got close. Amy's parents are writers and creators of a famous character called 'Amazing Amy'. 'Amazing Amy' is based on their daughters real life thus making their daughter Amy herself very popular. Now the missing of Amy becomes a very hot topic and suspicions begin to arise about Nick too, who seems quite absent and casual. This is not even 10% of what actually happened and there is a big twist at the half point. Telling about it will spoil your first view.<br/><br/>The atmosphere created by the movie has a dark tone thanks to haunting score by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor who definitely will get another Oscar nomination. The film is also visually splendid especially in the first part in New York where Nick and Amy first meet. I have not read the book but Gillian Flynn's story feels a bit unrealistic at times but the way it is told by the atmosphere created and direction of Fincher you are pulled deep into the movie. There is also a tone of dark- comedy to it at times making it refreshing. The best thing though is the acting. I haven't seen much of Ben Affleck, his first for me and he was very good. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry have a smaller role, both did a fine job. Its Rosamund Pike though who gives a fantastic performance as Amy which might give a Oscar win as well. You must see the movie to understand me though. Its difficult to review it without spoiling anything.<br/><br/>Despite its positives Gone Girl still has flaws and maybe even plot holes. Some things make you ask how, which will make you think a lot. At the end it would good to have our own interpretation. David Fincher is yet to disappoint. This.This one is may not be his best but definitely among the top movies of the year.<br/><br/>RATING: [4/5]"

He did best to draw out the best out of the story which is amazing and the actors which were amazing, and guess what, he made me not wanting to blink throughout the entire 2.5 hours movie! The script was written and evoked perfectly, it has so many twists and turns, and you stop at some point realizing to which character you should trust, who's good, who's not etc. I'm just utterly shocked how a movie which was just promising from trailer went into some of the best 2014 movies.

He's a pretty decent actor, in my point of view, but not great. It's amazing how the movie turns the detective work towards us, the viewers; we have to analyze the crime instead of our main character doing it for us. We are the detectives. Could this man be involved? Did he plan it? Or is this a misunderstanding? Just like the trailer, I won't spoil it for you. All I can say is I did not expect what I saw. Rosamund Pike's performance was brilliant. I look forward into seeing her at the Oscars. If they hadn't nominated her, they've haven't even seen the movie. I know she was nominated for a Golden Globe but she deserves more than that. If you liked Fincher's Se7en, I'm sure you'll enjoy the hell out of Gone Girl.

During the investigation clue one is found in the kitchen. When Nick and a pair of detectives follow up on the first clue in Nick's office, things take a turn when the clue hints to Nick having an affair.<br/><br/>This is another stylish thriller by David Fincher based on the bestseller by Gillian Flynn, who was also responsible for the screenplay. Fincher cleverly makes use of non chronological storytelling by way of flashbacks for a better understanding of the relationship between Nick and Amy through time. The Ross/Reznor score is subtle but effectively creates an unique and fitting sound scape.<br/><br/>Personally, I am a bit ambivalent about the ending. The final resolution is thought provoking, but certain decisions made by the main characters feel a bit 'off'."

","Gillian Flynn's acclaimed novel Gone Girl gets adapted to the big screen by the author herself and is a riveting and superior thriller.<br/><br/>David Fincher directs the dark film adaptation Gone Girl, about the mystery surrounding a missing woman.<br/><br/>Nick Dunne, played by Ben Affleck, was a writer living in New York when he met the enamoring Amy, played by Rosamund Pike. Though hopeful at first, the story of Nick and Amy is more realistically complex than a happily ever after. On the day of their fifth anniversary, the glow and glimmer of love and happiness long gone, Amy goes mysteriously missing and foul play is suspected. A whirlwind media frenzy erupts as Nick becomes the prime suspect as his projection of an ideal and blissful marriage collapses under the strain of truth.<br/><br/>Thrillers similar to Gone Girl seem to have gone out of style in film as of late. Gillian Flynn's dramatic narrative puts a microscope on the perceived trend highlighted by the media's preoccupation with murderous husbands with the picturesque wife, life and marriage. Flynn takes this tired story and spins it on its head, for a novel and enrapturing mystery she single-handedly adapts in a screenplay.<br/><br/>Twentieth Century Fox made the proper choice when the production company enlisted David Fincher to direct the New York Times bestseller. Fincher stays true to his signature style appropriate for Gone Girl's psychological thriller that looks at the primal questions of any marriage.<br/><br/>Much of the successfulness of Gone Girl can most likely be attributed to the nuances of Gillian Flynn's acclaimed novel and less with the film itself. The story is intricate and delves deeply into the darkest aspects of human psyche and expertly utilizes the precarious nature of media representation.<br/><br/>The audience will dutifully watch and observe, taking in subtle clues and evidence regarding the case from the camouflaged meaning behind the behavior of Nick and Amy. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike play Nick and Amy as complex, dynamic and intriguing. Pike is especially effective but seems primarily the result of the compelling character written by Flynn.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is a film that builds much anticipation with layers of deception and unfortunately the ending is rather disappointing and anticlimactic.<br/><br/>For more full reviews of all the recent releases, please check out our website."

But I won't reveal much more about the plot because then I will have lots of gone girls and boys from reading the rest of my review. Affleck holds game in his starring performance as Nick, but it was Rosamund Pike who reached a new peak in her promising acting career with her outstanding performance as Amy; it will be amazing if she gets nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, which surely is a shoe-in to happen. Believe it or not, Tyler Perry does not bolt it away and does credible supporting work as Nick's attorney Tanner Bolt. Neil Patrick Harris is hosting the Oscars, and also hosted us to a worthy supporting performance as Amy's obsessed ex Desi. Carrie Coon also delivered a cool Coon performance as Nick's sister Margo. Fincher's exemplary direction was not gone from this picture, and Gillian Flynn was in in her impressive screenplay adaption of her own ""Gone Girl"" novel. OK, I am about gone here. Just see ""Gone Girl"" if you haven't already. **** Excellent"

","When I have 1st seen the ratings that the movie had, I was doubting that it was overrated. I thought that the movie would be boring and too predictable for the audience. However, watching this movie to the end changed that. Watching this movie for 2 hours and 30 minutes has been very entertaining. The movie have truly changed my impressions and opinion on Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. I mostly remembered Ben Affleck from his movie Daredevil which was not a very good movie for him, but his portrayal as Nick Dunne in this movie makes you want to kill him in the start and makes you love him in the end. Rosamund Pike's portrayal as Amy Dunne is hands down, one of the best performances that an actress has done this year. Her lovable and kind personality at the start is great, but her chilling performance in the end was amazing. David Fincher once again blew my mind with his beautiful and amazing way of story telling and directing this movie. I forgive you for you had shown in the ending of 7ven. Overall Gone Girl is an amazing movie that would entertain you from start to finish. This movie is one of the best movies for this year!

From start to end this film did its job in keeping me on the edge of my seat for the entire runtime, something not too many films have done this year. Although i noticed that after the half way point it felt like a different but equally as interesting film that could have been approached differently and would have fit more with the original tone. Rosamund Pike puts in an Oscar worthy performance and leads the race for the award. She is definitely the most interesting and compelling character of the film but still doesn't take too much away from the other great performances. It was a fitting ending i felt for the film although it left me wanting a little more.

Only this was told from the Husbands point of view, then twisted to make it a little more Hollywood than real life.

","Building up in a long running time of 2 hours and 29 minutes, this David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's bestseller never feels a tad of boredom for its meticulous efforts of crafting an outstanding thriller that straddle both its genre and art perfectly. It is particularly easy to guess which direction the plot will be heading, but ignoring the minor flaws and some illogical parts towards the second half of the film, the dark, mysterious psychological development of the characters, funny and brutal at sometimes, the flashback editing at the beginning, stylish cinematography, ambient and eerie scores are the major contributions for the film to be one of the most masterpiece marriage thriller in decades. Not much to mention on Ben Affleck, but the surprisingly frightening and psychopathic performance from Rosamund Pike might drive anger of one's nerves, and come to a conclusion that she is the perfect role. At the end, audiences might try to sense out what is right and wrong, the morality behind a true modern-day marriage; but to feel upset as it has to end although hoping for more tricks from the characters after a lengthy run."
"agitpapa-562-1441","8","0","6","12 December 2014"," A film that crowns David Fincher as the Dark Lord
","David Fincher continues his studies in human deviousness with this masterfully crafted Machiavellian film. His choice of Rosamund Pike is particularly brilliant because it allows her to get her big break and be launched into the high orbit of potential Oscar winners with no more effort than gaining and losing weight. Her messed-up personal life provides her with more than enough material to flesh out her Amy Dunne character, just like Winona Ryder's did in Turks & Caicos.<br/><br/>Pike's slightly haggard face and frightened, borderline paranoid eyes are perfect for Amazing Amy but don't quite convince when supposedly bringing a hot hunk like Nick Dunne (Affleck) under their spell. So we are offered instead a whirlwind of clever verbal foreplay to suggest that Nick falls for Amy's mind more than her body. However since Nick has to be somewhat of a sex addict to have the misadventures he is about to have, they have a lot of unconvincing sex. Somehow, one never quite believes that Amy actually enjoys it. She is just too clever and sassy when she should be incoherent. {SPOILER}As it turns out, she doesn't and it is entirely in role for Nick, whose penis does occupy a rather excessive part of his brain, not to notice.{/SPOILER} <br/><br/>Then we are introduced to the delightful Tyler Perry, whose black humor lifts up the somewhat depressing atmosphere. Made a mental note to see more of that guy's movies.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie reveals the villain's breathtaking, meticulous, Machiavellian deviousness. Not much more can be said without giving it away but that it's really fun to watch.<br/><br/>At the end of it all of course no one is left unblackened except poor and crushed Margo, as befits Fincher's vision of a humanity beyond hope. {SPOILER}However,that's where the plot weakens because it would have been child's play to nail the villain at the end by simply installing a few cameras in the victim's house, where the villain confesses all.{/SPOILER}"
"alanjflood","7","0","6","10 December 2014"," Absurd story yet the underlying themes of marriage disillusionment are very real and the characters are complex, flawed and fascinating.
","Gone Girl is not quite the film that I expected it to be. Having not read the book, my predictions were based solely on the films trailer which gives us an awful lot of information and had led me to expect an investigation into marital difficulties following a wife's disappearance. That's what it is for the first hour but it changes gear after that and becomes something else entirely which will come to no surprise to those who have read the book.<br/><br/>On the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) arrives home to find evidence of a possible struggle in his home and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. Over the days following Amy's disappearance we learn through Nick's reaction and behavior that he was totally unhappy in his marriage and this leads to the police and perhaps even more importantly the media, beginning to suspect him.<br/><br/>The Police are represented through likable yet hard-nosed Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens). Nick is accompanied by Boney as he tracks the various anniversary gift clues left to him by Amy, which is a tradition she performs each year. Things begin to spiral from there in the best tradition of a thriller novel. To divulge much more would be to sabotage the plot. Let's just say that when writing this piece, trying to navigate through egg shells of plot spoilers I was reminded very much of the warnings that accompanied films such as Hitchcock's Psycho and Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques. Before the end credits rolled, early audiences were encouraged not to reveal the plot twists to their friends. If this wasn't already a hugely successful bestselling novel, a similar warning would have been apt.<br/><br/>The story is ridiculous yet Gone Girl is a thoroughly enjoyable film that I would look forward to seeing again. The plot may be absurd yet the underlying themes of marriage disillusionment are very real and the characters are complex, flawed and fascinating. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck fits into the character of Nick Dunne like a glove. Everything about his body language is languid and fed up. He stands on his lawn, hands dangling by his side, big deep breath, contemplating the darkness of his situation. Nick Dunne isn't a good guy or a bad guy. He's a normal decent guy with some serious flaws, like most of us. And it's this that makes his character interesting and Affleck's performance so compelling. He's more than just the every Joe though. Look out for the emotional depths he must reach when he's told things that shock him about his wife. It's a mixture of feigning anger and disguising the secrets of his marriage as well as genuine shock at times. It's a wonderful performance.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne is an equal yet all together different performance. Amy is intense, intelligent, manipulative and maniacal and Pike plays her full throttle with some of her more severe scenes bringing to mind Heath Ledgers memorable turn as The Joker in The Dark Knight. We don't get to know Amy as quickly as we get to know Nick, so to speak about her performance in much more depth would be to begin to give plot elements away. <br/><br/>Both Pike and Affleck are shored up by an excellent supporting cast. As mentioned Kim Dickens as Detective Boney plays that wonderful kind of detective that seems to almost charm her suspect into guilt. Carrie Coon as Nick's rock of a sister Margo is a completely down to earth, believable character and their brother/Sister relationship comes across naturally. Tyler Perry brings some timely humor as a lawyer in the final third of the film and the supporting cast is complete with Neil Patrick Harris as a rich mama's boy and a high quality creep.<br/><br/>In many aspects Gone Girl holds similarities with David Fincher's previous film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Both are adoptions of best-selling books. Both are plot dominated thrillers. It has been said that both could be classed as adoptions of 'Airport' novels, an airport novel being a fairly long, fast paced thriller/adventure meant to eat up the hours of sitting and waiting. In other words, a book you read to fill empty hours, rather than a book you'd seek out to read. Perhaps the two are not mutually exclusive but it offers an interesting look toward the direction Fincher, one of the most important filmmakers of the last two decades, is heading and whether it's the right direction or not. Zodiac, Fincher's finest film to date could never be accused of being an airport novel.<br/><br/>That said, Gone Girl is a thoroughly enjoyable film, one I'd watch again, a film with characters that we want to know more about and a plot to keep you glued to your chair. It is of course absurd and ridiculous like any good airport novel. But if you focus instead on the wonderful characters and their navigation through this whirlwind plot, you'll find Gone Girl to be another solid Fincher film even it does fall short of being placed alongside his absolute finest."

What, that was it? She would have done great to study Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity, The Loves of Martha Ivers and the File on Thelma Jordan - worthy Femme Fatales who were deadly. And what about Lizabeth Scott in Too Late for Tears, or Claire Trevor in Murder My Sweet and Born to Kill. And the greatest Femme Fatale Ann Savage in Detour. <br/><br/>Ah Film Noir with deadly dames and whacked out Psychos like Robert Ryan , Richard Widmark and James Cagney and many more. <br/><br/>Anyway Rosamund your performance was worthy.

"evanobrien100","8","0","5","4 December 2014"," A chilling, nasty and insidious zeitgeist
","Despite criticism from large media outlets that David Fincher has softened by adapting popular ""pulp"" novels I feel that this criticism goes entirely off the rails with Gone Girl. As the film unravels it slowly begins to reveal more and more of itself and once the ending comes you get it, Mr. Fincher has directed us towards a place of absolute meta-textual understanding.<br/><br/>The opening and ending specifically reflects the sentiments carried by No Country for Old Men, it's ponderous with foreboding and meditation in equal measure.<br/><br/>Gone Girl boasts outstanding performances, on an obvious level from Rosamund Pike who is most certainly a shoe-in for an Oscar Nomination. Ben Affleck's performance however is what I'm particularly impressed with, he manages to evoke and execute a deftly subtle performance. He incredibly has the ability to stay consistent, yet true to the film's many faces and tones as it progresses. Tyler Perry pops his head up as a brash but brilliant attorney ""Tanner Bolt"" a role in which I never would have considered him capable, however the film works it's magic in mysterious ways. This is once again a testament to the outstanding directing from David Fincher, I cannot speak more highly of it.<br/><br/>The dark humour present in the film is balanced quite well and adds thin but palpable layer of satire to proceedings. The humour does more than making the characters easy to swallow. It enables the film to strike a tonal balance that keeps the film with the rigour necessary to bring it to it's conclusion.<br/><br/>Overall, Gone Girl is a deliciously nasty film with outstanding performances and sensational direction. It's so much more than something people can stick labels such as ""pulp"" on."
"bankofmarquis","9","0","5","2 December 2014"," Best of 2014 (so far)
","GONE GIRL is my favorite movie of 2014 (so far). David Fincher - the finest director working today (IMHO) - has himself another winner.<br/><br/>Based on Gillian Flynn's ubiquitous best seller, GONE GIRL chronicles the marriage of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) Dunn following the disappearance of Amy. Through flashbacks told through Amy's diary, the audience gets a glimpse into a once fairy tale marriage breaking apart. Once Amy disappears, suspicion quickly turns to Nick as suspect #1.<br/><br/>That recap does not do this movie justice. Fincher's direction is sure and steady and helps punctuate the moods of every scene he films. The beginning scenes of the marriage are light and fluffy and the screen gets darker and darker as the marriage becomes darker and darker. The action moves throughout building the suspicion and suspense throughout. This is a top-notch director at the top of his game.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Affleck is terrific as Nick. He is appropriately ambiguous in his relationship with Amy. Affleck is a charming presence on the screen and that charm comes across and, at times, moves into smarmyiness, where appropriate.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of Kim Dickens (the detective working the case), Carrie Coon (Nick's twin sister), Neil Patrick Harris (former boyfriend of Amy's) and Tyler Perry (Nick's high priced defense attorney) are all strong and well cast. Even Missy Pyle as a Nancy Grace-type TV reporter acquits herself well.<br/><br/>But make no mistake, this movie belongs to Rosamund Pike's Amy. While the first 1/3 of the movie is mostly Affleck, the 2nd 1/3 of the movie focuses on Pike and she takes hold. We watch Pike's ""Amazing Amy"" degrade into something else as the flashbacks unfold until we are left with a person we did not recognize - or expect. Nothing Pike has done up to this movie had me prepared for watching what she did with this role. I am excited to see what she does next.<br/><br/>This flick has Oscar written all over it. Both Rosamund Pike (Best Actress) and David Fincher (Best Director) are shoo-ins for Oscar nods, while Affleck (Best Actor), Flynn (Adapted Screenplay) and even Perry (Best Supporting Actor) have to be considered.<br/><br/>I love it when I walk out of a movie energized by what I saw - and this movie certainly energized me. Go see it.<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
"bulk-13","7","0","7","2 December 2014"," I watched it all the way through, but...
","... ultimately I feel I am being slightly generous awarding it 7/10.<br/><br/>On the plus-side - the acting is good from most of those involved (though really we should be entitled to expect that); the cinematography was quite engaging at times; it wasn't a standard stereotypical thriller built on cliché (though there was a heck of a lot of cliché to deal with). <br/><br/>This film kept me watching but started to feel spun-out approximately 30 minutes from the end. The ""twist"", well you could call it that but it's one you'll see coming from a mile off. Thankfully the film doesn't completely hinge around that, so it's only a mild annoyance that for half an hour we have a stereotypical ""dumb cop"" thing going on. <br/><br/>Overall, there was just too much silliness in the plotting for me to be particularly impressed; doubt I will ever watch it again."
"Anfubvinch","7","0","6","1 December 2014"," Yeah, it's a Fincher movie alright. Now how do I get out of my seat?
","I must say, the first twenty minutes of the movie did not satisfy me. I thought Affleck and Pike looked contrived, the dialogues were sloppy and cliché'd; You would almost think you were watching a rom-com. Was it just awkwardly done or expertly achieved by Fincher? I don't know. All I'm saying is, if you don't like the beginning, hang on, it's about to get much better. And a lot darker.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple. Nick Dunne goes home to find his wife missing and traces of commotion (broken glass, a flipped coffee table...). He calls the cops, and they become increasingly suspicious of the husband as the film progresses and incoherences appear in his testimony. <br/><br/>This truly is Fincher's first tour de force: leading the audience to believe that Nick Dunne is indeed questionable, by simply making him not perfect. He awkwardly smiles at the camera when asked, he takes pictures with strangers because he's asked, which leads people to believe that he has something to confess, or at the very least that he doesn't seem much concerned by the disappearance of his wife. The notes from his wife's ""diary"" in which he's depicted as a cold, violent man only add fuel to this theory.<br/><br/>Fincher loves plot twists. But in ""The Game, or ""Fight Club"", or to a lesser extent ""Seven"", the plot twists come at the end like a bomb shell, to either end all possibilities of hope, or liberate the main character if the movie ends well.<br/><br/>But not this time. The plot twist brutally sets in about an hour or 80 minutes in, and from now on the doubts you had about Nick are dissipated (watch out for the SPOILERS) : the poor guy is in fact married to a psychopath, a cold, calculating, superiorly intelligent criminal who faked her own death and in a blood-chillingly complex and almost flawless meticulosity.<br/><br/>That is not to say that Dunne is without any reproach. He cheated on his wife with a younger woman; also probably neglected his wife too. but the disproportionate scheme of his wife helps us identifying to Affleck's character, a more-or-less honest guy caught in a dangerous spiral.<br/><br/>The last thirty minutes or so are pure torture. Dunne's wife actually manages to come back unsuspiciously after brutally murdering a weird rich ex-boyfriend obsessed with her, to make people believe he was molesting and raping her the whole time, in another far-fetched scene where she shoves a bottle of champagne down her vagina, this time faking kidnapping and rape). With the wife back, Affleck is now caught between his knowledge that his wife is a psychopath, and the loving and supportive husband face he has to display for the cameras (the public and police not knowing anything about his wife's fake disappearance.<br/><br/>In the end, I don't know what irritated me the most. The fact that Nick's murdering psychopath of a wife pretty much has achieved everything she was looking for, or the fact that Nicky Dunne, while displaying intelligence to unveil the scheme of his wife, displays an apparent lack of courage; he's simply a coward. I think Fincher also wants to instigate doubt inside of us as to whether or not they love each other. By the end you can see the weakness and vulnerability of Dunne towards his wife. Basically he doesn't know if he should run away or kiss her. You feel like there's at least some residual love between them. That's Fincher's last victory upon us and our morals. The fact that these two could actually (and probably will) continue to live together. <br/><br/>I've said it many times before Fincher is an absolute sadist. He likes to manipulate his audience, toy around with us like a prey. Please go on Mr. Fincher. HIT US AGAIN!!!<br/><br/>Gone Girl - 8/10"

","If someone recommends you to watch a two-hour and a half thriller movie about an ordinary guy seeking his missing wife in a suburb neighborhood, would you be interested in watching? Most audiences may question about greatness of the story, wife's motives or most likely, the level of acting. Yes, the acting goes through the roof as the entire audience were really into it throughout that length to find out whereabouts of the ""Gone Girl"", Rosamund Pike who plays Amy, a famous author whose husband is Nick, played by Ben Affleck. <br/><br/>As impressive as the guise of cast, the plot development also lives up to the hype by introducing main characters from the outset with deliberate flashbacks of how the relationship between Amy and Nick builds up. This is where a special aptitude of Rosamund for her acting is fully discovered as Amy begins to disclose Nick's wrongdoing from the past, which turns him into an audacious liar and cheater.<br/><br/>A huge shutout to the director, David Finch who led the amazing cast and the talented film crew, especially the editing department for nailing on Amy's conniving scenes where she sets up all the uncanny incidents, such as the basement with full of shards of glass in order to frame his husband as well as a pretense of friendship with a nosy neighbor to retain sympathy from surrounding. The calm narrations of Rosamund Pike based on her inner emotions and diary effectively adds potent depth to several critical moments.<br/><br/>To talk about other cast, Carrie Coon, who plays Nick's younger sister manages to be very natural at her role as she is in the limelight whenever she chastises her cheeky brother. Neil Patrick Harris shows off his elegance and professionalism, which proves why he is capable of playing all kinds of characters in various genres. <br/><br/>There are a few goofs and overly-done sequences that can be spotted. However, they subliminally get overshadowed by Rosamund Pike's presence which unleashes an all-out prowess to pull the wool over everyone's eyes to keep her reputation as a famous author and the marital status. Ben Affleck also does his part by being a nifty two-faced man who is forced to feint his love to live off Amy's fame and fortune. What they do in the movie evidently make them either a psychopath or sociopath.<br/><br/>And now, last but not least, I think this contains important lessons that a lot of couples can take cue from. When it comes to moving to a new place, it requires careful thoughts and researches in order not to regret because there is always a chance that it may exacerbate the relationship while making adjustments to changes. It would be essential to consider each other's situation and come to an agreement instead of solely sticking to one's advantage."

For example , the detective asks about the gun and Amy fades out. Afterwards the complete department seems to forget that something ever happened. May be justification to ""Amazing Amy"" was a bit less on the screen. <br/><br/>The ending is very debatable, but I feel it's very apt. With the uncertainty of Nick at that point of time, he couldn't break it in the interview and He wouldn't kill her for sure. <br/><br/>The secret of making the audience ask and expect something and you half give it - impacts more !<br/><br/>except ... the surveillance camera in Neil Patrik's home, what happened to it?

It felt as if he was simply chosen for being Ben Affleck — a star to bring in the ladies and the cash. By the end of of the film it was clear Ben was perfect for the role. Fischer said in a Playboy article that he was looking for the perfect smile for the Nick Dunne character and googled the Affleck smile. ""I flipped through Google Images and found about 50 shots of Affleck giving that kind of smile in public situations. You look at them and know he's trying to make people comfortable in the moment, but by doing that he's making himself vulnerable to people having other perceptions about him.""<br/><br/>The movie's leading lady played by Rosemund Pike is also a wonderful choice. Without giving anything away, let's just say the casting was perfection for the plot twists. Any team that can pull in NPH (Neil Patrick Harris) is going to put a great ensemble cast together. They are believable from the first second of the film. If you are questioning the acting, then the movie has you right where they want you.<br/><br/>I continue to grow my respect and love for David Fincher as a director after watching Gone Girl. The Social Network wowed me (behind the scenes footage was killer) and I'm a huge fan of House of Cards. Gone Girl is another home run. In an interview with Affleck, he talked about getting to finally rest during a movie as merely the actor, not the director / actor after his big Argo win. He mentioned that when he was directing Argo, he would hear ""no"" to something and consider it a done deal and move on. One of the things he learned from Fincher is the centuries-old-lesson ""never take no as answer"". According to Affleck, Fincher does not accept no — no matter the cost, time or hassle. It will be interesting to see how Fincher's lessons will impact Ben's direction in his next picture. (Author's note: I'm struggling to find the interview to post as a reference! Still looking and will update once found!)<br/><br/>Gone Girl is smart, engaging, exciting. During the movie take a quick glance at the people around you — they are on the edge of their seats. Listen to their comments after the movie — hear what they took away about relationships, social media and the 24 hour news cycle. And yes, ladies, it's over two hours of Ben Affleck  simply put, you can't go wrong.<br/><br/>We would love to hear your thoughts — especially from those of you who read the book. I hear the movie is awesomely close to the book. I have it on my nightstand and look forward to reading it."

","This movie... My god, it was amazing. Brilliant plot twists every half hour or so, I kept sitting on the edge of my seat, wanting to find out what would happen next. This is a brilliantly written script with amazing actors who did a fantastic job picturing the characters, sometimes scaring the audience. I would recommend this to everyone around me as it is one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. Ben Affleck is on top of everything and Rosamund Pike surprised me as a truly magnificent actress. The only thing I would have liked to happen is a better explanation of secondary characters and their thoughts, such as Margo(Nick's sister) and the ex-boyfriend of Amy Elliot. Also Amy's parents story line could have been a bit more clear since they seemed to just 'be there' and not really do anything particular at all. Other than that it was brilliant, leaving me wanting more and at times feeling at unease(but for good reasons!)."
"drael64","9","0","6","16 November 2014"," Layers of social complexity, compelling thriller
","This is a very compelling thriller, that takes you on a ride of red herrings, and misdirection.<br/><br/>At the same time, it speaks to the misdirection that emotional charged topics lead to in the media and public perception,<br/><br/>and simultaneously provides a either intended or unintended metaphor criticism of feminism, or the victim/perpertrator duality that men and women experience in todays society, as is promoted by gender feminists.<br/><br/>In a number of refreshing twists, and changes, the film might be bleak and morally chilling, but is definitely well acted, and thought provoking. <br/><br/>It is so deep set in the space of darkness, that some may take it incorrectly as a subtle black comedy, but it is not. It is an exploration of the unexplored darker parts of human minds, public perception, and foremost of course, a compelling and slightly unsettling thriller. <br/><br/>The one way that I would mark it down, is that the victim in the film, displays not quite enough fear, sadness, confusion or vulnerability at points where you would expect them to. And given the nature of the ending, that would sell the ending better, if that had taken place. This could be due to writing or the actor, but that emotional gravity undersell unfortunately prevents this from being a complete 10/10 masterpiece, but it is still an incredible film, with much to think about and much to draw the viewer in.<br/><br/>Worth seeing, if you like realistic and non-conformist thriller and dark human drama with a side serving of provocation."

","Of every movie I've ever seen that has been based on a book, this one was BY FAR the best. Perfect. It was perfect. Before seeing the movie, I wasn't sure about certain casting choices But I was proved wrong, and all the actors involved did an excellent job. Of course, some were mildly different than I imagined, but I never found myself being distracted by differences in characters between the book and the film. Some plot points were of course removed (they had to be, it was already a two and a half hour movie), but it didn't affect the flow of the story in any way. The only thing I would say was hindered was the development of Amy's character at the very end of the film, due to the absence of Desi's mother. However, all of her character is still there, it's just not as clearly highlighted as in the book. But of course, this occurs regardless, as the movie cannot include all of the internal dialogue featured in the book. That being said, it came pretty close to it. I don't want to oversell it, but I've never seen a film more closely represent the book it's based off. All book to movie adaptations should work like this. <br/><br/>Recommended for: I wouldn't even say you have to read the book to see this, they're so closely related. I would recommend the book first (always) due to the added detail, but if you like good quality crime and mystery, you should definitely see it; whether you've read the book or not."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","8","15 November 2014"," Did he or did he not?
","""Gone Girl"" is one of the big blockbusters from 2014 (which is pretty much a given as it was directed by David Fincher). It was adapted by Gillian Flynn from her own novel. I was not entirely sure if I would give this film a 3/5 or a 4/5, but finally went for the latter as, despite its massive length of 2.5 hours, it never dragged the slightest. Rosamund Pike seems to be getting lots of awards attention, but I thought Ben Affleck was equally good, maybe even better as he, unlike Pike, was also in it the full first half.<br/><br/>Apart from the dramatic scenes, there was also some much-needed comic relief provided by Tyler Perry and Missy Pyle, especially the latter who displays perfectly the deformity of media these days. The first half was good as you could keep guessing did he kill her or not. The second half succeeded thanks to the constantly new information we found out about the gone girl. The ending felt really unsatisfactory at first, but as I am not a fan of forced happy endings, it has grown on me since then. Sometimes that is just how it goes, although obviously the two will keep clashing with each other and this is gonna be all but a harmonious textbook marriage. No surprise as he is now living with somebody who planned to get him electrocuted and was on a good way. And is a baby, in the 21st century, really reason enough to stay with her?<br/><br/>I have some minor criticisms with the movie, for example that her plan was just too perfect for my taste. Not even the most gifted criminal investigator or forensic analyst could come up with a scheme like this and have it work out exactly the way she wants. So it was a bit nice to see when she did not go the final suicide step or got robbed by the hillbilly couple. If you looked closely enough, there are many well-written scenes. There was one at the beginning that I liked particularly. In a flashback we see Affleck's and Pike's characters tongue-kissing, and right afterward, back in the now, we see a tongue smear taken from Affleck's character. Or notice how the younger cop who keeps suspecting Afflecks character all the time, completely disappears the moment gone girl reappears, for example in the scene where Affleck's character, his sister, the female cop and the lawyer discuss what they can do. So far he has always been there when the female cop, his boss, was around. Carrie Coon, who played the sensible sister, gave a solid performance too. Neil Patrick Harris plays a very interesting character. It is really hard to say if he is dangerous, sad or just a bit creepy like all of us and I still cannot make up my mind. Anyway, he is probably the only thing in the story that gone girl did not lie about.<br/><br/>Finally, I must say I had some trouble with finding the whole thing credible with all its plot twists. I especially struggled with her change in mind from hating him to getting back together with him from the talk show appearance. She is such an intelligent woman and must know that it was probably all staged. Nonetheless, I very much recommend watching this film. Edge-of-seat stuff."
"galaxy210-802-160547","6","0","6","14 November 2014"," A good thriller filled with dark humor. Ben's acting is the highlight.
","First thing first, I find Amy's plan and the general plot generally ridiculous and unconvincing. Thanks to Mr Fincher, though, and the way of his storytelling, the 2 and a half hours was blessed with an air of dark humor that make you enjoy it more as a thrilling drama rather than a thriller.<br/><br/>The movie is in a way refrained from any extreme expression of emotions or raw display of human nature, but it depicts so accurately the very base of what we want and what we want to believe.<br/><br/>To point it out, I do believe Nick and Amy are perfect for each other. Nick knows what Amy wants, and Amy oh so well knows that Nick wants. <br/><br/>The single most memorable scene for me was when just before the interview at their home, and Nick was frustrated because of Amy's manipulated pregnancy. Amy would say that she makes the best of Nick, and the only times in Nick's life that he escapes mediocrity is when he tries to impress her. <br/><br/>Oh, and I do love Ben more after this. His acting here is superb. He's not the dramatic type or the transformational type (like Meryl Streep). No, he doesn't transform into his character; he simply is his character. I'm honestly considering composing a 2000-word essay just on his acting in Gone Girl.<br/><br/>In summary...<br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFFS: David Fincher. Ben Affleck as Nick. Ben Affleck's penis. Margo - Nick's sister. Nick's smile. The storytelling. The dark humor. How to Manipulate the Crowd 101. The importance of being earnest. The ending.<br/><br/>THE BAD STUFFS: Ridiculous and unconvincing plot. The police (including FBI) are unbelievably incompetent. The first hour was quite mediocre, not unlike a very predictable case from Elementary (the TV show with modern Sherlock Holmes)."
"akash_sebastian","8","0","6","13 November 2014"," Fincher does it again with this Gripping Tale of Modern Marriage and Deceit.
","David Fincher is still at the top of his game. He knows his strengths well, and chooses his stories appropriately. Here, Gillian Flynn's writing and David Fincher's storytelling style are made for each other; it's a sickly brilliant combination. Fincher brings out the best from all his actors, especially Rosamund Pike, who steals the show with her riveting performance.<br/><br/>The movie is about an upscale (late suburban) couple, Nick and Amy Dunne; both of them are writers. It exposes the secrets at the heart of this modern marriage, and how recession plays a role in leading them there. The story begins with the disappearance of Amy on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary. We get to hear both the partners' versions of their marriage - we get an idea of the setting, and everything around, but we don't know whose version to believe; this is done with the help of unreliable narration, like in the novel. Due to this, and other twists, proper amount of suspense is maintained throughout the film.<br/><br/>The movie also highlights the media and public's frenzy and fascination for such 'Missing' or 'Murder' stories, and how they are quick to pass their judgments even before the case goes to trial. It wittily pokes fun at public's collective obsession of social media and reality television. Other than this, the story portrays marriage as the biggest villain, which is quite true; people portray their best selves when they're dating someone, but often fail to cope with their partner's true nature once they're in a committed relationship or marriage. Our very human nature to lie and hide things is the biggest reason for most complications in a marriage.<br/><br/>I do agree with some of the viewers who said that the film sympathizes a little more with the male lead by omitting few complexities of the female lead (or rushing through them) and making her appear more antagonistic. It's just by a little margin though, otherwise the balance is quite proper in the storytelling.<br/><br/>The crisp cinematography and captivating soundtrack sets proper mood for the story to unravel. The ending might not satisfy half of the viewers, but with the central theme it's exploring, it's the most appropriate and thought-provoking one."

","Gone Girl is a dark and intelligent thriller that plays to Fincher's fascinating style, brilliance of Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike's performances might be what the film is remembered for in years to come. Fincher have a predilection for dark mysteries, but more to the point, they have a shared fascination with the psychology of dark mysteries like Zodiac or Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl's central mystery isn't simply one of evidence and alibis, but rather one of impulse. The film is based on a wildly popular novel (that I haven't read) by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the apparently pretty faithful screenplay. It is certainly a twisty tale. It starts out as one thing, turns into something else and then turns into quite another thing altogether. Whether it is the story itself or Fincher's amazingly precise handling of it, I don't know, but somehow the shifts flow smoothly and never jar — at least, they never jar more than they're meant to and always feel like part of the whole fabric of the film. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, especially the end. I felt like I was watching a long-lost Hitchcock classic. Fincher nails the tone and sustains it effortlessly for the entire running time."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is a men's magazine journalist who's married to Amy (Rosamund Pike), the author of some successful children's novels. But beneath the surface, their marriage hides a lot of murky secrets and sordid lies. Shortly after their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick reports that Amy has gone missing. There then follows a well publicized appeal to help find where she's gone, but Nick's strange behaviour and lack of emotion make others believe he's got something to hide. But the truth is far more sinister and unbelievable than anyone could have imagined.<br/><br/>Having previously delivered another adaptation of a successful novel, in the shape of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, here David Fincher puts his hand to another novel that has enjoyed a fair bit of critical and commercial success, and presents a film with a very similar, almost identical sense of style, mood and tone, not to mention the same testing length stretching at just over two and a half hours. It's a bold, experimental effort, that takes the murder mystery genre and attempts to take it in new directions and explore new avenues and possibilities with it, that doesn't grip you much at first, but somehow mellows your patience and gets you to stick with it and go with it's flow ,as it twists and turns in all it's unexpected and baffling turnings.<br/><br/>At first, Affleck's detached performance, not one of his more explosive ones, and the lack of development with the married pair doesn't promise a film that's going to hold your attention for much over half an hour, much less over five times that amount, and the early warning signs of the modern curse of 'back story', where we learn of Nick and Amy's early courtship and such, don't bode that well. But the film simply holds your attention through out by refusing to follow the rules of what went before it, serving more prominently as an examination of media hysteria, witch hunting, trial by media, being guilty until proved innocent and how the vacuous culture we live in makes the true victims the real criminals. At various junctures, it promises to end, only to strike it's fiercest blow in the middle with an explosively revealing twist that makes it stand out. From here, it can only get more shocking.<br/><br/>Throughout, the film also benefits from a superb score, a drained, spaced out soundtrack that gives a Fincher film it's signature style. Fans of TGWTDT will certainly not be disappointed, while everyone else can experience a flawed but visceral experience unlike any other. ****"

","Before reading further, know these: 1. I've read the book. Loved it. Made me read all of Flynn's other works. Loved them too. Dark. Subversive. Captivating. Deffo up Fincher's alley for adapting. 2. The supposedly nice cinema I watched this in had geniuses who were always on their mobile phone (including a genius who I accompanied - just my luck), and 3. The sound output was pathetic, along with the noise that was being made perennially by a projector. 4. The omnipresent censor board seemed to be taking it's role quite seriously in this flick, manipulating frame size and position to obscure nudity, sex and violence from all of us innocent moviegoers. Not sure it was something the makers did. Also, towards the end, quite a few lines spoken by one of the lead characters was muted out, and I did not catch anything, in spite of having read the book.<br/><br/>Sigh.<br/><br/>But the fact that I'd already read the book going in turned out to be surprisingly unfortunate (in spite of this being from the mind of David Fincher, which is weird, since I'd read all the 'Dragon tattoo' books and watched the fantastic Swedish film original 'Män som hatar kvinnor' as well, and his adaptation with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, though totally unnecessary, was right on-the-nose) since this turned out to be a totally uninvolving affair for those who've read the book. At least in my mind, the movie I imagined (IMO) was better than what unfolded. Well.<br/><br/>Specifics then:<br/><br/>There are far too many blink-kinda transitions from one scene/set- piece to the next, and I do not know why Fincher followed that theme over here. Almost found it distracting every time, though I've not had that complaint for this kinda transition in other works (though nothing comes to mind immediately, other than M:I 3, for which it seemed contextual, ergo, perfect). No style should call attention to itself, IMHO.<br/><br/>The performances are perfect, including that of Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt, though they've strangely changed his ethnicity to accommodate Perry. I'd call it racist/reverse-racist, but I'm glad Perry gets to sharpen his acting chops once in a while in roles like this. For my money, better'n Madea-ing around, though that pays better for him.<br/><br/>I was also not very impressed by the background score by Fincher regulars, Reznor and Ross, and their attempts to be subtle (not very, since there's always a droning going on in the background, that I feel the score could've done without - and this was not the damn projector fo sho, since I remember 2 separate 'drone' tracks throughout: to be fair, I might not have resented the one in the soundtrack if the other one were absent, but I'll never know, since I do not intend to revisit this one at all). <br/><br/>All the other technical aspects, including set and production design, the cinematography, editing (except in few places, perhaps) had people working at the top of their game, meeting Fincher's exacting (but perhaps lowered, in this instance) standards. <br/><br/>Last, and perhaps not all that important in the context of all my other points, I was expecting a better title sequence than was seemed (almost) lazily concocted/choreographed here (the one he gave us in 'Se7en' was perhaps the best in his filmography, closely followed by the one he conceived and executed for the 'Dragon Tattoo 1' remake), but I'm sure I wouldn't be dissing an entire movie for a routine kinda title sequence, so there.<br/><br/>All in all, a must-watch at the cinema for those who've not read the books. For the rest of us though, a TV viewing with other options on the remote is not a bad idea at all."
"Kicino","9","0","5","10 November 2014"," Brilliant plot and meticulous direction depicting twisted love story wrapped in a thriller
","Gone Girl is so enticing that I watched it two times. Then I read the original and found there are even more details not shown in the movie which could have made the movie a little more complete.<br/><br/>In terms of the movie, it excels on all counts: script, direction, acting, music and editing. A totally thrilling experience with many twists and turns while giving you some slacks to reflect on love/marriage and the role of media in our society. A great movie. <br/><br/>Good pacing and capturing from the start: Ben Affleck is quite good in portraying the frustrated, mediocre, and frightened husband Nick Dunne who is just human: a simple-minded kidult who might occasionally be naughty but way less controlling, calculative or manipulative. A writer in New York, he moves back to his hometown in Missouri with his beautiful Harvard-graduate wife (a New York native) to care for his dying mother. After his mom died, they stay on and he teaches writing at a community college.<br/><br/>His beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike), also a writer in New York, is missing on their fifth anniversary. But Nick seems to be too relaxed to the Police. Evidences begin to emerge, suggesting that Nike may have killed Amy. Nick denies repeatedly. <br/><br/>The drama starts with two parallel lines: Nick's search for Amy in real life and Amy's narration of their marriage through a diary. These two descriptions merge half way and more surprising drama follows. Without giving too much details and spoiling the suspense, let's just say it is very enjoyable to follow the development. To me, it is always engaging to see how smart Amy is molded into the way she becomes by her psychologists parents. Ever since her childhood, she has been living in an illusion. It is tragic in a way because she cannot face her real self. <br/><br/>Nick is manipulated by multiple forces in the movie as if he is a victim. It is almost comical to see how the media sneers at the underdog and how we could turn the situation around if we know how to play the game and change public opinion overnight. But then we could also be trapped by the image we created for ourselves. <br/><br/>It is very interesting how the gender is contrasted in this movie: three main female characters - Amy, Nick's twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and the detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) are brilliantly portrayed with confidence and intelligence. Even Amy's mom and the TV anchorwomen are strong personalities who like to take charge. On the contrary, Nick and Amy's ex-boyfriends appear to be victims of some sort, either because men generally do not think clearly when it comes to women or some women are just too dominant <br/><br/>As for marriage, Amy and Nick seem to be the perfect couple until things turn sour when they show their real self. Their relationship is portrayed as a lifelong torture with endless deceit, mind games and mutual manipulation. They both pretend to be someone they are not really are to get what they really want. Pathetic and ridiculous at the same time. <br/><br/>The accompanying score is perfect in expressing the mood of the characters and the urgency of the plot development. The direction is great as the details are carefully paved and punchlines neatly paced so you would be awed and chuckle alternatively. Not a single frame is wasted and the 149 minutes drift by swiftly. The novel gives more background on character motivations and tie some loose ends in the movie.<br/><br/>The overall achievement is so good that I would not be surprised if Gone Girl receives multiple Oscar nominations/prizes, especially Best Actress, Best Direction, Best Script and Best Score. The original novel is equally enjoyable."

"jdkraus","9","0","5","9 November 2014"," A twisted, crazy, yet nicely executed mystery...
","When a director crafts a mystery thriller for the big screen, he not only has to be able to spin a good story from his scriptwriter, and show that story with the editor's prowess, and have it performed to ripeness with his actors, but he also has to carry the capacity to intrigue the audience enough and push them beyond their boundaries of excitement and discomfort. David Fincher is a master of these powers and that makes him an awesome filmmaker. He knows how to make a movie stick with you and he takes his viewers to some of the darkest places of the human mind. <br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" is one of those good mystery thrillers that do not rely on suspense, thrills, or even a big twist at the end—all the typical makings of such a genre. In fact, I found myself guessing the remainder of the film's plot 30 minutes in. What kept me focused was the brilliantly written dialog and performances by the ensemble cast. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne, a down on his luck writer whose wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has mysteriously vanished. As time of her disappearance grows longer, he becomes the prime suspect of her possible murder and the center of a media circus that is out for blood. The only solace he obtains is from his hipster twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and a well-known attorney (Tyler Perry), who has a $100,000 retainer. <br/><br/>The first hour of the film sets itself up as a realistic mystery, but then switches gears to a psychological drama that borders on horror when the truth behind Amy's disappearance unravels itself. This sudden revelation to a pseudo-film critic may seem like a Brian De Palma/noir femme fatale knockoff, but it actually is a bit of a study on how a terrible marriage can lead to psychopathy. The events that further transpire are messy, twisted, disturbing, gross, and yet exactly what it needs to keep the film going. Without giving much more away, I will mention that ending is quite good and gives the viewer something to think about. <br/><br/>Once again, David Fincher has surrounded himself with a great team. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography evokes the natural lighting look combined with deep bluish hues to emphasis the bleak atmosphere. Kirk Baxter's editing is sharp and to the point in showing the plot's progression. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score adds an eerie atmosphere to the film. Fincher's direction displays his ability to capture exceptional performances from his cast. Rosamund Pike makes the movie as a very complicated, multi-layered character that we think we can understand, but we never really can comprehend. Carrie Coon fits in nicely as the supportive sister of Nick. She ranks as probably the most ordinary and down to earth character in the whole film. Even Ben Affleck delivers a fine performance. I never thought of him as much of an actor, but he plays an individual that is trapped in a horrific situation with plausibility. The sound mixing unfortunately lacks quality, making the dialog difficult to hear at times. It feels very much like a rough cut versus a final product. And while I like the ending, there are certain elements that seem to be overlooked or blatantly ignored if the events in the movie happened in a real scenario. <br/><br/>In short, ""Gone Girl"" proves itself as another great addition to Fincher's impeccable resume and may make the 2015 Oscar season."

"mitodruroy","9","0","6","3 November 2014"," An immensely clever movie.
","I watched "" Gone Girl"" yesterday. Its an immensely clever movie directed by David Fincher who is the genius behind the 1999 movie, "" Fight Club "". The movie stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as his wife Amy. Neil Patrick Harris plays Amy's ex-boyfriend Desi. Rosamund Pike portrays troubled Amy Dunne beautifully. This could possibly be her best performance till date. She actually manages to overshadow Ben Affleck's performance in this movie. Her main motive is to keep her husband on a tight leash and one needs to watch the entire movie to find out if she manages to do so or not . Neil Patrick Harris' performance as Desi in this movie is a complete departure from his usual comic roles. He manages to do a good job. Last but not the least, Ben Affleck's performance as Nick Dunne is mesmerizing to say the least. Nick Dunne isn't a faithful husband and he has a very very short temper and is extremely insecure. Which is why his wife plans to teach him the lesson of a life-time. The lady who plays Nick Dunne's sister has also done justice to her character. I have tremendous faith in David Fincher as a director. He has always made sensible movies and I'm sure he is going to make many more good movies like this one. :-)"

"lasttimeisaw","8","0","6","2 November 2014"," sterling work from Fincher, again!
","GONE GIRL finally arrives in the cinema here, so what could be more appropriate than Fincher's vastly anticipated and razor-sharp dissection of modern marriage/relationship for a Halloween night? The aftermath of this trend-setting thriller can impact abidingly on one's memory not only for its plot twist but also a brave ending which dares to defy the accepted mode of ""perpetrator gets punished in the end"", and intrigues viewers to inspect our own quotidian bearings and give an inscrutable glimpse to our partner. <br/><br/>Nick Dunne (Affleck) is the husband, a seemingly attractive guy, a professor in the college and not particularly ambitious, ordinary to say the most, but deep down he is a major disappointment to his wife Amy, who is a bestseller writer of THE AMAZING AMY series, they ditched their posh life in NYC to Missouri, to take care of Nick's cancer-ridden mother, but after she passed away, they are also stranded there, like their marriage and their financial situation.<br/><br/>In order to set up the false appearance of being murdered by her husband on their anniversary with the six-week pregnancy, Amy starts her meticulous scheming to start afresh at the expense of Nick's doom. Once we know the plan (which is surprisingly disclosed in the midstream), her outright malignancy is appalling, although Nick's good husband facade has dissolved quite conveniently for adultery and emotional detachment, but this qualifies for a death penalty. The second half kick-starts a dual storyline which out-paces the normal police procedural, in one hand, Nick is fried by media and police, lead by detective Rhonda (Dickens), to get rid of his suspicion, aided by his twin sister Margo (Coon) and a well-known lawyer Tanner Bolt (Perry), he realizes what Amy has done to frame him. In a game-changing crunch, Nick puts on his best performance to be the one Amy always wants him to be in a talk-show to easily win back the trust of populace (the satire is brilliantly on the nose!), also the belated admiration of Amy, now as a spectator in front of the TV. <br/><br/>In the other hand, Amy's post-crime story is also tortuous and remarkably startling, to disguise herself from being recognized, she gains some weight, wears shabby clothes with self-inflicted bruise on the face, maintains in a low-profile life but one small hiccup leads to the quandary of being penniless, but the amazing Amy will not give up, resorts to her ex-bf, Desi Collings (Harris), she is hidden in his posh lake house under surveillance, it seems to be a perfect place for Amy to stay with a man who is unconditionally obsessed with her. Just one thing, Desi is a control freak, and so is Amy, who cannot allow herself deprived of the power of command, Desi must be dispatched and in the arresting third act, Amy returns as a victim kidnapped by Desi, Amy and Nick becomes the most likable couple thanks to the media frenzy, and both agree to keep up the appearance after Amy comes clean to him about what she has done. The coda touches on a tangible thrill of distrust and creepiness, Nick decides to stay in the marriage and ignores the elephant in the room.<br/><br/>Affleck's often lukewarm body language and in lack of facial expressions gives Nick the authenticity of being indolent and insensitive, Fincher brings out his best performance, he is dampening down all the trappings of being a man of intelligence, but in the key scenes when he is elicited to talk to Amy on the national TV, he knows he enjoys the game, and he is good at the game too, from then on, he turns from a victim to a matchable gamer, which also attributes to Amy's decision to come back. <br/><br/>Pike is the film's overt MVP, finally grabs a meaty career-defining role and a leading lady status more than 10 years after her big screen debut in 007's DIE ANOTHER DAY (2002, 5/10), the role also demands a transformation of her appearance, but her versatility between an icy queen and a threatening psychopath is the actual calling card for her very first Oscar nomination, and it is a much more complicated and deadly villain than her Oscar precedents such as Kathy Bates in MISERY (1990, 8/10) or Louise Fletcher in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975, 8/10). She is mysteriously dangerous because she could appear nearer than one can imagine. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is all bells and whistles, only Carrie Coon (from THE LEFTOVER series) may have a shot for an Oscar nomination thanks to the tacit closeness between her and Affleck (they are twins in the film albeit a 9-year-old age discrepancy), plus the film is a major topical movie right now, if the momentum stays, she can sneak in the race; the same cannot be said to Kim Dickens, this very underrated character actress is also remarkable as the tough detective, but she is wanting an Oscar-inviting showpiece to solidify her qualification. <br/><br/>Fincher is red-hot now and it is respectable he doesn't pander for some Academy-friendly material to secure his trophy, instead, he keeps making films of his gusto with astonishing precision, and I cannot wait to watch this film again, in DVD or BluRay for sure, because in Egypt, the censorship has cut all the sex and gory scenes, which for a purist as myself, it is utterly frustrating."

Does Mercy have limits? If so, how much Mercy before it is seen as weakness. These questions might seem random but after watching the movie you will understand, why I have asked them in the first place.<br/><br/>When a suburban house wife goes missing, the detectives begin their investigation which catalyzed by an intense media-circus turns into a national sensation and at one stage turns against the husband who becomes the prime accused. But, the truth is buried several layers deep.<br/><br/>Time and again Hollywood comes with movies on How to lead a matrimonial Life? Here's a movie that tells us How ""not"" to lead a matrimonial Life? The stress that everyday couples meet, along with perversions, secrets, dis-communication and lack-of-trust built up to a point where, all it takes is a single match to turn everything else to ash.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike, as the titular ""girl"" is anything but a girl. A detailed description would spill beans on the storyline. But let me say this, she's not what it seems and her performance is easily the front- runner for the next year's Oscar.

"riteshshergill","8","0","5","31 October 2014"," As Much Rosamund Pike's film as David Fincher's
","Yet another Feather in the cap for David Fincher. He is a magician at extracting above par performances from his actors and such is the case with Gone girl. Essentially it is the story of a sociopath (Rosamund Pike's character) who gets married to the ideal guy but later realizes that he was far from ideal. Ben Affleck's character (Nick) wins her over by being somebody he is not and once they do get married, Amy realizes he is not the guy she married. Hence her frustration at making all sorts of compromises within the marriage. As the years go by, she becomes more and more disillusioned and the last straw is when she finds out that Nick is seeing somebody behind her back. This for her is the last straw and she comes up with a plan to frame him for her murder. For the better part of the movie, things go according to plan for Amy up until she gets robbed while hidden away at a lodge. From there things take a turn for the worst and she ends up back where she started. Only problem is that Nick knows what she is capable of now yet has to live a life of compromise with her. That is the end of the movie. There are plot holes.. especially with Amy's story, the one she lets the media and the FBI believe. The first is that when she gets robbed at the lodge, the girl who robs her doesn't recognize her but she knows that she is a woman in hiding. So that is one loose end as far as Amy is concerned. If the girl ever recognizes her and comes forward to tell the cops that Amy was staying at a lodge instead of being tied up in a lake house Amy is finished. The second thing is that we don't see her turning off the cameras at the lake house before framing and killing Desi. But she would've doctored the tapes anyway.. The final hole in her story is that she says that Desi hit her with a blunt object and apparently she lost a lot of blood from the head wound. Problem is there is no head wound when she comes back. Surely the doctors would check her for a concussion after the way she says Desi assaulted her when he 'took' her. And knowing the FBI, they wouldn't get taken in so easily by her subterfuge. They would definitely investigate further and find out the holes in her story. Especially the part where everything ties in a little too conveniently for Amy. Therefore, I believe the ending could've been better. Amy is on thin ice and her story is full of holes.. only a matter of time before the FBI finds out about her. Its just sad that Nick gave in so easily. 8 for the haunting soundtrack and very good performances from the cast, especially Rosamund Pike."

"kunalkhandwala","8","0","5","30 October 2014"," Bold, intriguing, dark entertainer
","Possibly, the most compelling reason to watch 'Gone Girl' in all its seriousness as a murder mystery is how it plays with your mind while being something else too. This isn't a reflection of today's society nor is it a thesis on failed marriages. Based on Gillian Flynn's popular novel and mostly adapted to screen by herself, this contemporary thriller is powered by a dueling narrative that doesn't permit the viewer to take sides for half the movie. Flynn's cinematic adaptation is smart and twisted enough for director David Fincher ('Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'Panic Room', 'Girl with the Dragon tattoo') to delineate his nimble ability with dark thrillers. He then uses his experience of 'The Social Network' and 'House of Cards' to provide a riveting drama that revolves around some powerful characters who face precarious and changing circumstances, neither of which are favorable to them. <br/><br/>On the morning of their 5th anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home after sharing his sob story of a struggling marriage with his sister at their bar, only to learn of his wife Amy's (Rosamund Pike) mysterious disappearance. The lead detective's initial suspicions as well as the media's overbearing judgements quickly turn Nick into America's most hated man while he is still coming to term's with her disappearance. This is where the narrative draws excitement with its dual points of view. Nick's deeds and misdeeds provide one angle of what happens in the present while Amy's diary provides insight into their relationship and possibly, motive for her husband to have malcontent. The element of intrigue generated by these parallel points of view is certainly a result of the synergies between Flynn and Fincher. As guilt, suspicion and negligence become matters of public opinion, media toys with their presentation just as the film's characters, the writer and director tend to manipulate with your interpretation of what really occurs. The attitude of media and public might be the American way which seems overblown sometimes but the film doesn't propose absolute seriousness in that aspect anyway. Make no mistake, this is a commercial thriller and therefore, it does offer some clichés and some exaggerations. <br/><br/>Hurt by the recession and with their recent move to a small town from NYC, the Dunnes are having more than just financial struggles. Nick's inability to turnaround his career's slide frustrates Amy whereas the constant nagging by her draws him further away from their relationship. With his wife's disappearance, Nick's life not only takes a shocking turn but the constant limelight by the media and public makes it tremendously challenging for him to move on. However, Ben Affleck's brilliant performance doesn't let you determine Nick's sincerity in the scenario. Underneath all the charm and innocence, is there truly a motivated killer or is there another side to the story? Amy's sincere narrative quickly draws the viewer's empathy and Rosamund Pike's sincere portrayal of this smart and beautiful writer is delightful to watch. She undergoes transitions both emotionally and physically through the storyline which is yet another portrayal of her commitment to the character. The supporting cast has some notable performances which include that of Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's creepy first boyfriend, Carrie Coon as Nick's extremely supportive twin and Kim Dickens as the lead detective whose systematic approach to the case requires her to be stern yet thoughtful as the mystery unravels. But with a commanding portrayal of the central character, Rosamund Pike leaves the lasting impression of surprise and delight about such underrated talent. <br/><br/>Apart from being a psychologically manipulative thriller, 'Gone Girl' is actually quite an entertainer. There are amusing moments that play in satirical fashion especially when the media and public are overly concerned about missing Amy and how soon they begin to judge Nick's involvement in the disappearance. Then there's Pike's performance that showcases Amy's quick-wit that gently leads to dark humor. While the film maybe a tad bit long, it doesn't lose its grip over your intrigue and that must be attributed to the adroitly written novel and screenplay by Gillian Flynn. 'Gone Girl' may not be an Academy Award contender nor will it make superhero kind of money at the box-office but after a long time, it will be the movie that thoroughly entertained with its darkness, wit and sincere performances. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.232 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"eonbluedan-1","9","0","6","29 October 2014"," Dark, twisted, gleeful fun, which leaves you food for thought
","How does one discuss a movie that is essentially a minefield of spoilers? It is the case with most thrillers that we do not reveal its big twists and turns, but in the case of 'Gone Girl', talking about anything beyond the setup could ruin it! You want to make a point about something that feels so insignificant to you, only to catch yourself, realising you're about to tarnish it for the uninitiated, for whom every ""little"" thing is going to seem pretty huge. Still, I'll give a shot. <br/><br/>Nick Dunne arrives home on his fifth wedding anniversary to find his wife Amy missing, with signs of a a violent struggle the only truly concerning clue as to what may have happened. The investigation starts out normally enough, but as the news frenzy begins and media-unfriendly Nick's response is put under the microscope, he finds himself many people's number one suspect. We assume we have seen this setup before, and we think it is going to simply be a case of did he, didn't he? We might even start to make up our own minds. And then 'Gone Girl' pulls out some unexpected guns, twisting and morphing as it goes, from domestic drama through thriller to twisted satire, playing games of which Hitchcock may have been jealous (there are more than a few shades of 'Vertigo' and 'Strangers On A Train' here).<br/><br/>Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross return for a third collaboration with director David Fincher. Their score slips by almost unnoticed to begin with; it is a gentle, calm serenade. Then, as author Gillian Flynn's tale reveals itself to be one in which nothing is as it seems, their music rots from the inside out, moving from barely noted serenity to unmissable static and electronic crunching, poisoning the scenes with further tension. I don't know that it has the same uncomfortable power as 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', but it is nevertheless precisely what the film needs. <br/><br/>Fincher is now famous for his precise eye, making every frame a painting, and here there is no exception. His dedicated fans will note a lack off flash in the first 90 minutes or so, with the director allowing the story and characters to calmly take the lead; or course we recognise this is intentional. Wait for the final hour and you'll see the man who made 'Panic Room' let rip! Film students would have a great time examining the change; all aesthetics here serve the story. It is fair to say it is a little too long for its own good; certainly there is trimming that could be performed at the front end of the film, but once it gets into the right gear, it really does not loosen its grip.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has taken a lot of flack in the past, and perhaps this puts him in a perfect spot to play Nick, the everyman who is long passed the point of even trying to be perfect, and now suffering a quite unforgiving public scrutiny. England's own Rosamund Pike plays his ""Amazing Amy"", the cool girl who secretly knows she never quite lived up to the character her parents modelled after her, forging a lucrative book series. Pike may well win a Best Actress Oscar and that is all you need to know. There are other notable turns in the film, but one that has not been praised quite enough is Carrie Coon, playing Margo, Nick's sometimes suffering sister. If anything, she doesn't have enough screen time to develop as much as you would like to see; her performance is riveting and I would have liked more of the chemistry she brought. Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris both surprise with the material they have, although in both cases, more character meat would have been welcome.<br/><br/>Those who have already read the book by the time they see 'Gone Girl' will be pleasantly surprised by just how loyal screenwriter Flynn is to her own novel, and many, like me, may also be happy to see that the final act, somewhat tough to buy on the page, becomes a different animal under David Fincher's careful direction. His gear shifts are so clear and concise, the viewer is in little doubt about the terrain of each act, and the final section of the movie takes what was, for me, a questionable set of circumstances and character motivations, and then turns them into something altogether more dark, chilling and bitingly satirical; in this context, it somehow just works better! Those who might raise questions about elements I cannot mention here (this is getting silly!), or the ""unsatisfying nature of the finale"" may have missed one of the various points the story is out to make. They might also do well to remember that David Fincher has a penchant for the atypical, non-Hollywood ending; if 'Se7en', 'Zodiac' and 'The Social Network' left you pining for endings that were more ""Hollywood hero"", climactic and conclusive respectively...then perhaps 'Gone Girl' isn't for you either. You are warned.<br/><br/>I did consider what it would have been like had I NOT read the book beforehand and came to this conclusion: You get to experience this story once fully, and after that once, it will never have the same impact. If you choose to read it first, you will admire the movie's smarts; if you choose to watch the film first, you are likely to have one of the most gleefully discombobulating cinema experiences you'll have had for a long time! Of course, I wish I could say more, but as you know, I can't. Bottom line is this: Love or hate Fincher, there is no questioning his craft or the fact this is one of his best moments. Whether you love or hate 'Gone Girl', there is no denying it is one of the most audacious, carefully crafted, if not, in your opinion, best films of the year."

Inside a building shots seemed very ""dimmed down"" as was all outside shots, whether at noon, morning or evening. Maybe it was me but did anyone else experience this? The best way to explain it was as though a filter was used on the same camera on all shots all the time. I noticed it so bad that I felt tired just a few minutes into the movie.

","Spoilers for sure. This is for people who've already seen the film and who want to hear about other reactions to the ending.

(Also, wouldn't the victims cameras have picked up on Pike's moves as she faked the rape using the spilled wine and wine bottle?) There's no proof his car was ever nearby, and no one seems to be curious enough about where the blood came from that was on her kitchen back home. Why weren't they curious about all the items in the shed that weren't used. Who buys golf clubs and never unwraps them? Other reviewers have talked about the half-hearted attempt to burn the diary. My problem, even if the police and FBI were incompetent about investigating her killing of her ex . . . . is why Afleck stays with her. She has no soul and he can't stand her. He's going to throw away the next eighteen years to be with this soulless maniac because she has used his sperm to impregnate herself? He's going to save the kid? Fat chance. That kid will be witness to one of the worst marriages in history. He will grow up with no evidence that families are a place where there is warmth and love. Good luck with that. And anyway, I just don't buy that Afleck's character could put up with her for that long. He hates her. He has her pegged as a sociopath. How can he throw his entire life away like that?

Now, in such cases, I'm never sure whether it is better to see the film first or read the book first. In the end, it comes down to an accident of timing. When you read a novel, you don't know if it will be made into a film; when a film is released, it is too late to read the novel first if you want to see the movie at the cinema. So I haven't read the novel and, in this case, the film screenplay - although written by the author herself Gillian Flynn - apparently has a different ending, so go figure. <br/><br/>Nick and Amy Dunne - played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike - have had to relocate from New York to Missouri and have now been married exactly five years, but this is the anniversary from hell when the girl goes and the revelations crash one upon another. <br/><br/>We always knew from as early as ""Good Will Hunting"" that, given a decent role, Affleck can act and this movie cements his return from mediocrity announced by ""Argo"". English girl Pike first came to our attention as a Bond girl in ""Die Another Day"", but always had more to offer and she is simply brilliant as the glacial beauty who calls to mind the main female characters in both ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Fatal Attraction"". The movie has somehow been classed as both feminist and misogynist, but what is undeniable is that it offers a strong and complex central female role and that is all too rare in cinema. <br/><br/>Nick moans: ""Yes, I loved you and then all we did was resent each other, try to control each other. We caused each other pain."" Amy replies: ""That's marriage."" But this is not your usual marriage and just how unusual becomes ever clearer up until the final moments and for two and a half hours one is mesmerised by the descent into horror. Director David Finch, who shocked us with ""Seven"" and mystified us with ""The Game"", has produced a terrific thriller than I will certainty see again. And I guess I'll have to read the book too."

","David Fincher is David Fincher and in my eyes he can do no wrong (because cinematically speaking he simply never does). Gillian Flynn's book got intense reactions out of its readers. It's a type of story that people either loved or hated and I have a feeling the same will happen with the film. I loved the book but I loved the movie just as much. This ended up being one of those rare situations in which I really did not mind changes made to the story - I think it has a lot to do with the fact that it was the writer herself who was adapting the book and that's probably why the changes did not take away from the impact of the story.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for the faint of heart. If you are squeamish give it a pass. If you are a fan of David Fincher's work, you simply cannot pass up the chance to enjoy the fruits of his artistic labor. Fincher's understated style puts even more focus on the dark elements of the story about a love story gone wrong. Rosamund Pike finally got an opportunity to shine as an actress in a main role and it was about time. (and I think Ben Affleck was really great in a role of the husband) If you loved the book do not hesitate to see the film - David Fincher really manage to do justice to this beautifully twisted story."

"samcatraz","9","0","7","22 October 2014"," Gone Girl - very good but ending so-so
","Very few films have the capability of keeping me awake for more than two hours. And sometimes, it's even less than two hours. Gone Girl, just like the trilogy of the Dark Knight, is one of those films: it's much longer than it appears to be. Peter Jackson should take note. Seriously, I never got to the end of a Peter Jackson movie.<br/><br/>Anyways, ""Gone Girl""'s plot is excellent and its atmosphere made me think of that of Prisoners (2013). Where things get spoiled a little, it's in the last 30 minutes or so, when Amy begins a new life with Desy. I would have stopped the movie at that very moment. But I think the authors have their reasons. They clearly wanted:<br/><br/>1.To show how Amy had everything planned. Yes, her plan even provided her with a way out, in case she wanted to come back with Nick! 2. To prove that Amy is 100% bananas (and not just 50%)<br/><br/>I found interesting the way the movie shows how public opinion is important in huge trials and how, at the same time, it is so easily influenced. Overnight, following his staged interview, everybody loved Nick just because he managed to make a very good impression. We ultimately realize that law, which is supposed to govern our society, has now been replaced by pure marketing, where the defendant's lawyer (more of a PR expert, that is!) tries to sell the public Nick's innocence. That was well done.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good movie, but with an end a little below the standards it has initially set.<br/><br/>9/10"
"adamscastlevania2","8","0","7","22 October 2014"," Not perfect, but still a fine mystery
","(73%) More or less a modern day remake/re-imagining of Alfred Hitchcock's 1941 ""Suspicion"", with weirdly issues surrounding the ending for each of them not quite holding water. This is at the very least one of the better mystery movies of the year, with pretty perfect direction, very strong performances from the all sections of the cast, and a script that keeps you guessing for most of its quite epic run time. By the time of the last quarter the plot has tied itself into such a tight web that quite large amounts of implausibility is needed to continue its way onwards to the quite abrupt feeling ending. All in all though this is a finely made suspense filled hit that deserves attention."
"randbish","6","0","10","22 October 2014"," Fincher, Flynn, Affleck, and Pike achieve Mediocrity
","Is David Fincher a ""great"" film director? Certainly, he has created much more excellent cinema than bad. THE SOCIAL NETWORK, FIGHT CLUB, and GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, in my opinion, achieving excellence; BENJAMIN BUTTON being a tiresome, pretentious bore. I would say that GONE GIRL lands somewhere in between. And ultimate blame for its disappointing mediocrity can be cast in multiple directions.<br/><br/>Fincher's GONE GIRL falls far short of achieving the deliciously devious tension of the novel. The book's seductive structure, dual point of view, and Gillian Flynn's fearless spelunking into the darkest predispositions of her characters make for huge challenges to the already daunting task of adapting a novel for the screen. And, more often than not, the novelist is not the best man for the job. Hands down, the all time champ was William Goldman. John Irving swung and whiffed more than a few times before finally hitting a grand slam with CIDER HOUSE RULES. Ms. Flynn was able to cleverly condense her thick, unhurried tome into a taut 140 pages. I'll give her that.<br/><br/>Alas, however, a more skilled, experienced screenwriter might have delivered more bang for the page. Aaron Sorkin, for instance, was able to take much less compelling source material and make THE SOCIAL NETWORK into a far more compelling film-viewing experience. So, it seems that director Fincher was somewhat handcuffed, short changed from the get-go. And, if it ain't on the page... (I know. Alert the Cliché Police!) Nuff said on that theme.<br/><br/>But please tell me this: how was Fincher unable to evoke a convincing — or even interesting — performance from Ben Affleck? Flynn's Nick Dunne is a Mama's boy, who constantly defaults to charm-offense mode to overcome his innate un-likability. Affleck sulks through this film in one robotic, unappealing gear. Only in his interactions with Carrie Coon, in an excellent portrayal of twin sister Margo, does Affleck pump any real blood into his Nick.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film belongs to the character of Amy — a role that should be as memorable as Glenn Close's whacked-out Alex Forest in FATAL ATTRACTION or Sharon Stone's diabolical Catherine Tramel in BASIC INSTINCT. The novel's Amy is a narcissistic psychopath, who picks away page-by-page at the reader's belief in the goodness of mankind. Rosamund Pike's Amy mumbles sleepily through the first half of the film. Thus, we are not manipulated, as we should be, into loving her. So, when she finally reveals her true nature, it fails to evoke the necessary gasp on which the entire story turns.<br/><br/>Also, Pike's performance doesn't adequately reveal how Amy's parents turned their daughter into a resentful monster by exploiting her childhood in their wildly popular Amazing Amy book series, only to add insult to injury by taking back the endowment she feels was minimum compensation at best for their plagiarizing her life.<br/><br/>Even Trent Reznor's musical contributions seemed paint-by-numbers. These repetitious, droney, dissonant crescendos that end abruptly at every other scene change only amount to vain, noisy attempts to create tension that wasn't already on the screen. One would think that Reznor might offer composition with more nuance and less noise — as he did so superbly with his SOCIAL NETWORK score.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike has a visage for the ages. Ben Affleck is a man of varied and substantial talents. David Fincher is one of contemporary cinema's most capable directors. Gillian Flynn is a splendid storyteller with an original voice. GONE GIRL should have been one of the most stunning shockers of recent years. Just goes to show, even with a top-notch team, somehow the sum of the parts can total less than the parts themselves."
"MovieCriticNextDoor","6","0","10","22 October 2014"," Interesting experiment, frustrating ending
","Ben Affleck playing a sociopath usually works out all right, and this movie was no exception. When he doesn't have to try to show normal human emotion I like him a lot better, much like Keanu Reeves. As it turns out, what I should have been worried about was the editing, or maybe it was just that Gillian Flynn, the author of the novel this is based on and who also wrote the screenplay, wouldn't let anyone edit anything out.<br/><br/>So good old Ben (State of Play), here playing Nick Dunne, is married to Amy (Rosamund Pike, The World's End). They've had some tough times, but they're pretty much the perfect couple, except of course that can't be true. Amy's diary entries show a relationship that's slowly crumbling under the weight of money troubles and Nick's temper, and I'm sure his wandering eye doesn't help, either. Of course, Amy's a bit messed up herself -- her mother made a fortune writing kids' books about Amazing Amy, based on her daughter, which sounds sweet until you realize that the character was always better at everything than the actual girl. No psychological trauma there.<br/><br/>Anyway, on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick returns home from an early-morning jaunt to the bar he and his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) own to discover that Amy is gone and there are signs of a struggle in the living room. At first more confused than worried, Nick calls the police, and Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens, Deadwood) arrives on the scene, with latex glove on one hand and the other perpetually clutching a coffee cup.<br/><br/>Things soon start turning ugly for Nick, who after all can't really manage to show any normal human emotion, and that looks bad when foul play is suspected in the disappearance of one's spouse. Officer Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) is all set to string Nick up right away, but Rhonda (I refuse to call her that other awful name) is less sure. This is the first sign of a fairly serious flaw in the film: much of it rests on the huge assumption that any (male) law enforcement officer instantly forgets all his training the moment he's confronted with a pretty woman in distress. If you're relying on that sort of thing, there's something seriously wrong with your plot.<br/><br/>As more pieces of the puzzle are revealed, Nick eventually gets a high-priced, high profile lawyer on his side named Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry, Alex Cross), who doesn't get to do much except chuckle over the mess Nick has gotten himself into. That's less cruel than it sounds, or at least I hope it is, because I wanted to giggle a little myself. Nick is very predictable, you see, and that's where most of the trouble comes from.<br/><br/>I'm a little torn on a rating. While I was interested to see how it turned out, by the time we finished hour two I really, really wanted it to be over already. And then at the end, everyone is basically right back where they started, except slightly worse off. Someone online called the second half a very black comedy, but I don't think that's right because I normally like dark comedy and this just didn't do a whole lot for me. So I think I'll have to go against the trend a little and give it three and a quarter out of five. It was overall an interesting experiment, but not entirely effective. I might have considered three and a half, but I docked it a quarter on behalf of male law enforcement officers everywhere."
"jamillah2","6","0","10","20 October 2014"," Loved the book
","As a huge fan of the book I was worried the movie wouldn't live up to it. Fortunately, they did a pretty good job capturing the general tone of the book and how absolutely crazy Amy is. The movie was much kinder in its portrayal of Nick than the book. It ended with me feeling kind of bad for him vs when I finished the book I thought of him as a spoiled narcissistic ""Man-child"" who by staying with Amy would thankfully not mess up the life of an unassuming nice girl. The idea of NPH playing Desi was great casting but the movie didn't really show how psychotic he was. In the movie, it was nice to actually Amy play out her escape plan from him as well as her initial disappearance vs in the book when they were referenced as things done in the past. To those who haven't read the book, I hope they enjoyed the surprises as they were revealed! I was in shock as I read! All-in-all, it was nice to visually experience and enjoy that wild story."
"vagues-vagues","7","0","9","16 October 2014"," A thought provoking as well as emotion provoking movie
","The last movie I saw was 'Gone Girl'. The movie dealt with the unorthodox relationship of a couple and illustrated how relationships are perceived from the inside and outside. In summary, the dynamics within the couple were utterly different in comparison to public's perception. The movie begins by describing a somewhat health and cute relationship, with only a few red flags and as the story unravels a disturbing, rotten reality is revealed.<br/><br/>All leading actors in the movie performed well, without any extraordinary performances. Casting was very accurate as the actors impersonated very well the characters in the movie. Mostly I was impressed by Rosamund Pike, as I was not familiar with her work. Ben Affleck's solid performance incited emotions of empathy as well as indifference. Both leading roles were quite controversial; the psychopath wife who plays God vs the woman who gets cheated on: appalling vs relatable. Along with the cleating-low lifer husband vs the victim: disgust vs sympathy.<br/><br/>In general, Gone Girl is a thought provoking as well as emotion provoking movie. The multidimensionality of the characters renders it inevitable to relate with them on some level. In addition, the interplay between reality and fiction throughout the movie grasps the attention of the viewer and enrols him/her on an emotional roller coaster. David Fincher has directed one more movie that is here to stay. His track record of epic movies automatically raises viewer expectations. Yet in my opinion these high expectations are the reason I did not come out of the theatre extremely impressed. When one awaits to be amazed it is hard for any production to deliver!"
"TheSquiss","8","0","6","16 October 2014"," Fincher's adaptation of Flynn's novel enthrals and engrosses. Just don't get ideas.
","On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) arrives home to find signs of a struggle and that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), is missing. The police are suspicious because it looks all too convenient and there seems to be more to it than Nick is letting on. Nick's portrayal of a blissful marriage is a little frayed around the edges and he is facing a trial by media. Is the woman who, as a child, inspired her parents' Amazing Amy stories and became America's darling, really missing or did secretive Nick murder her? <br/><br/>Adapted by Gillian Flynn from her own bestseller, Gone Girl is quite simply a triumph. I read the novel a year ago and it quickly ranked as my book of the month. As I wrote at the time, I saw much of the plot twists and turns a mile off but it was so well crafted that it did little to spoil the enjoyment. Inevitably, sitting in a dark cinema, I knew exactly what was coming but, again, the pleasure of watching it unfold before me was complete, if a churning stomach and the vague feeling of sickening dread is enjoyment.<br/><br/>When the author of the source material writes a film adaptation, there is no excuse for clumsy changes and Flynn has avoided them, staying remarkable true to her novel. Because of this, it jars all the more that Gone Girl is rated 18. The novel didn't require it and the film earns it probably due to a brief exchange of particularly harsh sexual expletives that Flynn has thrown in to guarantee the adult rating. It was a decent enough thriller without the needless, very self-conscious step and I rather suspect the hand of director David Fincher in this.<br/><br/>It is a small quibble (along with the character who appears to have ballooned in the space of just a few days) in what is yet another exceptionally fine film from the ever-reliable Fincher. He knows how to wring out the suspense and ramp up the anticipation, almost causing the viewer to yell at the screen ""What the?"" <br/><br/>Gone Girl is situation horror at its finest. While unlikely to happen to us, Flynn has devised a plot that is plausible enough to scare the heck out of us and Fincher takes the situation and pummels us with it so that we feel utterly powerless. My cinema viewing has taken a hit in the past few months (paying the rent while publishing a book can do that to you) and it was fantastic to find myself completely immersed in a film again.<br/><br/>The resurrection of Ben Affleck is complete. After the dark years of Beniffer, Holywoodland reassured the few who watched it, The Town and Argo stamped his credibility across the globe and Gone Girl places him firmly back in the A-list of leading men. It is a creditable performance as a man lost in the quagmire of hidden truths, dark lies and bending under the weight of judgment and persecution from the police, the public, the media and even his family.<br/><br/>Whilst Rosamund Pike absolutely holds her own and her star is slowly ascending (after the likes of A Long Way Down, The World's End and Jack Reacher), I'm still not entirely sure about her performance. This is a better performance and a far better film the afore mentioned, but the variation in her Amy just isn't there. As her arc (told frequently in flashback) develops, so should our understanding of her but from their first meeting, at a party, I found myself asking what Nick saw in her. She doesn't come across as terribly genuine or particularly pleasant and yet Nick is bowled over by her.<br/><br/>That said, as Gone Girl progresses and we see and learn more, Pike convinces more completely and her interaction with the obsessive old flame, Desi (Neil Patrick Harris), is enough to unnerve and, eventually, cause temporary revulsion.<br/><br/>At a little under two and a half hours, Gone Girl flows rapidly and smoothly, consuming the minutes while it thoroughly engrosses the viewer. It was one of the most imaginative novels of 2012 and is sure to be regarded as one of the most enthralling films of this year.<br/><br/>But perhaps think twice before taking your spouse. S/he just might get ideas.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","Nick and Amy Dunne seemed to have the perfect marriage. Amy is a writer, worth millions and well known for the ""Amazing Amy"" series she writes, an embellished tale of her life as a young girl. Amy is married to the love of her life. But her seemingly perfect marriage begins to unravel when Nick's relative becomes ill, forcing an unwilling Amy to give up her posh NY lifestyle so that the couple can move to the small town of Carthage, Missouri to help his family. Amy becomes further perturbed when both she and Nick lose their jobs and she discovers shortly before their fifth wedding anniversary that he is having an affair with a young college student. A distraught Amy then hatches a brilliantly twisted plan: to disappear, commit suicide, and frame her husband for her murder. Unfortunately, what should be the best part of the story comes out less brilliant and more banal, highly convoluted and overdone despite a nearly immaculate performance by lead actors Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Amy reveals a highly paranoid fear that Nick may kill her in lengthy journals that are later revealed to be mostly fake. She turns their anniversary clue game into another opportunity to frame him, forcing Nick and his sister Margo, along with Nick's lawyer, Tanner Bolt, to find Amy before they run out of time. As they search, Amy escapes, taking on a new identity. In the end, Amy meets her match in a former love, Desi Collings, whose obsessive feelings for Amy frighten her so much that she kills him in order to escape, faking the story of a captive rape victim to endear herself to the public even more and allowing her to return to Nick. A worthwhile thrill ride, one has to admit that most of Gone Girl will leave the watcher shaking his or her head."
"guchrisc","Null","0","7","13 October 2014"," Amazing Amy and her horrible husband.
","This Twentieth Century Fox film was directed by David Fincher, who has previously directed 'Se7en' (1995), 'The Game' (1997), 'Fight Club' (1999) and 'Panic Room' (2002).<br/><br/>This reviewer, having seen the trailer, thought that the plot about a man whose wife goes missing, offered nothing new. Planning not to watch it, I was advised instead to go and see it.<br/><br/>Gillian Flynn wrote both the novel and the screenplay. New Orleans born Reese Witherspoon, seen in the recent 'Mud' (2012), is a producer. The film is partially set in southern USA.<br/><br/>Film opens with some slow scenes, which are often very yellowy in colour, the music is rather intrusive, the male and female leads are both rather bland and uninteresting. Thus these early scenes in the first-half of the film, did not fill me with confidence.<br/><br/>Having seen the trailer, and been put off by it, when I decided to go, I looked at the plot of the missing wife, looked at the possible scenarios, and made my call. About half-way through the film, I realized that I had called it right. However, dear reader, I had been lulled into a false sense of security. This was merely the starting point, as the film then went off in different directions. Nothing less should have been expected from Director David Fincher, and this film is on a par with his previous work, so prepare for the earlier blandness to give way to complexity.<br/><br/>The plot has the husband Nick Dunne, played by Ben Affleck, returning home to find his wife missing. He calls the police and a search gets under way. At first kidnap is suspected, but later husband Nick is suspected of murdering his own wife. The wife Amy is played by London-born Rosamund Pike. Whilst both start with rather bland performances, which I now realize must have been deliberate, as the complexity develops, so too does their acting. Mr Affleck has given great performances in 'Argo' (2012), in 2009 in 'He's Just Not That Into You' and 'State of Play', and in 1997 in 'Good Will Hunting' and by strange coincidence was also in a film called 'Chasing Amy'.<br/><br/>Neil Patrick Harris of the 'How I Met Your Mother' TV series has a small part. So too does Tyler Perry, another New Orleans-born actor, who reminded me of Seinfeld's Phil Morris playing Jackie Chiles, who is a parody of the real-life Johnny Cochran. While not as funny as the Jackie Chiles character, Mr Perry's character is entertaining whilst also convincing. Mr Perry's 2012 'Alex Cross' was also convincing but that film was spoilt by poor action scenes.<br/><br/>Whilst good performances were given by both Mr Harris and Mr Perry, 'Gone Girl' has some really good and strong female characters. Kim Dickens, Lola Kirke, Casey Wilson, and Emily Ratajkowski who is another London-born actress, all gave good performances. However, for me, the stand-out performance of the film was from Carrie Coon, who plays a sister. Her acting was utterly convincing throughout the film. The interaction between the siblings was also totally believable and realistic.<br/><br/>The 'Gone Girl' game-plan, like that Brad Pitt thought he had in 'Se7en', like that Michael Douglas thought he had in 'The Game', is not what it seems. For once the trailers show you what you are expecting to see, then the film twists your preconceptions like a pretzel.<br/><br/>Film contains a fair bit of sexual and violent content, and plenty of blood, hence it's UK 18 rating, but also a spot of humour that the audience enjoyed too.<br/><br/>If you have enjoyed the work mentioned previously of actor Ben Affleck and Director David Fincher, then 'Gone Girl', despite a slightly bland title, is an entertaining and exciting film, on a par with their previous work, and thus well worth seeing. 8/10."
"sprickety","Null","0","4","13 October 2014"," What have we done to each other? What are we going to do?
","Returning to cinema after an excursion into TV's House of Cards, David Fincher tackles another adaptation of a literary smash hit. But whereas The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a misstep for Fincher, too long and slow without enough of a unique character to set it apart from the Swedish original, Gone Girl is a resounding success. The murky, mysterious story is of a missing wife, a husband who doesn't seem to care enough and a diary revealing a marriage in free fall. It's about lies and perception, the treatment of women and the expectations of men, and the dark side of modern marriage. To say anything more would begin to spoil the tightly constructed plot, adapted from her own novel by Gillian Flynn. Authors adapting their own works is rare but on this evidence I'd like to see it more often: Flynn manages to compress her complex book into a screenplay without losing anything of importance, and keeping the strong characters and their hidden motivations intact, while Fincher keeps the pace smooth, the plot intriguing and the mood consistent for a full 2 and a half hours. This owes much to his usual team of cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, editor Kirk Baxter and in particular composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Cronenweth's visuals are crisp and confident and Reznor and Ross continue to prove themselves as the best composer in Hollywood today; creepy, ominous, melodic and occasionally bursting into electronic mayhem. Ben Affleck, Tyler Perry (who can do serious surprisingly well, although he still provides several much needed moments of comic relief) and Carrie Coon put in good performances, but the film's greatest success lies is in Rosamund Pike's turn as Amy. Utterly devastating. I could write for paragraphs about her performance, but it's almost impossible to discuss without giving anything away. All I will say is it's going to take something outstanding to take the Oscar away from her. If nothing else, go see this for her.<br/><br/>If the film has flaws, though, it's in two supporting characters who, removed of the novel's back stories, come across as shallow; ideas to drive the narrative forward rather than real people. It would be a sin to reveal who these people are due to their importance to the plot; but they are played - not badly, incidentally, just poor characters - by Neil Patrick Harris and Emily Ratjakowski. The former also tips the plot into absurdity in the third act, with events that make more sense on the page than on screen. Under a lesser director this could derail the film but Fincher sweeps the viewer along with such verve, power and excitement that you aren't even given the chance to question or doubt. Gone Girl confirms he's one of the greatest directors working today."

","The story falls-prey to romance-novel clichés. Pikes character isn't exactly sympathetic or a heroine, but she's still a bit of a Mary-Sue. She's rich and beautiful and brilliant, and her main struggle is that of living in a gilded cage. Her romance with the male lead is twisted but still portrayed as genuine, a psychological kind of S&M. I am sure someone will read this and scoff and think ""it's a satire that plays off of the clichés!"" Yeah.... no, that's a cop-out.<br/><br/>There's this bizarre emphasis on appearances and ""what do people think?

It didn't make sense and rubbed its depressing-ness in your face. It had this theme of ""things suck but they have to end this way because... because... society"". (Because the writer had little imagination.) What the couple goes through is nuanced food for thought about gender relations. The writer gives an unbiased portrayal of how heterosexual gender roles play out. In a way it is a little bit too unbiased, extremists will read into the movie the way they want to, I see it already with online discussions of the movie.<br/><br/>At the time watching it, the movie was very entertaining, I couldn't wait what to see what would happen next. The suspense and action builds and flows well. But in hindsight, it was sort of a letdown. The characters are all kind of weak and inconsistent when you get down to it. For example, Pike's character is supposed to be so smart and ambitious, but when the movie tries to prove it the evidence is much weaker than the writer seems to think it is. (Imagine you had a movie about a man who's supposed to be ridiculously strong.... Everyone talks about how strong he is! Then he comes on screen and they show him... carrying several bags of groceries as evidence of how strong he is. It was like that...) <br/><br/>And so in conclusion, I do recommend watching this movie. I hesitate to call it original, it's more like an original combination of familiar themes. It keeps you watching and makes you think a little."

The face expressions are just too.....amazing. Subtle, yet expressive. One of the few movies I would actually recommend people to watch this year. IF you haven't seen it, PLEASE GO NOW. This movie will blow your mind away. Every scene is gold, and you would miss out important plots if you miss one of the scenes. Ben Affleck was really amazing as well."
"MattBrady099","9","0","10","12 October 2014"," David Fincher is a true master class of directing.
","Amy Dunne: ""This man might honestly,truly kill me"". <br/><br/>The story is about Nick Dunne, as he finds out his wife has gone missing. As increasing police and media pressure mount, the facade of a loving and blissful union crumbles and amidst the lies and behavior of Nick, the question remains - did he kill her?<br/><br/>I have to say that David Fincher is a true master class of directing, because Gone girl is one of the best films of this year. Ben Affleck was perfect for this role, because Ben Affleck through out his career had a lot of hate from the media and the critics that mostly slammed him in every role that he was in. And that's why he was outstanding in this movie. Rosamund Pike acting in this film was pure brilliant and spectacular. She was so good in this role she might get a Oscar nomination for this. Tyler Perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because Mr. Perry was in such awful films like: MADEA trilogy, Alex cross and the list goes on. But in this movie he did good.<br/><br/>What this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining they lives. Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly. <br/><br/>My only problem with this movie is Neil Patrick Harris character. Now let me just say that Neil Patrick Harris wasn't terrible in the movie, but his character to me slowed the film down for me. Overall Gone Girl is a fantastic film and it's the movie to see."
"ardahanapaydin449","10","0","10","12 October 2014"," Definitely have to take some Oscars
","I really want to say that in my opinion David Fincher made one of the best movies of 2014. ""Gone Girl"" is a very good movie for almost in every way. Also I can easily compare this movie with one of the best movies of Fincher 'Se7en'.<br/><br/>If we want to talk about acting performances Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and also Neil Patrick Harris did really great job. Specially Rosamund Pike definitely deserves an Oscar. Before that Fincher was nominated to Oscars two times for 'The Social Network' and 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'. I think he must get an Oscar for his amazing work in 'Gone Girl'. The cinematographer of the movie Jeff Cronenwth did a great job too. I expect a nomination from Oscars to him also.<br/><br/>Lastly I think astonishing director, after all of his astonishing works which started with 'Se7en' continues with masterpieces such as 'The Game', 'Fight Club', 'Panic Room', 'Zodiac', 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', 'The Social Network', 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' created a movie that everybody will remember as 'A Fincher Movie'. I highly recommend the 'Gone Girl'."

","If you like good suspense movies you'll love this one. The movie starts with Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) driving to a bar. When he comes back home he sees his living room destroyed. He then realizes his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. Everybody starts thinking Nick killed his wife, media starts accusing him and police start to find evidence that Nick killed his wife. The story starts to get complicated and there are a few twists that will blow your mind.<br/><br/>David Fincher directed this movie (he also directed Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network) and Gillian Flynn wrote the amazing script adapted from the novel she published back in 2012. Fincher was able to tell the complex story very well. He also mixed the two points of view, Amy's and Nick's, and that was very cool. I liked Fincher's past films so I had a good feeling about this movie, and I wasn't disappointed. Gone Girl is full of exciting plot twists and unexpected scenes that make the movie super crazy. It's pretty long (about 2 hours and a half) but it feels shorter than that.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful. Ben Affleck did a great job on this movie and Rosamund Pike too. Rosamund's performance as Amy was stunning. The character she was playing is a very difficult one and she did it incredibly well. I can't say a lot since I'll probably spoil a little bit the movie, but her performance will keep you on the edge of your seat. Ben Affleck's acting is also great. You can see Nick and Amy's marriage wasn't going well when you watch Nick's reaction when he arrives home and notices his living room is destroyed and his wife missing.<br/><br/>The shots are beautiful and the soundtrack, made by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, matches every scene perfectly. The music is very intense at certain times which makes the movie even more interesting.<br/><br/>If you like good suspense movies, you should definitely go check this one out."
"PipAndSqueak","7","0","9","12 October 2014"," Flawed but engaging crime tale
","Early on in this film, especially if you are really paying attention, you get notice that the story has been augmented in order for it to 'work'. The story, in fact, is extremely flawed with some absolute howlers of action/incident that are just too far fetched to be given 'benefit of the doubt'. However, these flaws do allow you to pick through the story to your own conclusions. Yes, there is a shocking and perhaps surprising development in the middle. You don't spot this because the character involved is portrayed as a 'desirable' type with looks and money. This is another of the incoherent motes in this tale. My feeling is that the story would be more realistic if the genders of the two protagonists were reversed. As it stands, the hardest flaw to reconcile is why the Ben Affleck character doesn't just up sticks and leave? Why was he sticking around to reach an anniversary date to deliver the bad 'news'? Lots of hype around this movie, join the crowd of chatterers if you want because you'll need something to justify the two hours plus needed to watch it."

","'GONE GIRL': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Dark Comedy/Mystery Thriller flick directed by David Fincher and based on the 2012 book (of the same name) by Gillian Flynn; who also wrote the screenplay. It stars Ben Affleck; as a bar owner who becomes the center of a media circus, when he's suspected of killing his missing wife. The film costars Rosamund Pike (as the missing wife), Kim Dickens, Carrie Coon, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Patrick Fugit and Missi Pyle (doing an impressive Nancy Grace impersonation). I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons, but the movie is a masterpiece!<br/><br/>Affleck plays Nick Dunne; the co-owner of a bar (cleverly titled 'The Bar') he owns with his sister Margo (Coon). Nick has been unhappily married, to Amy Elliott-Dunne (Pike), for sometime and on their fifth wedding anniversary he comes home to find their house ransacked and her missing. A media storm arises as an intense missing person search begins. Things become even more stressful (and nightmarish) when the police investigating the case, Detectives Rhonda Boney (Dickens) and Jim Gilpin (Fugit), consider Nick the prime suspect of his wife's disappearance (and likely her murder). The narrative begins to change, even more, as flashback scenes are revealed; from Amy's point of view.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of David Fincher and this is definitely one of his better movies. It's not just his flawless stylized directing though, that makes the film work so well, there's also a great story too (like all of his work); filled with nonstop twists and incredibly clever dialogue. There's also an awesome score, once again by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (in their third collaboration with Fincher), and amazing acting. Affleck has never been better; I was already a huge fan of his but this movie should turn any haters out there (if not they're idiots). Pike also gives a mesmerizing, award worthy, performance and the supporting cast is impeccable. I couldn't possibly praise the film anymore! It is really dark and disturbing though, definitely not for everyone, and it kind of made me completely afraid of women (without giving away too much).

","The fall movie season is OFFICIALLY upon us, and what a way to start. A 2.5 hr riveting drama, character study, suspense film with twists and turns. A ""killer"" performance from Affleck and Pike, a great screen adaptation from the novel, a great score from Reznor, and some well-done creative liberties from Fincher make this one hard to not get into. It's hard to divulge much of the plot without giving anything away, but let's just say that I thought I was getting a straight forward story/murder mystery that would still be fun to watch but what the film turns into is much more. Nothing quite black or white, total curiosity of where the story is headed or what some of the character's will do truly makes is suspenseful, even if the suspense isn't always danger. This one is worth seeing twice for sure. Bring on the well done fall movies."
"davidfyfe99","Null","0","6","7 October 2014"," David Fincher back on form
","This is a critic proof film. And I don't mean that bad reviews will not hamper it's success, but that the way it is executed means that it is almost impossible to review in any kind of meaningful way without giving away gigantic plot details which will ruin a viewers enjoyment. This in itself is a great compliment, because the plot developments and the twists and turns in it are to a great degree what makes it such a good film.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, we are introduced to Nick Dunne, who seems an affable enough man, on his wedding anniversary. He goes to a bar in the middle of the day and has an exchange with the barmaid and we are not told what kind of relationship he and the barmaid have, which turns out to be a rather important one to the story. Nick tells the barmaid that it is the day of his and his wife's anniversary and there is a suggestion that the marriage is not an entirely happy one, but is anyone really happy in marriage? He is then called by one of his neighbours who informs him that he can see that the front door of his home is ajar. Nick thanks him and makes his way home, where he finds the open door, an overturned coffee table and a few other bits of what appear to be evidence of some sort of disturbance. There is no sign of his wife. Nick calls her name several times and she does not appear, we see the neighbour who alerted Nick to his open front door with an expression of concern on his face when he hears Nick calling for his wife. When Nick realises his wife is nowhere to be seen, he calls the police. The remainder of 'Gone Girl' is an absolutely spellbinding mystery-thriller, and handled with masterful brushstrokes by Mr. Fincher. I have been led to believe that the film follows the book fairly faithfully (I haven't read it), metronoming between Nick's ordeal with the media circus and his wife's diary and by extension flashbacks to how they met and their marriage story.<br/><br/>I think there are many reasons this film works so well, not the least of which is that Gillian Flynn adapted her own novel for it. Inspired casting plays a major role too. Ben Affleck has the exact sort of non-threatening good looks of a man caught up in circumstances he cannot apprehend or control, Rosamund Pike as the 'gone girl' is completely riveting, I believed every word she spoke, in fact, I would have believed that her dialogue was not rehearsed at all.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that, come Oscar nomination time, 'Gone Girl' will be recognized in adapted screenplay, actor, actress, writing and directing categories, and they will all be very well deserved.<br/><br/>One of my learned movie critic colleagues said of this film 'It knows what it is' and before I saw 'Gone Girl', I was not entirely clear that such a statement belonged in a movie review. After seeing it, I now believe I know what he meant and why he said it. I believe he said it because David Fincher has never been a director to follow audience led formulas, nor does he have a reputation for 'giving in' to test audiences and changing things after audience feedback and at the behest of studio executives. But this film is different. There doesn't seem to be any evidence of him considering audience expectations, but there is an element of formula here. Which is not to say that we see anything coming. Quite the contrary, this film takes a great many unexpected directions, but the way it is executed in itself can be considered formulaic. I want to be clear, the twists and turns here are delightfully revealed, but the very idea of twists and turns is in itself a bit formulaic. This is no criticism, but observation.<br/><br/>David Fincher has finally found a story that satisfies almost every aspect of his film-making urges, and the exuberance with which he tells this story is in every single frame."

","""Everyone told us and told us, marriage is hard work"". <br/><br/>Gone Girl is the one film that will embed itself permanently in your psyche. A bold statement, to say the least, but it is the only statement that comes close to describing the frightening physiological paradigm created by suspense maestro Divid Fincher. Emotionally charged, disturbed and at times simply terrifying, Fincher's analysis of what can go wrong with contemporary marriage is the ultimate battle of the sexes and search for answers; whether right, wrong, or completely unexpected.<br/><br/>An adaption of the widely sought-after 2012 novel by Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl paints a bloody portrait of battle between husband and wife Nick and Amy Dunne (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) that asks the question asked by many who've had a relationship fall apart before their eyes: how much do you really know about your partner?<br/><br/>Contrary to its appearance courtesy of the narratively manipulating and heavily contrived editing and fragmented storytelling, the real issues in Nick and Amy's marriage begin long before either of them even meet. Amy, who is introduced as the atypical yet very real trust-fund baby, lives most of her life steps behind her fictional alter-ego ""Amazing Amy"", a character in a children's series authored by her parents, Rand and Marybeth Elliot (David Clennon and Lisa Banes). Nick (Affleck) may very well portray himself as the perfect man. A writer for a men's magazine, Nick finds himself at a yuppie party in the lower-east side of Manhattan before bumping into Amy, where he charms his way into her heart by confessing how he thought quinoa was a type of fish. The two depart the party where Nick leads Amy behind a bakery, the air glistening with sugar flakes, until the moment he kisses the specs of refined white power off her lips, the two perfect lovers fall in love.<br/><br/>But like everything that seems too good too be true, their magic doesn't last. Both suffering in their relationship from the failed American economy and Nick's ailing mother, Nick must pick- up his picturesque wife and life in urban New York City, and relocate to his Mid-Western hometown of North Carthage, Missouri. With the passing of Nick's mother and his father's admittance to the local nursing home for treatment of his Alzheimer's, the couple is burdened with financial woes, prompting Nick and his quick-mouthed twin sister Margo (the fantastic Carrie Coon) to open a bar, perfectly named 'The Bar'. Coming home to Amy for their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick drives into his perfect ""McMansion"" home and ideal wife, only to find the cat on the driveway, a wide opened front door, and Amy no-where in sight.<br/><br/>While many will spoil so much of what the film has to offer, it is best you go into it with a completely untainted opinion regardless if you've read the novel or not. Fincher and Flynn offer a completely revitalized reincarnation of Flynn's novel with many layers, twists and turns, and most of all questions.<br/><br/>Fincher has given himself quite the reputation as a noble successor to Hitchcock, mastering the art of Hitchcockian thrillers and suspense. From Fight Club, to his highly stylized American interpretation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Fincher has become the most consistent American director working today. Staying true to his ominous and truly septic vision, faithfully collaborating with editor Kirk Baxter, cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and music with Oscar winners Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor, Fincher is a meticulously relevant cinematic auteur who knows how to deliver in a tonal, visual, and deep subliminal forum that has quickly become his signature. Trying to ignore big set pieces, he goes to the most basic scenes in all films: two people seated in a room having a conversation. Fincher's greatest cinematic tool is his focus on information, buried in the revelations between characters and their conflicts expressed in their dialogue. Exposition is his greatest asset, with drama driven by audience reaction to a character's divulgence of new information—and Gone Girl is a testament to this.<br/><br/>While Gone Girl becomes the most sadistic cinematic version of he-said/she-said outside the walls of a courtroom, the film is pillared perfectly by its cast as well as its crew. Ben Affleck's interpretation of Nick Dunne draws fine lines of empathy and calmness, as well as unhappiness and deception for his wife and the people in his mundane, quickly shattering life. Nick's character, charming throughout the first act of the film, like any other man, shares his concerns about marital life, self-image, and the mistakes he makes as a man and as a husband. Affleck has never been better; yet, the next Caped Crusader isn't the true runaway star of Gone Girl. <br/><br/>Pike, who has always given her best supporting big names like Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher, Carey Mulligan in An Education and Pierce Brosnan as 007 in Die Another Day, gives the performance of her lifetime as Amy Dunne. Amy is tormented, bored, and pushed to the threshold of her marriage and her dignity. While the narrative is presented through Nick, Amy herself and a journal she had conveniently written prior to the anniversary, show glimpses of a very scary, brooding monster housewife. Together with her husband, Amy is the ideal spouse. Once alone and given her space, Pike's submergence into the role brings chills to the very core of your spine in her portrayal of a wife who is capable of everything a woman thinks, but would never dare do. If Pike does not get award attention for her role as Amy this year, I don't know what will."

","With the release of Gone Girl, I found myself somewhat torn. You see, I am an avowed fan of David Fincher but the feedback I had received from those who have read the novel on which the film is based has been somewhat mixed. However, having kept my expectations in check, I can report that Gone Girl is good; very good in fact. There is no doubt that Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name is a hugely popular read and I guess I found it hard to reconcile such a populist text with the dark, moody aesthetic for which Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network) is so well regarded. However, clearly my concerns were unfounded as Flynn's story is exactly the type of story that Fincher films so well; morally bereft – but far from simplistic – characters who engage in all manner of dastardly behaviour, seemingly oblivious to the impact their actions may have on anybody else.<br/><br/>The first hour or so plays out very much like a typical police procedural. In fact, there were several moments where I expected Stabler and Benson to arrive on the scene, engage in a little interview-room intimidation and wrap it all up in quick time. Alas, ultimately this is a little more complex than an episode of Law and Order, with a series of twists and turns that take the story in a direction that is as bonkers as it is surprising (although not to those who have read the book I guess) and utterly gripping. When Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home to find his wife Amy missing, it doesn't take long before he is the prime suspect. Whilst he is steadfast in his declaration of innocence, his personality and behaviour make it easy for just about everyone – the media, neighbours, the in-laws – to believe that he may very well be responsible for whatever it is that has happened to Amy (Rosamund Pike). However, whilst Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) doesn't necessarily find Nick an easy person to like, she is desperate for more conclusive evidence before she is convinced of anything.<br/><br/>Once we start to delve into the couple's past – the early years of their marriage, their relocation from New York to Missouri, the somewhat strained relationship between Amy and her parents – and the events of the days leading up to Amy's disappearance, things get decidedly more interesting. Other suspects emerge; the most notable of which is Desi Collings, a creepy ex-boyfriend played by Neil Patrick Harris, however none of these ever amount to much. Eventually we learn that the truth is far more complex, sophisticated and messed up than we could ever imagine. Once the truth is revealed and the events play out, audiences will no doubt be divided with regard to where their sympathies lie. In addition to being a crime thriller of the highest order, the film also takes an almighty swipe at both the influence of the media in constructing guilt or innocence – Missy Pyle's television host Ellen Abbott may just be the most vile character of all – and the dangers in relying purely on circumstantial evidence in cases where so much is at stake.<br/><br/>Whilst Affleck is good as Nick, it is the women who steal the show here, with Pike utterly hypnotic as Amy, a spellbinding performance that makes it hard to hate her even when you know you should. In fact, the more despicable she became, the more I found myself attracted to her. Both Dickens and Pyle are fabulous, with Carrie Coon also terrific as Nick's unwaveringly loyal sister Margo. Tyler Perry brings a touch of levity to proceedings as high profile lawyer Tanner Bolt, while David Clennon and Lisa Banes are the detestable parents who seem totally oblivious to their own shortcomings in their treatment of Amy. Patrick Fugit (Almost Famous) also features as a police officer who wants to see Nick fry, while Boyd Holbrook (sans his ridiculous accent from The Skeleton Twins, thank god) and Lola Kirke occupy small roles that ultimately prove significant in determining the fate of our protagonists. It is hard to say much more without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Fincher has a predilection for dark mysteries and in cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth he seems to have found the perfect conduit through which he can deliver his examinations of moral and emotional decay. In all its bleakness, the film still manages to somehow look beautiful and, with a suitably atmospheric music score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, Gone Girl is a haunting story from which nobody emerges unscathed."

If you think the Femme Fatales in those Chinese martial arts flicks or the SIN CITY series are realistic, then you will have no problem with GONE GIRL. On the other hand, guys will find ""Amazing Amy's"" Hijinks hoot-out-loud entertaining. (A little hint for any cerebral viewers: novelist\screenwriter Gillian Flynn couldn't possibly mean anyone to see any aspect of verisimilitude between Real Life and any events or characters in this tall tale, so she obviously means it to be taken allegorically, with ""Amazing Amy"" being George W. Bush and Suffering Nick a stand-in for Barack Obama.) Since IMDb says this comment is too short so far to be acceptable, I'll simply add a thank you to My Own Personal Gone Girl, who picked me up a while back as I was desperately hitch-hiking during an ice storm from Marquette, MI to Cape Giradeau, MO--where much of GONE GIRL was shot, jogging my memory.

"markbeckford","9","0","12","6 October 2014"," David Fincher has a fetish
","David Fincher has a fetish for taking complex novels of suspense and intrigue and turning them into delightfully dark and twisted tales that make damn good cinema. He did it with Fight Club and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and he's now done it with Gone Girl, the ""it"" novel of 2012. <br/><br/>Ostensibly a simple story of a wife that vanishes mysteriously under suspicious circumstances, it expertly weaves parallel and divergent narratives through multiple twists and alternative time-lines while skewering the ""trial-by-the-media"" culture and the real-life horrors of mid-life marriage angst.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is perfectly cast as Nick Dunne, the protagonist/antagonist husband of the missing wife. The book/movie works so well because Affleck's character is very hard to pin down. He's flawed but like-able, clueless but clever. Rosamund Pike is excellent but to reveal more would be a spoiler. <br/><br/>Fincher even works magic with the minor characters. Who would have thought of Neil Patrick Harris as a creep-manipulative sad-sack stalker. Carry Coon, a standout in the HBO series The Leftovers, plays Nick's sister and the audience's voice of reason when you just want to scream ""Nick, you freaking idiot!"" <br/><br/>It's not always perfect. Affleck is obviously buffing up for his upcoming role as Batman with bulging shoulders/biceps that are juxtaposed in tight shirts with his character's slovenly ""pot- belly."" Another character goes from thin to over-weight in just a few days while trying to go incognito. It also seems to struggle to figure out how/when wrap things up.<br/><br/>These are all ""nits"" as the story churns in your head as the credits roll which is the true test of excellent film-making."

","I saw this movie in the cinema today, and feel I have to put on record that it is one of the best I have seen in a long time. A great story which develops into a proper ""page turner"", complete with unexpected twists. I won't try to summarise the story, because there are plenty good summaries out there already. Great acting and direction all round....with my only gripe being about the rather poor audibility of some scenes, particularly in the first 15 minutes or so. Yes, the characters here are talking in low voices - but I would prefer to be able to make out the dialogue. Not an issue if you have the DVD and can switch on subtitles of course. But I am glad that I saw this in a cinema setting, where the sense of being gripped is more complete."
"sammieflorence","9","0","10","6 October 2014"," Bravo to Flynn & Fincher
","Excuse my language, but I feel the only way to describe this movie is as follows: unfuckingbelievable. That being said, I've yet to get around to reading the novel, but am trying to get a hold of a copy! <br/><br/>Let me just start with this: what makes this movie so amazing isn't just the acting and the incredible direction of David Fincher, but it is the fact that Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl, wrote the screenplay. That is something rarely seen these days, or any days for that matter. Now I know me saying that might not make sense considering I haven't read the book, so I have nothing to compare, but let me just say this: I could give less of a sh*t about the book at this point. There is zero chance the book has a tenth of the effect the movie has on the viewer. From the dry humor, to the total awkwardness of scenes, and the eeriness of it's characters.. the only way to get the full effect is through the film itself. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck is incredible, as always, and his co-star Rosamund Pike, who was basically unknown to me before this movie, was absolutely breathtaking. The two mix together like oil and water, but somehow a harmony is made somewhere in-between the opening credits and the ending. Each and every second of this movie has you on the edge of your seat questioning the characters, their motives, their desires. With each passing minute you feel as though you know the answers to all of the questions evoked from the film, only to find yourself changing your mind as soon as new information comes to light. <br/><br/>In all honestly, there was not a dull moment in this film. It is a long one, 2 and a half hours, but unlike when I saw The Wolf of Wall Street (3 hours), which had it's boring moments, Gone Girl never left me wondering ""when will this end?!"" It was as if I watched a 2 and a half hour movie in 5 minutes; it flew by. <br/><br/>Now all I can say is go see this movie!! You won't be disappointed, trust me."

","This doesn't bode well for my reading career.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is spectacular. A strong contender for this year's Best Picture.<br/><br/>I couldn't recommend it more highly.<br/><br/>Reading the book isn't necessary.<br/><br/>The differences between the textual and visual are minimal. Reconsider the commitment lingering on your bookshelf.<br/><br/>This is one flick you won't want to miss.<br/><br/>If you've got a better half, bring him or her along. Both men and women will thoroughly enjoy.<br/><br/>It's long (145 minutes total) but should hold your interest throughout.<br/><br/>The screenplay for G.G. is by Gillian Flynn, the same woman who penned the novel.<br/><br/>If Gone Girl offers any inclination toward the quality of G.F.'s alternative texts, let's hope Sharp Objects and Dark Places are green-lit.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher doesn't have a distinct public persona like Tarantino, or an iconic physical appearance like Scorcese's.<br/><br/>That doesn't detract from his mastery of feature film direction.<br/><br/>Iconic motion pictures like Fight Club, Se7en, The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo highlight his filmography.<br/><br/>If a story's a stairway, Gone Girl is a multi-tiered double escalator.<br/><br/>It's extremely well written, and the tension is like radio static, vibrating angrily amidst the coiling score.<br/><br/>The pacing is kinetic; the story constantly switching gears.<br/><br/>The humor is occasional in a realistic fashion.

Can't we just assume he was fantastic from now on?<br/><br/>How about Ben Affleck, everyone's favorite punching bag? Folks who doubted him should be flogged with a sofa cushion.<br/><br/>Upon recommending Gone Girl, a friend's initial hesitation hinges on Affleck's involvement.<br/><br/>First of all, that's like saying you're missing the N'SYNC concert because you don't like J.T.'s pipes.<br/><br/>Benny was never 'bad' at acting, by any stretch of the imagination. Folks cite 2003's Gigli and Daredevil as Fleck Daddy's downfall.<br/><br/>I can't speak to the former, but a final thought on the latter.<br/><br/>At fourteen years old, a group of friends and I thoroughly enjoyed Daredevil in the theater. Plus, it gave us a 'walk in the shoes' of a blind person. Whether we appreciated it or not; we were educated on a lifestyle none of us understood.<br/><br/>I can still cite multiple scenes in detail, and I haven't seen Daredevil since that initial viewing.<br/><br/>My basic point is: Don't skip Gone Girl because of a strong opposition to Affleck's acting ability.<br/><br/>Rosamund Pike is lights-out.<br/><br/>She's a semi-unknown, but a look at her filmography proves she deserves more notoriety.<br/><br/>I've a feeling we'll be seeing more of her in the future.<br/><br/>The remainder of the cast is just as good, but too much detail may trigger a spoiler, so I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>The warm weather left with the hummingbirds, but at least there are solid flicks repopulating theaters."
"blanbrn","8","0","6","4 October 2014"," A film that is a tease with hype and suspense drama with a deviant twist.
","If you know anything about the movies of David Fincher you know they are different, strange, and dark with twist as he gives clues and then twist happen that you may or may not expect. With this latest ""Gone Girl"" which is based on a best selling novel it's a good suspense mystery tease. The acting and chemistry is top notch with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as married couple Nick and Amy. It seems as if they are the power couple as they have money, love and success from their writing jobs as both are educated with wit and books. Still behind the scenes lies drama and hidden skeletons in the closets of both and when the 5 year anniversary hits Amy vanishes from their home, and strange clues are left behind and then the hype and drama builds thru the police and media around the case as people think that Nick killed and did away with his wife! Fincher does a good job of drawing the film out with discovery and drama build up as it leads to more tension and much of the film is told thru flashback. Only this picture takes a twist that you may or may not like I don't want to reveal to much it proves that life and blood is thicker than water and also that people are deviant and life is complex and strange with love and desire."

","So this was my most anticipated film of the year, and I was really hoping it would be good since 2014 has been kind of a shitty year (exceptions being Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, X-Men Days of Future Past, Guardians of the Galaxy). So I was hoping for the best, and figured I would get it since it's a David Fincher film. <br/><br/>Act 1 seemed really rushed to me. There wasn't enough exposition I felt. It's just like within the first 5 minutes ""Here is this guy who we are suppose to care about and woah his wife is gone!"" That's just me and is kind of a nit-pick though. So we go into Act 2 and it's kind of just a mediocre thriller. Ben Affleck's acting is kind of wooden at times through this time, and there isn't really any thing really impressive. Then we find out Amy (Pike) is actually alive, and she is trying to frame Nick (Affleck). Now I start getting more invested, still a little disappointed but it's starting pick up. I really don't get blown by the film until Desi (NPH) gets his throat slashed. That scene is disturbingly beautiful and transforms Amy from a manipulative bitch to a psychopath. From then on the film goes full Fincher! It's mesmerizing, engaging, and memorable. Suddenly I think back to the film leading up to this and I appreciate it. Then the film ends in this ambiguous and surreal fashion. The credits roll and I sit there speechless. <br/><br/>Overall the film is fantastic! Not Fincher's best, but it's definitely a worthy contribution to the art of cinema."
"jadepietro","10","0","10","4 October 2014"," Gone, but Not Forgotten
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Did he or didn't he? That is the question. The majority of the world's population already know that answer as they have already read Gillian Flynn's best-seller, Gone Girl. I, on the other hand, fall into a small minority and can see David Fincher's screen adaptation of this popular mystery novel with no preconceived notions or bias. So you may ask, was I able to solve the crime? Were the twists and convoluted plot satisfying? Did I like the film? My response to that is...<br/><br/>Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is the primary suspect in his wife Amy's (Rosamund Pike) disappearance. Both appear to be the Great American Couple: beautiful, wealthy, happy, and in love. But those facades chip away to show a more troubling relationship, one filled with lies, secrets, and torment.<br/><br/>Gone Girl is cleverly structured so that we view the mystery from two opposing points of view. Using the Rashoman effect, we follow Nick's narrative as its contrasts Amy's viewpoint via her diary. One never knows the actual truth as more complications arise in the investigation. <br/><br/>Fincher's focuses on the media circus as it bellows out of proportion and paints Nick as the main culprit. His take on sensationalism in our society and our abject need for unethical journalism is akin to other great films on that same subject (Billy Wider's Ace in the Hole, Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express, Sydney Pollack's Absence of Malice, and Sidney Lumet's Network). More than just a murder mystery, the film debates larger issues such as the propagandizing of 24/7 network news coverage, our corrupt legal system, the absurd world of celebrity gossip, the perceived notion of puritanical family values, and the dysfunction of marriage itself. That's a lot to cover, plus adding the personal mystery to the mix, and his direction is so effortlessly and efficiently in control. This is a terrific film on so many levels and much credit must go to this director who manages to create a modern classic crime thriller. <br/><br/>Also impressive is the screenplay by the original author, Ms. Flynn. Terse and focused, it defines its characters beautifully and deliberately confuses the moviegoer with its intricate plotting while still making logical sense, a rare feat these days. Whenever one's interest begins to flag, and it isn't often, a sudden plot twist arises or the film backtracks its focus on Nick or Amy's dueling contradictory versions of the crime scene. This is skillful filmmaking, both in the film's visual look and its complex plot structure. At times, some of the characters do seem like plot devices that are there with the sole purpose of moving along the action. But the film is so well acted that one doesn't really mind the artful manipulation involved in the storytelling.<br/><br/>The acting is absolute perfection. Affleck continues to excel as an actor. He uses his rugged good looks and charming persona to his advantage in this role and can play the vulnerable or wicked card at a moment's notice too. It's a nuanced and totally believable portrait of a man whose guilt or innocence is in question. Ms. Pike is also in full control as the put-upon spouse or the scheming harpy, depending on the version that is on display. Solid support comes from a marvelous ensemble with a particular shout-out to Carrie Coons as Nick's loyal twin sister, Neil Patrick Harris as an odd loner and stalker type, Kim Dickens as the stalwart detective, and Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt, Nick's unscrupulous lawyer. Also, production values are top notch throughout, especially the masterful editing by Kirk Baxter and an atmospheric score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that builds tension beautifully. <br/><br/>Everything is in the right place and nothing is missing in Gone Girl. It is one of this year's best films. GRADE: A-<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"KnightsofNi11","8","0","6","4 October 2014"," Fincher never ceases to amaze
","David Fincher is back into the feature film game, and he is continuing to prove that he is an absolute master of his craft. His new film, Gone Girl, based off the novel of the same name is a stupendously crafted mystery thriller. It's a devilishly clever story that keeps you guessing at every corner, laying on surprise after gruesome surprise to twist and rile your brain for two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Gone Girl stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne, a middle America husband whose wife suddenly goes missing from her house one morning. The neighborhood wide search for Amy Dunne begins, as well as an investigation into her appearance that starts to reveal some strange and startling clues about Amy's whereabouts. All the while all eyes are on Nick Dunne as the potential murderer of his wife, despite his constant assurance that he didn't do it. More and more questions begin to pop up as this compelling mystery unravels at a perfectly crafted pace, told in a beautifully dark tone with an icy tinge of black comedy. <br/><br/>Gone Girl is cruel and unforgiving in its story. It drags us through this harrowing and painfully real mystery that is packed with the typical Fincher darkness, of which he mixes in that snide and hilariously crass streak of humor. It's Fincher in near tip-top storytelling form. Gone Girl keeps you guessing all the way through. There are moments when you think you're ahead of the game and you've figured it all out, but the next moment will shoot all that down, leaving you scrambling to try and pick up the pieces. <br/><br/>This movie takes you on a dark and twisty roller coaster ride that is exceptionally fun from start to finish, even if two and a half hours seems a bit overlong for this story. Gone Girl certainly hits bumps and potholes along its way, but the unraveling mystery and undaunting suspense is a glue that holds the film together. At times the dialogue doesn't land the way it should, and this might be because the the film's screenwriter, Gillian Flynn, is also the author of the novel, and some of Flynn's words on the page don't translate quite as well to the screen. <br/><br/>A slew of good performances certainly help smooth out the dialogue though. Rosamund Pike is fantastic as Amy, one of the most complex and unpredictable characters I've seen on the screen in recent memory. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry are surprisingly great in their smaller yet still crucial roles. Hell, even Ben Affleck delivers a pretty great performance. Whether it's enough to carry the film or not is debatable, but the movie has so much else going for it already. <br/><br/>Then there's the finale of Gone Girl that is so brilliantly simple. The ending comes unexpectedly, delivering a dreadfully bleak final note. One that, per usual Fincher form, leaves you with an uneasy feeling in your stomach as you try to digest what you just experienced. This grim movie has the power to draw a real physical reaction, and that's saying something. It has the power to tell a truly gut wrenching story in two and a half hours, but also keep it wildly fresh and entertaining. Gone Girl is easily one of the best of the year thus far."

","The premise seems pretty simple, something taken from a sad news story in Anytown, USA. Nick Dunn (Ben Affleck) returns home on the day of his 5th wedding anniversary after a routine morning. He discovers the front door of his home is open, a broken coffee table and overturned furniture in the living room, and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. He immediately calls the police and a detective and an officer arrive at his home. They quickly notice things that allude Nick. He agrees to go with them to the police station for questioning and he is soon released.<br/><br/>Nick contacts Amy's parents, his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon), and the story quickly gathers national attention. Nick's detached, casual demeanor and sometimes inappropriate, cringe inducing behavior during a press conference, a large gathering of volunteers to search for Amy and a vigil soon make him suspect number one in the news media. The officer is sure of Nick's guilt as evidence of foul play unravels that leads to directly to Nick, but the detective has doubts.<br/><br/>The story then changes gears from the usual missing person's case. It twists, tangles, and hurls you along in a jaw dropping, you-must-be-freaking-kidding-me maze and weaves in flashbacks from the recent past. I do not wish to write anything else to avoid spoilers.<br/><br/>""Gone Girl"" captures the intriguing and bizarre story of a marriage gone terribly (understatement) wrong and the role the media plays in deciding the guilt or innocence of someone accused of a crime. Rosamund Pike is brilliant as Amy, a calculating, manipulative, intelligent, focused, driven, confident woman on a mission. Carrie Coon gives a raw performance as Nick's sympathetic, supportive and emotionally distraught twin sister. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Neil Patrick Harris as Desi Collings, Amy's smooth talking and creepy ex-boyfriend, and Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt, Nick's high profile attorney who has a great sense of humor. I also love Missi Pyle as Ellen Abott, a cable TV host who has an uncanny resemble to Nancy Grace and captures the judge, jury and executioner style of some news reporting. And the music of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross blends in well with the film. Ben Affleck is a disappointment for me because he does not immerse himself fully into the character. But he comes so close, is right on the edge, but he does not make the leap. I see Ben Affleck on the screen not completely in the moment, not Nick Dunn.<br/><br/>Last year I read the novel ""Gone Girl"" by Gillian Flynn and there are parts of it that I strongly disliked. Does the author, who adapted the screenplay, make any major changes for the movie? You'll have to see the movie to discover the answer to this question."

","David Fincher has delivered yet another film that doesn't disappoint. I often find myself saying that the trailer is possibly better than the movie in most cases. In this case however, the trailer doesn't do it justice. I knew going in that there would be twists, but I had no idea what to expect.<br/><br/>To be brief: Ben Affleck plays the husband of Rosamund Pike who has gone missing and is presumed dead. Naturally Ben Affleck is the prime suspect. All of this is divulged within the first 15 minutes of the film. What happens after that I'd have to include a spoiler warning for; which I won't do because watching the story unfold is so entertaining. We all think we're pretty good at guessing the twist, or we claim to be. But I promise you this time that most of us will be blindsided by this one. The story is at once, dramatic, shocking, and haunting without going overboard into ridiculousness. What transpires between these people is believable enough even though it's quite shocking. More than that I won't say.<br/><br/>What I will add though is that nearly everything in this film is pitch perfect. I would have preferred a bit more excitement at the very end, but the story ended as it probably would have had these been real people. Aside from that the cinematography is beautiful, the acting top notch (look for Rosamund Pike's Oscar nomination in February), the editing is fantastic, everything is exceptional.<br/><br/>Definitely money well spent.

"sfertelmes","9","0","10","2 October 2014"," Gone Girl pulls you straight in and absolutely refuses to let go from beginning to end. This is filmmaking at its best.
","If you haven't read Gone Girl yet, I don't know exactly what you're waiting for. Those of you who have read the book... Good job! (You go Glenn Coco!) Critically acclaimed Director David Fincher (The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fight Club) creates a fantastically dark piece of art that stays true to the central essence of Gillian Flynn's bestselling novel. Gone Girl pulls you straight in and absolutely refuses to let go from beginning to end. This is filmmaking at its best. <br/><br/>Gone Girl tells the story of Amy Dunne's disappearance, and the resulting spotlight being placed on her husband Nick by media outlets, friends, family and the police as it becomes suspected that he may not be completely innocent. <br/><br/>I was a HUGE fan of Gillian Flynn's novel. It's one of those books that you pick up, and cannot physically put down until you reach that last page. It's like opening a box of munchkins from Dunkin Donuts and not being able to stop eating until the box is empty. I read the book in a day and couldn't help but want more. When I learned that David Fincher was to direct the film AND that the book's author Gillian Flynn was writing the screenplay, I was more than confident that the movie adaptation would be true to overall essence of the book. <br/><br/>And boy was I right. <br/><br/>Gone Girl exceeded my expectations for a book to film adaptation in a multitude of different ways, but firstly because of the casting. Nick Dunne is character you'll have a love-hate relationship with, depending at where you are in the story's plot. There are moments when his character is violent, and others when he's completely destroyed emotionally resulting in some empathy. Ben Affleck does a great job evoking these sentiments. His expressions and body language continually make us question his involvement in his wife's disappearance, like flashing a cheeky smile at a press conference or taking a selfie with a random lady at the ""Find Amy Dunne"" headquarters. #Sketchy<br/><br/>When I first saw Rosamund Pyke in the early Gone Girl trailers, I was somewhat skeptical that she had the ability to pull off the utterly fascinating character of Amy Dunne. I felt that the character required an actress such as Charlize Theron (Think Monster and even Young Adult) who could easily handle the darker and richly complex role. I was happily surprised when Pyke both met and even surpassed a few of my expectations. I would offer more details, but I refuse to give any major spoilers for this movie. <br/><br/>Three more casting decisions are worth briefly mentioning: Neil Patrick Harris as Desi Collings, Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt, and Carrie Coon as Margo Dunne. Desi Collings is a stalker and former lover of Amy's from her boarding school days. He is creepy in the books AND thankfully creepy in the movie thanks to Harris. Those scenes in his lake house thoughÂ… (Fans of the book, you know what I'm getting at.) Tyler Perry was an interesting selection for Tanner, a wealthy high-profile criminal defense lawyer who eventually represents Nick. It naturally takes some time to stop visualizing Madea, but I did quickly warm up to his portrayal. Lastly, I have to give an honorable mention to Carrie Coon (She plays the coolest character from HBO's The Leftovers. You don't watch that show? Maybe you should?) as Margo Dunne, Nick's 'tell it like it is' twin sister. Her acting was top-notch throughout the film as her character's world is torn apart because of Amy's disappearance. <br/><br/>The cinematography in Gone Girl is understandably both excellent and brilliant based on one simple aspect: David Fincher is the film's director. Yes, it's as simple as that. The majority of the film contains dark, gloomy, and crisp shots that exemplify the movie's opaque core. Trent Reznor's exquisitely shadowy score helps to further compliment Fincher's masterful cinematography by creating tension and consistent undertones of suspense.<br/><br/>Despite all of Gone Girl's bells and whistles as far as acting, cinematography and score, the film's true success comes from Gillian Flynn and her adapted screenplay. No one knows a novel better than the novel's author, and Flynn's involvement in writing the screenplay truly helped carry over many of the elements, aspects and characteristics of the novel that I initially fell in love with. Gone Girl is far more than a simple 'whodunit' detective story that we've all seen before. The unconventional nature of the story's structure and theme simply refuse to let go of you once you start watching (or reading for that matter). I only warn of the film's 150-minute runtime, because various scenes did feel slightly longer than necessary. This feeling may have also resulted from my empty stomach and (eternal) craving for pizza while watching. <br/><br/>If you're one of those people who prefers reading the book before seeing the movie, then do so. If you prefer seeing the movie before immersing yourself in the book, then do so. Regardless of the order, make sure you see Gone Girl. Fincher and Flynn's beautifully dark love story is a masterpiece that simply will not disappoint."

","While I very much enjoyed this film which was done in a Hitchcockian style, there were a few flaws that slipped by. The most significant being that Amy was not challenged as to how she had come upon and stored the box cutter under her pillow.<br/><br/>The storyline appears to have drawn a lot of its material from the 2002 real-life Scott Peterson story in which he reported that his pregnant wife, Laci was missing. Even the scene in which his girlfriend, Andie goes public about the affair she was having with Nick, is reminiscent of Amber Frey's public appearance.<br/><br/>This may indeed have been Ben Affleck's best performance to date. I would not be surprised if his name pops up at Oscar time.<br/><br/>Also, while some may like the ending, in my view it did not bring the film to a proper ""closure.""<br/><br/>The film nonetheless is still a very suspenseful edge-of-your seat thriller."

","Just came home (12pm) so fantastic had to write a review straight away. Honestly the most thrilling movie ever seen, the actors are fantastic. This film contains every genre possible, some moments have the audience laughing uncontrollably whereas other moments it is the most unexpected gore horror scene. Completely shocking, do not be fooled by the trailer it feels as though the film is a completely different storyline hence the shock. Honestly fantastic, recommend to everyone who enjoys being kept on their feet in deep suspense. Great work absolutely amazing, but so messed up at the same time. Never in my whole life expected this film to turn out the way it did. Enjoy"

","David Fincher has taken another fantastic novel and turned it into an engrossing spectacle. The movie may be long (nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes), but not for one single second does the excitement leave you and boredom sets in. Fincher keeps the suspense high throughout the entire movie, just when you think the movie has been solved, new obstacles arise and it couldn't be more engrossing!The first half of the movie obviously focuses on the mystery of 'Where his Nick's Wife?', but it isn't until we figure out if she is alive or dead that the real excitement kicks in. That being said, the second half of the movie focuses on Nick and his colleagues trying to figure out a way out of the mess he is now in, thanks to new evidence, this is where the movie gets wild. Unfortunately, he is always one step behind the true monster and it's exciting to see him attempting to counter and disprove 'the perfect crime' and whether or not he will come out on top. The movie starts off as simple mystery thriller and then explodes into a much larger story with plenty of intricate layers to keep you guessing at the end game; and it also challenges you as viewer and forces you to pick a side (the lesser of two evils perhaps). Of course much of the praise must go to the author of the actual book, because she has created a truly captivating story. As of right now, it is safe to say that 'Gone Girl' is the second best movie in 2014, second only to 'Snowpiercer'. This is a must see for anyone looking for a fantastic mystery movie with some of the best acting of the year! <br/><br/>Full review at : http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/10/gone-girl-2014.html"
"Argemaluco","8","0","9","3 October 2014"," Gone Girl is a satisfactory and quite interesting thriller
","Many people adore director David Fincher, but I'm not one of them. I generally like his films, but I don't consider myself an unconditional fan of his. Gone Girl, his most recent film, is a very good addition to his filmography, because besides of having a refined style and various solid performances, it tells us a cleverly twisted and perverse story, where there aren't good or bad people, but different levels of victims. However, I found the first hour from Gone Girl a bit generic... the ""husband accused of homicide"" subject is kinda trite, like taken from an episode from Law and Order. But then, the twist comes, and the movie comes to life, filling itself with energy which is kept until the ending. I had previously never swallowed Ben Affleck as an actor, but I have to admit that he brings a credible performance in Gone Girl, and he's well complemented by Carrie Coon, Tyler Perry and Kim Dickens. As for Rosamund Pike, who plays the missing wife in flashbacks, her performance is irregular; she feels excessively feigned in some scenes, but in other ones, she transmits devastating levels of melancholy and hopelessness. One of the elements I appreciated the most in Gone Girl is the tense music from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Or I might be saying ""soundtrack"", because more than ""music"", Reznor and Ross created ""aural landscapes"" with percussions, noises and electronic cadences which twitch the nerves and make us participants of the anguish and concern all the characters experiment on a higher or lower degree. In conclusion, even though the first hour feels a bit generic, Gone Girl quickly recovers itself in order to bring us an intense, satisfactory and very interesting thriller, which I consider worthy of a recommendation. Besides, from a personal point of view, Gone Girl became another subsection in the long list of reasons why I prefer to be single."

","-Gone Girl start Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as a pitch perfect married couple, when one day, the wife suddenly disappears. The police get involved and many people begin to suspect it was the emotionless husband at fault. But since it is a thrilling David Fincher film, I won't say any more.<br/><br/>-It was great! It was suspenseful, thrilling, and kept me wondering what was going to happen next throughout the entire film! The writing is genius and the film is definitely looking at a few Oscar nominations including best picture and screenplay.<br/><br/>-Speaking of Oscar nominations, Rosamund Pike killed it in the film and will probably get a nomination. Ben Affleck was also very great and even more impressively, Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry were great too! -It has a very dark mysterious tone and isn't exactly the feel-good movie of the year. It is also slow, but very entertaining and well done.<br/><br/>-The music is dark and artistic, also going for a nomination.<br/><br/>-Gone Girl does hold an R-rating. It has some language throughout, although IMDb made me think it was going to be a lot worse. It has a scene or two of violence, and it has some sexual content in it. However, most of the content is quick, not explicit, and there is only brief nudity. Most of this would warrant a high PG-13 rating their own. That said, it's still there in a pretty dark film.<br/><br/>-So if you like dark thrillers with twists and a great story wrapped up in a great film, than Gone Girl is totally worth seeing in theaters! Rating is tougher because it is not a Guardians of the Galaxy fun film, however, I think I liked Gone Girl a little more and would give it a strong 8.5/10."
