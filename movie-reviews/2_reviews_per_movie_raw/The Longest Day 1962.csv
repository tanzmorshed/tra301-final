"Buck_Thruster","Null","187","204","12 April 2004"," The last good WW2 film made by people ""who were there""
","This is perhaps one of the most ambitious, epic WW2 films to have been made; certainly it is the last of the classic B&W films made about the subject. Featuring an all-star cast (John Wayne, Richard Burton, Kurt Jurgens... even a cameo by Sean Connery!), it comprehensively details the build-up and execution of the Normandy landings in 1944, taking care to show how the event was perceived by Allied and Axis soldiers and commanders, as well as the Free French resistance.  This is a film that takes great care in documenting the events of the day, without lapsing into sickly sentimentalism or getting distracted with fictional characters' personal lives (a failing of many WW2 movies since about 1970), or over-emphasising any one nation's importance in the operation (although, admittedly, Canadians may feel a little short-changed).<br/><br/>Classic moments abound, notably the landing at St.Mere-Eglise and the soldier who gets caught in the church steeple, the frustrations of the front-line German commanders and fighters, and the numerous cameos for film nerds to keep track of.<br/><br/>If you want a wartime romance, or an appearance by Matt Damon or Ben Affleck, or long, loving shots of the Stars & Stripes in slo-mo, or a gritty blood'n'guts fest, you'll be disappointed.  This film has broader concerns, and was made with much more thoroughness.  There is no agenda at work here, pro-war or anti-.  It is solely concerned with documenting Operation ""Overlord"" for the film-going public, and succeeds brilliantly; a shame then, that it has not made the top 50 war films list.<br/><br/>A must-see for any fan of war films."

","This an important, interesting movie depicting the Overlord operation with monumental logistic and means of effecting the Normandy landing , the most difficult campaign of war . The picture brings to life the famous images of WWII and splendidly the most sensational military operation of the history in an Allied hard-fought effort . The film develops the previous days to the D-Day invasion , such as the landings and the advance over France . The film is magnificently produced in big budget by the great 20th Century Fox producer Darryl F. Zanuck . Evocative cinematography by Jean Bourgoun and catching song by Paul Anka with musical score by Maurice Jarre . Excellent casting by a great plethora of stars . Special mention for John Wayne as Lt. Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort , he's top-notch as a tough , valiant officer in this believable war film and terrific acting by Richard Todd as Major commanding Us paratroopers dropped to protect the flanks of the invasion and taking strategic bridge . Furthermore , known Generals and officers played by prestigious players , as Germans : General Gunther (Curt Jurgens) , Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (Hinz) , Field Marshal Von Rundstedt (Paul Hartmann), and Allied : Brig. General Theodore Roosevelt Jr (Henry Fonda) , Brig. General Norman Cota (Robert Mitchum) , General Haines (Mel Ferrer) , Brig. General James Gavin (Robert Ryan) , General Raymond Barton (Edmond O'Brien), Lt General OMar N Bradley (Stuart) , General Bernard L Montgomery (T. Reid) and General Dwight D. Eisenhower played by Henry Grace . Grace was a famed set designer , while he worked extensively for many films , his only appearance was an uncredited performance as Eisenhower ; despite not being an actor , he was cast for his uncanny resemblance to the General . This famous event from how was orchestrated the dangerous , risky landing maneuvers was professionally directed by a magnificent trio of directors , Ken Annakin , Bernhard Wicki and Andrew Marton.<br/><br/>Adding more details along with the well developed on the movie , the events that happened on June 6, 1944 were the following ones : Shortly after midnight on June 6, about 23.500 US and British paratroopers landed along the edges of the landing beaches . Their mission was to seize vital bridges and communications centers. They also had to hold off any Germans counterattacks until they were relieved by the amphibious forces. The Airbone landings were largely successful. Some US troops missed their target and end up scattered over the countryside. The main amphibious landings took place after an artillery bombardment from some 200 Allied warships at German positions also came under attack from Allied medium and heavy bombers. They were part of the 11,500 aircraft committed to D-Day. They bombed the Germans on and behind the five landing beaches. US troops landed on Utah beach. Strong currents and inaccurate navigation meant that they were a little away from their precise target. They landed about 1 mile (1,6 km) south. The beach there was relatively undefended. The troops soon knocked out the only concrete gun position guarding the beach.Demolitions teams cleared paths through the obstacles the beach and the first tanks crossed the Atlantic Wall. They fanned out into the countryside to link up with the paratroopers. By nightfall of D-Day some 23,000 men and 1,700 vehicles had gone ashore. The beach had been highly congested for much of the day. Utah was a triumph ,however Omaha beach was nearly a disaster, the fight was the most difficult. The Us troops were unable to get off the beach to make room for later waves of invaders. There were better defenses there than on the other beaches, and the German defenders were positioned on high ground, from where they could pour fire down on the attackers.The allies also made mistakes. The naval bombardment ended too soon, and the bombers missed their targets and launched landing crafts and amphibious tanks too far out from the beach, may were sunk. When the first assault wave landed ,it faced a bar-rage of fire , some men were thinking of evacuation. However small groups began to make it off the beach to the high ground beyond. By dusk, some men were ashore, most were still crowed on the beach. The high ground beyond was only thinly held by exhausted survivors waves. Some 2300 US troops had been killed in the landings. The operation had come close to disaster. The three Anglo-Canadian beaches-Gold, Sword and Juno stretched fore some 25 miles. They were wide and open and ideal for amphibious landings. The British on Gold and Sword quickly crashed though the Atlantic wall. Their success was due partly to a range of specially developed armored vehicles known as Funnies. The Canadians at Juno had a tougher time. They faced rough seas and alert defenders .By late morning ,they were also pushing inland. Despite the horror of beaches , overall Allied losses were far lower than expected. Some 6000 US personnel were killed, wounded, or missing, along with 4300 British and Canadian troops. German losses totaled between 4000 and 8000. By the day's end ,some 128000 Allied soldiers were ashore and many more were on their way."
"tggilchrist","Null","15","15","3 September 2011"," Candian Presence in The Longest Day
","The previous comments about Canadian participation in the Normandy invasion were significant - insofar as there weren't very many. One of the five Normandy beaches was Canadian (Juno), but there is almost no mention of this in The Longest Day, and I'm sure that one would be hard pressed to find many Americans (and not a whole lot more Canadians) who know this. Unfortunately, it is movies such as this and other popular media that shape the historic knowledge of people on both sides of the border. In the near absence of Canadian content, I find it ironic that a young Canadian (Paul Anka) not only played a part in the movie as an American soldier, but also wrote the theme music. I find it also ironic that the legendary rifle used by US soldiers during WW2 and shown in this movie was designed by a Canadian as well (Garand is a French Canadian name). The cruelest irony, of course, is the fact that thousands of Canadian soldiers were maimed or lost there lives on 6 June 1944 and the days thereafter, with virtually no acknowledgement in this movie. I have always enjoyed watching this movie, but it is unfortunate that I must use my imagination to see in it the heroic and selfless wartime effort of my father's generation, in similar fashion to viewers in the US and UK."
"Nazi_Fighter_David","10","78","90","1 October 2002"," An absolutely remarkable film...
","'The Longest Day' is June 6, 1944, the day the Allied assault on Hitler's Fortress Europe... And when it came everything went much according to plan... But fighting through the tough country of Normandy took much longer than had been expected...<br/><br/>Dwight D. Eisenhower, the four-star Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, made up the force of some two million men massed in England for the strike at Europe...<br/><br/>Combined American, British, Irish and Canadian forces assault the beaches of Normandy in an effort to gain a foothold on the continent... From the viewpoint of the Americans and Germans involved, the story unfolds through numerous episodes highlighting the 'Longest Day.' We see the commands posts occupied by the Germans; Caen, the starting point; the French underground network; Omaha Beach; Utah Beach; Ste-Mère-Église; as well as sites and camps in England...<br/><br/>The film is a clear examination of D-Day looked at from almost every viewpoint, particularly from that of the Germans who are overwhelmed by the forces brought against them... It is in fact Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (profiled against the French beach thoroughly planted with mined obstacles) who looks out to where the invasion fleet will appear later-or sooner, and gives the film its title: ""The first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive... For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day.""<br/><br/>In the first half, much attention is focused on the weather, as the troops... American, British, Irish, Canadian and French are poised on board their boats and ships, waiting for the rain to stop... In the key scene when Gen. Eisenhower (David Grace), makes the decision to go ahead with the invasion on June 6, more than 5,000 ships moved to assigned positions... The importance of time is emphasized by increasing the ticking of a clock... On the other side of the channel, the German generals, who know the invasion is imminent, see the same nasty weather and decide to take some time off for war games...<br/><br/>French Resistance fighters receive their coded instructions from BBC radio and increase their sabotage activities... Much of the early going is also devoted to some of the Allies' more unorthodox ideas, the kinds of things that make more sense cinematic ally than militarily: the use of metal clickers by paratroopers for identification, and parachuting mechanical dummies loaded with firecrackers behind German lines to create confusion...<br/><br/>The film reaches its peak when the two sides in the battle are finally engaged...<br/><br/>The first assault wave hit the Normandy beaches at 6:30 A.M. on June 6... The soil of France looked sordid and uninviting... Planning has been as complete as possible, but in the vast confusion of invasion under enemy fire, so many men fell uselessly when they left their landing craft, and stepped into water... Others fell into underwater shell craters and drowned...<br/><br/>The Allied air bombing that was to have knocked out German beach defense guns had not been accurate, especially on Omaha Beach where the bombs had been laid down too far inland to do much good... As a result, the gunfire that met American troops there was more murderous than anything they had been prepared for..<br/><br/>Today it is difficult to watch the invasion scenes and not compare them to the opening of Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan,' but that really is unfair... Zanuck manages to display the image of thousands of young soldiers who were killed fighting to liberate France... <br/><br/>A long aerial shot from the point of view of a German pilot Josef 'Pips' Priller (Heinz Reincke) strafing Normandy Beach reveals a shore-line of successive waves of men running for their lives trying to secure Omaha Beach... This awful waste and destruction of war: scores of trucks and boats hit by shells, or sunk by mines with their crew lost... Trucks overturned and swamped, partly sunken barges, and many jeeps half submerged... <br/><br/>Field Marshal Rommel set to work to do everything possible to make the beaches if not impregnable, very uninviting indeed... 'The war will be won or lost on the beaches,' he states... The German command was slow to react to the invasion... They had been misled by the weather and the Allied deception plan that Normandy was a diversion and the main landing would be at Pas-de-Calais...<br/><br/>Shot in CinemaScope and in black-and-white, 'The Longest Day' captures the history of the moment... The film tracks the book very closely, shifting the viewpoints from German to French to American to British throughout... In three hours Zanuck and his staff expand on the scope of one day, to tell mostly everything, with an exceptionally strong cast playing cameo roles... The cast could not be better, in spite of the brevity of their roles: <br/><br/><ul><li>Bourvil is the French Mayor of Colleville who welcomes the British soldiers with a bottle of champagne...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Irina Demick is Janine Boitard, the sexy good-looking Resistance member...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Henry Fonda is Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the Brigadier General who limps ashore with the first of the assault boats landing on Utah Beach...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Christian Marquand is Philippe Kieffer, the French Commander in desperate situation in Ouistreham...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Robert Mitchum is Norman Cota, the Brigadier general who chops on his cold cigar, and walks along the beach and rallies his men... Mitchum gets some great lines and delivers them with the right amount of idealism and cynicism...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Richard Todd is John Howard, the major who lands by glider at Bénouville to capture the canal bridge over the Orne River...</li></ul><br/><br/>All the characters speak in their own languages... The motion picture is Winner of two Academy Awards for Cinematography and Special Effects, Zanuck's 'The Longest Day' is one without doubt an absolutely remarkable film, one of the most impressive and most authentic documentation of war ever put on film..."
"mrcaw1","Null","11","11","27 April 2004"," Classic WWII Film!!
","The Longest Day (1962) - CO-Directors: Ken Annakin & Andrew Morton Everyone knows this was producer Darryl F. Zanuck's baby and it earns its place in cinema history as one of those epic style movies that treats its subject matter with the most serious of attitudes. Obviously a war is no laughing matter but, for better or worse, movies tend to simplify logistics while highlighting emotional chords, such as bravery and homemade apple pie. Zanuck, however, wanted the audience to understand the scope and grandeur of an enterprise like D-Day.<br/><br/>Utilizing a cast of thousands, half of which seemed to be cameo appearances by major stars of the day, Zanuck presents on wide screen all the action and turmoil that surrounded this turning point of WW II. The ever-fighting Republican John Wayne is there, along with Democrat Henry Fonda, tough guy Bob Mitchum, brooding Richard Burton, sexy Sean Connery and pit bullish Rod Steiger.  Still for my money, one of the best landing on the beach scenes ever filmed.  Sorry Mr.Spielberg. (B&W)"
"sawyertom","Null","88","107","16 March 2003"," One of the Greatest War Films Ever Bar None!!!
","The Longest Day is one of the greatest war films ever. Bar none. The  acting, the cinematography, the storline and the acuraccy are great. if  any of you fans watch AMC watch the Backstory behind this movie. It's  amazing that it was even made. This is Zanuck's greatest work. The  perspective from the different combatants regardless of their rank is  great. Like somebody else said it did not portray the Germans as  cartoonish evil doers. It gave a good honest portrayal that I wish more  war movies would have. As a history buff I love to see movies from  other countries soldier perspectives. This captures it better than  every other war movie. The only one that comes close is Tora, Tora,  Tora. There is one drawback however and that is the rangers at Pointe  De Hoc. They did find the big guns but,they were further inland and  later destroyed before they could be used. Zanuck used this to show the  futility and waste of war. Other than that is a classic with very few  flaws. The comparison between SPR and TLD are well like comparing  apples and oranges. Yes, SPR has gritty realism that stuns you, but  like another reviewer said, this was 1962 and the movie was about the  entire scope of the battle. It was not meant to be up close and  personal like SPR. Many of us  appreciate movies from different perspctives. This is not a movie you  should not rent. You should own it as part of your video collection.  This movie may appear to be pro-war and patriotic, but Zanuck himself  said he wanted to make an anti-war film. I think he did so  magnificantly. He captured the essence of the book where Cornelius Ryan  said he wrote about the men,not the battles. That is why Zanucks film  is so successful. He captured the men and their feelings, whether they  were American, British,German's or French and what they were feeling  going into one WW2's most decisive battle. This is a Four Star  Classic!!!!"
"phantomsteve_","8","54","65","2 May 2004"," Still a classic after 42 years!
","Invariably compared with ""Saving Private Ryan"" (SPR), this scores over the more modern work because of the focus on all the major sides of the action (British, American, French and German).<br/><br/>All languages are used (with subtitles as appropriate - eg the Germans speak in German, etc).<br/><br/>While true that the battle scenes are not gory as SPR's, and that the sounds of battle are muted during the dialog (unlike SPR's), it should be borne in mind that in '62, the audience rating of the time *was* a General Release (""G"" in the US, ""A"" in the UK (I'm guessing for the UK, but it is now PG)) - which more detail would not have allowed.<br/><br/>I think part of the purpose of this film is to allow *everyone* to see what happened 18 years before!"
"cariart","Null","15","16","9 August 2003"," An Unforgettable Overview of an Epic Battle!
","'The Longest Day' is perhaps the greatest dramatic record of one of the defining moments in world history. After the intimacy of 'Saving Private Ryan', many critics have accused it of being a 'sanitized' version of the Normandy Invasion, but it is a different kind of film, entirely! While Steven Speilberg's aim was to personalize the horror facing the first wave of troops to hit the beach, Producer Darryl F. Zanuck, a D-Day vet, himself, wanted to create a mosaic of the myriad of personalities, events, and experiences that shaped the day. It is a film that looks objectively at all the forces who fought this epic battle, wisely casting major stars of each country to portray actual and fictitious characters. This was a bold move at the time, as subtitles are used extensively, giving the film has a uniquely international flavor. This is not your usual war film with 'American actors doing funny accents'!<br/><br/>
There are many standout performances; a few that deserve particular recognition are Richard Burton's war-weary RAF pilot, the last survivor of his original squadron; Dietmar Schönherr as one of the few remaining Luftwaffe pilots, faced with the impossible order of stopping the invasion with two airplanes; Jeffrey Hunter, a young sergeant who is 'Dear John'ed and faces the horrendous Omaha landing; a pre-James Bond Sean Connery as a cocky Irish infantryman; Red Buttons, as a paratrooper whose chute snags on a church tower, and is forced to view the carnage as Germans annihilate jumpers dropping into a French town square; and John Wayne (himself a war film icon), as Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort, the Airborne commander, who impatiently waits for the 'Go' order, then breaks his ankle jumping into Normandy.<br/><br/>
Filled with drama, humor, and pathos, 'The Longest Day' works on many levels, and is never dull! Over forty years after its initial release, it's semi-documentary style still seems as fresh and engrossing as ever, and works equally well viewed by itself, or paired with 'Saving Private Ryan'.<br/><br/>
It should be an essential part of your film library!"
"bkoganbing","10","61","77","7 August 2006"," ""Gentlemen, We Start the War from Right Here.""
","Simply put if things had gone differently on June 6, 1944 we would be living in a very different and very much uglier world than we have now. The Longest Day is Darryl F. Zanuck's tribute to all who were involved in Allied invasion at Normandy.<br/><br/>Even viewing it now as opposed to the theaters back then back then I am staggered at Zanuck's incredible eye and grasp for the detail of the Normandy invasion. He did the smart thing and not only bought Cornelius Ryan's standard account of D-Day, but got Ryan to write a very coherent screenplay. Even one who has absolutely no grasp of military history will be able to follow exactly what was going on.<br/><br/>Several of the people who are portrayed in the film also served as technical advisers of it. When you Peter Lawford as Lord Lovat or Robert Ryan as General James Gavin and many others these people aided in recreating the project.<br/><br/>Zanuck may have had the largest movie set in history to work with, at least up to that time. You are seeing the film photographed in the places it actually happened. The beaches, the towns of St. Mere Eglise and Ouisterham, even the embarkation areas in the UK. I doubt you could do The Longest Day today because of the changes in all these places now. Lots of cooperation from the British and French governments was necessary.<br/><br/>You also couldn't do it because the budget would be the size of the U.S. national debt today. This was the last days of the all powerful studio system and even with a lot of the stars free-lancing at that point, Darryl F. Zanuck was still a most powerful man in Hollywood with a lot of favors owed. One example was Richard Burton who was shooting Cleopatra at the time The Longest Day was also shooting. For his two brief, but memorable scenes as an RAF pilot, they shot around him on Cleopatra also a 20th Century Fox production while he filmed his part for Zanuck.<br/><br/>Even the Germans came in for a portrait of them as human beings. Curt Jurgens as General Blumentritt, who was also a technical adviser, put it philosophically best about how after he can't convince Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl to wake up Hitler to move the Panzer Divisions, breaks open a bottle of cognac and decides to drink it before the Allies arrive.<br/><br/>I have several favorites in The Longest Day. Richard Todd who actually was at D-Day and was a decorated hero himself, plays commando leader, Major John Howard who is asked to paratroop into France and capture and hold a key bridge intact. Todd is channeling his own as well as Howard's war experience into the film and gives a performance of unusual depth.<br/><br/>Norman Rossington and a pre-James Bond Sean Connery who was just making his debut as Bond in Dr. No, give some good comic relief as a cockney and Irish soldier landing on Sword Beach. So does Kenneth More as a British beachmaster with his bulldog Winston.<br/><br/>The French are well represented by Arletty, Bourvil, Christian Marquand and by Irina Demich. Being that three of these play civilian roles they get the only two women's parts of any substance in The Longest Day. I do like the scene where some Germans checking Irina out in a low cut dress, fail to properly search her. Irina also demonstrates how much the women were equal partners in the Resistance. Marquand as a captain of a Free French company is involved in a particularly bloody battle for a coastal town.<br/><br/>Of course the American cinema is well represented. Charlton Heston was to originally play the part that John Wayne does, but he couldn't get free of some commitments of his own and when Wayne became available, Zanuck grabbed him. Heston was later quoted as saying Wayne did a better job than he would have in any event. Wayne's best scene was when he saw some American bodies dangling from roofs in St. Mere Eglise. As I've said many times, John Wayne had one of the best faces for movie closeups ever. One look at the horror expressed in his face tells you all you need to know.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda plays General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. who would within a month after the invasion die on Normandy Beach. Had he lived, Roosevelt might have picked up the pieces of a stalled political career. But that was not to be the case. Roosevelt was found dead of a heart attack in his tent after the invasion when the Allies were trying to break out of the beach.<br/><br/>The heaviest casualties on D-Day were on Omaha Beach where Robert Mitchum plays General Norman Cota a division commander. Mitchum is involved at the climax of the film where American GIS after being hung up for hours, break through and insure the invasion's success.<br/><br/>The Longest Day is not only great drama and a great war film, but it is as accurate a film as you will ever get depicting the Normandy invasion, good history as well."

","True, the first half an hour of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is truly mesmerizing but then it degenerates into a soap opera of sorts and all the angst and horror of war evaporates until the truly sentimental finale. ""The Longest Day"" doesn't depend on special effects but on the minute by minute horror of its moment. It's also, if I'm permitted to say it, a lot of fun to watch. Strangely enough the all star cast is not distracting at all. It was much more in ""Saving Private Ryan"" with a cast of up and comings headed by Tom Hanks himself. In ""The Longest Day"" there are real moments, film, cinematic moments that are intimately connected with the profoundest sense of drama: The clicking of the rifle. Richard Burton, Richard Beymer and the boots of the dead German. Red Buttons hanging from the Cathedral. Paul Anka, Fabian, Robert Wagner, the landing in Normandy. This film remains one of the best, from every angle, films of its kind."

","I'm old enough to have seen this epic when it was first released and, even as a nine year old, I was impressed. It was the great Daryl Zanuck's last hurrah and a fitting one (not his last film - just his last worthwhile film). <br/><br/>This is a great film. It's not perfect but its faults are few and minor. For me the most glaring fault is the amateurish delivery by the actor (a near ringer) portraying Ike. Also, the very beautiful actress portraying the French resistance fighter is wearing a very 1960s hairdo (a common problem with Hollywood films).<br/><br/>I see this film every memorial day. It helps me to remember my father, a Navy gunner's mate in the Pacific theater and my maternal grandfather, an island-hopping Sgt. in the Marine Corps. Personally, as a veteran, I find this movie as realistic as I think it was possible to be in 1961.<br/><br/>Is it the best American war film? No. I would place it in the top 10 alongside the following:<br/><br/>1. All Quiet On the Western Front (1930) 2. Platoon (1986) 3. Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) 4. In Which We Serve (British - 1943) 5. Patton (1970) 6. They Were Expendable (1945) 7. Twelve O'Clock High (1949) 8. Paths of Glory (1957) 9. Grand Illusion (1940?) 10.The Longest Day (1962)"
"windsong05","Null","10","11","6 January 2007"," Not a fair comparison
","THE LONGEST DAY is one of the if not the greatest World War II movie epics. However, it is unfair to compare it to Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. To do so would really be comparing apples and oranges. Spielberg's movie was meant to convey the gore and horror of war and succeeded quite admirably. In THE LONGEST DAY, which was shot in semi-documentary style, Zanuck's intent was to show the monumental effort involved, on the part of the allies, in mounting a successful cross channel invasion. In that regard this film also succeeded quite admirably. It should be regarded more as a history lesson rather than as simply dramatic entertainment. The historical value of the film far outweighs any minor dramatic licenses taken by Zanuck."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","54","74","17 June 2006"," The Cast & The Actual Event: Overwhelming Numbers
","This was an another one of these all-star casts that you don't see in more modern times, in which about everyone who was actor made an appearance....or it just seems that way. For those unfamiliar with this film, take a look back on the main page here and check out the famous names in this movie. Click the ""more"" under the cast overview and you'll see all the names. It's unbelievable. Some of them, to be fair, had very short roles in here, such as Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger and Roddy McDowell, but this is a real ""Who's Who"" of the acting profession in 1962. There are also a lot of German actors in here speaking German (with subtitles provided), perhaps numbering even more than the English-speaking stars. That's because the famous day of June 6, 1944, is seen from both sides of the conflict.<br/><br/>At three hours, it gives you plenty of D-Day World War II action. Almost two-thirds of the movie involves action from that famous invasion. In some spots, it just gets to be too much. Frankly, the whole film is too much and almost bogs down in too many areas....and it shouldn't, but it is a very technical film. And, for a film 45 years old, the action is pretty realistic. I thought the best shots were the overheads during one particular scenes when the Alies were going through a town.<br/><br/>I am anything but a WWII expert so how much detail of the infamous 'D-Day"" here is correct, Since they went into such detail, I'll assume they were fairly accurate. I can't say but this movie educated me on the size of the task. I had no idea ""D-Day"" was this huge in scope: three million men and 5,000 ships??!!! Amazing."
"keith-207","Null","6","6","10 December 2002"," A great film within its context
","The Longest Day works on several levels - the most obvious being the ""don't blink or you might miss several"" nature of the Star-Studded cast. Much of the cast works very well (Sean Connery's little comedy double act with Norman Rossington is an unexpected highlight). Some less so, and some is just downright tokenism - Rod Steiger getting all of 43 seconds on-screen for example. But overall, it's always a watchable movie - beautifully shot.<br/><br/>Some previous comment have surprised me, particularly the assertion that The Longest Day is, in any way, a ""pro-war"" film. I'm not sure if there *is* such a thing, but if there is then The LOngest Day certainly doesn't fall into this category - the scene of bewilderment between Richard Burton and Richard Beymer at the end about the confusion and directionlessness of war is the perfect example, ending with the memorable line ""I wonder who won"".<br/><br/>
I'm also surprised that a European reviewer should have accused this film, of all world war II movies, of being American propoganda. I wonder how many other WWII films include both German and (almost unqiuely) French perspectives of the war to such an extent that almost half of the dialogue in them is in a language other than English. I find the German sequences in The Longest Day to be amongst the most interesting historically and dramatically.<br/><br/>The film is certainly as accurate as it's possible for a fictional movie to be - the list of advisors that it had working on it should prove that - including many people who are portrayed by actors in the movie itself. These include the characters played by Peter Lawford, Richard Todd and Kenneth More, along with several of the German field officers. Little touches that seem utterly out of place (like the nuns procession through the French village bringing a temporary ceasefire) are actually historically spot-on.<br/><br/>The final problem for the modern reviewer, of course, is the inevitable comparison between this film and Saving Private Ryan. But, as several other contributors have noted, SPR is not only the product of a different age with a different view of these events - historical as opposed to something which happened so recently that half of the audience are likely to have lived through them. But, ultimately, something usually forgotten about Operation Overlord is that Omaha Beach was merely one battle of a very long day indeed. Americans tend to focus on it because of the death toll, but the taking of Utah, Sword and Gold were just as important to the overall outcome. The Longest Day is a film about five beaches, many battles, and many men - some, as Richard Burton says, dead, some crippled and some lost. It is an anti-war film which proves that you can be anti-war and still celebrate and acknowledge heorism. The heroism of the young American and British troops, falling face-first into the salt water of the Normandy killing grounds. The incredible bravery of the Rangers who scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Luc on and, ultimately, meaningless mission.

","Quite simply the best film ever attempted on this subject. The events leading up to the D Day invasion in France are meticiously viewed from the French, British, German and American sides. The dialogue is spoken in the national languages of the countries taking part in the invasion and this aspect alone elevates it high above most other films. The superb black and white photography adds yet another layer or realism . Cast features many international stars, but never stoops to a ""spot the stars"" formula like too many of these films tend to do.Clichés are avoided and the people portrayed are realistically drawn. Even the Germans are presented as actual military leaders and not the stereotypical Nazi villains . There are massive invasion scenes, quieter scenes at the villages before the raid, and a commando raid on a German howitzer emplacement in the basement of a casino, a scene that follows the attacking Allied group from an ariel perspective while they move through town past the docked fishing boats and destroyed buildings. The overhead shots of the beaches with hundreds of troops, tanks and landing craft gives the viewer a very accurate picture of the massive scale of the invasion, something that Spielberg just could not pull off in ""Pvt Ryan"".A three hour film that is up for repeat viewings. You will discover something new each time you view it. The screenplay was by the author Cornelius Ryan from his own book.No silly romantic subplots, just the facts. I remember seeing this film after it opened with my father and uncle. It was impressive then, and it holds up beautifully today. In my humble opinion, this is the best WW11 film ever made. One of the greats."

","Darryl F. Zanuck's THE LONGEST DAY is indeed long, has over 48 international stars, 3 directors, and took about 2 years to make.  1962 was the year of the epic as far as the 1960's were concerned and this exceptional film is no exception.  No cost was spared.  Some good war sequences mixed with stock footage of WWII effectively present a version of D-Day, June of 1944.  We see it from the German perspective (in sub-titles), the American plight, and the rest of the Allied forces.  One problem:  If you are seeing the film for the first time AFTER watching SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, you may come out disappointed.  The war scenes are well-crafted, however, the piercing reality is missing.  I tried to watch it as objectively as I could, but it is hard, considering the impression Spielberg's version of D-Day left on me.<br/><br/>The soldiers are led by a variety of huge name actors.  John Wayne is a no-holds-barred Captain who will fight, broken foot or not.  Henry Fonda plays Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. looking not to be treated as the son of an ex-president.   Bob Mitchum is great as a cigar-smoking officer of the U.S. raid on Omaha Beach.  The only problem is authenticity.  The actors look good and realisticly war-like, however, they are kept in frame to showcase their talents and they never seem to be near death.  This is by no means an anti-war film like RYAN.  It can be harrowing at times, but watching Richard Burton, Sean Connery, and Rod Steiger deliver cameo-like performances (meaning they know they are only on-screen for a short time) was a bit contrived and distracting.<br/><br/>Overall, I did like the movie.  It is greatly detailed and it lets you know exactly who each actor is playing.  This is pure American propaganda, but it is still exciting.  Too many fearful war experiences are handled with kid gloves.  The grand spectacle of the top-notch production values as well as non-stop action  make the picture watchable, if only once.<br/><br/>RATING: 7 of 10"

","June 6th,1944. The Allied invasion of northern Europe begins along the Normandy coastline. In the early hours of the morning thousands of British and American paratroopers are dropped inland to secure strategic objectives, to be followed at dawn by the main assault force consisting of Americans (Utah and Omaha beaches), British (Gold and Sword beaches), Canadians (Juno beach) and French (attached to the British at Sword). By nightfall it is hoped that the troops will be moving off the beaches and linking up with the Airborne forces inland.<br/><br/>   This multi-faceted account of the D-Day landings was a mammoth undertaking in its day. Adapted for the screen by Cornelius Ryan from his book of the same name, it is a very detailed look at the events of that momentous day in history. Every angle is covered, from the commanders, planners and soldiers to the French underground, civilians and the German defenders. The cast list reads like a who's who of international cinema at the time, to the point where this can detract from the drama of the events at times. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the production is staggering in its scope, most of it filmed on the actual battle sites where possible. In terms of cost, this would surely be impossible to film these days.<br/><br/>   There are a couple of drawbacks, however. Some of the dialogue leans toward the corny at times, especially by todays standards. Also, since the release of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band Of Brothers' the landings on Omaha beach and the parachute drop sequences look tame and rather antiseptic. This isn't a criticism of the production, so much as a comment on how the film is starting to show its age.<br/><br/>  On the plus side there are some very well executed sequences. The scaling of the cliffs at Point du Hoc by the US Rangers is one, and the storming of the town of Ouistreham by French commandos is another. This is probably the most breathtaking scene in the entire film, as an airborne camera tracks the commandos through the streets and ends up circling a German machine gun nest on top of the casino building.<br/><br/>   The film needs to be viewed in its original widescreen aspect ratio to fully appreciate its epic scale. The DVD print is a beautifully clean transfer in the original black & white. I, and I suspect many others, got quite a shock a couple of years back when I tuned in to watch it on TV, to find it has been digitally colourised. In truth this version looks quite good, but it's not available on DVD.<br/><br/>   Despite showing its age a little, 'The Longest Day' remains one of the great World War Two films, and is still the definitive cinematic account of D-Day."

","In 1962, almost post studio system 20th Century Fox was in trouble. Almost broke because of the cost of making then in-progress Cleopatra, they were in a similar fix with filming ""The Longest Day"". They had been churning out a series of small films with small stars that were losers at the box office. Turn on Fox Movie Channel Retro if you want an object lesson in their sorry output during the late 50s/early 60s. Enter stage left Darryl F. Zanuck, former head of Fox studio, who had left the states in 1956 to make a series of loser films in Europe with his girlfriends who were loser actresses. He argued how he could rescue The Longest Day to the board of directors, and the job became his.<br/><br/>The result is a great film in the tradition of old Hollywood - Zanuck's kind of Hollywood - that entertains on a grand scale, telling the story of the Allied invasion of France with a star studded cast. The big stars of the day were all there, with special billing for John Wayne. The cast includes Eddie Albert, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Sean Connery, Red Buttons, Steve Forrest and Leo Genn. Unbelievably Sal Mineo and Roddy McDowell get into the act too. And there are many others.<br/><br/>There are many stories being told in many places from the viewpoints of the Allied soldiers, the Germans, and the French resistance prior to the actual invasion. We don't get to follow the stories of all of these people to the end, but each story gives us a slice of life and produces a great and compelling story of the overall invasion. You don't know who is going to get cut down suddenly, who is going to make it, and who is just going to be the victim of just plain bad luck. It is all part of the horror of war. Highly recommended. It is a long film, but it is also an engrossing one."

","Despite being a classic war movie THE LONGEST DAY is very flawed as a production . Did someone say there's just too many stars in this movie ? If so I agree . Look at the way they're introduced , Mister big name movie star has back to camera , he turns round and wow we're looking at a big name movie star . All this is somewhat distracting . <br/><br/>It should also be pointed out that many of the cast are let down by Corneilus Ryan's script . Ryan wrote the definitive account of the last year of the war via his trilogy THE LONGEST DAY , A BRIDGE TOO FAR and THE LAST BATTLE , he was a truly great historian but it's obvious he couldn't master the technicalities of screen writing , his characters are more like caricatures with the Americans all being butch and macho while the Europeans are somewhat eccentric save for a few Englishmen who have stiff upper lips . Like HG Wells with THINGS TO COME Ryan writes dialogue that sounds suspiciously like thought processes , an example being where the rangers fight their way into a bunker only to find it's a decoy and someone says "" You mean we came all the way up here for nothing ? "" . You can almost imagine the passage in the book saying "" it was obvious to the men who had survived the battle , so obvious that no one dare say it but they'd fought their way to the bunker for nothing "" <br/><br/>Despite that I will congratulate Ryan and everyone else involved in the production for pointing out that the 6th of June was a multi national effort to free Western Europe from the Nazi jackboot , Brits , Yanks and the Free French are represented ( Not sure about the Canadians but ? ) unlike the rather overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that seems to indicate that D Day was an American solo effort THE LONGEST DAY is far more accurate and subjective as to what happened on the day . The script also has the temerity to suggest that the allies didn't win the battle but the Nazis lost due to the military incompetence of Hitler . It should be remembered that despite the overwhelming fire power of the allies they could have easily have been massacred on the beaches and that the Normandy landings was probably the most complicated military endeavor in all of military history<br/><br/>A word of warning - If you ever watch this movie only see the widescreen version because the technical aspects are awesome . The outstanding scene is where a few Americans sit on a bunk playing cards and one of them stands up pleading "" Hey guys , anyone got five bucks , ten bucks , anyone got twenty bucks "" . At this point the camera quickly pans out and the sound crashes in making the audience realize that the scene is set in a billets with hundreds of soldiers . Needless to say this scene is totally ruined when it's watched on a scanned copy <br/><br/>THE LONGEST DAY is a flawed film but a great tribute to the men who fought in that campaign . As the veterans who fought there gather tomorrow for the 60th anniversary along with politicians who didn't have the guts to join the military but are very happy to use it for political gain I'd just like to say a big thank you to all the men who fought there . Thank you to one and all . If it weren't for you I wouldn't be here now"

You felt the frustration of the men and the determination to succeed. Their pent-up emotions after an interminable wait to begin were unleashed on the unprepared Germans. The jubilation of the French citizens displayed gave us a real example of a country waiting to be liberated. (Maybe Bush should watch this to see how it really is when people welcome your invasion.) Robert Mitchum led an all-star cast that must have included every major actor in Hollywood at the time. If you can't find a favorite, then you are just not looking hard enough.<br/><br/>A superb war film."
"tigerman2001","Null","7","8","5 May 2002"," Defining the modern-day military epic...
","**Possible spoilers ahead, though we all know how the story eventually ends (having read the book)WWII, that is.**<br/><br/>Those who dismiss this film in the wake of ""Saving Private Ryan"" are missing the point.  Yes, ""Ryan"" was a powerful piece of film- making, but ""The Longest Day"" has a far more epic scope and concerns itself with providing a more complete picture by telling the stories surrounding D-Day from the perspective of British and American troops, French troops, German troops, and French resistance fighters and civilians.  Continual involvement of the higher command officers, particularly among the Germans, helps give the viewer a sense of the 'big picture' that was probably unknown to most on the ground involved in fighting.<br/><br/>This blending of the strategic picture and vignettes from individual soldiers -- many of them underscoring alternately the horror, the futility, and the absurdness of war -- was a prominent feature of Cornelius Ryan's book upon which his screenplay is based.  The same is true of the 1977 classic, ""A Bridge Too Far.""  And, yes, those more quirky scenes depicted in the film did apparently happen in real life, truth being far stranger than fiction could ever hope to be and war being sprinkled with absurdities of all flavors.<br/><br/>Attesting to the veracity of this film is not only the fact that Ryan was responsible for its screenplay but that among the military advisors were a host of generals and other officers from German and Allied forces, most of them depicted in the film.  And some of those depictions were spot-on, in that the actors chosen naturally looked like or made themselves look like the historical figures (for example, the fellow who played Eisenhower looked more like the Allied commander than Ike himself did!).  The core story of ""Private Ryan"" is fiction; the totality of ""The Longest Day"" is fact.<br/><br/>Another difference between the two films is that many of the battle scenes in the 1962 movie were dominated by long-shots whereas the newer movie kept things tight and far more up close and personal.  This difference reflects the difference in the films' scopes:  big-picture versus small; divisional action and objectives versus platoon-based action and objectives.  On the subject of long shots, some of the sweeping tracking shots (especially of the French commando raid, but also of the assault on Omaha Beach and in a few other scenes) in this film were pretty incredible.<br/><br/>""The Longest Day"" shares another essential similarity with the later ""A Bridge Too Far"" in that both feature the proverbial 'all-star cast.'  I'm not sure that similar assemblages of talent and 'big names' have been cast for the same project since ""A Bridge Too Far.""  Although it can be a tad disconcerting to see a famous actor occupy a tiny chunk of screen time, apparently underutilized, the approach does get across the idea of the sum being greater than any of the parts.<br/><br/>As for charges that ""The Longest Day"" was a pro-war filmI don't know where that comes from.  And that's even WITH John Wayne being among the cast!  The fact is that camaraderie and certain positive aspects of human character become magnified during war just as the more negative aspects do, and elation over triumphing over adversity is not something that should surprise viewers who might wonder why some of the soldiers appear happy at times.  Also, bear in mind that many of the troops were relatively inexperienced in battle and that they were embarked upon the 'greatest adventure of them all,' finally delivering the enslaved nations of Europe from the grasp of tyranny (etc, etc).<br/><br/>Heroism is real, too, no matter what motivates it.  Moreover, the inherent waste and tragedy of war was -- despite relying less on overt gore than is now the custom -- a current that ran through the entire film, perhaps being most obvious in such scenes as those concerned with the accidental dropping of members of the 82nd Airborne Division in Sainte Mere-Eglise and the US Rangers' incredible (and ultimately pointless) scaling of the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc.  I was surprised, when I saw ""Private Ryan,"" that Steven Spielberg had included a scene that showed American soldiers killing prisoners.  I'd forgotten that a similar incident was included in ""The Longest Day"" (the GI responsible mused about what ""bitte, bitte"" meant, but surely he knew what arms raised in surrender meant).  It's to the film-makers' credit that the German cast are (in addition to being allowed to speak German) portrayed as real human beings, with emotions, concerns, and real problems with those who command them.<br/><br/>In summary, this film is far from supplanted by ""Saving Private Ryan.""  The Spielberg film is an incredible one, and worthy of the accolades accorded it, but its existence does not relegate ""The Longest Day"" to the scrap heap.  The two films complement one another and together provide a remarkably full picture of what happened in Normandy almost 60 years ago."

","I have spent years studying World War II, particularly in France. I have walked Omaha Beach and climbed the cliff - with no one shooting at me from the top. I have walked around the square in St. Mère Eglise. In other words, I know something about D-Day.<br/><br/>That allowed me to be impressed by Zanuck's effort to recreate a moment in history. But, with all due respect, this movie comes off, to me, as something of a dramatized documentary, a history lesson with cameos. It is great for learning about how we finally made it across Omaha Beach, for example, and up that cliff. But it pales next to the opening of *Saving Private Ryan* when it comes to making you feel as if you are there, one of those poor soldiers in the first waves trying to cross that beach.<br/><br/>The acting is all fine, the ""staging"" of the scenes, especially Omaha Beach, very impressive. I could have done without the brief cameos designed to make the French civilians look foolish, as in Bourvil's portrayal of the mayor of Courville.<br/><br/>You will learn a lot about D-Day from this movie - though not as much as if you read any good book on the subject. The movie, being a movie, leaves us with all sorts of questions. Like: why didn't the Allied air force destroy those pillboxes at the top of the Omaha Beach cliff before we landed on the beaches down below. Why didn't we have better info about German positions in the area? Etc."
"gab-14712","8","4","4","12 October 2018"," A Good War Film That Could Have Been Great!
","1962's The Longest Day is one ambitious, comprehensive war movie. The care that was put into the film making it as realistic as possible is very commendable. With that realism in place, I think the movie suffered just a tad bit. The movie is three hours long, and there are long stretches of build-up leading up to the famous Allied D-Day landing in Normandy. That said, the rest of the movie works well and I really liked the ambition put forth into the film. The film had the largest budget for any black-and-white film, a whopping ten million dollars (a lot for its time). It would hold that title until 1993 when Schindler's List came along. The film made use of many famous actors from all around the globe-48 actors to be exact!<br/><br/>One of the things the movie does differently when compared to other films is that it is divided into different sections. Each section represented a different country and was directed by a person from that country. The main sections were the United States-directed by Andrew Marton, England-directed by Ken Annakin, and Germany-directed by Bernhard Wicki. Every section had their own actors. For example, the American scenes featured John Wayne. There are also some scenes regarding the free French resistance. Unheard of for its time, each of the foreign countries (Germany, France) spoke in their own countries and English subtitles were used. I think this format enhanced the movie as we see what both sides are doing and thinking regarding the war. <br/><br/>It's June 1944 and Europe has been battered with an unusual amount of storms. The Allies made plans to invade France with Normandy as their chosen location. On the other side of the coin, Nazi Germany believes the Allies won't make any move because of the weather and if they do, they would land in the French town of Calais. The Germans think wrong, and General Dwight Eisenhower decides to make the move. <br/><br/>I was impressed with the acting. Usually if 48 renowned international stars would appear in a movie together, things would get rushed. Give credit to the movie-the actors were used well. No one stood out-and that is the point! If I had to single out any actor for their performance, it would be John Wayne. Who can forget John Wayne going into battle on crutches. But listen to some of the actors in the cast: Wayne, Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Kurd Jurgens, Henry Fonda, and the list goes on and on. <br/><br/>On the technical side of things, The Longest Day works. Even though there are some long stretches of nothing, there are some great battle scenes. The Normandy landing is quite impressive and so is the parachute drop. This was a film that had assistance from people who actually fought in the war, so they filmed the movie to be real as possible. The sound and the visual effects are rather impressive. The movie was filmed in docudrama style and it would make a great education tool. Despite the impressive look of the Normandy landing, it will not hold well when compared to the D-day landing depiction in 1998's Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>Overall, The Longest Day is a solid war movie. It could have been a great movie if it was not hindered by its length. Some tighter editing would have done the movie favors. The movie is based off the acclaimed bestseller by Cornelius Ryan and he also wrote the script which was a good one. I liked the tone of the movie and how ambitious it tries to be. If you like war movies, definitely give this film a shot. <br/><br/>My Grade: B"

","Biggest takeaway from this mammoth all-star war movie about d-day is that the boys playing with their toys were just having so much fun. The absolute scale and seriousness of the game they were playing only emphasized the complete, male testosterone driven idiocy of the whole thing. I thought, when it was over, thank god for Einstein, thank god for Fermi and the Manhattan project, thank god for nuclear weapons which bring the masters of war directly into the line of fire. Hopefully no one is so crazy as to commit suicide (and racial suicide) by starting another world war. Because there can never be a WWIV -- WWIII will, if it happens, be the very last world war.<br/><br/>Actually 'The Longest Day' is a terrific flick. The Germans, other than hitler, are treated with respect. As honorable, worthy adversaries. No one is inherently evil or good. The multiple storylines flow smoothly. The action is intense and realistic without being unnecessarily drenched in blood and exploding body parts like a more modern movie would feel compelled to be."

","The Longest Day (1962)<br/><br/>This is an ambitious movie, extremely well photographed, filled with stars and secondary actors of fame and talent. And it covers roughly at 24 hour period leading up to and into the epic and dramatic June 6, 1944 invasion of German-held France known as D-Day.<br/><br/>On all these levels, the movie almost has to succeed. And it does. It's a popularizing account of an important event. It's history made simple, for sure, but it compresses the complexity with good intentions, and with some fair handling of both the German and non-German sides of the battles, inside and war rooms and on the beach.<br/><br/>The movie is filled, however, with so many characters (maybe fifty who are given enough camera time to take on some small meaning, though the poster advertises ""42 International Stars"") and shot in so many locations (Germany, France, London, on boats, on beaches, in villas, by the bridge, in the bunker, in the strategic commands, along the roads, flying overhead, on and on) it is truly impossible to engage in any one part of it fully. Many scenes are superb, even short ones, sometimes with great actors like Robert Ryan playing with a light on his face (in a comic scary way) and sometimes with unknowns who for a moment shine in their terror. But it's necessarily fragmented and dispersed.<br/><br/>There are, furthermore, attempts at humor that are a welcome break to the seriousness but are sometimes too silly and improbable to really make sense. It's like the humor that perks up little moments in a Chris Nolan Batman movie--except this is real life, this is the real D-Day and not an entertainment. You don't expect a documentary, exactly, but the levity--even if as cute as a young Sean Connery goofing on the beach as bullets fly around--is a bit off target.<br/><br/>The fact that this kind of movie works this well is probably amazing. It even got divided between different directors, and so the unifying qualities show a kind of logistical planning that paid off. (There are only two cinematographers and, crucially, one editor.) And of course there is history holding it together.<br/><br/>And this is a history that is getting lost. Fans of WWII movies (or of WWII history) will have no trouble feeling the grand, world-changing nature of D-Day. I grew up on American movies and around my parents and grandparents who had strong feelings about the war and about D-Day in particular. But young people, like the students in my classes at college, often born fifty years after the fact, have sometimes not even heard of D-Day. Many don't know a Nazi from RAF officer, even in concept. (I'm not kidding. I ask, routinely.) This is just life. Blame education if you want, but it's a natural movement forward to more recent and still living world events. We had D-Day, they have 9-11.<br/><br/>I watched the movie with my girlfriend who is not from the States, and who knew only the outline of the war. (Her country wasn't involved in it enough to make a dent on its own history.) And so she watched with a kind of dulled boredom. The cameos by famous people were fun for both of us, and filming was to be appreciated, but the drama I felt even with the opening credits I saw was dependent on knowing the larger scope. <br/><br/>And so this movie will have a shrinking audience and shrinking appreciation over time. It's a long watch--three hours--and it has a steady stream of great moments. But it's not a great movie in movie-making terms. Exciting and important and with a wikipedia page to make this all clear, but it's unlikely to fully integrate and take total form as a whole."

The film in comparison to say Saving Private Ryan is not a single layered narrative, unnecessarily emotional or utterly ignorant that other countries other than America actually participated, it even notes that Britain were in the war before America!!!! Perhaps this film does not have the special effects that Private Ryan does have (to its credit)but this aside it certainly makes up for it in every other area. The sheer fact that this was the most expensive black and white movie until Schindler's list is testament to that. The advisers on this film were actually there and helped draw the plans themselves, yes it is a drama, but when considering history please don't disregard fact for the want of a better plot (Spielberg) If you like war movies then this is the king of the genre, if you have never seen a war movies or dislike them, this may just about change your mind.

Secondly, this film mentioned the turning point of World War Two in Normandy from both sides of Allies and Germany. You can see the whole picture not just from the European Allies but also from the German's point of view. If you watch this movie carefully you can also learn something happened in the battlefield. In addition to it, the intelligent department, weather forecast department and underground fighting force were described well enough in this movie. Thirdly, the way the actors behaved, the costumes, cinematography and special effects are very good. The soldier’s costumes look like the real one, making someone’s feel that the movie is real.

In 'The Longest Day' we see small stories, and big ones. We see Americans, Brits, Germans, and view the conflict and the issues from all sides. There is pathos and humour.<br/><br/>Directed with a sure hand by Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton, this film represents one of the best of its kind. Well written by Romain Gary and James Jones, it makes you think about what really happened during those momentous days of World War II. And for those of us who had family members who were involved in D-Day, this film does its bit towards making us proud of their contribution."
"tfrizzell","Null","5","7","8 December 2001"," The Original World War II Combat Epic
","""The Longest Day"" is an outstanding epic which could be best described as the ""Gone With the Wind"" of war films. An amazing production which had five directors and five screenwriters, it is an intense film which lasts three hours and tells the story of the D-Day invasion from five different attack angles. John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton and Robert Mitchum are all super as the primary characters. However, the supporting cast has a diverse range of actors such as Sean Connery, Red Buttons, Sal Mineo, Robert Wagner, Stuart Whitman, George Segal, Robert Ryan, Roddy McDowall and Jeffrey Hunter. This was the definitive World War II film before 1998 when it was dethroned by both ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", but make no mistake of it ""The Longest Day"" is still outstanding in every way imaginable and it continues to stand up well as the years go by. 5 stars out of 5."
"classicsoncall","8","2","2","31 March 2012"," ""For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day...""
","Watching and analyzing the film today is surely a study in contrasts given the half century since the film was made. A ten million dollar budget back in the early Sixties was certainly a considerable sum, but even accounting for inflation, doesn't hold a candle to seventy million for ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) or the hundred twenty five million dollars spent to produce ""Band of Brothers"" (2001). Then there's the decision to film the picture in black and white, kind of surprising to me as I'd never seen it before until today. Not knowing the history of the picture, I don't know what went into that decision, but I thought about it throughout.<br/><br/>With an all star cast led by John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Henry Fonds (all on the CD cover), it's surprising to note that each of them had relatively little screen time given the scope of the movie. And it is a rather large scope when you come down to it, alternating it's scenes with Allied planning for the invasion, German preoccupation with downplaying the Allied resolve, and the parts played by American, British and French forces on that fateful day. One is regularly struck by the incredible confluence of planning, timing, good fortune and sheer luck that played a part in the events of Operation Overlord. Interestingly, that term was never used in the story unless it got by me somehow.<br/><br/>Another treat for videophiles is the inclusion of so many cameo appearances by celebrity headliners of the day, and not all of them actors as it were. I managed to pick out Paul Anka easily enough, but reading the names of others in the cast like Tommy Sands, Fabian, Sal Mineo and George Segal caught me completely by surprise. I suppose I could go back and hunt them down but the three hour run time prohibits that, though my initial viewing didn't really seem that it took that long.<br/><br/>For sheer size and epic sweep of the film, ""The Longest Day"" is certainly a must for anyone interested in World War II and the events of D-Day. As best as can be compressed into a feature film, the picture does an admirable job of relating the horrors of war and the stake Allied forces had in executing a successful operation with America's entry into the War effort. Technically there are better made war films like the ones mentioned earlier, though not many offer the sheer scope of the numbers involved in planning this greatest military maneuver in history. For those directly involved with D-Day at the time, it surely must have felt as a German General remarked in the picture - ""We are living an historical moment""."
"virek213","10","2","2","11 November 2011"," THE LONGEST DAY--A Review In Salute To Veterans Day (November 11, 2011)
","What is there to say about 20th Century Fox and its legendary and cantankerous studio chief Darryl Zanuck's monstrous 1962 World War II epic THE LONGEST DAY that hasn't already been said? Taken from Cornelius Ryan's excellent book of the same name (with Ryan and various others working on the screenplay) about the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, an invasion officially known as Operation Overlord, THE LONGEST DAY shows how numerous elements of planning and chance helped bring about the single biggest military campaign in history, one that led to the eventual end of Hitler's Third Reich. And for this, Zanuck had assembled a massive crew in which three directors (the legendary Andrew Marton for the U.S.; Ken Annakin for the Brits; and Bernhard Wicki for the Germans), special effects men, and a huge cast of Hollywood stars put themselves in service of this epic true story.<br/><br/>While certain elements are inevitably fictionalized, notably elements of the landing itself (which, as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's opening sequence shows, wasn't a cakewalk by any stretch of the imagination), the film does capture the behind-the-scenes planning amongst the top men and officers on both sides of the conflict, including the Germans, whose soldiers are seen accurately in this film as basic foot soldiers just doing their job, and not the goose-stepping Nazi goons in Berlin who sent twenty million people, including plenty of their own, to their deaths. At three hours, this still may be a lot for people to take in, even if their attention spans haven't been warped by the sound and fury of war movies past and present. On the other hand, if the length of the film is a bit much, and the film itself is old-fashioned by today's standards, there is always that unbelievable gathering of Hollywood heavyweights to keep one's attention focused: John Wayne (who, ironically, never served in World War II), Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner, Edmond O'Brien, Robert Ryan, Sean Connery (just as he ascended to stardom as James Bond), Roddy McDowall, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Fabian, Richard Burton, Richard Todd, and tons of others. All of this was done at what was then considered an exorbitant cost of $10 million (though Fox had poured $40 million into CLEOPATRA at the same time, and almost went bankrupt doing so), and it became one of the biggest moneymakers of its day, as well as the most commercially successful black-and-white film until Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of war films of its time, THE LONGEST DAY, while stirring and stunning, doesn't make any heavy pretenses or apologies towards patriotism, because it was understood that Operation Overlord was an absolute necessity in order to save Europe and the world at large; as such, the gravity of the situation was enough to unite everybody. Those men who fought that day, regardless of their nationalities, are to be saluted for their courage and bravery; and even though it may have been surpassed by SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE LONGEST DAY still remains one of Hollywood's great war films, one to be remembered for many more decades to come."

","i grew up on this movie; my cousins and i would pile our GI Joes around the warm glow of the television to watch it on Sunday night and Monday night, since ABC couldn't show it all at one time... and we loved it. it gave us endless scenarios for our fearless troops to play out in the days to come, until the movie faded into memory (at least until the next airing!). then we got educated. we learned history, we read more books, we saw other films, and realized that not many of the men landing on the beaches were Robert Mitchum's age; not many Paratroops were John Wayne's age; most of them were barely out of their teens and not much older than we were in high school. it doesn't pack the visceral punch of the first 24 minutes of SPR, but it does cover MUCH more material in trade. i still watch TLD (i have it on VHS) but wish it could have been broken into more informative, fewer scenarios. i don't mind the odd cameos (Connery's was not truly a cameo; he still was a relative newcomer to stardom) and enjoy Germans speaking German."

It also said that he consented to do the part but the reason he didn't get it is that the make-up artists couldn't make him up to look like his same young self in 1944.  I find this rather hard to understand because, to me anyway, he didn't look that much different in the early 60s when the movie was made than he did in the mid 40s!

This ensemble movie is a classic and inspiring story of D-Day.  It successfully conveys the fog of war.  It also shows that the most carefully planned battle still must rely on rapid improvisation. The production values are outstanding and as I write this comment, I feel myself on the Orne River Bridge with the British Glider forces and hear the bagpipes in the distance which means Lord Lovat and the commandos are near by to relive the company of glider-troops who must ""Hold the Bridge, until Relieved.""

","Comparisons with SPR are pretty meaningless, as that film was not about D-Day, it was not an attempt at accurate historical reconstruction, and it was made very recently.  So The Longest Day stands or falls on its own. And on its own it is a brave, indeed impressive attempt to portray something that simply can't be done on a film.  Because it tries to show everything, it is inevitably episodic, and unless you know the details of the story first, pretty hard to work out who is who and what they are doing.  So I think it is no surprise that my 14 year old son didn't enjoy as much as I did.<br/><br/>But that said, its use of different languages, its lack of American jingoism, some marvellous scenes, and the sheer scale of the whole effort make it worth seeing."

The characters sound very sincere and involved, with a good mix of comedy and tragedy.<br/><br/>This was Hollywood honcho Darryl Zanuck's pet project for an anti-war drama, and it works very well. And the title music by talented music artist Paul Anka is very catchy. Sure, this hasn't got the high gross-out impact for a post-Vietnam audience that certain later efforts do (How could it?); but at dramatizing the situation, this is a lot easier to follow.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend that you try and see the colorized version as it's a lot easier to watch; especially in noticing scenic details and when reading the subtitles.

","The Longest Day (1962) is an Action/Drama/History/War feature about D-Day. The film shows the events of D-Day from the perspective of both the Germans and the Allied forces. The film was great. I enjoyed the acting and the casting of the film. One of the greatest assets of The Longest Day is the movie score. The songs are excellent and add to the plot of the film. Battle scenes are introduced with a beating of the drums.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are incredible and detailed. You are able to see dialogue between soldiers that would usually be left out in Hollywood renditions of important battles. You see what happens leading up to the battle, the plans that are made, the things that go wrong, and how the soldiers overcome obstacles and work to win the war. The scenery and acting are so vivid and authentic that you'll swear that you can smell the soldiers as they run through puddles of mud. The shots and bombs are so loud and destructive that you'll jump from your seat.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war movies or historical dramas. Although this film did not have much in the way of special effects due to the fact that it was released in the early 60s, the director still manages to create an intense and action- packed movie that will give viewers the perspectives of opposing soldiers at war."

So much has been said and written about this huge production, that it will be no wise to go repeating the many times written things of praise. Anyway, what is really great about this excellent movie? This is not banal, not pompous, not trite or clichéd. Instead, it depicts the war as multi-tiered, multi-faceted affair through the eyes of many simple men and women. What is Really great and really outstanding here, is the way the battle is shown - every little person made their humble effort in winning that horrible battle, and together, they won. The great cast of many actors show us all sorts of people - paratroopers, soldiers, nuns, Resistance fighters, partisans, officers, generals, sailors, miners - and they all commit themselves and do great and unimaginable feats of valor, courage and gallantry. The battle scenes are among the best I've ever seen and they mesmerize with their cold, brutal realism, with their excellent depiction and their impeccable effect. War is all hell, and it is clear here. Much can be said about each separate actor - they all did marvelously here. This is a grand example of a really great movie. Thank you"

","The Longest Day is a ambitious movie that tries to show everything that happened that fateful day, the D-Day. It is very long, as it is ambitious enough to tell the story both from Allied and German viewpoints, and do so at least in a plausible way, if not wholly truthfully. <br/><br/>That means a huge cast list, and it is a little difficult to keep track of everyone and their own little subplots. However, it also manages to deliver an overlook with each little subplot augmenting each other. As a story it is magnificent. Despite the known outcome it kept me on the edge. Helping is the for its time good effects and huge scenes with great masses of extras. It is very clear that few expenses were cut making this film. The huge cast also allows for a lot of famous actors appearing, most notably John Wayne, Richard Burton and Sean Connery, among many others.<br/><br/>Even though it is a little too long for my taste it was never boring or dull. It kept the tension and the interest by combining calm scenes with action filled ones. In that way there were never too much of either one.<br/><br/>The Longest Day is getting a little old nowadays but still keeps it place as one impressive war movie.

","This is, without doubt, one of the greatest American war movies made in the '60s, along with ''Battle of the Bulge'' and ''Where Eagles Dare''. It's well told from the different sides (Americans, British, French and Germans) and everyone talks in his own language (the French speak in French and the Germans speak in German).<br/><br/>The title refers to the D-DAY (6 June 1944), the day the Allied assault the Nazi-dominated France.<br/><br/>The movie can be divided in two parts. The first, with Americans and British that complain about the bad weather and about the ships and planes, and the decision of General Eisenhower to go ahead with the invasion on June 6, with the background sound of a clock: meanwhile also the Germans want to take some time because of the bad weather. The French Resistance receive their coded messages by radio and then they start their sabotage plans.<br/><br/>The second part starts when the two sides, Allies and Germans, are engaged in battle. My favorite part was the Pointe Du Hoc, because is full of action and thrilling scenes and with few actors that I like; Robert Wagner, George Segal, Fabian, Tommy Sands and even singer Paul Anka, that also wrote the theme song.<br/><br/>The scenery is great, from the beginning to the end; the beaches, that today are one of the most famous of France's camping sites, the farms with some animals (cows, doves and rabbits) that are indifferent of the soldiers, and Pointe Du Hoc itself.<br/><br/>The music score is also great, especially in the ending credits.<br/><br/>Shot in black-and-white and CinemaScope, The Longest Day is the excellent chronicle of the D-DAY, from the preparation till the ending of the beach invasion, with a remarkable line said here by Robert Mitchum ''Take me up the hill, son''.<br/><br/>In three hours Zanuck and the three directors (Annakin, Marton and Wicki) managed to tell all the scope of one day in every minimum detail, and with the greatest all-star cast ever seen in a war-movie. There are some, like Rod Steiger, Henry Fonda or a pre-007 Sean Connery that vanish after few scenes, but they are also convincing. While the biggest parts, like Robert Mitchum or John Wayne's, are also good, and surrounded by some famous supporting actors of those years. Wayne's co-stars are Steve Forrest, Tom Tryon and Stuart Whitman, while Mitchum's co-stars are Eddie Albert, Ray Danton and Jeffrey Hunter.<br/><br/>I want to talk about the roles and the actors that, for me, were the best in the movie: <br/><br/><ul><li>Irina Demick as Janine Boitard, the SEXY French Resistance leader, that succeed to distract two German sentries.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Robert Mitchum as Brigadier General Norman Cota, that never stops to give orders and rallying his men. His lines were the best, and were said with a right dose of cynicism.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tommy Sands as an US Army Ranger.He is the most bold of the Rangers and eventually kills some Germans in pacific state while he keeps company to a wounded Robert Wagner.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Eddie Albert as Col. Thompson. He reassures Mitchum saying that the rain will stop. Eventually he is convinced by Mitchum about the fact that the men have to battle despite the heavy casualties.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Stuart Whitman as Lt. Sheen. He is useful for John Wayne's men because he gives indications about the locations of the German outposts.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sal Mineo as Pvt. Martini. A brief role because he is killed in action.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sean Connery as Private Flanagan. A loudmouth soldier and always besides him Norman Rossington. Trivia: After this movie Connery became the first actor to play James Bond in ''Dr. No''.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Henry Fonda as Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the Brigadier General that arrives with the first landing craft at Omaha Beach.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>John Wayne as Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, who would participate in war actions and wouldn't stop to give orders to his men broken foot or not. He is the best actor in the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>I always watch this movie every 6 of June, the anniversary of the D-DAY. It's one of the best American war movies ever made, second only to ''Saving Private Ryan''. It also won two Oscars, for Best Cinematography and Best Special Effects. And watching this movie, even multiple times is a great experience. Must-see for all war movie fans!"

They got John Wayne to put the big name on the headline. But they also got pre-Bond Sean Connery. The German side of the story is also well represented.<br/><br/>The action is big. Without CG, the grand scale on the beach of the actual day is more hinted at than actually achieved on the screen. For example 'Saving Private Ryan' provides a much more visceral experience for the landing. The attack on the casino in Ouistreham looks great. Who can forget the nuns?

","The Longest Day is a long movie that tries to dramatize the events of June 6, 1944 - D-Day - and succeeds!!!! Here Hollywood actually succeeds in making a movie that stars ... the actual historical event. This is so uncharacteristic of Hollywood that it deserves special notice. Usually when Hollywood gets a hold of some historical event that it wants to bring to the screen, the event itself winds up becoming a mere backdrop to some insipid love story. This movie does not ... REPEAT ... DOES NOT ... do that. How the producers of this movie managed to stay so focused should itself be the subject of a movie. Nowadays if Hollywood did a remake of this movie, maybe one-quarter of the movie would be about the actual event and the remainder be about some dumb and completely impossible love story - for instance an American paratrooper who, of course, had never been away from his hometown until joining the army, and a young French women, who happens to be fluent in English (with a French accent of course), who are both hiding from the Germans while the invasion is going on ... and become guerrilla fighters and then ... lovers!!! (In reality, the French woman would have been a collaborator who would have reported the GI to the German authorities or her SS lover. After all, let's not forget Marshall Petain and Pierre Laval.) That's what Hollywood would do The Longest Day if re-made today. One other thing, it is tempting to compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan. This is like comparing apples with oranges. They're both war movies concerning D-Day, and that's where the comparison ends. What is for certain is that D-Day, June 6, 1944, was one of those momentous days in history that no amount of Hollywood embellishment can trump and that the brave soldiers who stormed onto Omaha Beach were the stars of the story and to portray it any differently would not only be artistically dishonest but disrespectful to the memory of those brave soldiers who participated in the event and in many cases made the supreme sacrifice."

There was great attention paid to details in putting this together, and as far as I can see it was pretty accurate in those details as well.

The film watches almost like a novel, in chapters, and skipping around different POVs German, American, French. Yes it is a ""victory march"", but it was 1961 when it was filmed. The US had emerged as a great new power in the world and they wanted to celebrate. There ARE German viewpoints written and filmed about these events that one can track down that DO tell a different story, but that doesn't mean this one is not as accurate as they could make it at the time. Popular history, as they say, is indeed written by the victors.<br/><br/>A great book to read, that in a strange way complements this film, is Stephen E Ambrose's ""Pegasus Bridge"".

I don't have a problem with any of this. The film's length - not a problem. If anything, I always want more. The historical inaccuracies - not a problem. There's a whole page of goofs listed on IMDb. I'm not a historian and I'm not about to let the fact that someone was carrying the wrong sidearm get in the way of my enjoyment. The number of cameos - not a problem. The only cameo that I feel is unnecessary is the one of Rod Steiger. I enjoy all of the others. The ""flag waving"" - not a problem. The Allies, of which the U.S.A. was a part, should be proud of their victory in WWII. The lack of realistic bloodshed - not a problem. The carnage depicted in Saving Private Ryan may be missing, but the atmosphere and ""feeling"" are still there.<br/><br/>In short, it's damn near a perfect film as far as I'm concerned."
"tyguy-2","6","4","6","14 August 2002"," Good docu-drama on the D-Day invasion
","The story of D-Day presented in a quasi documentary style.  This is a meat and potatoes serving that lays out the battle plans and shows them being executed, but without intense drama of a top rate war movie.  It works for me as a docu-drama more than anything else.  But as far as action and really capturing the atmosphere of the invasion, I think it falls short.  It had the feel of a civil war re-enactment rather than an intense battle.  I'm not saying we need gratuitous gore, but to really show the battle, we need to see guys wrenching in agony and more bodies on the beach.  We are given the impression that the invasion was not a messy affair.  I think this does a disservice to the people who were there.  Now the good things.  The movie pays quite a bit of attention to historical detail, from the German commanders who were at odds with the furher to the French resistance and even the 'crickets' the airborne troops carried.  One more thing I didn't like is there is a slight bit of comic tone thrown in here and there.  I think this detracts from the serious theme of the movie.  This is a very good movie, but like a supermodel who has a few blemishes, is not perfect."

","I have just come back from visiting the D-Day beaches, museums, memorials and cemeteries for the second time in 4 years. This time with my wife. I find the subject fascinating.<br/><br/>I saw this movie a very long time ago, I must have been a kid. I have just seen it with my wife, hoping to help her put some order in all the things she has seen in Normandy.<br/><br/>I was sadly shocked to see such poor acting and above all, extremely terrible directing for the English and American scenes and ""just"" bad directing for the German ones.<br/><br/>Other films from the same period and older portray battle scenes and the soldier soul with far superior credibility.<br/><br/>I can imagine the directors telling the poor actors ""look towards the horizon with dignified face"" and other rubbish of that sort. No attention to logic, coherent acting or historical research. This resulted in empty, soulless characters.<br/><br/>It was really hard not to turn the film off. The stupid comical acting in the middle of a battle made my whole body cringe. Why did they need to invent things like paratrooper John Steele hanging for 10 hours and being deafened by the church bells? That is not true and looked stupid! He was shot in the foot BEFORE landing, he was hanging there for ONLY 2 hours until taken prisoner by the Germans to be liberated by the 82nd and 101st Airborne. And he was not deaf for hours or days, he even said that the tension and the pain in his foot did not allow him to hear the bells. In the town of Sainte-Mère-Église you can read all about this. Do not rely on the internet because sadly it mostly considers the scenes on the film as historical facts.<br/><br/>And why did the actor play him as if he was a silly clown? I guess the directors thought that they needed some comedy in the movie in order to keep people entertained.<br/><br/>If they paid 1/4 million $ in 1962! to John Wayne to appear and ruin the movie, they could have used a small fraction of that sum on historical research or a proper director.<br/><br/>A positive note is that the Germans spoke German amongst themselves, and not English with German accent, which sounds imbecilic. The same applies to the other languages, although they are all very stereotyped.<br/><br/>Quoting freely from ""To Be or Not to Be"" (1942) what this movie has done to Cornelius Ryan's book is what the Germans did to Poland."
"classicalsteve","4","12","26","31 December 2007"," Visually Impressive but Suffers from Cliché Dialogue & Bad History
","During the couple of decades after World War II, Hollywood made movies about the war that were really fantasies disguised as histories. Many aspects about World War II are incorrectly portrayed in ""The Longest Day"". First, not all of the German high command were complete idiots. Second, not all the French were in favor of the allied invasion. And last but not least, it was not as easy for soldiers coming from the naval war carriers to hit the beach at Normandie. When it was released, ""The Longest Day"" was probably appropriate for its audiences who were only a stones throw away from the war and probably wanted to see escapist fair. However, 45 years later, the film does not uphold as well against far more realistic depictions of war such as ""Platoon"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", even ""Patton"". Except for a sequence in the latter part of the movie in which the allied forces move inland, much of the movie suffers from too many clichés, too many unrealistic situations, and dialog that has become almost laughable.<br/><br/>If someone who had never been taught anything about World War II were to see this movie, he or she might well believe that all the Americans were heroes, the English were constantly ingenious, the French loved Americans (and maybe the English too), and the Germans were a bunch of nincompoops. The problem may go deeper as this is the portrait that is often painted in US High School text books. The picture on this Hollywood canvas is over the top idealism in both directions. <br/><br/>It's hard to believe, based on this movie, that the Germans were smart enough to get their uniforms on correctly, let alone almost capture Europe. When the Germans learn of the shrewd moves made by the allies, their reactions remind me of the bad guys in the old Batman TV show. Or maybe Colonel Clink in Hogan's Heros. The Germans either blow their tops (I almost expected smoke to start coming out of their ears) or they dismiss what they're hearing. The movie shows a German lookout at the beach becoming frantic, dropping his binoculars at the sight of all the war ships. When he phones the high command, they at first insist that the allies don't even have that many ships before realizing the invasion is on and they go crazy. And the few references to Hitler make him seem more like a spoiled grammar school boy than one of the most feared men in the world. One officer says that the Führer is having another one of his tantrums. <br/><br/>The problem is the movie rarely breaks away from its own cliché rhetoric. The characters constantly talk about ""making history"" and heroism as if ground soldiers would say such things in the heat of battle. It just gets a little much. While the German high command are insulting each other, the American and British high command are portrayed as much more organized and deliberate in their actions. Robert Mitchum and John Wayne who play the high ranking officers at the ground level seemed like they were plucked out of a novel rather than portraying real people. Every line, every command, and every decision is prophetic. And the men obey their commands as if they came from Moses! And every time the allied forces were about to attack, a high ranking officer always prefaces it with a patriotic speech! Maybe that was a motivation to go and fight so you didn't have to hear another one!<br/><br/>The actual invasion at the beach is probably the weakest and least realistic aspect of the entire film. In reality scores of men were mowed down by gunfire long before they ever got to the beach. Here, about 1 in 50 seems to get hit by gunfire. I guess the Germans just weren't very good shots. Another rather insulting piece of Hollywood melodrama shows a Frenchman becoming overly ecstatic at the appearance of the allied forces at the Normandy beaches. (I guess he couldn't wait to get an autograph from a movie star, considering just about every major Hollywood talent was drafted into this movie, including Richard Burton and Roddy McDowell.) In reality, the attitude toward the invasion was more ambivalent. There were many French who were not thrilled with the allied invasion, but these diversities are never touched upon.<br/><br/>There are some good visuals in the film, and some great shots from above. Overall, a rather mixed movie that has a few moments of interest and a lot of cliché silly lines, and parts that are simply bad history. But as the old adage says, the heroes write the history. Or re-write it."
"flingebunt","6","8","16","19 May 2005"," Big Budget, Bad acting, little story...nothing in Hollywood ever changes
","The Normandy landings was one of the biggest military operations every undertaken. Capturing this in a single movie would be a great challenge. Unlike ""saving private Ryan"", ""The longest day"" is the story of the landings, not a story set during the landings.<br/><br/>It is perhaps overly ambitious, but when you consider that it was produced by the same person who was also making Cleopatra, then you will understand why it was attempted.<br/><br/>What we get is a lot of bad acting, as each big name star, who was paid only a small amount of money, tried their best to say what they hoped would be the most memorable line from the film.<br/><br/>There are some absolutely stunning visuals, great expansive continual shots of a different battles. These are interspersed with rather cheap, cheesy studio scenes.<br/><br/>My feeling is that the humour was forced in to make up for the stilted dramatic dialog. The result is rather uneven, but on par with the other big budget blockbusters of the time.<br/><br/>Like the big budget movies of today, it is both good and bad. It is not a classic. Some people praise this type of movie because it portrays the history of a moment, rather than impose a story in a historical context (it isn't saving private Ryan or pearl harbour). But ultimately the canvass is too big and the brush too small.<br/><br/>It also fails to provide a lot of the real facts for why things happened. One for people who like good old fashioned war movies."

","I knew this film was in trouble when near the beginning French model Irina Demick, playing a member of the French underground, rides a bike in a 1962 hairdo and makeup. If you were going for authenticity, don't let an actress appear with such an obvious joke of a hairdo. The rest of the movie is submerged in corny dialogue and wholesome soldiers who have the personalities of 8-year old cub scouts (Richard Beymer, Red Buttons) or of cranky lint bags (John Wayne, Peter Lawford, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum). The combat action depicted here is very weak - the horrors of Omaha Beach are not conveyed to any degree that would do justice to what had actually occurred there. None of the chaos and stark terror that is war is shown in this film - only down scaled, obviously choreographed, watered down nonsense. The beginning of he film showed promise, with the drum roll beating as the action shifts from the German fortifications - the marching soldiers, the German officer playing fetch with a German shepherd on the beach.....then we see Irina with her bubble-flip hairdo....and it's all downhill from there."

","A film at the height ?<br/><br/>Longest Day is an black and white film which tells the events of D-Day during the Second World War. This film realized in 1962, is an adaptation of the homonymous book of Cornelius Ryan.<br/><br/>This War film is co-directed by few directors: the English producer Ken Annakin who was charged to film the Britissh and French Exteriors, Andrews Marton(famous for Ben Hur) for the American side and Bernhard Wicki for the German episodes.<br/><br/>This film was also famous for his amazing casting of actors; we can recognize the well-known John Wayne, Robert Ryan, Richard Burton, the unforgettable Clint Eastwood, the French actor Bourvil. So the film is very attractive for fans (and it's a pleasure to look our favorites icons!) and a colossal amount of cash was used since the budget of the film overtakes the 10 millions of Dollars! The Longest Day is even on of first blockbuster in the story of movies.<br/><br/>This giant production tells during nearly three hours the episode of the Normandy Landing, the 6 June 1944. He was cut in different point of views, with mains and secondary characters. Unfortunately, the spectators can be lost although these richest perspectives, and the different camps and place of the film. But we can notice a positive point: each actor played in his own language. For example, the French actor Bourvil spoke in French, his native language. So, it gives a certain authenticity in the dialogue especially. The amazing performs of the casting bring the efficiency when the actors play faithfully their historical role. For example, we can salute Red Buttons in the role of John Steel(The parachutist who was hanging in the bell tower); he took inspiration thanks to the testimony of the real John Steel.<br/><br/>But, outside this good point we can notice in many reviews the cliché side of the French Underground or the Germans authority voluntarily ( or involuntarily!)parodied like the scene with the Geman who was wearing his boots upside down. Maybe to give a little irony in the war... I don't know. However this moment of comedy which lighten the dramatic tension of the film.<br/><br/>We can although congratulated the place of film which were faithful to the historical reality ( Remember-us the famous village of Sainte-Mère-l'Eglise in France), but we can also notice a gap: the scene of the Landing was turned in the beaches of Corse because the landscape stayed natural contrarily to the beaches of Normandy. Fortunately, the amazing aerial shot, (we have the impression to fly over the beach!), and the short scene of dialogue are lively with the face to face of the character. For example, when the soldier who is lost met an injured soldier who contemplate the corpse of the upside-down-boots German are speaking about the real sense of the life. I find this scene sums up the film: philosophers are speaking as for the uselessness of this war.<br/><br/>During the film, we can hear the fabulous music of Beethoven which the movement follows perfectly the script of the film. We can congratulate this choice mixed with drums which accentuate the tension and the imminence of the fight. The film begins of the image of a helmet on the beach and it closes on the same, like this war was useless...with the same music.<br/><br/>A negative point: the special effects. They are not bad for the time but the smoke, the explosions and just near a soldier in life...( always in a single piece!)<br/><br/>This film received two Oscars and it tells the war with excellent techniques , excellent actors and an excellent screenplay, but for the used budget we expected for it not less..."

","As a combat Veteran, I can truly say, for its time, is a very good movie. I seen the movie in 1962. My Dad fought at the battle of the Bulge and my great-uncle died shortly after D-day while on a patrol near there.
Seven years after this movie's release, I was a grunt in Vietnam. I mention my family's service only because of the use of John Wayne as the lead character.
Broke after his financing of his flop of a movie, The Alamo, he demanded and received $250,000,00 for his cameo appearance while actors who actually fought in the war received $25,000,00.
Wayne, unlike many of his fellow actors who volunteered to serve, dodged the war and spent his time making money off of it.
Regardless of my feelings of Wayne, this is a good movie and should be a must watch for younger generations.
Saving private Ryan is basically a spin-off if this film but the black and white filming easily separates the two."

","I hadn't got around to watching THE LONGEST DAY before now; I knew little about it, other than it featured an all-star cast and was about the D-Day landings. Having just watched it, I've been blown away by what I consider to be one of the most confident, assured, WW2 films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>THE LONGEST DAY is to D-Day what TORA! TORA! TORA! is to the Pearl Harbour attack. It covers the build-up and events of the day in minute detail in such a way that it never feels slow or overlong; indeed, there's so much going on here that this lengthy production requires the viewer's attention throughout. No time for nodding off as you'll be lost otherwise! <br/><br/>The all-star cast makes it a highly attractive proposition as a film, but really this movie would have worked just as well with an unknown cast, as it's so well written; exciting where it should be, tragic in places, and unexpectedly funny in others. Watching John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and the rest of the familiar faces wading their way through one of the most important days in 20th century history is a sheer delight. Needless to say this blows Spielberg's mawkish SAVING PRIVATE RYAN clean out of the water."

Well, yes, Hans, but only if you watch the whole thing.<br/><br/>Lots of guys who've done excellent work in films far, far from this one mark their time here imprisoned by an atmosphere of tremendous density, moving through cement in unhurried interiors that suck the life from even Rod Steiger - now that's a rare day - and in exteriors that seem designed to minimize whatever benefit may have been offered by fresh air. There's more lead in this movie's feet than in its guns. You think that's labored prose? Try listening to Richard Burton's Officer's Club scene.<br/><br/>At minute 6 this film is an unwatchably boring series of sea- and landscapes, photographed as if by remote control. By the time somebody speaks, it's in poorly translated French, then intermittently translated German. The first English we hear is bad wisecracks from a b-movie graveyard. Then Liz Taylor's best girlfriend Roddy McDowell recites a tender memory of camping with his Dad. Now you know you're in trouble, but wait: next a bunch of grumpy stars deliver bald exposition like men just awakened from dreams of not being in this movie. At minute 53 somebody finally shoots a German, but I'm already counting sheep named Tom Tryon, Fabian, Paul Anka... all-star has never meant so little. 120 minutes to go. Watching this movie may be the only experience painful enough to compare with actual combat.<br/><br/>American draft-dodger and armchair warhawk John Wayne is a dependably uninspired performer at the best of times, only coming to life when he plays an overbearing prick with a gun in his hand. This movie nefariously circumvents his only cinematic value by sticking him with the kind of up-to-speed dialogue normally delegated to Jeffrey Hunter (""...there's 3 million men in camps just like this one scattered all over this island...""), then breaking his leg so he can't move. Kind of like his real-life inertia while his fellow American Fascist Jimmy Stewart and co-star American Liberal Henry Fonda went off to win DFCs and Bronze Stars fighting three-dimensional Germans and Japanese.<br/><br/>There's one decent battle sequence, including an impressively executed 90-second aerial shot, when the French attack Ouistreham with the help of some nuns, but it's too little too late. Too bad. Overall it's the German interior scenes that come off best, with Blech, Wolfgang Preiss, and the unstoppable Curt Jurgens maintaining some sort of pace under the Prussian lash of Bernhard Wicki. This while Andrew Marton allows Robert Mitchum to stagger up Omaha Beach in a distracted daze, trying to remember where he stashed that third reefer. The scene reminds me of the Paul Verlaine line that signals the start of the whole operation. ""Monotonous langour"" should be this movie's epitaph."

","Nazi-Occupied France during the fifth year of the second World War, 1944, detailing the strategies of the British and American troops and their historic invasion on Normandy. One of those war epics which takes place in the 1940s and is written and directed just as squarely as similar movies from that era, with purple prose taking the place of real dialogue, and famous faces popping up just long enough for the audience to recognize them (there's Sal Mineo!) before the editor moves along to the next pedagogic vignette. The film is certainly epic-scaled, but the subplots early on involving the French Resistance and the decoy paratroopers are lumped together without much style. Critics usually trip over themselves with heightened accolades for well-meaning event-movies such as this (""A masterpiece!"" or ""The greatest WWII film ever made!""), but the portentous drum beat at the very beginning (and the star-sightings within the first ten minutes) signal what lies ahead: a commercial Hollywood package with 'a serious side', designed as a war document but really meant for mass consumption. The milieu seems right, and the Oscar-nominated cinematography is fine, but the dialogue is ripe with overeager passion, and the casting is certainly odd (John Wayne drawls his lines as if he were still out West, while Richard Burton appears intermittently to deliver bizarre, studio-set soliloquies on the atrocities of battle). The mechanics of the film are not very engrossing or surprising; there are brief flashes of weary war-time humor and some beautiful images, but there are no memorable characters or exciting sequences beyond the derailing of a train. Curiously, the movie is timid in dealing with the Nazis (is the word ever uttered?) and in showing the swastika symbol (it gets a close-up near the beginning, but is otherwise tough to spot). The bulk of the screenplay by Cornelius Ryan, based upon his own book, is given over to theatrical vitriol or melancholy, and all human interaction is woefully stilted. ** from ****"

With an initial domestic rentals gross of $17.6 million, ""The Longest Day"" was second only to Fox's own ""Cleopatra"" at the U.S./Canadian box-office for 1963. Although it was not generally released in the U.K. until late October 1963, ""The Longest Day"" took more money at U.K. ticket- windows than any other movies in 1963 except ""Cleopatra"", ""How the West Was Won"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"". <br/><br/>Oddly, though the movie was well-liked, it did absolutely nothing like this sort of business in Australia.

In actual practice, however, the lines of demarcation are somewhat blurred. Many Hollywood studios including M-G-M made a practice of nominating all the heads of their special effects departments, including miniatures. Other studios like Fox, RKO and Paramount included only camera personnel. So whether you received one of those prestigious Hollywood awards for your miniatures and painted backgrounds depended to some extent at which studio you worked at).<br/><br/>Also nominated for prestigious Hollywood awards for Best Picture (won by ""Lawrence of Arabia""); Black-and-white Art Direction (won by ""To Kill a Mockingbird""); Film Editing (won by ""Lawrence of Arabia"").<br/><br/>Best English-language Movie Release of 1962 — National Board of Review. 4th Best Motion Picture of 1962 — Film Daily poll of American film critics.

Number 2 on the N.Y. Daily News list and also on the Filmfacts composite list.<br/><br/>COMMENT: Although not listed at all in the official credits, Gerd Oswald directed some of the most effective episodes, including the searingly unforgettable sequence with Red Buttons. Zanuck himself directed the interior ship-board, plane-board and barracks-board scenes, while Elmo Williams handled most of the battle footage, and Wicki did a lot of memorable German work including of course that stunning D-Day bombardment scene with Hans Christian Blech. Though the story structure is necessarily episodic, the film retains our firm interest, partly because of the inventiveness of the writing, particularly its sharply realistic dialogue and colorful characterization; partly because of the movie's spectacular scope and breadth, plus all the stunningly-staged action; and partly because of the constant star-spotting. So far as actual acting goes, I thought the German players creamed the rest. Wayne and Mitchum are wholly their usual selves, but it's good to see Richard Todd in uniform again. Burton, however, is moodily dull, even with Donald Houston along to stooge him his cues.<br/><br/>OTHER VIEWS: The producer's actual battlefield experience is amply reflected in all phases of The Longest Day, for never before had Zanuck been so intimately involved in the making of any of his pictures. He worked with the writers, Ryan, James Jones and Romain Gary; spent long night hours planning camera angles and positions; talked ""strategy"" with the army and the navy; conferred with directors, sound men, special effects technicians, prop men and accountants. Even so, he was present, day after day, in good weather and foul. - Fox publicity."

","This movie does a great job of bringing such a massive logistical operation down to the individual level in several of the major components - paratroopers, infantry storming ashore, naval personnel on the ships, the generals trying to plan it all, etc etc.<br/><br/>Some have criticized it for not being explicit enough in the violence and others who say that it tried to do too much at once. I'd like to point out that this movie was released in 1962. That was only 18 years after the actual invasion. Hence, the audience knew the horrors of war - they'd lived thru it. If they didn't actually serve in combat, they sure knew men who did, maybe even knew one or two who died in combat. Hence, they didn't need to be shown all the gore that was shown in ""Saving Private Ryan"" cause they knew it far too well.<br/><br/>As far as the scope of the movie, one must realize the depth of the operation the movie tried to overview. To do that, the movie had to be long. To give each component of that massive scope a human element, yet provide insight into what it was like for the individuals involved, the movie had to be long and it had to involve numerous subplots to even come close to being representative.<br/><br/>And, here we are 73 years on from the actual event the movie portrays and this great flick STILL draws a great following.

","""The Longest Day"" may be the best historical film ever made about World War II in Europe. It has plenty of action. It gives a wonderful picture, from both sides, of the invasion of Normandy on D-Day. The Allies are anxious and restless as they wait in England for the word to go on June 6, 1944. The Germans are reticent and uncertain, knowing that an invasion was imminent. But when? Where? Finally, all the parts of Operation Overlord play out.<br/><br/>The largest armada in the history of the world set sail – more than 5,000 vessels headed across the English Channel for the coast of France. Shortly after midnight, more than 13,000 American paratroops take off for a night jump in the largest airborne assault in history to that time.<br/><br/>Few of the Allies met their objectives the first day. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their target sites. Americans met Germans entrenched with artillery and machine guns on cliffs high above Omaha and Utah beaches. At Gold, Juno and Sword beaches, the British, Canadian and French troops fought house to house in towns along the coast. Most of the airborne drops behind enemy lines were way off target and paratroopers were scattered across a large area. Yet, the Allies gained a foothold, confused and disrupted the enemy, and soon were able to move inland for the drive to defeat Germany.<br/><br/>There is nothing about the plot to give away – the story is well known. But the production of this movie– about such a major event in world history, begs a close look for its achievement.<br/><br/>The film is based on a book by Irish-American author Cornelius Ryan, who also wrote the screenplay. Ryan had been a war correspondent who was driven to write a book about the world-changing event. After a 1949 visit to Normandy, he began his research and interviewed more than 1,000 D-Day veterans. He finished his novel in 1959, and ""The Longest Day: 6 June 1944 D-Day"" was a huge best-seller.<br/><br/>Daryl Zanuck bought the movie rights for 20th Century Fox. More than a dozen of the senior veterans – American, British, French and German, were consultants on the film. More D-Day veterans were military advisers. The result was a movie that closely followed the real event. The film won two Oscars and had three more nominations for its technical excellence. It had a huge cast that included more than two dozen notable actors of the day – all who gave top performances.<br/><br/>""The Longest Day"" had a $10 million budget – the record for black and white films until ""Schindler's List"" 30 years later. The film was one of the first to record characters of different nations in their own languages. English subtitles appear in the German and French scenes. The movie was filmed at locations in France, including parachute scenes in Ste. Marie-Eglise. The beach landing scenes were shot on the Ile de Re in the Bay of Biscay off the coast of La Rochelle, France.<br/><br/>As with any war film, all of the aircraft and ships couldn't be the originals, or even of the same time period. But Zanuck found Messerschmitts and Spitfires in the air forces of Spain and Belgium, and he rented them for the beach strafing scenes. Only military purists will note the different equipment elsewhere that's not accurate.<br/><br/>The scenes of the invasion fleet were filmed in June 1961 during maneuvers of the U.S. Sixth fleet. It was then stationed in the Mediterranean. The film crews shot around the fleet's aircraft carrier because there were no carriers in the Normandy invasion. But 22 ships of the Sixth Fleet were photographed for the movie.<br/><br/>The movie opened in France on Sept. 25, in America on Oct. 4, and in Great Britain on Oct. 23. When it came out, I was serving in the 1/504 airborne of the 1st Brigade, 8th Infantry Division at Mainz, Germany. The 2/505 airborne was part of our brigade. I met some of its troopers who had been in the jump scenes for the movie. Ste. Marie-Eglise, France, has an Airborne Museum dedicated to the American paratroopers who helped liberate Normandy. The movie shows a company of the 505 that was slaughtered by the Germans when it was dropped right on the town.<br/><br/>Quite a bit is made about John Wayne's age in playing the part of Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, and I agree. By way of comparison to airborne commanders, the ages of most senior military officers are 15 to 20 years older. Those in this film – Allied and German, were mostly in their 50s. And, the actors who played them were very close in age. But, both actors who played the American paratroop leaders were way over age – and looked it. Wayne was 54 when he played his role – twice the actual age of Vandervoort who was 27 at the time. And Robert Ryan, at 52, was 15 years older than the real Brig Gen. James Gavin who was 37 at the time. This is a point worth noting.<br/><br/>In the 1945 movie, ""Objective Burma,"" Errol Flynn's character tells an older reporter that the paratroopers, including their officers, have to be young men to stand up to the rigors of airborne missions. ""Do you know how old the colonel is in there? Thirty-four. You know how old our commanding general is? Thirty-seven."" I appreciate and enjoy John Wayne and Robert Ryan as actors, but this is one time when the roles they played would better have been cast with someone else. Charlton Heston was supposed to have wanted the role that Wayne got. At age 39, he would have been good for either role. But, Paul Newman at 37 would have been just right as Gen. Gavin, and Steve McQueen at 32 would have been ideal as Vandervoort."
"GusF","Null","3","5","25 August 2015"," A thrilling and engrossing epic war film
","A largely historically accurate account of D-Day, one of the most important single days of the 20th Century, this is a thrilling and engrossing epic war film of a kind which is sadly not made anymore. Based on the 1959 book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan, it is a stirring tribute to the resourcefulness and bravery of the Allied strategists and combatants who ensured that Operation Overlord was a success. While it only covers the events leading up to the invasion and those of June 6, 1944 itself as to opposed to the rest of the campaign, there is a sense of ""a lot done, more to do"" as the film draws to a close. The film may be over but the war certainly isn't.<br/><br/>The film benefits from a very strong script and is extremely well directed by all concerned in both the quieter character scenes and the wonderfully shot battle scenes. In spite of its multiple directors, the tone of the film is very consistent and, had I not known already from my previous viewing, I would assumed that there had only been one director. The fact that all of the German and French characters speak their own languages rather than English also gives the film a great sense of authenticity. The film is extremely well paced and there was not a minute where I was bored. On the Allied side, D-Day was chiefly depicted from the British and American perspectives but I did like that there was an acknowledgement of some of the other forces involved such as the Canadians, the Free French and the Free Polish. Still, they could have done more with it.<br/><br/>There is a terrific sense of tension in the early scenes in which the Allied Forces are waiting to receive the word from General Eisenhower to launch the invasion in spite of the worst weather in the English Channel in 20 years. Eventually, it is decided to give the order as the conditions were unlikely to improve any time soon. There was talk of Eisenhower playing himself in the film but it was decided that he looked too old. The same was true of David Niven. I can't say that I'd really have cared in either case! The prelude to the invasion is also examined from the German perspective with Field Marshals Erwin Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt, played very well by Werner Hinz and Paul Hartmann respectively, being dismissive of the prospects of invasion due to the poor weather conditions and are consequently caught unawares when it does come. On the German side, the strongest response to the invasion comes from Generals Max Pemsel and Günther Blumentritt, both of whom served as consultants on the film as did Frau Rommel, among others. They were also lucky enough to be played by the two best German actors in the film: Wolfgang Preiss and Curd Jürgens. Preiss later played von Rundstedt himself in ""A Bridge Too Far"", incidentally.<br/><br/>The film has a very big cast which reads like a ""Who's Who"" of 1960s male film stars and almost all of them get a chance to shine. Richard Burton has a great cameo as the RAF pilot David Campbell, distraught at the death of the only other remaining member of his squadron from the Battle of Britain. He later turns up towards the end of the film after being shot down the previous night. Richard Beymer plays a cocky young private named Dutch Schultz who wins $2,500 gambling as he is waiting to be deployed. However, he has the reality of the situation brought home when he receives rosary beads from his mother. Cast against type, Red Buttons is excellent as Private John Steele, who was trapped on the church tower of Sainte-Mère-Église after his parachute became caught. Robert Mitchum has one of the more substantial roles in terms of screen time as General Norman Cota and gives a great performance as a general who cares about all of the men under his command. Henry Fonda, my favourite actor in the film, has a smaller role as General Teddy Roosevelt, Jr., who lead his troops onto Utah Beach in spite of his severe arthritis and died of a heart attack the following month. Jeffrey Hunter is very good as Sgt. (later Lt.) John H. Fuller, who does not survive the day sadly.<br/><br/>At 55, John Wayne, who probably had the biggest role overall, was twice as old as his character Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort was on D-Day but he is nevertheless more suited to the role than he was to that of Genghis Khan in ""The Conqueror"", the last film that I saw him in. He was certainly not a very good actor but he had a likable screen presence in most of his films and this one was no different. That said, the anguish on his face when he sees the bodies of parachutists who were shot down while attempting to land in Sainte-Mère-Église was the best acting that I have ever seen from him. In a case of art imitating life, D-Day veteran Richard Todd plays his erstwhile superior officer Major John Howard and took part in the assault on Pegasus Bridge as he did in reality. Other than those actors that I have already mentioned, I was impressed by Richard Münch as General Ernst Marcks (who turned 53 on D-Day but did not have a great birthday), Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Hans Christian Blech, Peter van Eyck, Roddy McDowall, Mel Ferrer, Rod Steiger, Edmond O'Brien, Kenneth More, Peter Lawford, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, Georges Wilson, André Bourvil and Irina Demick, who has the best role of any woman in the film as the French Resistance member Janine Boitard.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent war film which was deservedly nominated for Best Picture. It may not be on quite the same level as its companion piece ""A Bridge Too Far"" but it's not far behind either."
"bowmanblue","9","3","5","14 November 2014"," Possibly the greatest ensemble war movie ever made
","There's not much that hasn't been written about 'The Longest Day.' It's arguable one of the best World War II movies out there. It charts – predominantly – the 8th June (or 'D-Day' to most of us) when the Allies finally stormed their forces into France to liberate it from German rule, but the first part (of the film's near three-hour runtime) tells the story of the events leading up to the fateful day itself.<br/><br/>The film is generally an 'ensemble' with multiple actors appearing for – in some cases – quite brief periods of time. However, due to the general talent of the actors, that never really feels like a problem. Yes, I'm sure that any of them could have had an entire film made just about them, telling their individual story, but we have to make do with their minor performances. It's hard to pick a 'stand-out' performance as they're all so good.<br/><br/>Apparently, according to some who have lived through the day itself, the film isn't always factually accurate (and even a former President of America apparently left a showing due to technical inaccuracies). However, even if some creative liberties have been taken, it still gives a no-nonsense feel of what the troops had to go through when entering the French beaches and countryside for the first time.<br/><br/>Due to the film's length, there's even time to fit in some scenes with the Germans themselves. It's important to see what was happening on the 'other side' as it relates specifically to how the Allies managed to pull of the (overall) victory.<br/><br/>Of course it is black and white, so for those who find it unable to watch anything that isn't designed for 3D and/or IMAX will find it hard to take! The Longest Day may seem a little dated by today's standard, but, if you're a fan of war films, or are even just interested in what went on during World War II, then you should definitely check this one out."
"grantss","9","3","5","9 June 2014"," An epic among epics
","WW2 dramas do not get more epic than this. Massive in its scale, involving every nation and almost every operation and type of unit that took part in Operation Overlord. Thanks to this you get a true sense of all the planning, men and materiel involved in the invasion, and how they all fit together. By showing the German side you also see how the enemy feels, and how wrong-footed they were.<br/><br/>Not as realistically gory as Saving Private Ryan - such realism would never gave gotten past the 1960s censors - but such micro-detailed realism is not necessary here. The picture is more a strategic one, though you often get to see it from the eyes of average soldiers.<br/><br/>Mostly quite accurate, but there are some mildly-annoying inaccuracies. The portrayal of 27-year old Lt Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort by the 55- year old John Wayne is probably the pick of the bunch. Once the action starts, however, the mild inaccuracies are quickly forgotten, as you immerse yourself in reliving an event of massive historical significance.<br/><br/>In fitting with the epic nature of the movie, just about every actor in it with dialogue is a major star. About the only male superstars of the time missing are Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Orson Welles! Some of them, eg George Segal, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, have very minor parts and only have a handful of lines, but it shows just how deep the talent pool was in the cast of the movie.<br/><br/>Stirring, incredible, epic war drama."

You really felt that you were present in the time leading up to June 6, 1944, when Allied forces made the incredible landing on the beaches of Normandy.<br/><br/>Like me, I am sure many people reading this had family members that were involved (me - a Canadian brother-in-law) in this massive undertaking. To see the story from the standpoint of the men involved was a tremendous experience. <br/><br/>Yes, I've seen Saving Private Ryan, and the incredible carnage in the first 20 minutes, but I was just as moved by the same footage in this film without the blood. You felt the frustration of the men and the determination to succeed. Their pent-up emotions after an interminable wait to begin were unleashed on the unprepared Germans. The jubilation of the French citizens displayed gave us a real example of a country waiting to be liberated. (Maybe Bush should watch this to see how it really is when people welcome your invasion.) <br/><br/>Robert Mitchum led an all-star cast that must have included every major actor in Hollywood at the time.

"Roman-Nies","1","12","34","12 May 2007"," Popcorn Spectacel
","The Longest Day is popcorn entertainment, no critical analysis of what was going on. Nevertheless the movie gave that what the audience wanted. Movies are made for the box-office not for the critics. The directors developed some trouble to show both sides and one has to admit that in 1962 it was too close after the war to make a balanced film about the events. Who cares? At that time nobody in Germany would have raised a voice to put up a brave front. I read a lot about D-day and I visited the historic sites and find that the film shows the major lines about the day, but not really more, because even the details are not for real. The average soldier is anonymous besides the big shots"" (double meaning) . Well, you have to stay with the victors to have an idea about the purpose of it all. The movie was expensive and filled up with many stars of the time, but is it good? The answer is no as for a historical accuracy. The representation of the German side is simple and incorrect, as if it would not mater at all what was going on on this side. <br/><br/>It is shown the invasion from the viewpoint of the Allies. Therefore it is one sided. In retroperspective of a winner there is a lot that is stereotyped. The Longest Day suffers from the ""Hollywood"" treatment of historical events. Some characters are obviously composites; Richard Burton's Flight Officer David Campbell and Eddie Albert's Col. Newton are nowhere to be seen in Ryan's original book, while others (Jeff Hunter's doomed Sgt. Fuller) are clearly fictitious.<br/><br/>There are also some unexplainable errors, such as having American paratroopers jumping from British Lancaster bombers, showing how close they worked together as only brethren can do. Again nobody cares. In most parts the film is just a spectacle of no significance, a rowing of episodes, patriotic, heroic  the reality was different. No heroism at all, but the accomplishment of desperation on both sides. I heard original reports of participiants from both sides. They know what happened. This movie shows not much of it. Therefore I say much money invested, many stars exerted  for another Hollywood Popcorn flubdub."
"alantentevier","6","2","3","22 June 2019"," EXCELLENT FILM IF LACKING IN HISTORICAL FACTS
","A great film but as an historical record, majorly flawed. It perpetuates the myth that the British and Canadian involvement in D-Day was minimal. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Strategic plans for the Normandy landings were conceived and developed by the British under the auspices of Lieut. General Frederick Morgan. His ingenious plans included the building of the floating Mulberry harbours and the construction of underwater oil pipelines between Britain and France.<br/><br/>The Supreme Allied Commander was indeed an American, General Eisenhower; but he had never fired a shot in anger, and all the allied forces on the ground (including the Americans) were under the overall command of the British General Montgomery who expanded General Morgan's initial plans. The Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Arthur Tedder, was British. The Allied Air Commander in chief, Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, was also British; as was the Allied Naval Commander in Chief, Bertram Ramsay.<br/><br/>On D-Day, British Empire forces (largely British and Canadian) put 75,215 troops ashore over three separate landings; the Americans, 57,500 over two. To these figures should be added 8.500 British and Canadian paratroopers (who achieved all their objectives); and 13,100 American.<br/><br/>Overall, there were nearly 7,000 vessels involved, and of the 1,213 warships taking an active part in the assault, 892 were British. The Royal and Merchant navies provided 137,824 personnel; the Americans, 52,889. Of the 4,126 landing craft involved 3,261 were British; 805 were American.<br/><br/>In addition to providing its own supplies, the British provided the Americans with nearly one-third of theirs.
.
On D-Day 11,590 allied aircraft took part in operations; almost half of these (5,656) were flown by the RAF. In addition, 1,800 RAF personnel were landed on D-Day (swelling to 3,500 by 9th June). They and over 800 vehicles were used for airfield construction and the servicing of allied aircraft.<br/><br/>Bletchley Park's input was also hugely significant; they had broken the latest German Enigma codes some six weeks before the invasion. MI 5 had not been idle either: all German agents working in the U.K. had been captured before D-Day and many of them turned, so the Germans were receiving false information about allied intentions. The entirely fictitious ""First United States Army Group"" was (apart from its name) the concept of British colonel David Strangeways, the head of Montgomery's R Force deception unit. This ""Army"" under the supposed command of General Patton was designed to mislead the Germans into believing the allies assault would take place around Calais.<br/><br/>The American contribution to D-Day was indisputably substantial; but it was certainly no greater than the British and Canadian. It's a pity the film does not accurately reflect this."

My father was in the Canadian Air Force and served in England during the war. As typical Hollywood so often portrays Canada in WW2, the movie devoted about 1 minute to the Canadian participation on D-Day. Canada landed over 15,000 men on Juno Beach and achieved most of their 1st day objectives, they actually pushed the furthest inland of any of the 5 beaches.

In addition, each of the segments was shot by five different directors, including the parachuting episodes.<br/><br/>The all-star cast includes luminaries like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Sean Connery, Jeffrey Hunter, Steve Forrest and Roddy McDowall. Furthermore, the opening military percussion-oriented score is superlative. The movie saves the compelling invasion of the Normandy beaches for the last act (unlike the mawkish ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which starts with it).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie loses points for the B&W photography, which is inexplicable for such an all-star early 60's blockbuster. There are also some hackneyed or awkward parts, like the scene where a ravishing French woman & her bicycle suddenly appear at the railroad tracks by two skeptical German soldiers. Why Sure! Another arguable problem is that the ambitious scope of the film prevents the story from focusing on any one group of notable characters, which make the proceedings seem like a thrilling docudrama rather than a gripping action/drama.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, ""The Longest Day"" is a must to catch a glimpse of what it was like on D-Day on several fronts, not to mention you get to see the proverbial big picture.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE RUNS 2 minutes shy of 3 hours; and was shot in France.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Many WWII films hone in on the Omaha Beach invasion. Certainly important, heroic and frightening yet this film touches on each aspect leading up to and during the D-Day attack including of course the Omaha Beach invasion. The movie goes into interesting detail on the planning, strategy and decisions that went into the battle not only from the American's side but Germany and occasionally other countries. It was fascinating to hear the behind the scenes thinking from various high ranking officials for how and why certain decisions were made. As the film enters the battles, it reminds me of A Thin Red Line as you get a peek into a complete assortment of scenarios from big to small and the emotional perspectives of those involved; from a paratrooper stuck high up on a bell tower to residents of a cottage in the battle zone to German officials afraid to awaken a sleeping Hitler. The pacing was stellar as this is a 3 hour war epic shot in rich black & white, thus their approach of including an assortment of scenes shot with stunning cinematography (won Oscar for cinematography) helped this epic feel lightweight. Sean Connery even makes an appearance as a jovial soldier with his James Bond smirk. Getting warmed up for Dr. No as he starred in that immediately after. This is a high quality war film with impressive effects with an engrossing screenplay."

The Longest Day tells the story and events of D-Day from the British, American, German and French perspectives. There are many story from the Allies deciding on whether to invade, the German wondering where the Allies would invade, the airborne landings in Normandy to capture important strategic points, the bench landings and German commander's reaction to invasion and trying to get the Panzer Reserves into the battle. The Longest Day is a historically accuracy film as it shows all these parts of the conflict and is balanced between showing the story of the British, German and Americans and soldiers fighting on the ground and high command in headquarters. The Longest Day focuses on the military aspects, so threats the Germans and their generals simply as men doing their jobs. The battles were brilliant handled, especially with aerial shots showing the size of the actions. The Longest Day does suffer from a few bad performances and expository dialogue but it is a must watch for fans of war films and history buffs."
"yenlo","8","3","6","18 May 1999"," Well done semi documentary style with good acting
","To present the D-Day invasion on screen from as many scales as it was is a monumental task. Darryl F. Zanuck did it about as good as it could ever be done. He presented it semi-documentary with the right amount of subplots using a selection of some of the best actors at the time in various cameo roles. No one actor is the star of this film. The result is an epic war film that should be seen by any one who enjoys war/military films. The film does not honor one side more than the other but simply tells the story of events that day from the nations that took part."
"larryludwigpilot","5","4","10","29 May 2006"," Longest Day 40 years later
","I remember seeing this film when it came out, and most people didn't know better. I suppose it did some good reminding a few of the sacrifices made on 6/6/44. Now that there is so much more information available because of the release of documents and pictures from families of survivors that have since died, so much more can and should be shown and told about these events. Most will compare ""Saving Private Ryan"" which is technically far advanced, and understandably does a better job, it still presents a limited view and from an artistic and not historical point of view. The first 20 minutes of Ryan will live on, but even it will have some mark set before it when you consider that Longest Day is now 40 years old and more time has passed since the making of the movie, than had passed between the event and the filming times two."
"mharrison-17627","1","3","7","21 August 2019"," Everyone was far too old
","Nearly all the actors are far too old to be believable. Casting a fat 55-year-old John Wayne as a 27-year-old paratrooper has to be the worst casting mistake ever. There was nothing remarkable about the D-Day invasion, Germany was fighting against the entire world with virtually no tanks or air force."

"thecornman10803","3","5","15","2 April 2009"," Badly Done War Epic
","I just re-watched this film after many years of not viewing it. I watched it with my sons who are interested in World War II. I have to say that across the board it's badly done. I imagine tackling a multi-national, multi-lingual epic is a tough job but everything about it smacks of being done on the cheap. Bad direction that looks like old staged television shows. God-awful editing of picture and sound. One segment of a German officer obviously standing in front of a green-screen beach comes immediately to mind. The officer just sort of appears and disappears from the foreground as the beach stays exactly the same. The sound of the film is very thin. Almost minimal use of sound efx. Main characters have conversations in the foreground with battalions in the background preparing for battle and all you hear is the dialogue. It really looks like they ran out of money while finishing this film. The black and white photography doesn't age well with this film either. Very washed-out looking film And the acting and direction are very wooden. Viewing this film is like watching paint dry or better yet a slide show on the D-Day invasion."
"irish102","Null","4","11","2 June 2004"," Pretty Corny
","I just watched this film again. Although I can't explain why I'm drawn to watch it. It's got some pretty corny acting. <br/><br/>In the first place, every American in it seems like they are hunting to speak the historic line of the war. The British,French,and Canadians are almost non-existent. And the horrible over-splicing of action scenes. Couldn't they find real boats and real people,and real water to do the landing scenes? <br/><br/>Just picking apart two scenes, let's take the first one: Henry Fonda (T.Roosevelts son) goes to the ward room to see his division commander about being first on the beach. Now,the division commander let's fly about T.R.'s sons father being the first up San Juan Hill and leading the Rough Riders. Wouldn't T.R.'s son already know these fact. I mean come on. If he didn't hear them from his father certainly he picked it up somewhere he was a one star general.<br/><br/>Next,John Wayne is in the chute room having a cup of coffee. In comes word about the attack. With so many tables around him, why did he have to throw his coffee cup to the floor? Couldn't he just put it down?<br/><br/>Peppered with ham acting the best part of this film was that of the German actors. They seemed to want this movie to contain better then average acting.Look at Major Pluskat. That poor guy caught hell right from the time he was woke up with a phone call. If I was him I would have walked down the hill and surrendered.<br/><br/>The only thing shot full of holes here is this film. It can get to be a roar if you see it too many times!!!!!"
"HotToastyRag","8","2","4","22 August 2018"," Incredible war epic masterfully directed
","Steven Spielberg's got nothing on The Longest Day. Once you watch this movie, you'll wonder why he felt the need to reenact the landing at Normandy, after Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, and Darryl F. Zanuck did such a wonderful job capturing the moment thirty-five years earlier. The beginning of this movie is extremely slow, and the first half hour could have easily been cut. The start of the film could have been when Eddie Albert announces, ""Next stop: Normandy."" But after that announcement, it's very good, and the beach scene in so incredibly filmed, it feels like watching a remake would be sacrilegious. There's a long tracking shot where everyone rushes in, machine guns knocking people off, bombs crashing down, chaos in every inch of the frame, helicopter shots that show planes picking off soldiers on the sand-what else do you need? Blood and guts aren't really necessary to capture the horror and seriousness of war, not if it's filmed correctly. And those four certainly filmed it right.<br/><br/>It seems like everyone who wasn't in 1962's star-studded epic How the West was Won joined the star-studded cast of 1962's The Longest Day. Except Henry Fonda. He can do whatever he wants, so he was in both movies. This three-hour war drama chronicles D-Day, and as the title forewarns you, it's long. But if you want to see John Wayne, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Curd Jurgens, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Eddie Albert, Peter Lawford, Rod Steiger, Mel Ferrer, Robert Wagner, Sean Connery, Paul Anka, Christian Marquand, Kenneth More, Gert Frobe, Richard Beymer, Steve Forrest, Ray Danton, Paul Hartmann, Sal Mineo, Roddy McDowall, Edmond O'Brien, Tommy Sands, Peter van Eyck, Richard Todd, and George Segal all together in one movie with parts ranging from five seconds to thirty minutes, you can rent it. Just to warn you, everyone in this movie speaks their native language, so a good two-thirds of the movie aren't in English. The first section of the movie involves the French, German, American, and English bigwigs planning and strategizing. There's lots of subtitles, and if that's not your cup of tea, you'll get bored. Once you get past the first thirty minutes, it doesn't feel so long, because then the battle scenes start.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, there's actually a lighter side to this movie. In the middle of the landing at Normandy, a Frenchman rushes up to the soldiers waving a bottle of champagne, welcoming them and thanking them for coming. Peter Lawford says, ""That's most kind of you. Very nice to meet you! Perhaps next time, you see, we have a previous engagement-the war!"" Very dry and very British, but at a time like that, it's nice to see good old fashioned manners towards someone who is so happy to see the soldiers. In the same scene, Sean Connery is joking with another soldier, and his commanding officer, Kenneth More, keeps encouraging the soldiers to get off the beach, since all the gunfire is upsetting his dog. He shouts at them, ""Don't stand there yapping! The war's over there!""<br/><br/>If you like watching classic war movies, this is one of the most famous out there. Yes, it's filmed in black and white, but it's just supposed to transport you back in time and add to the realism. And no, there's no blood or guts, but with all the drama and tension in the battle scenes-once you get past the first thirty minutes-there's no need for all those extras. The second half of the movie in Normandy is riveting and incredible to watch. No wonder it took four people to direct this movie!"
"CinemaClown","Null","2","4","29 July 2017"," Grand In Scope, Objective In Approach, And Impressive Throughout
","Maintaining a close proximity with the real life landmark event, featuring a massive ensemble, and told on a grand scale, The Longest Day is one of the most ambitious productions of its time that's not only notable for rescuing its studio from bankruptcy but is also one of the rarest examples of its genre that narrates its tale from an objective viewpoint.<br/><br/>The Longest Day chronicles the events leading up to the historic Normandy landings on June 6, 1944 during World War II, and tells it from both the Allied & German points of view. Supervised by Darryl F. Zanuck and directed by multiple directors, the movie unfolds like a docudrama and is a 3- hour epic that remains compelling for the majority of its runtime.<br/><br/>By allowing the British, American & German directors to handle segments of their own nationality, Zanuch is able to provide the film a much-needed impartiality, and even manages to evoke some sympathy from all the three parties. One can tell the extensive amount of research that went into its production, for some scenes that seemed too far-fetched to be true are surprisingly factual.<br/><br/>A major portion of the movie is devoted to the wait, analysis & preparation of the Allied invasion, and Germans' response to prevent it from succeeding instead of the gruesome battle that unfolded on the Normandy beaches. Some moments are disturbing & upsetting, others brim with suspenseful vibes, and few even manage to squeeze in little laughter. All in all, it's a superbly executed effort.<br/><br/>Its grand scope is reflected by the massive extras & huge ensemble that show up on the screen, and everyone play their part rather well, except John Wayne who's a tad too full of himself here. Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Sean Connery & many more notable actors show up here n there but their presence never becomes bigger than the story itself, plus the roles they are assigned are cameos anyway.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Longest Day is a comprehensively researched, brilliantly directed, deftly written, crisply photographed, patiently edited, thumpingly scored & finely performed account of one of the most memorable events that occurred during the Second World War, and is brought to cinematic life in a concise, controlled & calculated manner. One of the best examples of its genre that still carries elements of surprise, The Longest Day lives up to its legacy in splendid fashion."

","A film about just one day, but an important day. The film gives sometimes brilliant, sometimes anecdotal accounts of the 6th of June 1944.<br/><br/>Thanks to the personal focuses, involving many personal stories, forgotten details, important decisions, and many other insights, the film manages to fascinate.<br/><br/>The film is epic in its scale, with a lot of scenes in which many resources were invested. It is not epic in the sense of heroism, and that's a good thing. All levels of command are portrayed, each one with their own tough decisions to be made.<br/><br/>Another bonus is the absence of moral judgment, thanks to the often-lacking German points of view in WWII films. The inclusion of the French resistance is also noteworthy.<br/><br/>Acting is great, and history-lovers will have a great evening watching this film. I wish I could say this was the day that decided WWII, but I'd rather refer to the more recent film 'The Imitation Game'."
"atlasmb","8","2","4","28 May 2016"," A Solid Retelling Of The WWII Normandy Invasion Story
","As the Germans waited in France for the inevitable invasion, the suspense on both sides of the channel was palpable. The British and Americans devised plans of great complexity, involving vast amounts of men and materiel. It was a guessing game where they would land and when. An element of surprise was achieved when the first allied forces appeared off Normandy--where they were not expected--on the tail of relentless rain, through fog banks over choppy waters.<br/><br/>But the initial stages of the attack occurred during the previous night, when allied paratroopers descended over the French countryside. ""The Longest Day"" does a good job of showing the confusion and mishaps that resulted from the night invasion. And it provides a glimpse into the unintended and accidental nature of war. The effectiveness of the invasion was affected by red tape, egos, poor communications, bad planning and mistakes--just like all wars.<br/><br/>Though the film contains some factual errors, it does a good job (for its time) of conveying the true nature of armed conflict, where lives are often lost or saved simply due to chance.<br/><br/>A large all-star cast and thousands of extras make this film noteworthy. Four directors under the direction of Darryl F. Zanuck were used to achieve balance in the film by serving the American, British and French interests in the story.<br/><br/>For a more graphic representation of that beach invasion, see Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"". But ""The Longest Day"" is a fine film, especially for its time. The ending includes minimal moralizing and some good summarizing, but it feels like a sequel was envisioned. A television miniseries would certainly be welcomed if it could follow the stories of various participants on all sides of the conflict as this film does."
"AmyJenson1995","10","2","4","1 December 2015"," A very special movie
","As my great grandfather was one of the many men who participated to this historic and epic event, this movie has always been very special to me and my family.<br/><br/>Each time my great grandfather was watching or even discussing this movie, all his memories of that day as well as all the relationship he had with great friends he lost on that dirty beach came through. The moments of happiness, the tension becoming stronger each day waiting for big battle, the fear of dying or losing the strangers you learned to know and respect throughout the intense training. This movie had a very special resonance to him and he was very thankful that such a movie was released and even more he was proud that the director didn't take on any side because the Germans were as afraid and respectful towards the men they faced.<br/><br/>Now when I watched this movie, it makes me remember of my great grandfather who was one of those heroes, one of what we called the greatest generation. He had the chance to survive this day and the battle which followed and claimed even more lives. So it has also a very special place to my heart. We should never forget their sacrifice and be careful to not repeat the same mistake which led to WW2."

","The epic war movie to end all epic war movies, The Longest Day is producer Darryl F. Zanuck's salute to those involved in the Invasion of Normandy. It's a riveting film that recreates the events leading up to D-Day for the Americans, the British, the French, and the Germans. It's told in great detail with more historical accuracy than is usual for a movie based on real people and events (then or now). It helps that it was filmed on location in many of the real places and used military consultants, both Allied and Axis, who had actually been involved in D-Day. The cast features many big names such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, and so many others it'd take the whole review just to list them. I can honestly say that, despite the huge cast, every actor involved does solid work. No one was phoning it in or hamming it up in this one. The special effects and beautiful black & white cinematography both deservedly won Oscars. It's a remarkable film that holds up very well after all these years and stands as the premier war movie of its kind. One of the last great WWII movies made by people who lived through it, the greatest generation."
"SanteeFats","10","2","4","7 May 2013"," A good one
","This is pretty historically accurate which I really appreciate since so many movies take way too many liberties with the truth. This movie has soooooo many big time old stars that it is not even funny. All of them do a great job in their roles. The writing is excellent and so is the acting. Some of the roles showed stuff that I later found out was real, such as Henry Fonda as General Roosevelt and the debilitating arthritis he had yet still went ashore. Red Buttons as the paratrooper stuck oh the side of a building while his company of paratroopers were pretty much cut to ribbons by the Krauts. John Wayne as the colonel with the broken ankle who kept on pushing forward however he could. The landings on the beaches that killed so many but went forward anyway. This movie shows the fortitude of the U.S. and Allied troops to get the job done. If these landings had been thrown back who knows how long the war would have gone on. Not to mention what it would have done to Allied moral."

"JKwiat5787","Null","2","4","1 January 2009"," Fine adaptation
","To really judge this film, as well as 'A Bridge Too far', one needs to read the book either after or (better yet) before seeing the film. Every time this film comes on, I find myself flipping through my battered paperback copy of the book, especially at the point where Private Schultz decides he needs to lose the $2,500 he won at craps. That actually happened, though there is no mention of him having suffered any serious injuries during training.<br/><br/>Probably the most glaring deviation from the book is that the final breakout from Omaha Beach wasn't as dramatic as was portrayed in the film. Those who survived fought their way off that beach inch by bloody inch. It is true that General Cota was very inspirational to his men in the 29th Infantry Division as he tried to move his men off the beach. I was pleased that some of the more minor 'idiosycracies', like Lord Lovat having his personal piper with him, were accurately portrayed, as well as the incident when Lovat's commandos relieved Major Howard's Paratroopers at 'Pegasus Bridge.' That incident was retold fairly accurately, although I'm not so sure about the exchange of words between Pvt. Flanagan and the other Irish soldier, regarding the way Bill Millin played the bagpipes. It did strike me as classic British humor in a time of stress.<br/><br/>By the way, one error on this page that might be cleared up. Pips Priller's Luftwaffe 'buddy' and wingman, the one who complained about 'not being able to get any sleep', was no major. He's Flight Sergeant Heinz Wodarcyck, Priller's regular wingman on the staff flight of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wing) twenty-six. Also, Priller's final official score was 101, not the 130-some-odd mentioned in the movie. He survived the war, so it's entirely possible that some of those kills occurred after D-Day. Wodarcyck was killed in Operation Bodeplatte, a major strike coordinated with the Battle of the Bulge, intended to wipe out the U.S. 9th Air Force, and maybe the British 2nd Air Force, on the ground in Belgium. That was New Year's day 1945."
"rmax304823","7","2","4","11 July 2008"," Colossal, Stupendous, Brobdingnagian -- and BIG!!
","Darryl F. Zanuck's epic story of the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944 boggles the mind with its scope and ambition. It's properly called ""Darryl F. Zanuck's"" movie because the cigar-chomping Goy from Wahoo, Nebraska, is the prime mover. Without him, and without the four-million-dollar infusion of his own financial blood, it would never have been made. Zanuck was just coming off a series of flops at the time (""Satan Never Sleeps""?) and this was his last big shot. He controlled everything. He inserted an important part for his then-girlfriend, Irene Demick, during the demise of his marriage. Not that this was anything but traditional in Hollywood then and now. Darryl's son, Richard, gave HIS paramour an important, if silent, part as Charlton Heston's girlfriend in ""Planet of the Apes."" It's GOOD to be the producer. Anyway, it has to be Zanuck's movie because it's a vast ensemble piece with none of the forty-two stars being given more than a few minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>There are no back stories at all. None of the characters, most of them based on real people drawn from Cornelius Ryan's blockbuster book, have wives or children. There are no flashbacks to anyone's happy boyhood, fishing barefoot from a pier. Nobody grew up in a dysfunctional family in the slums either. Nobody carries a picture of the girl back home.<br/><br/>The Americans and Brits speak English, the French speak French, and the Germans speak German. This means subtitles, which in turn means that if it were produced today nobody under the age of thirty would enjoy seeing it, since MTV and ""Die Hard Forever"" and ""I Dismember Mamma"" have no subtitles. One can almost hear the complaints of the kids sitting around chugging energy drinks and squirming with the effort to look and read at the same time. Well, maybe that's a little harsh. I'll make an exception. There would be no squirming among the kids in any household that has a copy of ""The Origin of Species"" on one of its bookshelves.<br/><br/>Aside from the expense and the massive logistical effort on display, it's not a bad movie. There are a few awkward moments in the script, true, such as when a solemn actor tells someone else, and the audience as well, that this is an important day and we should all try to remember it.<br/><br/>And, thank God, no speeches about patriotism. These guys on both sides are dying. The nationalism is on display and doesn't need to be spelled out. There's a good deal of irony too. It tempers the obvious heroism. Some German soldiers come out of a bunker with their hands up, crying ""Bitte, bitte!"" and a GI shoots them all down, tips his helmet back, and muses, ""I wonder what 'Bitte, bitte' means."" In ""Saving Private Ryan"", any Germans trying to surrender are automatically exterminated without qualms. But ""The Longest Day"" is a kind of transitional film. Those produced during and immediately after the war pretty much demonized the enemy. Those coming later in the 1960s and afterward were usually more ""realistic"" in that they had more blood, and the enemy, although a nuisance, was sometimes humanized. But if the enemy weren't demonized, they weren't sympathized with in any way. They were offed matter-of-factly, the way Dirty Harry shot his adversaries. Just bodies.<br/><br/>The British here are the kind who are jolly and brave and who hide their emotions carefully, as Richard Burton does. The Americans are good-natured complainers who practice seductive speeches in rudimentary French before jumping out of airplanes. The Germans are of two types -- the commanders who sit around sipping tea in palaces, and the men and junior officers at the front who frantically try to communicate with them while holding off an inexorable Allied force.<br/><br/>There are concessions to commercialism, as there almost inevitably will be. Some incidents are depicted that never took place. Some mistakes are skipped over (the frenetic and pointless gyrations of the airplanes carrying the parachutists). And Irene Demick has a hair style straight out of 1962. Of course, our side wins. Our side always wins. That's why you will never see a movie called ""The Battle of the Java Sea"" or ""A Yank at Kasserine Pass."" But it's a good movie, almost a documentary, and should be seen for its educational value alone because it isn't fictionalized like ""Saving Private Ryan."" It may not be as bloody as some people would prefer but it's instructive -- and it's so gol darned BIG that the grand sweep of this ineluctable, elephantine monster carries you along willy nilly."
"savoy6-1","9","2","4","13 January 2008"," Casting choices
","The photo of John Wayne wearing a helmet as a Major-General (two stars)on the main page, is NOT from The Longest Day but Cast a Giant Shadow. In Longest Day he was a Lieutenant Colonel from the 82nd. The best part is the casting of Richard Todd, a veteran of D-Day, and the piper with Lovatts commandos WAS Lord Lovatt's Piper Bill Millen. Casting actual participants adds to the realistic feel. I argued with my family about the Longest Day vs. Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan was a good movie, but it was a fictionalized account. Whereas, Longest Day had many of the actual participants in or providing technical advice. Ryan had better effects(big deal) but if you watch it, it's a cliché' ridden WWII movie just like Bataan or others. Compare the ""central casting"" characters with WWII era movies. The breadth of the battle was compacted in a couple of hours and was an excellent movie, one of the best. The characters came alive and were believable. It has stood the test of time."

","We all have seen a recent picture of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and other films depicting the War at Normandy.

This film even in black and white is a great film Classic which is worth viewing every once in a while. I remember seeing this film years ago and I think about all those men and women who gave their lives for this country in order to destroy the evils of Adolph Hitler and his wicked country who allowed this man to have such power and control. ""Saving Pivate Ryan"" was a great film and broke out hearts but this film is truly a great film classic."

","THE LONGEST DAY begs for a remake -- SAVING PRIVATE RYAN style, of course. This 3-hour, widescreen retelling of D-Day stars a huge roster of then-stars like Robert Ryan, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum plus a quite-young and unknown Sean Connery. Not a drop of blood is spilled, and soldiers who are shot fall theatrically. We spend as much time in the company of the Germans as we do the Allies, which wears thin after awhile, and there are probably 2,000 extras in this early '60s epic. The special effects look pretty bad today, but I assume they were pretty impressive in their time. Minimal documentary footage is included, which is a blessing. The film is in pristine B&W, which gives it a greater sense of reality but will cost it many potential viewers. There are moments where the viewer will feel drawn into the action, particularly in the French commando siege of a hotel held by the Nazis. Some passing nuns give this incredibly tense scene a touch of whimsy.

","The Longest Day is a 1962 war movie with one of the most impressive cast in film history (Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, John Wayne). Coming at about 3 hours this film is very long and with a gigantic number of characters. I really liked this film, it's portrait of the many forces that played an important role in the D day and the all together epic proportions of this film. I also really liked the cinematography, the beach landings have some amazing and beautiful shots. The acting is good but maybe due to the giant amount of characters it feels like no one (not even the big names) gives any amazing performance. I personaly think the film is a little too long but it wasn't painful to sit trough it. Finaly I absolutely loved how the film showed so many perspesctives, the american and british forces, the french forces returning to fight for their country, the german point of view and I espeacily loved the scenes with the french resistance. There were parts of the movie that really put me off though, like in the beginning the shot of a german talking with the sea behind him but then he sudently disapears and reapears back in the same place a few moments later.

","I submitted that to the Trivia line but it seems that it did not make it. In the sequence of the sea side bunker attack, at the Pointe du Hoc, after the Kieffer Command men succeeded in their mission, we see them kill in cold blood German soldiers who wanted to surrender. We see more or less the same scene in Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and series BAND OF BROTHERS. But if you have read the book document about the D Day viewed from the German side THEY COME,written by the German Paul Carrell, a former Nazi general - who later wrote under an aka - and who always emphasized on the legendary chivalry and German courage, he never spoke of this fact, Allies killing German soldiers who wanted to surrender; killed them in cold blood. Strange, isn'it?
And I think it would need a remake, because the book written by Cornelius Ryan is one thousand times more interesting than the however excellent film, the feature that re invent the war movie, brought it to a higher scale. In the book, you have millions of details, awesome details and elements which could not be put in the movie. Details about German soldiers, US privates aboard the landing barges, puking, crying, dying even before arriving on Omaha Beach. A new movie or even a TV series, some kind of spin-off of BAND OF BROTHERS, but focusing on D DAY only. That's a suggestion."

","""The Longest Day"" is unquestionably a product of self-important Hollywood bloat, but it is also a noble attempt to do justice to one of then-recent history's most singular moments, the Normandy landings of June 1944. For the price of sitting through clumsy expository dialogue, misplaced comedy, and thumb-in-your-eye cameos, you get some terrific cinema and a decent war story.<br/><br/>As an opening title tells us, its the fifth year of the German occupation of France, and on both sides of the English Channel, warriors await the inevitable clash of arms. RAF pilot David Campbell (Richard Burton) notes ruefully he is now the last member of his squadron still left from the Battle of Britain. American paratrooper ""Dutch"" Schultz (Richard Beymer) decides if the landing is on tonight, he'll gamble away his sizable winnings and ""jump clean."" An unnamed German officer sleeps comfortably in a French farmhouse, his boots off and carelessly arranged.<br/><br/>Much later in the movie, the three men will be found together in a scene that summarizes the film's philosophy at its most pungent: War confirms our universal brotherhood, even with those we kill.<br/><br/>Little moments like that are sprinkled throughout ""The Longest Day"". Every now and again, you get something more sustained. There's an attack by Free French commandoes at a casino in Ouistreham that sustains a bird's-eye view of the running battle for far longer than any other film I've ever seen, overall by far the best sequence in the movie. The British glider troop assault on Pegasus Bridge comes off effectively by being played in real time, while a botched U.S. parachute drop on a German-occupied village makes for a harrowing sequence.<br/><br/>But ""The Longest Day"" has its share of misfires; too. A lot of times in the movie, we are taken to a meeting room somewhere so the directors can tell you what is happening. The huge all-star cast is about a few stars too many, either unnecessary (Henry Fonda, Eddie Albert, Rod Steiger) or playing themselves instead of their characters (John Wayne, Red Buttons). By the time the beaches are hit, the film is two-thirds over, and a lot is skimped, especially the most effective of the D-Day landings, the Canadian assault at Juno Beach.<br/><br/>But the overall quality of ""The Longest Day"" is high, reflecting its big budget as well as a passion for telling the story. Even more than its three sure-handed directors (Brit Ken Annakin, naturalized American Andrew Marton, and German war vet Bernhard Wicki) and numerous screenwriters (including James Jones and Cornelius Ryan, who wrote the book upon which this is based), you have a masterful editing job by Samuel E. Beetley, which sustains the film's galloping pace by keeping less important scenes to the barest minimum. Few films are as long as ""The Longest Day"", but many feel longer. Too bad for Beetley he was up against ""Lawrence Of Arabia""'s Anne V. Coates come Oscar-time; any other year he would have won.<br/><br/>It's not a great film otherwise, but it manages to hold up more than not, leading up to that winning wistful moment when Beymer, Burton, and the German come together. ""He's dead...I'm crippled...You're lost. I suppose it's always like that. I mean war."""

"kentbeuchert","10","3","8","12 March 2010"," The only accurate war movie ever made
","As a veteran WWII historian, I always point to The Longest Day as the only war movie I've ever seen that is actually truthful and accurate.<br/><br/>Many war films are merely dramas or a backdrop for scriptwriter political views or to showcase a studio's stars. The Longest Day was NOT your typical Hollywood pseudo history. It contained actors from everywhere - every male actor in Hollywood wanted to be in this film, and a very large number of them were in this film. The film succeeds as history because it faithfully follows the book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan. Of course, a movie cannot come anywhere close to a book in terms of information, and thus there are necessary editing decisions as to what should be included. The biggest failure, in my opinion, is the lack of a clear exposition before the attack of exactly where the beaches were located and which units were assigned to them. <br/><br/>If one wants to know the full history of the landings, then the book is where to find it. Nevertheless, the movie does just about as good a job of providing the pertinent facts as is probably possible. Certainly this film makes a mockery of Private Ryan, a totally absurd piece of fiction with an absurd plot and populated by folks who never existed. That film also totally exaggerated the experience, with body parts flying all over the place. The casualty rate at Omaha Beach simply did not live up to its reputation as ""Bloody Omaha."" Only in comparison with the experiences of the other beaches would anyone claim a high casualty rate for Omaha. We landed over 35,000 troops on Omaha on D-Day, and the total number dead was less than 400. And A Bridge Too Far was a totally manufactured event that leaves the audience with more rather than less misinformation after viewing. It was a political movie, not a valid history of Market-Garden. The Longest Day is the real McCoy and also quite pleasant to watch. You don't need to manufacture facts to tell a good story. The story practically tells itself. And truth is always far more interesting than fiction."

","Daryl Zanuck took this on as a personal project, but earnestness cannot overcome run-of the mill conception & direction. The merit of this film is to tell the story of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. It's not to create art, or even to elicit sentiment. So to be as factual as possible, (or at least market it as such) they filmed on actual locations which are still recognizable today. A puzzling disconnect occurs in the production: John Wayne is there to 'John Wayne' things up (he plays another hard-on), trying to make it a personal story but if ever there was as story about group sacrifice, D-Day is it. This narrative problem is never successfully addressed. As with all war films the goals are so poorly explained that you don't care if the allies derail a train, or save a bridge; because although characters have talked (and talked and talked) for an hour before things get going, you still don't understand what specific goal has been achieved. It's all poorly explained.<br/><br/>My french guide through Normandy took us through his hometown 'Ouisterham' in the film, whose distinct cliff-walled harbor is featured in the movie. This sequence begins with a long aerial tracking shot that comes down the harbor. It's one of the best sequences. It occurs nowhere near the beach. When we revert back to the beach, some time later to resume the Mitchum/Albert storyline, it actually feels out of order.<br/><br/>The on-location filming in undermined by some of the worst rear-screen insertions I've ever seen. The actors actually cast shadows on the rearscreen. At one point about nine actors are squeezed onto a barely passable set of an aircraft carier bridge, with the sea faked in behind them. Red Buttons is here playing the same annoying sappy twerp he always does. Richard Beymer is trying to give an electrifying modern performance but he has nothing to do.<br/><br/>The English army is constantly depicted as dorks with silly priorities. English culture used to interest me. Now I can't imagine why; it doesn't stimulate an ounce of interest.<br/><br/>The movie never wavers from the battle narrative. This is most unfortunate as we watch maybe twenty early scenes establish, re-establish and belabor the same points. We don't get a scene of the army greeted as liberators, so as far as prestige pix go it's pretty chilly.<br/><br/>Sean Connery shows up and spews some indecipherable lines. Three single-named stars (Arletty, Fabian, somebody else) are in the movie along with anyone who passed through Hollywood in 1956 in possession of a penis (Paul Anka, Ricard Beymer, Jeff Hunter, Sal Mineo, Robert Mitchum, Eddie Albert, John Wayne, Richard Burton, Peter Lawford, Henry Fonda, Edmund O'Brien, George Segal, rod Steiger, Tom Tryon, Robert Wagner) & Roddy MacDowell (whom I would argue could not possibly have had a penis).<br/><br/>Graphic deisgn. I really can't understand why graphic design has achieved the reputation it has. Here ""The Longest Day"" is spelled out with long letters, literalizing the stupidest aspect a weak-minded designer could muster.<br/><br/>The end theme doesn't help the tone. It's a peppy whistling march that gives way to an asinine chorus, as if to say don't think about the gravitas of this heavy topic, just go out and think pretty thoughts."
"mulveymeister","3","4","13","21 December 2008"," This is a terrible film
","I have read all the post here and if I am given the chance, I would like to explain why I DO NOT like this film. I see it as the ultimate dumb blonde ww2 film, which I have suffered again in the build-up to Christmas 2008. Now, I have lived in the USA and have a very small idea of how they think (at least in the Midwest). I quite accept that they may love this film anywhere in the United States, especially with their armies in Afganistan and Iraq. Hollywood is the US film industry and playing at home to the US public. Europeans have no such loyalty to any film industry outside each of their own countries.<br/><br/>My real problem with this film is with the screenplay. You cannot argue that the money and stars were not thrown at it - and that is a major problem. Every name had to get it's 5 minutes on air and the money was there to allow it. Monosyllabic German is subtitled (bar Curd Jürgens). I reserve my harshest complaint for those do believe that this film has a grain of truth about it. Cornelius Ryan seems to have given the dumbest situations possible to stage the action scenes. There are literally dozens of examples of layered stupidity. Nuns roaming through the beaches unharmed. Bagpipers marching from inland to the beaches (and being cursed for being Irish!) undisturbed by the shells falling within their ranks. Then you have the time for American GIs to respond to the slow witted Germans. This brings up the problem of the cast.<br/><br/>No stars were included from outside Hollywood. Only the Dutch actors were previously unknown to American audiences. This allows lazy acceptance of the stereotype norms - em, for who? Well, in this case, the American audience. So the Yanks were all John Wayne wannabees, the Brits all Trevor Howard wannabees (even Sean Connery and Richard Burton). The Germans were irrelevant as this is an American victory film. I have no problem admitting that the Allies could not have won the war without the US. It is something Europe will always owe the USA....but that is a separate topic. This film is a celebration of those 'Palinesque' Americans who believe all the dumb stereotypical images of Europe and their peoples. The stars had to take part, or be noted for not being. No depth of character was asked for nor given. No actors or situations were challenging. No questions were asked or answered. Steven Spielberg and others have done wonderful ww2 films, from all the countries involved. This is a very poorly made, expensive, film which did nothing for the career of any actor taking part. I hope I am allowed to hold these views without negating my liking for my time working in the United States, England and Germany."

Still, the movie has merit. I like the movie but am very aware of the limitations.

"sherbetsaucers","10","2","5","6 February 2007"," It's SUPPOSED To Be In Black And White!!
","Opening with a shot of an upturned helmet on a beach, The Longest Day drops us straight into the middle of a dizzyingly complex series of events; quick scenes involving a number of high ranking officers of many nationalities whizzing past us. This is a gathering of stories that combine to paint the big picture of what happened on the 6th June. And this in itself is the movies great strength. It allows us to see the many faces of this historic day, without focusing on one group of soldiers overly much.<br/><br/>In doing so this movie also gives us such massive scope. We are constantly reminded of the sheer scale of what was involved as if reminding us that yes, this really happened and yes, it was very, very big. This sense of scale is continued with some amazingly shot scenes of battle. One of my favourite is when the remnants of the once great Luftwaffa make a strafe on the troops on one of the Normandy beaches. We see two actual working Messerschmitts fly over 3,000 extras, as well as vehicles and equipment. Another extraordinary scene is when the Free French commandos attack Ouistreham. It is a sweeping helicopter shot that starts tight in and then just moves out, once again showing the sheer scale of the production and, indeed, hinting at the scale of the war itself. The word breathtaking does not even begin to cover it.<br/><br/>Yet amongst all of this grandeur the moments of intimacy are not lost. Richard Burtons jaded pilot is a particularly interesting character. The lone survivor of his original squadron and now shot down over Normandy, he finds himself finally having to deal with death face to face: his former melancholy mood becoming one of introspection. Earlier we see two American soldiers talking on a troop carrier. They're discussing how one of them has received a divorce request from his wife, how he does love her and that he wants to do the best he can for her, his friend doing his best to advise and comfort him. It's not until later, when he's gone, that we realise that the two had never even met before.<br/><br/>Another way of helping us understand the vastness of the events happening around us is to let us view it through the eyes of the common soldier. This is best typified by the characters of Flanagan (Sean Connery) and Clough (Norman Rossington), their commentary of what is happening about them reminiscent of the best traditions of Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Something that this movie gets across so well is just how lucky the Allied invasion was. It seems that their best weapon was the lumbering German bureaucracy and their inability to believe that the Allies are actually invading. Even 2 hours and ten minutes into the movie Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt (Paul Hartman) cannot truly believe the invasion is happening in Normandy. The failure of the German army is summed up so well by Major General Gunther Blumentritt (Curd Jürgens) 'This is history. We are living an historical moment. We are going to lose the war because our glorious Führer has taken a sleeping pill and is not to be awakened. Sometimes I wonder which side God is on.' This is particularly interesting, as earlier an Allied general had been wondering just whose side god was on as well, thus showing us that there is really little difference between the two enemies.<br/><br/>This is a movie that acknowledges many factors. Many British people feel slightly miffed with a lot of American-made war movies about what feels like the downplaying of our role during the second world war. This isn't a recent phenomenon. Objective, Burma! is a fantastic re-telling of history with the Americans suddenly playing the parts of the British and Australians. However in The Longest Day you have John Waynes Colonel telling off one of his subordinates for talking about wanting to have a crack at the enemy. Yes, everyone's impatient, including the British who have just been bombed for a good many years. It's almost hard to imagine anyone in an American movie saying 'I don't think I have to remind you that this war has been going on for almost 5 years. Over half of Europe has been overrun and occupied. We're comparative newcomers. England's gone through a blitz with a knife at her throat since 1940. I'm quite sure that they, too, are impatient and itching to go. Do I make myself clear?' Especially from a country that talks about the '1942-1945' war. Yet here is The Duke saying this, and it actually made me feel good.<br/><br/>Why was this movie filmed in black and white? With a budget of $10,000,000 and an all-star cast, you would think that the studio could spring for some colour film? So it is clearly a stylist choice. This is a movie that is about a book that documents the D-Day assault. The word 'document' is key here. By choosing to film in black and white Zanuck was clearly trying to give this movie a more 'documentary' feel, a classic feel.<br/><br/>This is a movie that could never be made again. The planes flying are actually of the time, the locations are where the action really happened and many of the extras and technical advisers were actually at the D-Day landings. The actors were able to talk to their real life counterparts, indeed many of them were given items to wear/use from the people they were portraying. It's a movie that was made with a huge amount of passion, everyone in front of and behind camera giving it everything they can. With a cast that is beyond belief and characters speaking in their native language this is a one off, a classic, and one of the best war movies ever made, yet it does not feature in IMDBs top 250 movies. Sometimes I weep."

Surely the spectacle, size and scope of the battle scenes make up for this supposed lack of acting skills.<br/><br/>I personally beleive the acting in this film is great, and the multitude of stars is just one reason to watch. Sadly because of the short space of time the movie has, and the number of characters it is hard to get involved with each of the charcters as an individual, as you would in a war film about one or a select few, like Patton. This has to be about the film's only flaw.<br/><br/>Albeit the war scenes lack a large amount of gore, in-fact they show any, with men not even screaming when they die. This has to be expected considering the film was made in a time where special effects were not as amazing as they are today.<br/><br/>
Despite all of this, this has to be my favourite war movie, and my third favourite film all up. I could watch it purely for the battle scenes, but I also enjoy the film because of the way the events are depicted from three positions: those of the Germans in France, the French citizens and the Allied soldiers.<br/><br/>I beleive you cannot go wrong with this film. Some of the early parts are a little slow but that is all forgotten by the time the first glider-borne troops crash onto the Orne River Bridge and D-Day begins.<br/><br/>A great film, patriotic, exciting and very very gripping.

And, unfortunately, the opposite usually occurred--the whole tempo of the film was disrupted and too much money and time was spent following these stars in their brief roles. Apparently, THE LONGEST DAY originated this idea--which came into its own on the many Irwin Allen movies (particularly THE TOWERING INFERNO)--one #@^#&#!&^$!! celebrity after another parading across the screen at the expense of the plot.<br/><br/>And this is really a shame, as at heart, THE LONGEST DAY is a very, very good film. Its production values illustrate how this was a real labor of love for producer and studio head Darryl F. Zanuck.

","When this film was released some 18 years after the events it depicted it's reasonable to assume it would have interested and/or 'spoken' to mostly the survivors and families of the participants, i.e. servicemen/women directly involved, civilians - government personnel, clerks, typists etc - indirectly involved and, as stated, their immediate families. Viewed in 2008 for the first time, courtesy of TV, it's equally reasonable to assume that the majority of the above are no longer with us and/or around 90 years old which means that the film or rather TV)is now targeting a younger audience, one on whom it can't hope to have the same impact. It is, of course, virtually impossible to chronicle accurately everything that occurred on that momentous day but on the whole Cornelius Ryan, who adapted his own book for the screen, has probably done as well as anyone. Because I'm somewhat familiar with the subject via novels like Nevil Shute's Requiem For A Wren I missed the 'feel' of the build-up to the day which Shute captures so well in a novel in which D-Day itself is only peripheral, inasmuch as we enter the action more or less on June 5th but I realise that other viewers will not necessarily share this opinion. Rather bizarrely the necessarily large canvas negates the feeling of a collective effort and there's a danger that some viewers will empathise with one or a group of characters who never appear again. As a great admirer of French films/actors I was delighted to glimpse such luminaries as Arletty, Madeleine Renaud, Bourvil etc even in blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos and I'm sure that Hollywood/UK buffs will feel the same about the likes of Eddie O'Brien, Rod Steiger, Harry Fowler, etc. On the whole I doubt if it could have been done better as an overall picture of a vital moment in wartime."

","The Longest Day is a magnificent story that is still as fresh and relevant as it was when it came out in 1962. The comparisons with 'Saving Private Ryan' that some of the reviewers make here are not relevant. With no disrespect to Spielberg's achievement, 'SPR' in no way compares to this documentary style black and white film. The cast is superb and there is no way a contemporary movie could include such a high caliber collection of star power and talent because frankly, it just doesn't exist these days. Contemporary film makers seem to be too busy rewriting history to be able to tell it accurately and objectively. Many of the  terrific character actors that sparkle in this film would not be instantly recognized, but their performances shine nonetheless. Such actors as Richard Munch ( as General Marks)gives a bird's eye view into the German dilemma of trying to trace the allies true intentions, which were all too cunningly guarded by an invincible 'bodyguard of lies'. Hans Christian Blech also terrific as a German ace pilot in command of the beleaguered Luftwaffe's  front line fighter squadrons gives an unvarnished portrait of the divide between desk-bound commanders and the fighters who have to make do with too few planes and tanks close enough to the front to do any good. Any military man would give gruff assent to this point of view. 'SPR' is told through  undeniably brilliant cinematography and superb direction, 'TLD' is told by some of the best actors of the 20th century and superb editing. Both are valid ways of telling a story but I must say, that while I've seen 'SPR' at least 3 times, 'TLD' is a film I 'must' see at least once a year, especially at Memorial Day, as one of the only ways ( as a tribute to the sacrifices of these men and women) I can attempt to share the experiences of the many thousands who lived and died on that longest day of days."

","....and, yes, that INCLUDES Saving Private Ryan. The Longest Day outshines every other war film ever made. Talk about an all-star cast! The list of stars is amazing - Eddie Albert, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Kurt Jurgens, Fabian, Red Buttons, Richard Burton, Peter Lawford and the list goes on! This film is also proof that you don't need a lot of blood and gore to make a film great - there is little blood and no gore in this one! The film is long - nearly 3 hours, but worth every second of it. This is a more or less factual film about the D-Day landing at Normandy. It includes many of the mistakes made on both sides during that fateful day. The story is told evenly - from all angles, American, British, French and German. The Resistance is given great weight also, as they played very key roles before and during the invasion. The Germans in the film all speak German with subtitles, which is fine and doesn't take away from the film at all. The only ""I wish"" that I have about this film is that I wish it had been filmed in color. But even in B&W, I gave this film a 9. Watch it!"
"filipemanuelneto","7","1","2","23 April 2020"," It is an excellent film, but with problems on several levels.
","The allied landing in Normandy is almost certainly the moment, in the whole World War II, that was most often taken to the cinema. There are, therefore, a lot of films about it. Some are better, others worse. This is one of the most epic, one of the most expensive and one of the best.<br/><br/>I'm not going to waste time explaining what the D Day was because 95% of the people who are going to read this review know what happened there, and the few who still don't know, I advise, should do some reading about it before taking this film. This is because the film does not waste time on explanations either. The script, written by Cornelius Ryan, has serious problems: it is quite clear that the whole effort was focused on reporting, very meticulously and rigorously (as far as I was able to see) the landing and its previous arrangements. One thing I really liked was to see several nationalities and military forces that, alongside the British and Americans, also take part of D-Day: the Scots, the Irish, the free French (I miss the Canadians)... but everything that goes beyond the landing report, and which is also part of a good movie script, has been undervalued: the construction of the characters was limited to a series of sketches, when they are not caricatures, the dialogues are cliché or sound absurd and, moreover, the film has no story to tell that goes beyond the war story. It is the epic ""documentary film"" of war, at its best.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film is that its a nest of highly regarded movie stars who practically limit themselves to appearing and saying something. It is eye-catching for the audience, and the camera work tried to echo that with frontal shots from that stars, but it sucks for the plot because we are seeing the actor So-and-so, not the character he plays. Among the actors that appear in the film we can mention Eddie Albert, Paul Hartmann, Robert Ryan, Curd Jürgens, George Segal, Richard Burton, Hans Christian Blech. I especially liked the work of Henry Fonda, as the Teddy Roosevelt's son, eager to honor his father's name and memory, and to see Sean Connery, still quite unknown (the first 007 film premiered in the same year as this one) playing the role of a simple Scottish soldier, with touches of British humor. John Wayne is good, but he always seemed to me like a very theatrical actor and his characters sound artificial.<br/><br/>Despite all this, this film had the full commitment of its directors, who through it wanted to honor the men who fought that day, winners and losers. That is meritorious. The film has excellent cinematography and an exceptional film and camera work, worthy of the Oscar for Best Black-and-White Cinematography, which won that year. The special, visual and sound effects that were used are also really well done and look great (Best Special Effects it was another Oscar that this film collected). The film has great sets and costumes and an excellent post-production work, where the commitment of all involved is perfectly felt. There is no scene or sequence that seems to be over, or out of place. The film is long, in fact, it is three hours in length, but if the audience gets carried away it will not be a problem.<br/><br/>Technically extraordinary, this film makes a remarkable account of the military events it portrays. But the flaws in the script, the poor construction of characters and dialogues, the constant parade of famous actors with nothing to do hurt the final product."
"jeremy-dent-627-314416","3","1","2","31 January 2020"," The military scenes are laughably amateurish
","I have seen this movie several times over my lifetime. Very little of it is at all credible, as are most war films made by production teams who have not served in combat. The film give a good idea of the logistics involved but the script and age of the actors are huge minuses. The details of how sub-units actually give orders and mobilise into battle are ludicrously simplified. John Wayne is like a comedic representation of an airborne unit commanding officer. There is no impression given of how precisely the landings were co-ordinated and timed and the cameo scenes between generals and operational officers and hilariously poor. How could a regimental commanding officer request his DZs to be changed on the eve of the biggest military operation in history? Years of planning had gone into the overall plan."
"renegadeviking-271-528568","8","1","2","12 January 2020"," The last WWII movie with WWII veterans casted
","The Longest Day may very well be one of the most expansive film projects in history. With four directors, five writers, and forty-two billed international stars, this is an unforgettable movie, and one that used its many stars to their full advantage.<br/><br/>The 1960's were loaded with epics where directors took every big name star on the market and thrust them into a role. It may seem like that's what was done here, but in fact, the casting was excellent, and no one looked out of place, especially the lead actors John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Henry Fonda.<br/><br/>There is also an amazing supporting cast, with actors from America, Britain, France, and Germany, which represented the four countries involved in the D-Day Invasion of Normandy. It takes a whole paragraph just listing their names: Eddie Albert, Richard Burton, Red Buttons, Sean Connery, Jeffrey Hunter, Peter Lawford, Roddy McDowell, Sal Mineo, Kenneth More, Robert Ryan, George Segal, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner, and Stuart Whitman. Singers Paul Anka and Fabian also made appearances as American soldiers. The cast of Germans and French include Hans Christian Blech, Richard Munch, Bourvil, Werner Heinz, and Wolfgang Preiss.<br/><br/>Ken Annakin shot the British scenes, Andrew Marton shot the American scenes, and Bernhard Wicki shot the German ones. Darryl F. Zanuck produced the film and is often credited as a fourth director.<br/><br/>What was really special about this film was the fact that the characters from their respective countries spoke their native language, and subtitles were used on-screen. This was very rarely done by Hollywood back then, and films involving foreign characters were still shot in English, with the vernacular to be assumed by the audience.
The famous opening shot from ""The Longest Day"".<br/><br/>The special effects are also top notch, and the battles scenes and cinematography were worth the Oscars they won. There are may distance shots of the battles scenes, with so much going on and this added to the realism of the movie.<br/><br/>Even with so many stars, this film really does not belong to anyone in particular. Wayne and Mitchum's scenes were brief and spread out evenly throughout the course of the movie. Meanwhile, Henry Fonda recieved less time on screen than any of the top-billed stars.<br/><br/>It's truly amazing to finish this movie and see the end credits role and see so many names whose faces you did not recognize. There are so many small scenes and cameos all around, that it could almost be made into a game with whoever you are watching this film with, to try and name who is on screen.<br/><br/>This film would work really well as a compliment to Saving Private Ryan, which is considered the definitive D-Day movie, despite it being only one scene at the beginning. Watching The Longest Day before watching that will help you to understand what went behind the largest invasion in modern warfare history. That's why this movie is so great, because it is not just one big battle, but lots of dialogue explaining every mission involved, no matter how menial.<br/><br/>I will make my final rating a 9 out of 10, because I am still impressed at the special effects and star power every time I sit down to watch it."
"antagonist117","9","1","2","19 June 2013"," A movie so huge it needs repeat viewings
","An hour and a half into the movie we're still meeting new characters, most of whom are played by major celebrities of the day. Though many of these characters appear in only a couple of scenes, they are introduced with text at the bottom of the screen giving their name and rank. This technique is not necessarily helpful in keeping track of the action, as there are simply too many characters to memorize during a single sitting, but on repeat viewings the pieces should fall more perfectly into place. And fans of classic war pictures will want to see this one more than once, as the story is enormously entertaining. The storming of the beaches is a monumental action sequence that gives the impression of a full-scale recreation. The Nazi characters' use of actual German rather than German- accented English lends a sense of realism that sets the movie apart from many other war epics of the period. Toward the end of this largely triumphant narrative, Richard Burton's world-weary RAF pilot offers a touch of cynicism that also rings true."

For the 3 hours of the movie, you see D day come together as each nationality appear and discuss plans and battle it out with the enemy.<br/><br/>The action scenes are excellent as they come in the form of several battles between each army. Battles make ear blasting use of machine guns, cannons, planes, battleships, rifles, grenades, cannons, tanks and gattling guns. The many battle scenes which show soldiers pouring out of small boats and onto different beaches while being shot and bombed at are truly breathtaking.<br/><br/>The theme music is brilliant and the film is beautifully produced by Darryl F Zanuck and perfectly written for the cinema by James Jones, Romain Gary, Cornelius Ryan, David Pursall and Jack Seddon. The direction should be an example to all film makers today and the film was stunningly directed by no more than six directors, Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, Gerd Oswald, Darryl F Zanuck and John Wayne. The fact that the movie took millions of dollars to make and involved thousands of cast and crew members make this film a true epic.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to anybody.

"tieman64","Null","1","2","28 August 2011"," Zanuck invades Europe
","""No matter what political reasons are given for war, the underlying reason is always economic."" - A. Taylor <br/><br/>Before Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" collected all WW2 clichés and dressed them up in money, shaky-cam and faux black and white cinematography, producer and movie mogul Darryl F. Zanuck did the same with ""The Longest Day"", an expensive mega-production which hoped to capture the ""spectacle, horror and sacrifice of Allied soldiers"" during WW2 and D-Day.<br/><br/>Younger audiences raised on kill-a-second video games and indoctrinated in ""Private Ryan's"" sexy shaky-cam carnage will no doubt find Zanuck's production tame (""Where's the blood, man? I want more squibs!""), but virtually every sequence in ""Private Ryan"" is done here equally well, and at times better, though Zanuck's agenda is ultimately the same as Spielberg's: a celebration of movie technology, spectacle, action and glamour in the guise of deceitful notions of ""humanism"", ""brotherhood"", ""humanity"", ""heroism"", ""honour"", ""sacrifice"", ""pride"" and ""country"". And as Zanuck's films runs for almost 3 hours, scenes you've seen in other old B or A list WW2 movies pop up as well.<br/><br/>Though ""The Longest Day"" was directed by over five directors, its real auteur is Zanuck and so it manages to maintain a consistent tone and voice throughout. Most of it is aestheticized slaughter, though, war lovingly recreated, documentary style, for no reason other than to recreate, faithfully, war, documentary style. The idea here is that the images speak for themselves, but of course this is never the end result. It's less salacious and exploitative than ""Ryan"", but the ultimate effect is the same. And so we smile as a haggard John Wayne (draft dodger and armchair war-hawk) kills Germans and squirm as a brave Robert Mitchum guns his way up a beach. Sean Connery and Richard Burton's square jaws makes us proud, Henry Fonda's gentleness touches our hearts and we marvel at scene after scene of exciting, righteous murder, in which wrong-footed Germans (the film even makes a point about their shoes being on their wrong feet) are lovingly perforated. People die? Yeah, but we're dodging bullets by proxy, baby. Meanwhile, the truths of world wars 1 and 2 are brushed aside, thinking is admonished, myths and cosy iconography are reheated, and all history, nuances, complexity, ambiguities, politics and context are ignored.<br/><br/>Still, some of the film's moments are haunting. Zanuck's smoke shrouded cliffs and beaches are ghostly, haunting even, shots of corpses hanging from parachutes stuck in trees achieve a kind of macabre surrealism, and one long helicopter take into Ouistreham, in which a disembodied camera tracks a platoon as it guns its way across a river, over a bridge, into a town and then up a building, is special, echoing the floating cameras of Jancso's ""The Red and the White"" and Rosselini's ""Garibaldi"". There are other good moments, like one in which a group of nuns glide serenely through a gun fight, the nightmarish burning of St Mere Eglise, the film's overall look of grey, concrete and cement, and Zanuck's protracted beach landing (contrary to ""Private Ryan"", the landings weren't frenetic blood baths; the beaches were too big, forces separate and progress slow). The film's final shot, a helmet on a beach, would be re-textured with the final shot of Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"", a germinating coconut on a beach, death sprouting life. The sheer scope and scale of Zanuck's film is also overwhelming (his battlefield sets are spectacularly expansive, but not as turgidly so as other epics), and the film's production design is impressive. Again though, it's all technique.<br/><br/>Ironically, ""The Longest Day"" was part of a group of war films released between 1965 and 1977 (""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", ""The Battle of Britain"", ""Battle of the Bulge"", ""Cross of Iron"", ""Patton"", ""633 Squadron"" etc) which promised to broaden the scope of previous war films by focusing on as wide a cross section of the military as possible. In these films, generals, soldiers, sergeants, medics, lieutenants, Army personnel, Navy personnel, Airforce personnel, nurses, doctors, civilians etc, all came together in a kind of narrative cocktail, the entire military body working together to achieve some goal.<br/><br/>Unlike the platoon genre, these ""heirarchal films"" thus aimed to portray war on a far larger canvas. They promised to offer audiences the ""spectacle of history"", viewers being granted a nuts and bolts recreation of some historical event in which the entire hierarchy of the military machine took part.<br/><br/>Significantly, the event being recreated often revolved around some grand disaster: Pearl Harbour being attacked, Britain being blitzed, D-day going awry, the German advance in the Battle of the Bulge etc. These are all films in which noble Allies bravely fight against all odds (against an overwhelming, savage, superior foe), only to eventually emerge with a kind of bittersweet victory. These films thus display contempt and reverence in equal measure.<br/><br/>The last film in this cycle was ""A Bridge Too Far"" (1977), by which time audiences were tired of WW2. At this point a series of cathartic Vietnam films were realised, culminating in the angry sermons of ""Rambo"" and ""Platoon"". But covertly, all these films succumb to the Cult of the Military. The Cult which says that Freedom isn't free, and that the cost of freedom is blood which must be periodically sacrificed on the altar of Liberty by the military clergy. This kind of thinking tends to believe that we only have freedom because we are allowed it by the state, to whom we should therefore be devoted, obedient, unquestioning and grateful. Of course Zanuck's films were often propagandistic, from his Bible movies, to his Lincolm movie to his ""The House of Rothschild's"". He'd turn his hands to Pearl Harbour later.<br/><br/>7.9/10 - Simple war porn with impressive choreography, vast sets and careful set design. Worth one viewing."

","I agree with the depth of D-Day being captured fabulously by this film. I used to watch this with my Dad on TV whenever it was on. I will always remember the dum-dum-de-dum intro because it was so foreboding. As an adult I've watched it. For the first-time viewer it can be difficult to keep track of all the players because the first 20 minutes or so of the movie certainly throws a lot at you. With repeat viewings it gets easier. It's too bad that we never learn the fate of Henry Fonda's character since Teddy Roosevelt Jr. perished in the invasion but the film does not point this out. The last we see of Fonda is when he is wading onto Utah beach with his regiment. Also, the cast credits on IMDb list Lee Strasberg in a minor role but I've never been able to locate him in the film. Any help with this? All in all, ""The Longest Day"" remains one of the penultimate war films of the 1960's (along with ""Guns Of Navarone"", ""The Great Escape"", ""The Dirty Dozen"" and maybe ""Von Ryan's Express"".) Would've loved to have seen more of Rod Steiger and Richard Burton and others but, I guess you can fit only so many international faces on screen in three hours."

The troopers were sometimes dropped right into enemy garrisons or killed by small arms fire before they even touched ground.<br/><br/>One bad thing about the movie is that it contains a couple of scenes that were supposed to illustrate the madness of war in a  funny/sarcastic way.

This and Saving Private Ryan are the genre leaders for this historical event and therefore comparisons between the two are inevitable.<br/><br/>The Longest Day is like a diluted version of Saving Private Ryan - you get a lot more but much less strength. Where Private Ryan chooses to dissect the real effects of war on the individual, this movie shows as many aspects of D-Day as possible to provide a complete, unbiased view of the events (we see the war as viewed from the outside rather than the inside). For example, I think the scale of the D-Day invasion is realised in Longest Day, but not in Private Ryan, where I found the opening sequence harrowing but somewhat like a small commando attack rather than the largest invasion ever staged.<br/><br/>

This movie was made by people who not only remember the events, some like Eddie Albert, were actually serving in the military during WWII.  Because of this fact, this is one movie that does not need to be remade.  The true meaning just can't be brought forward by the actors of today, no matter how talented."
"sychonic","Null","1","2","28 May 2001"," One of the best war movies every made. Period.
","This movie defines the word ""epic"". Everything here is massive: The biggest stars, the biggest cast, the longest running time, the most directors. Big, big, big.   I still find this movie to be surprisingly fresh, even after forty years.   No, it's not Saving Private Ryan, it's far better.  But really, it's essentially a different movie.  ""Ryan"" wasn't really about D-Day.  It was about a small group of soldiers in battle--it was rather comparable to ""Midnight Clear"" with Ethan Hawke, or ""The Victors"" with George Hamilton.  Not that it's a bad movie, of course, Ryan was imaginitive, and intense, but it simply can't compare to this incredible production. <br/><br/>The Longest Day gave great context, the issues and questions.  It established the reasons, the strategy and tactics, and in some cases, the utter foolishness.  Nothing here seems to go right for the AMericans and British, or the French for that matter.  And I think the criticism about lacking in reality are utterly misplaced: I could just smell the fear of Red Buttons as he's dangling on the church, or the utterly exhausted and petrified Richard Beymer. Or the frustration of George Segal after his men die pointlessly.  (Small spoiler here) When Jeff Hunter is killed, it's rather effective.  <br/><br/>John Wayne is often thought to be a rather wooden actor, nothing could be the further from the truth; his bitter rage when coming across his dead soldiers hanging from the poles is trenchant, and one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.  I think he can communicate more feeling and emotion in one look than many actors can in a soliloqy.  There's a reason he's the center of this movie--because there aren't many actors of his stature. <br/><br/>
Perhaps another asset here is that the producers avoided making the Germans into cartoon villains.  They are some of the most impressive characters--actual human beings.  They're caught up in the same situation as the allies, and are doing what they feel is right and honorable.  And they don't use silly German accents to approximate speaking German, they just use subtitles--something directors who don't underestimate the intelligence of an audience do.<br/><br/>If there is a flaw here it's that we aren't really given enough of each actor--there being so many.  They're not really given an opportunity to flesh out the people caught up in the storm.  For the destructiveness of war on a grand scale, this is a wonderful movie.  No, it's not the most deeply effecting when it comes to the human destruction--see ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" for that."

","This is truly a Hollywood War Movie. With its expensive staging and some impressive aerial shots it looks, at times, quite remarkable. But at other times not so much. Some of the sets look staged and are so over lit and glossy they resemble something from the Theatre or Television. These seem irredeemably self-conscious and corny, as does much of the acting and dialog.<br/><br/>The Military details and the Historical accuracy, or lack thereof, have been discussed by experts and let's leave it for them and concentrate on the Film as a Film, the Movie as a Movie. In short, its entertainment value and not its value as a Documentary account.<br/><br/>As mentioned the long shots are stunning and it shows what you can do with time and money. But this is all undercut by some really shoddy back projections and lackluster troop invasion scenes. Yes, there are lots of soldiers (again, time and money) but they are completely unrealistic and uninspired. <br/><br/>The unending list of name Actors fare even worse with little screen time. What motivation and character development we have are dated platitudes, fake humility and bravado, along with some intrusive unfunny comedy relief. There is not one memorable or engaging performance.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a sprawling epic and cuts a wide swath that only money and time will allow, but it is all done with a heavy hand, a pandering patriotic pathos, and not much verisimilitude. It is a dressed up delivery of imitative imagination in a noble, but elated production."

"kingtanichi","Null","2","8","19 May 2004"," The most over-rated movie ever made
","There is too much good stuff in The Longest Day for it to be called totally worthless, but it's certainly less good than you'd think, given its credentials. The film was an incredibly epic production, probably right up there with Lawrence of Arabia for sheer number of extras, number of costumes, number of locations, etc. This may actually be the films problem: it's too big to hold together, and collapses under its own weight.<br/><br/>The film touted itself as having a cast of ""48 international stars."" I don't think its being timid to say that's too many. It obviously lets out much by way of character development, and even makes it hard to keep track of who's who. The audience is expected to keep track of dozens of subtitles telling characters' names and affiliations. This is mitigated somewhat by the star system, however that brings up another problem -- no single player is able to get enough screen time to really capture our attention. John Wayne swaggers forth for what looks like it could have been one of the best movies of his career, and then never really gets to do anything.<br/><br/>And really, the script is just plain bad. A lot of the dialogue sounds bizarrely amateurish, and more than a few situations are so badly conceived its more like a comedy than a ""war epic."" Big dramatic moments are written in that never come to anything, and supposedly big moments are shoehorned in when there's been nothing to remotely build up to them. Any kind of tension or coherent pacing are nowhere to be seen, and this is worsened by the fact that the film is criminally over-long. It could have ended over an hour before it does, and when it finally does end, it would be hard to imagine a more arbitrary moment for it.<br/><br/>One can probably tell a lot from the fact that the film had three directors, nearly a dozen screenwriters, and an army of consultants. With so many voices clamouring at once, its no surprise the film takes the vague, rambling shape it does, with no single, coherent voice shining through.<br/><br/>And the combat. Oh, the combat. Imagine if you will the fantasies of a six-year old with only the vaguest idea of what a war consists of. Now imagine that same six-year old given a Hollywood epic budget to put his fantasies on screen. That's what a lot of the film's fighting looks like. We're spoiled for realism in this age of Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down, where We Were Soldiers is the worst it gets. The Longest Day is the product of another age, where it was thought necessary to romanticize war and lionize the soldiers in it. When it was an odious task to have to show a single GI get killed, and would be made up for by showing 50 Germans with machine guns get gunned down by one GI with a rifle and a few grenades (which in this movie, seem mysteriously to be nothing more than smoke grenades).<br/><br/>The only redeeming moments in this movie come from the odd moment when one of its stars gets enough screen time to say something memorable, or the odd cleverly scripted moment. Big, grandiose aerial shots of battle mean little when they're in no coherent context, and it doesn't help that they're interspersed with gratuitously slapstick humour. This movie is not even worth wasting a coupon on."

","I saw this movie many years ago and only recently rented it on DVD. For my money this movie is very disappointing, full of cliches, rehashed scenes, cardboard characters, and above all totally biased towards the American military. As soon as I saw that ""Green Acres"" oddball Eddie Albert strutting around like an ageing thespian and John Wayne with his typical gung-ho attitude, I realised my memories of the original film were distinctly vague. This is an awful film, and I have to say the best performances came from the actors portraying the Germans. Maybe it appeals to 10-year-olds, but to those of us who took part in the war, and have longer memories, it's an extremely poor attempt at covering what was a momentous time in history. The British forces too were presented as cartoon characters as is often Hollywood's manner. Compare it to Saving Private Ryan? Well at least in TLD there were British forces present at Normandy. For Americans note the war started in 1939, not 1942 when the ""yanks"" decided to save the world."

","This movie is one of the finest war movies that I've ever seen and unlike most movies that i've seen about the D-Day invasion this one goes into much more detail despite some inaccuracies that frustrated the real people even General Eisenhower walked out of this movie when it was being shown in theaters due to inaccuracies. Operation Overlord is frequently associated with Eisenhower as he was the architect of the invasion and during that time he sent fake intelligence to the Germans to trick them about the invasion. The movie also talks about the American soldiers behind the scenes such as Col. Benjamin Vandervoort (John Wayne), Brig. Gen. Norman Cota (Robert Mitchum), Brig. Gen. James m. Gavin (Robert Ryan), Col. Thompson (Eddie Albert), as well as the son of Theodore Roosevelt (Henry Fonda) who was a Brigadier General. The film also tells its story from the British and German perspective with precision and marvelous detail and perfectionism thanks to the direction by Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, and Berhnard Wicki who directed one of each of the episodes of this movie on such an excellent level. The performances are also excellent and impressive with actors from different parts of the world, and an excellent supporting cast including Richard Burton as British flying officer David Campbell, and along with Mitchum, Fonda, Ryan, and Albert, there is also people like Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Jeffery Hunter, Paul Anka, and especially a young Sean Connery who doesn't have that many scenes but makes it count with the amount of screen time he has. Feature films aren't known for accuracy when they're telling real life stories but documentaries are the only ones that are which doesn't bring this movie down one bit. The writing is superb, the performances are top notch,and every person involved made it into a masterpiece that ranks among the best military movies ever made such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), ""The Great Escape"" (1963), ""Platoon"" (1986), ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978), ""Where Eagles Dare"" (1968), as well as many others. This is an essential movie that is required viewing for history students who are studying World War II in their respective classes, and it is one of the most patriotic movies i've ever seen, as well as being one of 1962's finest films."

","""The Longest Day"" is a small miracle of a movie. Despite being directed by a handful of different men, it manages to be more coherent and more consistent in tone across its considerable running time than many films directed by a single person. This is not an episodic film in the sense that each director gets his own moment to shine before handing another section of the movie over to someone else; no, all of the variously directed segments are interwoven into a seamless narrative about the events leading up to and taking place on the day of the American invasion of Normandy during WWII.<br/><br/>Released in 1962 and produced by an artist of the old school, Darryl F. Zanuck, ""The Longest Day"" sits somewhere between the patriotic WWII films of the 1940s and 50s, to a greater or lesser degree all propaganda films, and those of the 1970s and 80s, which would downplay the heroism of war and instead focus on its barbarity and its toll, physical and mental, on those who fight them. This film leans much more toward the former, but it does dip its toes in the water of the latter by including a couple of moments that ask us to reflect on the sheer horror of what it must have been like to see combat during the World War. Of course, compared to a film like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" its version of the Normandy beach landing looks quaint, but taken as a whole this film is better than Spielberg's, because it rejects the maudlin and sentimental story around which Spielberg anchored his film and replaces it with a much more objective, journalistic style. The film looks jaw-droppingly amazing, a marvel of sheer physical scale. If this were made today, CGI effects would do at least a half of what real actors and physical locations do in this film.<br/><br/>The film stars everybody and his mother. OK, so actually it doesn't feature anyone's mother, since only one role in the movie out of hundreds, that of a French resistance fighter, is played by a female. But it's a who's who of male talent, some of them -- John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Richard Burton -- already superstars when the film was released, and others -- Sean Connery, George Segal, Rod Steiger -- about to become so.<br/><br/>But the real star of ""The Longest Day"" is Samuel E. Beetley, the film's editor. This is a movie entirely made in the editing room, and it's one of the best examples of the art form ever committed to screen. Beetley was rightfully nominated for an Oscar nomination, but had the misfortune of seeing his work go up against that other little movie from 1962, ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" which won just about every technical award it could. That would have been a tough choice, but I'm not so sure that, much as I love ""Lawrence"" and think it's overall by far the better film, I wouldn't have given Beetley his due.<br/><br/>The film did win Oscars for its black and white cinematography (thankfully ""Lawrence"" was in color) and its special effects. In addition to editing, it received nominations for Best Picture and Best Art Direction (B&W), which is also phenomenal.<br/><br/>Oscar trivia: ""The Longest Day"" was one of three films in 1962 (the other two being ""The Music Man"" and ""Mutiny on the Bounty"") that managed to be nominated for Best Picture without receiving nominations for directing, acting, or writing, the only time that's ever happened in a year with only five Best Picture nominees.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Producer Darryl F. Zanuck dreamed about making Cornelius Ryan's bestselling World War II book about the Allied invasion of Normandy into a major motion picture. Reportedly, Zanuck anted up $175-thousand to obtain the screen rights to Ryan's book. Nevertheless, neither Ryan nor Zanuck got along well with each other. Ostensibly, ""The Longest Day"" represents the high water mark of World War II movies. No movie before it had the cast that this Twentieth Century Fox film boasted and afterward only ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Battle of Britain"" approached it in terms of prestige. The cast is truly legendary with luminaries like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, George Segal, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Curd Jürgens, Robert Ryan, Kenneth More, Gert Fröbe, Peter Lawford, Robert Wagner, and Stuart Whitman. Five directors helmed the sprawling action scenes, with Andrew Marton directing the American scenes, Ken Annakin handling the British scenes, and Bernhard Wicki lensing the German scenes. Most of what happens occurs in vignettes that feature a major star. The paratrooper scenes are incredible, especially when Red Button is trapped atop of a bell tower while his fellow jumpers landed in a square and were picked off by the Germans like fish in a barrel. The black & white cinematography adds an element of authenticity, and the whistling theme is classic. Interestingly enough, the Twentieth Century Fox logo with the searchlights is never shown in this film. Just as interestingly, despite all the participants of the actual battle who served as advisors, former top commanding general Dwight Eisenhower walked out of the film because so many technical errors were committed. ""The Longest Day"" opens with the Allies mobilizing for the cross Channel invasion and keeping an eye on the weather. Reluctantly, Ike (Henry Grace) decides to commit the Allies to a landing during stormy weather. Essentially, the Allies caught the Germans sleeping and battered their way through enemy lines. The Allies dropped in dummies that activated and created noise designed to detract from the appearance of real soldiers. The dialogue is memorable, too."

","**This Review May Contain Spoilers**<br/><br/>There are many great war films. They are in a class by themselves, and can never be replaced. However some are the more elite, effectively capturing a time and crucial moment in history we might not have known much about. This is one of them. <br/><br/>Darryl F. Zanuck's The Longest Day is possibly the best of the elite war films, and one of the greatest of all time. The key comes from the realistically staged and recreated invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. He could have made it a overly American film, and it would have been forgotten. But Zanuck put his heart and soul into the film and tries to present each side with dignity and honor. And with success.<br/><br/>For instance when Pluskat sees the invasion coming, it is darkly funny. But this is not to make Pluskat look like an idiot Nazi, it made it so he is a guy doing his job and frightened of whats coming toward him. Another when Richard Burton and Richard Beymer sit and smoke waiting for the Allies, they get into deep thoughts about the war. They are indeed patriotic soldiers, but they are tired, frustrated, and sick of the war. That is inspired writing, directing, and casting. I believe the greatest moment is delivered by Curt Jurgens at the end when he realizes he won't stop the Allies. The subtlety is unrivaled<br/><br/>Every cast member has his own story and moment, and all is executed flawlessly. it can be a long movie at the start, but once the invasion begins, you are on pins and needles the entire time.<br/><br/>One of the greatest films.

Whether English, German or French, all of the roles are beautifully played.<br/><br/>With the Fuhrer having taken a ""sleeping pill"", the German commanders realize they are losing the war. Unfortunately, it's such an epic film that it doesn't give you a chance to identify with any of the characters to the extent that you can care what becomes of them. That, indeed, is the film's major flaw.<br/><br/>Truthfully, while all of the invasion sequences are extremely well staged for maximum effect, what's distracting is when the viewer's attention strays from the story upon seeing name players pop up unexpectedly in the midst of explosive action. Just a few of the names come readily to mind: JOHN WAYNE, PETER LAWFORD, RODDY McDOWELL, SEAN CONNERY, ROBERT MITCHUM, RED BUTTONS, HENRY FONDA, ROBERT RYAN, ROD STEIGER, RICHARD BEYMER and others. Fox seemed intent on using just about every male star in the business to fill the huge number of speaking roles.<br/><br/>Summing up: If World War II war films about D-Day, the 6th of June, are of interest to you, THE LONGEST DAY, from a novel by Cornelius Ryan, is an essential, not to be missed, in all of its B&W glory."

","I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release when I was a boy which was the only time I have seen it on the big screen. It of course is the story of Decision Day better known as D-Day, June 6, 1944 and the allied invasion of Normany setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to the end of the war in Europe 10 months later. 2,700 ships carrying 176,000 soldiers land on the heavily fortified German controlled beaches of Normandy. Thousands were killed in fighting so brutal that over the bodies 1500 men were blown to bits or swept out to sea and were never recovered. In recent years Steven Spielberg chronicled the event in his film Saving Private Ryan. In that film you are put directly into the battle and it's graphic depiction. That film couldn't have been made in 1962 before Vietnam. This film, The Longest Day is more of the overall telling of the day. German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was said to have called D-Day, the longest day of the century. From that quote author Cornelius Ryan titled his best selling 1959 book from which this film is adapted from. Told in three parts, The Waiting as they prepare the invasion, The Night as the allies prepare it's launch and the Germans prepare their defense and The Day of the invasion. Ryan drafted the screenplay along with Romain Gary, James Jones, David Pursall and Jack Seddan. It took an equal amount of cinematographers to film it led by Jean Bourgin and Walter Wattiz the all-French photographic team included Pierre Levant, Henri Persin and Guy Tabary which won them the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography in the last black and white epic filmed. The film won a second Academy Award for special effects. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction and Best Editing. This film was producer Darryl F. Zannuck's pet project and he claimed to have directed much of it although uncredited in that role he obviously oversaw it's production and it's use of multiple directors to have so many directors turn out a seamless production. Principal directors Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton are supplemented with director Bernard Wicki and second unit directors Gerd Oswald and Elmo Williams in addition to six assistant directors. Shot in 31 locations in France and Corsica including studio locations everything about this movie is on a grand scale. So much so it required four production managers.

It could be potentially disastrous otherwise!<br/><br/>However, I wonder if the soldiers on the battlefield could really be moving so slowly, and actually had time to get down to talk about the boots worn by the Germans and why one wore a lifecoat.

WWII was still a vivid memory to many of the makers (Richard Todd virtually plays himself in this film) and understandably they submit to the temptation of making their comrades a little more consciously heroic than they were. This after all is designed to be an entertainment - not a documentary. Nevertheless there is a more even handed treatment of the material than you might expect, the victory is shown as being as much due to German errors as to Allied successes and the acknowledgement of the parts played by the Free French and resistance groups seems more enlightened than modern Hollywood often manages. Three pieces of tour-de-force camera work stick out vividly - a small group of GI's playing craps is revealed, through a spectacular zoom out and tracking shot to be a vast dormitory of soldiers awaiting the word to go. Two Luftwaffe fighters strafe the beaches and we see every bit of WWII hardware the production could lay hands on as we see the attack run from the fighters POV. Finally the opening of the assault on a German garrison filmed as another single tracking shot that must have taken whole days to re-set between takes.<br/><br/>Dated yes but still a significant piece of cinema and a fitting tribute to the Men and Women who lost their lives in June 1944."

The man played by Sean Connery was very lowkey and had perhaps a couple of lines.  Robert Mitchum was great!  In one scene he made one of his men go back to the beach to grab his rifle!!  I WILL NEVER FORGET THOSE BRAVE SOULS WHO SACRAFICED THEIR LIVES FOR OUR COUNTRY!!!!  This is one movie I will watch OVER AND OVER!!!!!!!!!"

","It's not that I consider this the most brilliant film about war - Saving Private Ryan or Paths of Glory have better credits - but for me in the seventies as a child, to watch it was very impressive. Since than, the 6th of June to me always has been a day to remember the dramatic events of 1944. Though I have seen the film only twice - and already years ago - I can vividly recall every image."

","The ""Longest Day"" is a massive film of the greatest day of the war.  The movie begins with the pre-invasion plans by the generals and the rest of the army.  It shows many of the key officer's plans, complaints and excitement about the forthcoming invasion.  From there the movie recounts the incidents from every aspect of D-Day: the citizens of Normandy, the Germans, the Paratroopers, the troops who landed on the beaches those troops who had to scale to verticle sea cliffs in order to even reach the enemy.<br/><br/>
""The Longest Day"" won two 1962 Oscars, one of which was for cinematography, and although it is 1962 black and white you can still appreciate the cinematography. One of my favorite scenes from the movie was when Major Pluskat (Hans Christian Blech) is looking out his dugout window and he ses that massive Allies armada appear on the horizon.<br/><br/>An amazing cast ensemble.  How many other movies could boast a cast of over 40 international stars. When someone asks you who's in the movie you could go on for a couple minutes listing easily recognizable names.  The leading names in the movie include war film legends John Wayne, Henry Fonda, and Robert Mitchum.  John Wayne leads the paratroopers while Fonda and Mitchum take the beaches.  Allies and axis rivals Sean Connery and Gerte Frobe two years later will team up again as rivals only this time as James Bond and Goldfinger.  None of these stands out above the rest they all did an excellent job.<br/><br/>This movie is very much worth the time to watch it."

","If you want an all-round, (relatively) unbiased overview of the D-Day landings, then this is the film to watch. Reasonably accurate, historically, with some good acting performances from some big screen names. It is somewhat sanitised, with regards to the battle scenes, although this is hardly surprising, given the year it was made. If you get the chance, read the book of the same name, by Cornelius Ryan, to see just how accurate this film is, you may be slightly surprised. All in all, an excellent film, even now, nearly 40 years later.<br/><br/>On a slightly different note. I was under the impression that this film, when made, was the most expensive black & white film ever made. Well, they made a colour version of it too. A fact I was totally unaware of, until I saw it on TV this afternoon. I even had to get my old, taped, copy of the film, to check. Every time I've seen this film, it's been in black & white, and all this time, a colour version was available."

","Any war movie with John Wayne isn't worth your time, even The Sands of Iwo Jima.  He is no better here as the gung-ho airborne commander.  I don't see what the Zanuck's saw in him other than box office exploitation.<br/><br/>The other day I sat down and made a list of all the war movies I'd seen, many of the embarrassing ones of my youth cropped up along the way and then I remembered The Longest Day.  So, in an attempt to clear my conscience, I rented it and became sorely UN-impressed.  The Longest Day has no credibility.  It is too concerned with ""Kraut-bashing"" to be of any historical value and even the French are poorly represented.  It wants to be a happy-sappy excursion in futile heroics and false patriotism.  What a load of...<br/><br/>Many scenes have aged worse than your grandmother.  What might have worked in 1962 doesn't work today.  And people thought John Hughes was bad...<br/><br/>The depiction of war here is in the same vein as other garbage from the 50s and 60s, gung-ho and inconsequential.  Patton and Platoon, among others, covered these grounds--sometimes more preachy than in other instances.<br/><br/>Overall, a poor excuse for a war movie.  While Saving Private Ryan is a load of patriotic hooey, at least it was concerned about people and not events. For a better understanding, watch Tora! Tora! Tora!  1 out of 5 stars."

","The D-Day invasion was a major event in the history of the world. Eisenhower decided that it was time to join the allies and invade via the beaches at Normandy. This movie could have beens stronger if it had been a little more concise and taken on a smaller piece of the story. It tries to get at virtually every aspect of the invasion from the points of view of five different entities. Granted, it has some incredible performances (and some sort of dull ones), but, again, there were just too many stories to keep track of; hence, most of them are just a bit undernourished. Don't get me wrong. It's a terrific film at time, and they do a good job of presenting that story. The movie is based on a very extensive novel by Cornelius Ryan."

","The Longest Day has been one of my favorite WW2 movies of all time. There is so much packed in that you can see it multiple times and still pick up things you may have missed. The only weak point for me is the casting of Red Buttons as a US paratrooper. Aside from that excellent work from many people some of whom include: Henry Fonda as Teddy Roosevelt Jr demanding to be included in the invasion with his men.<br/><br/>Jeffery Hunter - very good as a member of the demolition team on Omaha beach who has to take over when his officers are killed. The movie did a very good job of showing how regular/nameless people like Hunter's character would play such a big part in winning a battle and no one other than the people there ever knowing about it.<br/><br/>Richard Burton as the last of the RAF pilots from the start of the war. He doesn't have a big part but gets a lot in on the few scenes he has.<br/><br/>Sean Connery - excellent as a little comedy relief Curt Jurgens as the German general knowing re-enforcements were needed but caught between Hitler throwing a tantrum and his boss who refuses to speak to Hitler personally ""Get on my knees to that Bohemian Corporal?? Never !"" Richard Todd as the Brit told to ""hold until relieved"" and not know if the relief would ever come.<br/><br/>A short scene where a group of nuns arrive during the middle of a battle showing as much courage as anyone there to try to help with the wounded They had people from the French Resistance, Rommel, war correspondents, the beach masters, it seemed like they tried to cover just about every aspect, most for just a few minutes but very well done.

"kenobi7","10","1","4","18 June 2009"," The definitive war film of cinematic and historic genius.
","""THE LONGEST DAY"", based on a book by Cornelius Ryan, tells us of the events of and surrounding D-Day, the World War II invasion executed on June 6, 1944. We see almost everything from the perspectives of both the Allied and Axis forces. It is a brilliantly made, extremely well-acted, and above all, a genuinely felt war epic. Just about every actor that ever worked in Hollywood during the ""golden age"" is here to lend their excellent acting abilities- John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Beymer, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Stuart Whitman, Roddy McDowall, Robert Wagner, Curt Jurgens, Sean Connery, and so many others. But even more worthy of top billing is the invasion itself. The actors and actresses, great as they are, are far outshined by the scope and grand scale of the invasion, which, in turn, gives the film immeasurable quality. The entire film is perfect. Every part of it is a complement to everything else: the acting, the black-and-white cinematography, the music (by Maurice Jarre and theme music by Paul Anka), the wonder, the awe, the irony-absolutely nothing is out of place. I believe the only reason that movies, television, documentaries, and anything else to do with the art of film should or ever needs to exist is to make us believe in the subject matter. It's not about the paycheck, the latest romantic scandal, or to show off. The purpose is to make us believe, recognize the character's attributes (or lack thereof) within ourselves, and for the cast and crew to do their best. Not every movie has succeeded, but many have, and it's a pity that many of today's films do not. Even though World War II did occur, as well as D-Day, Pearl Harbor, and all the rest, the audiences of war films could never believe for themselves that those things did happen if the movies were not believable. Fortunately, this film is very believable and realistic, and the stock footage from the actual invasion is a great asset. As a matter of fact, ""THE LONGEST DAY"" is probably one of the best films ever made (on the subject of war or otherwise). It defies the use of unnecessary gore in ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"", and even uses all the elements from many other films - such as the ""get-in-blow-it-up-get-out"" theme from ""THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI"" and ""THE GUNS OF NAVARONE"" (both great films). The unrest and comraderie among superiors and subordinates, the escapism, the adventure, the horror, the frustration - all have been used before, and not just in war films. Not to mention that this film also succeeds as both a ""buddy film"", and, of course, a ""guy movie"". But it is this movie that, even though it was one of the last of the greatest war movies, sets the tone for all the others. As a final note, ""THE LONGEST DAY"" also has some of the best scenes ever captured on film. A lot of the old clichés are used, and some new ones as well. Kenneth More's entire performance, the two guys with the pigeons, John Wayne exhibiting his tough guy persona, etc. The sporadic wry humor, the great action pieces, the use of actual footage from the invasion, is all used very well. To list some of my favorite scenes from this movie would take forever and a day, but my top favorites are as follows: John Wayne's first scene when he suddenly turns around and you're thinking, ""Holy Smokes! It's the Duke!"" (let me assure you that those are my exact feelings every time), the introduction of ""Rupert"" (and when he is introduced to the German officers), the use of codes, the boats unloading the troops onto the beach, the guy on bagpipes, the ""hold until relieved"", all the character pieces, and so much more. A tried-and-true, dignified, immensely entertaining, miraculous, illustrious slice of history. <br/><br/>Also Recommended: ""STAGECOACH"" (1939), ""JESSE JAMES"" (1939), ""D.O.A."" (1950), ""THE NAKED SPUR"" (1954), ""JOHNNY TREMAIN"" (1957) <br/><br/>THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF ""THE LONGEST DAY"", AND TO ANYONE WHO IS CURRENTLY OR EVER HAS FOUGHT IN A WAR."
"Scott_Mercer","8","1","4","27 April 2008"," Bad Presentation
","I had the misfortune of watching this film last night on the AMC cable channel. Don't do it! I should have known better, because I know how AMC handles their product, but it was late at night and nothing else was on the tube but infomercials.<br/><br/>The channel showed this widescreen film pan-and-scan, which is an abomination, first and foremost. Then, secondly, they interrupt the film for a commercial break every 5 to 7 minutes! Agghh! I will grant that the commercial breaks were not that long (2-4 minutes), but, when dealing with a film that is 3 hours long, and has such an epic scope, these frequent interruptions become trying pretty quickly. These frequent interruptions are less irksome when AMC shows Hollywood fluff like action films or comedies (anything with Eddie Murphy comes to mind), which, also, are much shorter, but with an intense, long, epic film like this, they rise to the level of maddening soon enough.<br/><br/>I have to say, I stuck with the film since I was over an hour into it and wanted to see it through to the end, but I did so through clenched teeth, and finally went to bed in the wee hours.<br/><br/>The film itself is pretty great. Yes, in a way, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has trumped its beach landing scenario with film-making that seems both more realistic and more modern. But this was state-of-the-art epic Hollywood craftsmanship in 1962, and the subject befits this sweeping, epic approach. Such an amazing topic that the idea of not delving into the characters' personal lives, thoughts or dreams, is an appropriate one in this case. I'm not a John Wayne fan at all, but okay, he's not seen here too much (nobody is) and he does a decent enough job. What I did object to was stunt casting of musicians Paul Anka and Fabian, even if they too had brief roles. They're not so good.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this film, but get it on DVD, do not watch it on AMC."

","Leonard Maltin says it is one of the last great war films. I say that it is, along with Sands of Iwo Jima. Some people say that films that are like this, with big name stars in cameo/extra-ish roles, have the wrong outlook because of that. I disagree, because with How the West was Won, which also casts big name stars in cameo/extra-ish roles, you are not supposed to worry about the stars- you are supposed to worry about THE FAMILY, what happens to them, whether they get killed or not, who they have as friends, who they should not have as friends, who they have as enemies, who they should not have as enemies, etc., or if its The Greatest Story Ever Told, which, again, casts big name stars in cameo/extra-ish roles, you, again, are not supposed to worry about the stars, but instead, you should worry about THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, (which truly is The Greatest Story Ever Told) and how George Stevens tries to make you understand that you should worry about how the story always can, always will, and always has effected our lives. Lastly, with The Longest Day, you are not supposed to worry about the actors, you are supposed to worry about the INVASION itself, and how IT is the star of the movie, and that the actors are really the co-stars, compared to the INVASION. Another reason you should not worry about the stars in The Longest Day is because, I think, that if you were, say, Sal Mineo's character, Pvt. Martini, you would remember it if you ran into John Wayne's character, Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, for two reasons: because it is John Wayne playing the part, and it is Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort on screen. But if you were John Wayne's character, Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, and you ran into Sal Mineo's character, Pvt. Martini, you might not remember it if you ran into Sal Mineo's character, Pvt. Martini, for two reasons: because it is Sal Mineo playing the part, and it is Pvt. Martini on screen. Another reason is that you would remember John Wayne, because he hurt his leg, and also because it is John Wayne- we know he can get through that. But if it's Sal Mineo, you might not remember him, because he gets killed because he mistook the bolt-action of the German's rifle for the cricket-clicker, and its Sal Mineo- he will probably die."
"dglink","9","1","4","15 April 2007"," One of the Last Films to Celebrate the Heroics of Battle
","Unlike subsequent films that depicted war as hell, Darryl Zanuck's spectacular epic ""The Longest Day"" emphasizes the courage, heroism, and raw guts required to wage battle. Admittedly made about the last non-controversial war in which the United States was involved, Zanuck's film downplays the brutal realism of more recent war movies and focuses on the broad vistas of thousands of soldiers storming the Normandy Beaches on June 6, 1944. Employing dozens of well-known actors in small parts, ""The Longest Day"" effectively utilizes the cameo approach to help viewers keep track of characters in the complex cutting between scenes that depict American, British, and German military personnel both on and off the battlefield. While a cast of unknowns would have enhanced the otherwise documentary-style approach, the audience would have been lost as to who was who. Among the large cast, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, no strangers to war film heroics, register strongest, although Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Edmund O'Brien, Jeffrey Hunter, and Richard Beymer are also memorable. The bevy of rock and roll stars that includes Fabian and Paul Anka will be unrecognizable to younger viewers and illustrates the dangers of casting those with fleeting fame in a movie intended to be seen over the decades. Only one actress, Irina Demick, appears among the otherwise entirely male cast. Her credibility, however, as a French resistance fighter is severely undercut by her carefully applied makeup and perfectly coiffed hair.<br/><br/>The stunning black and white cinematography creates bold and beautiful images of the battle, which was filmed on the beaches where it took place. One incredible uncut helicopter shot follows a platoon down the streets of a French town, around the harbor, and into an encounter with another platoon on the other side of the town. The logistics of setting up the shot must have been awesome in the days before CGI. Although three directors were used, evidently producer Zanuck was the guiding force, and the result is a seamless film with few blunders. Unfortunately, the screenplay at times relies on expository dialog to identify characters or to set up a scene, and occasionally an obvious attempt at ""meaning"" creeps into such lines as ""I wonder who won?"" The stirring march penned by Paul Anka may be too up-tempo and enthusiastic to underscore the depiction of a day when thousands died, but the music does emphasize the producer's intent to celebrate a great victory. However, the addition of insipid lyrics over the closing credits goes too far in trivializing a weighty subject. Nevertheless, ""The Longest Day"" remains a fine tribute to the men who fought on D-Day and does a credible job of remaining faithful to the facts without embellishing them with the kind of fanciful fiction that marred another filmed depiction of the battle."

"Air America","9","1","4","10 December 2006"," Lacking Support?
","From seeing this film and from historical accounts, it appears to have been solely a Navy-Army operation. I am not entirely sure of this but this is how it strikes me. Operations in the Pacific were also Navy-Army operations and Navy-Marine operations. I believe at D-Day, the Marines were already using close-air support before many Pacific landings. The Navy was also involved with the use of gunnery as was done at the Normandy landings. It is commented about in the film that Allied Command did not believe the Air Force could do much good because the guns were placed in a position that could best be attacked by the landing forces. However, I feel sure that reconnaissance must have shown much greater detail of the onshore battery emplacements and the locations of German troops. Of course it is easy to make comments with hindsight, but one has to wonder why the earlier, virtually unopposed missions flown by Air Corps pilots in softening up some of the rear areas; why this measure was not applied to the emplacements at the beachfront? Aircraft operating at that time in the European theater included many capable of close-air support as employed by Marine aircraft in the Pacific. I believe it is factual, that only two German aircraft flew one sortie over the beaches that day. Of course the Allies did not know about the placement of enemy aircraft on that given day, but the unopposed earlier missions by aircraft should have been reported and this factor given its proper consideration; seems to me that it dictates the use of the air arm in support of landing troops on the beach. Doubtless if given the amount of close-air support employed by Marine pilots, the number of men lost to hostile fire on the beaches could have been reduced as the enemy forces could have been greatly reduced by fire from aircraft. This action would also have diverted their intentions from defending against landing forces to seeking cover to avoid fire from aircraft. I am not sure when napalm was first employed by the Marines in the Pacific; it might have been later, but can you imagine the devastation that would have caused the enemy along the four beaches the Allied forces landed on? <br/><br/>I would appreciate any comments from more knowledgeable persons on some of the historical events I commented about; also any thought any have as to the validity of my assertions. As I said, hindsight is usually 20/20, but the isolation it seems, of these saving techniques remained principally in the Pacific as I know of no action on the European continent that employed this method of prosecuting war against the enemy. I have to wonder and write this in an effort to understand why it was not employed for the D-Day landings?"
"maddutchy","9","1","4","11 November 2006"," Great Movie, New DVD Release
","I saw this movie when it first came out (yes, I am THAT old!), bought it for $75 when it first came out on video tape and just purchased a DVD set at Wal-Mart marked as a ""Cinema Classics Collection"".<br/><br/>The movie itself is outstanding in most aspects. For younger people, please understand that when this movie was made, many of the participants in the actual event were still alive. Many contributed in some way to the movie and others would have commented strongly if they saw something wrong. That had to put tremendous pressure on the producers. The only complaint I ever had with it was technical in nature. Much of the equipment worn by the American soldiers is incorrect. It is not that it isn't WWII equipment (it is) but that it wasn't appropriate to what the soldier was doing or carrying as a weapon. I have also read that the action on the beach is spectacular but not quite correct as most of the movement off Omaha Beach early in the day was in small groups like depicted in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I forgive the movie both glitches as it was more important to put Ryan's book on the screen rather than sweat the small stuff.<br/><br/>One bit of trivia I learned years later by reading one of Ambrose's books had to do with Richard Todd who played Major Howard taking ""Pegasus Bridge"". If Todd looks believable in the role, it turns out that there is a very good reason for that. It seems Todd was a young officer in one of the British Parachute Battalions that dropped into Normandie in support of Howard's capture of the bridge.<br/><br/>Regarding the DVD release I just bought, I have to comment on the 'historical commentary' section. This is a feature that you can turn on and a ""historian"" comments as you watch the movie. I was highly disappointed in the comments. Instead of real history, all it contains is a lot of movie commentary and social statements. If you choose to listen to the ""Audio Commentary by Historian X X"" on this set, please read Ryan's book afterward or one of Ambrose's books to correct what you have listened to on the DVD. I normally wouldn't include such a negative section but it really angered me what they termed 'historical commentary'. If it had been labeled anything but 'historical' I would not have minded. That is why I am sometimes called ""History Nut""."
"wntuc","10","1","4","29 May 2006"," Pretty good to me!
","I think too many of us read so much into a movie or forget the audience and passions of the time. Yes this was an American propaganda movie--we need more of that today! There are only a few two hour-plus movies I can tolerate and this is one of them. And for those that feel there are too many stars in this film, that is the reason its easy and fun to follow for three hours. It reminds me in that way of Tombstone--each star brought his own personality to the party--thus making it fun to watch. I actually commend the producers /directors ability to bring all these guys together--and I'm sure the stars had fun doing it also.<br/><br/>It lacked the blood and gore of Saving Private Ryan but then again look at the original audience and era. Does a movie have to have gore and sex to be accepted today as good?<br/><br/>I cant say what is a favorite part but I uniquely enjoyed the look of jubilation on the French farmers face when the fleet began bombing the shore. Here comes the calvary---thats what America's all about!"

","This is one of the best war movies ever made. It has such a large international cast, along with excellent acting and realism. Germans speak German. This is one factor that I believe makes a more real war movie. Hearing Germans speak perfect English in WWII movies just irritates me to no end. Also look at some of the actors chosen for the film, you have John Wayne, Sean Connery, Robert Ryan, and Richard Burton, and many more great actors. For being made in '62, it has decent special effects, especially when they show the ships coming toward Normandy. The sound of the shelling and weapons is great, not at all cheesy. This is definitely a DVD I'm planning on getting."
"lebensraum-1","9","1","4","4 March 2006"," The best D-day film
","Some reviewers have commented on the comical aspects of the British segment. This is probably because they were directed by Ken Anakin who made many comedy films and maybe humour is a way of relieving the stress of combat. Ken Anakin went on to direct ""Those Macnificent Men In Their Flying Machines"" and ""Battle of the Bulge"" and it is interesting to notice that a lot of actors in ""The Longest Day"" went on to appear in those two films. Also Sean Connery's Irish accent was far better than the Edinburgh Irish dialect he used in ""The Untouchables"" !! The producers seemed to want to attract young cinema goers to the film by using teen idols like Paul Anka, Fabien and Tommy Sands, who would soon be swept away by the Beatles. Indeed one of the faults of war films in general is the use of middle aged actors to portray servicemen barely out of their teens. Richard Burton as an RAF flying officer is stretching things a bit. He may have been one for real in 1945, but by 1962 he was to old. But overall ""The Longest Day"" is the best D-day movie. ""Saving Private Ryan"" may have more realism, but it does not give the overall picture."
"ntvnyr30","9","1","4","15 November 2003"," Inspired Epic
","My original review was written in 2003. I feel I should expand it to at least 10 lines since the first one was so brief and especially since this is Veteran's Day.<br/><br/>I am a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces but I naturally I never encountered anything like the Normandy invasion on June 6, 1944. When I was growing up in the 70's, calendars still had little icons denoting D-Day, VE-Day, and VJ-Day. Apparently, that's too politically incorrect for today's youths, since they are too busy being indoctrinated in school. But I digress...<br/><br/>The scope and breath of this film is amazing. The fact that the film stays together after so much detail is amazing in itself. I read many of the user comments and tend to agree that a lot of the dialogue is stilted, especially in the American scenes. The best part of the film for me was the scenes involving the Germans. Their acting was years ahead of its time. I love the scenes where the German officers are afraid to wake Hitler to tell him about the invasion. The only French scene I can stomach is at the beginning when Irina Demick is on the bike trying to distract the Germans from the adjacent wagon of hay, in where her comrades were hidden. Holy crap she was hot!<br/><br/>I thought the best American performances were from Robert Mitchum, Richard Beymer and Henry Fonda, whose role was unfortunately too brief. The best British performance was from Richard Burton. His scene at the end is great.<br/><br/>Although nothing can match the Normandy landing in ""Saving Private Ryan"", I'd take this version of D-Day anyday. While people have commented about the armchair warhawks like John Wayne, I similarly find the inclusion of Matt Damon and other Hollywood lefties in SPR just as revolting."
"stp43","10","1","4","26 September 2003"," The Beginning Of The End Of The Thousand-Year Reich
","No one will tune into this, one of the greatest and most epic war films ever conceived, for plot surprises, given the fact that it details an event whose outcome is of course already known.  The point of the film is to detail what actually happened on the day that began the eventual downfall of the Thousand-Year Reich, and it does so with a rare combination of painstaking historical accuracy and Hollywood star power.<br/><br/>The historical documentary aspect of the film is best shown in the German scenes, given the general lack of familiarity of the German performers and their characters on the part of the audience.  Most will probably recognize Erwin Rommel and some may recognize Karl Gerd Von Runstedt, but it is doubtful most will know who Werner Pluskat or Josef ""Pips"" Priller or Gunther Blumentritt were (though James Bond fans will recognize Curt Jurgens, here playing Blumentritt).  Given this general lack of audience familiarity, the German scenes move along like a documentary.<br/><br/>It is in the American and some of the British scenes that the Hollywood star power of the film comes into play.  Darryl F. Zanuck assembled the most ambitious cast in memory and all the major stars get quality screen time, from John Wayne and Robert Mitchum on down.  Roddy McDowell is best known for the mild British accent he imbued to so many of his roles, so much so that it takes a few viewings to recognize him as an American grunt. Richard Burton has only two scenes in the film, but he makes the most of them and has the strongest dialogue, notably in his conversation with an 82nd Airborne paratrooper - ""He's dead, I'm crippled, you're lost, I supposed that's what war is"" is one of the best lines in any film ever.<br/><br/>Sean Connery would soon become famous as James Bond, and here he eats up the scenery with Norman Rossington as they land on the beaches, Connery chewing out the fact that an officer rallies the troops to remember Dunkirk even though he was not in the service at the time, and Rossington commenting on some of the absurdities involved in this battle - ""I tell you, there are some very peculiar blokes on this beach.""<br/><br/>The one scene I had a problem with is the assault on Pointe Du Hoc - the film notes that German guns that have been firing on the other beaches have been moved, and makes it out like the Army Rangers assaulted the hill for nothing; in actuality the Rangers tracked down the guns initially deployed at Pointe Du Hoc and destroyed them as they tried to besiege Allied Forces further inland.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes are the travails of the 82nd Airborne batallion led by John Wayne's Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort, and the squabbles between Luftwaffe commandant Wolfgang Hager and hotheaded ace Colonel Josef ""Pips"" Priller.  Hager and Priller haggle it out on the telephone constantly, leading Hager's XO to ask why Priller was never court-martialled. Meanwhile, Vandervoort leads the drive to St. Mere-Eglise, despite breaking his foot in the swamp area the Germans have flooded five miles away - when he and the batallion discover they're going in the wrong direction because a directional sign was turned around, Vandervoort growls, ""Does anyone in this outfit read a compass besides me?""<br/><br/>The 82nd also figures in the film's signature horror - the slaughter of a batallion, here including comedian Red Buttons, who is brilliant as the 82nd private who is concerned with speaking French but who can only watch helplessly as his pals land in the middle of the town and are wiped out by the waiting Germans, amid the din of church bells.<br/><br/>Without question this film ranks as among the very best war epics ever put to film.  Whether shown in its original B&W format or colorized (unlike many other colorized films this one loses nothing in the switch from B&W) it tells a chilling historical story to near-perfection."

","I own this movie and have always been impressed with the scenes of the British glider attack on the Orne Bridge, particularly with Richard Todd's role as Major John Howard.  Little did I know that Mr. Todd served in the regiment that made that attack on D-Day!  No wonder he played the part so convincingly. As for John Wayne, those who say that he was not a good actor should watch the scene where he enters Ste-Mère-Église and sees the dead paratroopers.  His faces alone says it all.

","Great cast, staging, and photography.  This is a no bs great war movie.  It doesn't have a corny love story (ie ""Midway"") or some other odd story (the intelligence officer in ""Battle of the Bulge"" who no one will listen to) to help it hang together. This is just a series of stories, that when put together, tell the story of the invasion of Normandy. The staging is amazing.  There is one shot of street fighting that is fantastic.  This opening shot must have been shot from a helicopter but it is very smooth, as smooth as a crane shot. This shot just goes on and on as the street battle begins. It follows a large number of men as they run up various streets, overcome opposition and finally get stopped by a heavily armed German position. This movie doesn't have the special effects or sound engineering of ""Private Ryan"" but it is a much better overall view of the battle."

","As far as I am concerned, this is the best war film ever made.  I never tire of it and watch it every June 6th. Filmed in a semi-documentary approach and in black and white, I always feel I am watching a documentary of the real D-Day invasion and not a motion picture. The film has more impressive action sequences than probably any other war film, before or since.  Some standouts include: The French Commando raid on the French village, Oestram, the disasterous 82nd. Airborne division drop on Ste. Mere Eglise, the 2 Luftwaffe planes strafing what seems like miles of beaches, the U.S. Ranger Division climbing Pointe Du Hoc, the British Glider attack on Pegasus bridge, etc. etc.  I'm sure that many will be confused by the scenes I have just described.  But if you've seen this film or know anything about D-Day, than you will know what I am talking about. Blessed with an impressive cast (many of whom are, unfortunately, not with us anymore,) including John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, etc. etc., this film was producer Darryl F. Zanuck's towering achievement. This film just lost the 1962 Best picture Oscar to Lawrence of Arabia.  As great as that film was, this is a better and more important film.  It is unreal that these two great epics should have gone against each other. One last thought, however.  Since Saving Private Ryan was released, The Longest Day has been criticized basically for not having the same type of carnage (realism) that Ryan had in its Omaha Beach segments.  However you simply could not do that type of thing in 1962. As great as Saving Private Ryan is, The Longest Day is a film that will live forever.  See it this D-Day."

","What a spectacle of man's ultimate and most dangerous endeavor.  Too many stars to mention.  This black and white pageant of war is an artful collage of the thousands of stories that are woven into the complex fabric of a great invasion.  The camera work is sometimes breathtaking.  The performances are surprisingly good.  Memorable scenes include paratroopers landing in the midst of a village involved in putting out an unrelated fire, and a running attack on a wharf area that has to be the best crane shot since Gone With the Wind!<br/><br/>The picture also holds up historically (except for more recent history being a bit kinder to Rommel), showing the German side and point of view as well as the Allies'.  This motion picture is a must see for war film buffs, and should be required viewing for school kids.

","I have watched this and several other D-Day movies and I like this one the best because it has great music and can be watched with my family. It also shows German, English and French perspectives which serve as a reminder that this was a World War not just an American one.<br/><br/>I often watch war movies with my kids to help them with their history lessons.  They find it much easier to learn from a movie than from a textbook.  This movie was very good for this because it keeps switching points of view and from the big picture to small individual actions. It is excellently acted and filmed but it has enough slow scenes that my kids can catch up by asking me questions.<br/><br/>For my generation it is hard to remember that World War II is really ancient history to today's kids. It is harder for the kids to understand that in this world of political correctness where they can't even say bad things about other people, that there used to be such evil as Hitler and the Nazis. This movie lets me tell them about the horror without them actually having to see it unlike more 'realistic' movies such as 'Saving Private Ryan'.<br/><br/>My favorite parts of the movie are the John Wayne scenes where he is at his gritty best.  Another movie that I like that is similar to this one is 'A Bridge Too Far'.  It has the same great acting and action while trying to give a historical flavor to the events."

","If all you're knowledge about D-Day comes from the excellent movie Saving Private Ryan, you should really check out The Longest Day to see the big picture.  The two movies aren't comparable.  SPR is a close quarters look at how the war effected the soldiers.  TLD takes a epic point of view that explores all sides of the invasion.  Just compare the way they depicted the landings on the beach.  Zanuck's version is a wide camera view of thousands of soldiers running up the beach.  Speilberg's focus's on one small stretch of one beach.  Anyway, this is the definitive movie of the D-Day invasion, as in the ENTIRE day.  SPR is currently the definitive WWII combat movie.<br/><br/>I can't help but warn people that you do need to go into this with the aim of learning about history. It really is a dated movie (hammy/wooden acting, sometimes unbearable low humour, total lack of gore), but this doesn't stop it from delivering a great deal of good info to the watcher."

It is brilliantly pieced together by three plus directors covering the German, French, English and British points of view. It has an all-star cast of anyone who was anything in 1962, the year it was made. Told in brilliant documentary style, it begins in occupied Europe focusing on the French Resistance and the Germans obtaining secret D-Day plans. Then we see the Allies in England planning, organizing and preparing for the Invasion, many already on board ships awaiting for the go-ahead. The weather plays a role in itchy anticipation. Everyone awaits the 'word' from Ike (Gen. Eisenhower). Soon the action begins with unbelievably memorable scenes i.e. the German seeing the entire Allied fleet out the window of his bunker; parachutists landing in the middle of the German occupied town of St. Mere Iglise; a patrol of Germans and Americans passing each other in the dark unaware of each other; a glider landing smack in front of a German foxhole and it goes on from there and never gets boring or bogged down. Filming in black and white paid off in spades. It does contain inaccuracies but they are mostly minor.

","'The Longest Day', also known as D-Day, is a film produced by Darryl F. Zanuck in 1962. It described a battle between the Axis and the Allies in the Second World War. <br/><br/>This movie is a vivid, hour-by-hour re-creation of the Normandy landing. Featuring actors were coming from Britain, American, France and Germany. This movie had won two Oscars, and ranked as one of Hollywood's truly great war films. <br/><br/>On June 6, 1944 the Allied Invasion of France had marked the beginning of the end of Nazi domination over Europe. The attack involved 3,000,000 men, 11,000 planes and 4,000 ships, which comprising the largest armada the world has ever seen. <br/><br/>The Second World War was started in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. The United States, Britain and France declared war after Germany's aggression. <br/><br/>During this battle both Axis and Allies lost many soldiers. However, when the Allies gained Normandy, the Axis directly lost France and Allies gained the confidence to win the War.<br/><br/>It is a very old film in black and white colour, and it was already a great film in the 1960's, even without modern technology. To me this is a very good movie because I can see clearly what D-Day's was like. It contained quite a lot of historical facts during the Second World War which. Moreover, the director successfully described through the actors the lives and feelings of people during the Second World War."

That morning when the men of the free world landed on the beaches of Normandy shall never be forgotten. One can only imagine what it was like for those men in the landing craft when the ramps came down and they went forward to begin the liberation of Europe. This movie comes close to the experience. Although quite graphic in it's portrayal of the carnage there is no time to shed a tear for each man as you see him fall because this movie is fast paced. Many died that day and some never left that beach. Thousands are buried on the bluffs above in carefully manicured lawns of the military cemeteries.

I get the video out every ANZAC day to remind me that the people they portrayed must have gone through hell to bring some normality back to the world. It was also good to see both sides of the story. John Wayne was one of my heroes and to see him in a military roll after seeing him in so many westerns took a bit of getting used to. Also Eddie Albert(Green Acres) was interesting in a military role.

","This is quite a poor movie on many fronts, although it does succeed in combining an impressive cast and some large battle scenes. The story is unfortunately populated by cartoon characters. Some of them are so hideous e.g. french farmer celebrating shelling of the beach right by his house, that I just hoped the writers would have had the mercy to kill them quickly. Unfortunately, they did not. The acting is wooden (yes, John Wayne is here), and the actors are given some howler lines to deliver. The battle scenes, although using an impressive number of extras and equipment, fail to deliver on the realism side; the cliff climbing scene is just plain silly. The beach landing is very similar to that in Saving Private Ryan, however the pace is slower, with a smaller body count. Overall, although no doubt an achievement for it's time this film has aged badly. It's story is definitely more interesting and relevant than that in SPR, however the screenplay and acting are poor. Watch it if you have nothing else to do for 3 hrs or want some laughs."
"zippo0114","Null","1","5","28 January 2000"," A D-Day Disappointment
","I was somewhat disapointed after seeing this war movie, but the reason behind that is probably because I saw Saving private Ryan before watching this. Saving Private Ryan leaves quite am impression on you, and other D-Day movies, including this one, have a hard time living up to Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>A main reason that this movie is so weak is because of it's unrealistic portrayal of D-Day. The film tries to show D-Day as a group of brave American and British men, at peace with God, and ready to fight and die for their country, no matter what the cost, these men were ready to go into battle. This is made obviously clear as John Wayne runs out of his invasion boat courageously at the German bunkers onto the beaches of Normandy, his men following bravely behind him, not once hesitating to find a large obstacle to hide behind. When in fact, the young men who fought at Normandy were scared beyond reality. The invasion boats were covered in puke because the men were so frightened that they were throwing up. Men lost their values, beliefs, and standards for human life in D-Day and the rest of the war. This film tries to portray it as exciting, to make everyone get up, join the Army, and go kill the Nazi's, or whatever enemy America may be fighting now.<br/><br/>Which brings up another point that this film is purely American propaganda, trying to support the Army. The reason that this film is so weak and unreal, is most likely due to the fact of the cencorship of the 60's time period. They weren't allowed to show the true brutality of war, and the fact is, they probably couldn't have captured it then anyway.<br/><br/>While I did enjoy the film because it is about D-Day and is a good movie, especially for it's time, it makes war look like fun, which simply isn't true. However, I reccommend you see this movie anyway, because it is still quite interesting."

The soldiers there had the sense to merely whistle ""Colonel Bogie's March,"" NOT prattle insipid lyrics glossing over unspeakable war-time agonies. Most of the spoken dialogue in THE LONGEST DAY sounds so contrived, pompous, and written 15 years after-the-fact that it seems probable that some of the dimmer bulbs in the cast--such as self-admitted potheads John Wayne and Robert Mitchum--were allowed to ad lib their own lines. With at least 60 speaking parts, most characters (including Henry Fonda's doomed American President's son) get lost in the shuffle, and virtually none merit a movie watcher's attention (no matter how Heroic their Real Life counterparts). If Hitler had had an opportunity to watch this three-hour snooze-fest, he would not have needed to take a sleeping pill in order to nod off! Producer Darryl F. Zanuck apparently was too dense to realize that having FIVE directors on your flick is nothing to crow about. If he wanted to be honest about something, he might have advertised that THE LONGEST DAY was mostly his effort to make his latest mistress--Irina Demich--a movie star, so that he could reap the perks that might come with her gratitude. THE LONGEST DAY is like giving SAVING PRIVATE RYAN a HOGAN'S HEROES makeover. This could well be one of the WORST World War Two pictures of all time!"

Many various characters to watch as they follow strategies and fight their way through the operations and battles, including in towns and villages, in Calais, in the air and on sea, on the Channel, on Omaha Beach and much more.

"virek213","10","0","2","12 November 2019"," Revisiting June 6, 1944
","There are just some dates in history that will live forever. July 20, 1969 was one of those days, when Man set foot on the Moon for the first time. November 22, 1963 was another such day, when America lost its innocence as the result of John F. Kennedy being murdered.<br/><br/>Another important date in world history would be June 6, 1944. On that day, with the world still writhing in pain from a horrible war, an invasion force of three million soldiers from the U.S., England, and Canada stormed the beaches of France's Normandy coastline to start the freeing of Europe from Adolf Hitler's Nazi tyranny, which by that time had killed well over fifteen million people overall (six million of those for the specific reason of them being Jewish). The operation was known as ""Operation Overlord""; and the date itself became known as D-Day. But for those millions who stormed those beaches, and the tens of thousands of them who were to lose their lives in this great cause, it was THE LONGEST DAY. And eighteen years later, in 1962, the combined talents of 20th Century Fox mogul Darryl Zanuck, writer Cornelius Ryan, and tons of others memorialized that day on the big screen in one of the greatest Hollywood epics ever made.<br/><br/>This nearly three-hour masterpiece doesn't just focus on the complexities of the D-Day landing itself; it also gives us a look at the men who had to fight it, and the Nazi commandants who were in charge of repelling the invasion (and who evidently slept at the switch, not thinking that such an invasion could ever be mounted). THE LONGEST DAY was the most expensive black-and-white movie ever made in Hollywood up to that point, at nearly $10 million; and in order to make this happen, Zanuck got practically every living actor in Hollywood, and some more from England, to participate. This meant that many of the actors were only on the screen for a short time; and it also meant that some were in roles that they arguably were a bit too old to be playing. Still, the presence of these actors and their star wattage made THE LONGEST DAY, among other things, The Biggest Deal. When you have a cast that includes John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, and Eddie Albert just for starters, then it definitely is a big deal.<br/><br/>Of course, it is tempting for people to compare this film's depiction of the D-Day landing to the way it was depicted in, but was the opening salvo to, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. But such comparisons, while inevitable, are not necessarily fair or accurate. What was shown in unflinchingly graphic detail by Steven Spielberg in his 1998 masterpiece could not be shown in pre-MPAA ratings Hollywood. One can't hold this against either Zanuck, or the three directors (Andrew Marton; Ken Annakin; Bernhard Wicki) who helped bring THE LONGEST DAY to the screen. In the end, THE LONGEST DAY still gives one a feel of the scope of the way the invasion took place, and some of the foibles that occurred on and prior to June 6, 1944. The fact is that D-Day, while an enormous success for the Allies in the end, wasn't perfect at its inception, which was certainly shown to be so in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and acknowledged here.<br/><br/>Still, the invasion was given its full measure of due here in THE LONGEST DAY; and that's why it remains indisputably one of the greatest films about the absolute last ""Good War"" in history."

-Flight Officer David Campbell<br/><br/>An epic war film if there ever was one. The film plays like a chess match as we see D-Day from the perspective of the Germans, English, Americans and French (both Army and resistance) with different directors doing their own segments. The biggest surprise is that at no time does the film feel like different directors were involved.<br/><br/>I thought the glorified cameos would be a bit much in the film, but it turns out it works a great deal in it's favor. You get an instant attachment to certain characters and care what happens with limited time devoted to them which is good, because despite it being three hours long, the film doesn't have time to waste on character development.<br/><br/>It works though. How do we make sure the audience notices Brig. Gen. Norman Cota when he's introduced in a five minute scene and then remember him when he shows up again 2 hours later? Put Robert Mitchum in the role. How do we make sure the audience is suddenly invested in what happens to Pvt. Flanagan when we see him for the first time storming the beaches of Normandy? Cast Sean Connery in the role. Ect and so forth.<br/><br/>The various moving parts coming together with amazing star power to back it up would be enough to make this a great movie, but it also has some jaw dropping amazing shots. Practical shots you do not see in films today without them being CGI'd to hell.<br/><br/>Also one of the most surprising elements of the film is that despite it being this grand epic, completely worthy of that moniker, the film makers decided to go with a small understated ending... which was PERFECT.

Though it shows both sides of the story from Allied and German POVs, it is biased towards the winning side. Characters are nicely developed. Cinematography is fantastic. Background music gels well with the emotions throbbing throughout the movie. I wish it was in colour. Nonetheless, a wonderful watch."

","""The Longest Day"" is one of the fastest three hours you will ever spend. The movie is so good that it goes by like a blink of the eye. That's because it might be a perfect movie. It's a beautiful looking movie. it has an amazing cast. It tells its complex story in very understandable and, more importantly, human way. ""The Longest Day"" is very exciting, very sad and often quite funny. Its movie making at its finest. It's a true classic."

","THE LONGEST DAY<br/><br/>The longest movie more like!<br/><br/>Now, to be honest I am not a huge war movie fan. There have been some great war movies... but in generally I find them all the same. Unfortunately, this one didn't really stand out for me. I was bored through some of it. It just felt like another old war movie. I know it did well when it first came out... it was nominated for 5 Oscars I believe.<br/><br/>The acting was good by everyone... there is a very impressive cast list for this movie. I loved the actors in this film and am happy to have seen them all in one movie. The film stars far too many people to list, but the big names are... Richard Burton, Sean Connery, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Roddy McDowall, Leslie Phillips, George Segal, Rod Steiger & Robert Wagner. Very impressive.<br/><br/>The actual fighting scenes were pretty good, but being a war movie, that was pretty much it. There were a few parts of the movie that I thought were great... I loved the idea of them dropping little fake soldiers out of planes just to distract the Germans so they could attack from behind. There were also other parts that I really liked.<br/><br/>The film is on for so long too... the movie goes on for 3 hours, and it definitely felt like it.<br/><br/>I will give this film 4 out of 10.<br/><br/>I do understand why this is a classic, but it is not for me i'm afraid. This film is made for war movie fans. <br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"kikkozanna","9","0","1","14 February 2011"," Aviation contents not really correct
","Great epic movie. However, aviation related aspects not really perfect as it would be possible in 1962. During the operation, the most utilized airplane for paratroopers and glider towing duties was the ubiquitous Douglas C-47 (available perhaps in great number in the sixties and still flying nowadays). No C-47 are visible in the movie (!). The planes in the movie are only Avro Lancasters (only models) that were not utilized for the Sealord operations except for bombing ops. The towing was performed by HP Halifaxes and Short Stirlings, plus said C-47 and Curtiss C-46 from USAAF. The Luftwaffe Priller's planes were actually Focke Wulf 190 while in the film they are badly represented by Messerchmitt 108 (in their post war french version by Nord Aviation), a light communication and trainer airplane and not really a fighter . Its resemblance to the illustrious Me 109 fighter could be the reason of the choice. Look at the Priller's airplane control column: too long , the fighter cloche works between pilot's legs. During the beaching ops there are American fighters flying low over the ships. They are Douglas Skyraiders , a plane that did not participate to the II WW but become a standard attack plane during Korea and the, Vietnam too. Quite right the Airspeed Horsa glider mock-ups and models bit with wrong English Insignia over the wings. No American gliders are visible, like the largely utilized Waco Hadrians in their classic olive drab camouflage and invasion black and white identification stripes. So, great movie but full of aviation mistakes."

","I saw this movie at the cinema when I was a kid, and on the big screen is seemed to just blow everyone away. We got to see the war from what at least looked like every angle, with a cast that included just about everybody who was anybody. It was long, sumptuous, involved and sometimes confusing. But it was also epic and definitive. Or so things seemed back then.<br/><br/>But I got the DVD cheap last week, not having seen it for a while, and gave it a watch. Now; I have to admit that I've joined the nay-sayers. I've awarded it 7 stars because it does still provide a decent run for your money, and one should take the movie's vintage into account. However; it no longer appears to be the epic I once thought.<br/><br/>Today, editing comes over as rather fragmented. A lot of little vignettes of ordinary servicemen don't really move the story along. I'm thinking of the guy who makes a fortune at dice and then believes his winnings might betoken bad luck. We know such things may happen, yet its detailed inclusion was irrelevant especially at the expense of true events. There's a guy telling a boring personal tale to someone he has never met, or there are the needlessly vociferous arguments with the Luftwaffe pilots, and so on. Pluskat's dog had the good sense to scram before the shooting started (in times of war follow your pet's instincts!). The big issues needed to be addressed before we spent time with all this minutiae. Yet the cut and cut again from one senior military figure to another presumed an almost encyclopedic knowledge on the part of the viewer. Often these people were seen just once or twice, and again it contributed to a fragmentary appearance.<br/><br/>It's obvious that a lot of money, thought and effort went into this movie's making, but watching it today, some production values have an almost made-for-TV appearance. That may be a measure of how production values as a whole have risen over the years. The thunder-flash grenades and fire-cracker ordnance explosions especially on the beach just don't measure up nowadays. 'Saving Private Ryan' has raised the bar too high. We also saw no sign of the 'funnies' - ingeniously adapted tanks - that were such a boon to the British assault, but which were scorned by the American high-command with dreadful consequences. The amazing 'Mulberry Docks' also deserved at least a look-in, even though they didn't actually arrive in France on the first day. They were an essential part of the preparation. Some mention was also deserving of the elaborate effort to conceal the military build-up. All of this was part of the British effort, and shamefully omitted. <br/><br/>I think a remake, employing far greater use of special effects with good-quality CGI, and a much more coherent (and honest) overview is called for. The first half at least should be dedicated to the tremendous preparations - rather like 'The Dam Busters'. Though whether or not such a stellar cast could ever again be assembled to play the leads seems highly unlikely. Worse still, an update will be made by a Hollywood that is even more Anglophobic than that of the 1960's and would probably be shown from an exclusively American stand-point. It could even include a scene in which Yanks present us with the 'Enigma' machine which they captured for us in 'U571'. Ahem.<br/><br/>I still regard 'Dunkirk' as the superior movie. And not because that was an all-British (or perhaps Anglo-French) success/debacle."

","Surprisingly, this is a remarkable film. At the begining of it there are<br/><br/>some really dull editing, some efects that just look old and preachy <br/><br/>patriotic and moral discourses. But as the film starts to move into<br/><br/>Normandy, it starts to develop as an inspired epic with tons of<br/><br/>remarkable film making. Some of the happenings decipted here, by their<br/><br/>nature, seem to be real stories of veterans. I hate John Wayne, but even<br/><br/>in this film he fits rigth. The stealer of the show is Richard Burton,<br/><br/>with a great closing dialogue.<br/><br/>Not to be taken as an history lesson (no movie, specially from<br/><br/>Hollywood, should be taken as a such), but instead a great little<br/><br/>ilustration of the incredible and most bloody invasion of modern times."
"Jester2000154113","Null","0","2","19 June 2002"," An interesting study of the High Command of WW2 (mild spoilers)
","While the Longest Day doesn't give you much of an idea of how terrible war is (only one significant character dies, and there's no blood), and is hindered somewhat by John Wayne (who doesn't really belong in a movie like this), it is an interesting study of the High Command on both sides.  I also like the way that it depicted the German commanders as intelligent human beings rather than idiotic, power-mad war mongers who somehow managed to conquer Europe, as war movies are wont to do.  I wish the character of Erwin Rommel had been more significant, because it would have added depth, seeing as how Rommel really wasn't that bad of a guy.  I also liked the scene where an American killed a German trying to surrender, because unlike most war movies it acknowledged that bad things happen on both sides.  A good depiction of the planning and command decisions made on and immediately before D-Day, and how it all went wrong for the Germans."
"Jaime N. Christley","Null","0","5","15 February 1999"," above average old-school WWII epic
","For all the star power money could buy, you get a good value if you see ""The Longest Day"".  As far as old-fashioned Hollywood epics go, it's not bad--<br/><br/>One thing, though, the Omaha Beach landing scene aged about sixty years the very day ""Saving Private Ryan"" was released.  Guess that's the price of progress."

","What does Titanic, Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbour have in common and why, you may ask yourself, what do they have to do with a review for The Longest Day.<br/><br/>Well bare with me and all will be revealed. They answer to the above question is they are all good films that could have been great films, if they had stuck to an age old formula, which is 'if there is a great tale already, then do not invent a sub story', for example Titanic, great effects, great acting, bad love story. A Night to Remember, fantastic acting, but out of date effects and a little out of date on facts but told the tale quite true to the facts as they where known then. Mix both films together (removing the fictitious love story) and what do you get. A film that would be a classic.<br/><br/>And the same could be said for The Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan (or Pearl Harbour) The Longest Day is in my opinion is one the greatest war stories ever put to film.<br/><br/>It builds the story up well and tells the tale from the Allies (yes the Allies, sorry to tell you this America, but you did not win World War II on your own) and the German's point of view. It has an almost endless list of star's (albeit some in cameo's) and is well directed.<br/><br/>If you have never seen this film or have not seen it for a while and you have a spare couple of hours, would like to be entertained, but also educated at the same time then this is the film for you. Ideal for a winter Sunday afternoon, just after the roast beef and yorkshire pud. Then watch Saving Private Ryan straight afterwards and just think what it would be like if Mr Spielberg had mixed the two together.<br/><br/>I think we would have had a modern epic on our hands 10/10"
"H Lime-2","Null","0","2","9 August 1999"," Great Movie But Dated
","Everyone else seems to think that this is the best war movie ever made (or close to it), including several friends whose opinion I value.  However, although I agree that it is one of the best war films of its time, I feel that it has not aged well and is now dated & not as interesting as more recent efforts.<br/><br/>My biggest problem is the depiction of the Germans vs. the Allied characters.  The Allies tend to be shown in a silly or comical way--snapping their little plastic noise makers, cracking jokes, & engaging in other low comedy (i.e. Sean Connery).  Meanwhile, the Germans are all depicted as deadly serious, realistic characters.  One gets the feeling that the tension in the film comes from whether these bumbling comedians can overcome the serious, goal-driven Germans.  While the film is faithful to Ryan's book, the choices of what to show and how to show it are not well made.  This may not have been that big a problem in 1962, but in 1999 it is a significant one.<br/><br/>A further problem is with the idea of the ""all-star"" cast.  The stars tend to overcome the characters they're supposed to be playing.  Again, other than the German characters who are given more depth, there is a tendency to toss big names at the audience and the significance of the character they're playing is minimized.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this is a bad movie (no movie with Robert Ryan in it can be said to be truly bad).  What I am saying is that it has lost some of its sheen over the years.  I have to admit to preferring ""A Bridge Too Far"" when it comes to ""all-star war movies"".  For all the flaws in that film, it puts its actors firmly into character and doesn't fall for simplistic sentimentality.  And the low humor is kept to a minimum."
