","I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?<br/><br/>And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney ""adventure"" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?<br/><br/>And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...<br/><br/>I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen ""Pirates"" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, ""Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?""<br/><br/>And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?<br/><br/>I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?<br/><br/>I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.<br/><br/>Except for this year.<br/><br/>Go Jack.<br/><br/>And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected ""money shots"" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, ""You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!"" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.<br/><br/>And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking ""overproduced by"" credit on the cover-liner. ""Bombastic."" ""Overdone."" ""Absurdly Stupendous.""<br/><br/>Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.<br/><br/>Once again, the children were wondering, ""What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?""<br/><br/>Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, ""Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho"" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.<br/><br/>At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.<br/><br/>This is not just another ""entry"" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of ""The Wizard of Oz."" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me."
"MR_Heraclius","10","54","58","23 February 2020"," Johnny Depp is fantastic!
","Awesome action and swashbuckling adventure, great music from the likes of Hans Zimmer, good visuals and Johnny Depp's hilarious improvisational performance as Captain Jack Sparrow (the other performances are good as well but Depp's the highlight and you damn well know it) make the first Pirates of the Caribbean adventure a fun action flick that's not only a great first non-Touchstone/Hollywood Pictures/pre-2006 Miramax & Dimension PG-13 Disney movie but also a much better movie than a movie based off of a THEME PARK RIDE has the right to be."
"Brad2002","8","227","282","4 September 2004"," Surprisingly Good
","Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.<br/><br/>There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.<br/><br/>I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10"

","You will always remember this as the movie that made Johnny Depp a superstar and almost got him an Oscar.The fact that he didn't win isn't a problem,since thanks to him this is the best pirate film ever made.<br/><br/>The opening concept is a clich√®:a beautiful woman(Keira Knightley)is kidnapped by a bunch of filthy pirates(led by Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa)and the man(Orlando Bloom)who's desperately in love with her decides to track them down.From now on,things get unexpected,as he asks another pirate for help.And it's no ordinary pirate:it's Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp),a lying,cheating,but charismatic scumbag,the hardest man on Earth to predict,not to mention quite unlucky and clumsy(""You are,with no doubt,the worst pirate I've ever heard of"" ""But you HAVE heard of me!"").<br/><br/>It's got all the elements of a classic pirate movie,elements that would give this flick a 9/10.<br/><br/>So,why am I giving it a 10/10? The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From the moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10 Entrances of all time,we know he's the reason people will keep watching the movie.He 's Depp's best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can't wait 'til he returns.<br/><br/>See you next summer,Captain!"

","A damn good movie. One of the best of 2003 in my view.<br/><br/>This movie made me laugh, and it really pulled me in.<br/><br/>At first I was afraid this would be another bad Pirate movie. I went to see it anyway, as I've always loved the legends of pirates, and I love adventure. I saw it once. Then twice. Then Quadrupul. Then six times. And one more 7. And now I eagerly wait for the DVD in Australia.<br/><br/>What i'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.<br/><br/>The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.<br/><br/>The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the british fleet.<br/><br/>A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book."

","As a lovely wild, filthy long haired bearded white British Barbarian who also happens to be a British Imperialist, this film was truly amazing and makes me SO proud to be British culturally and genetically. My only flaw of this film is that I wish it showed our sexy island during the film, but the Caribbean for a faraway foreign land was surprisingly quite pleasant in terms of looks, it did make me sweat just by looking at it though and I'd never go there for fear of burning my lovely white skin under the scorching Caribbean sun. So overall the setting wasn't brilliant but it was ok. Moving on, the acting was brilliant as were the characters, they were all so complex and therefore gave me a lot of food for thought. All the characters accents were also very nice and pleasing to the ear.<br/><br/>I'm a huge lover of violence and gore and this film had enough to please me. My favourite scene was when Barbossa's crew sacked Tortuga, seeing those lovely Britons so angry, strong and fierce made me immensely proud of their strength and courage, I knew during the scene nothing was going to stop Barbossa's courageous crew from pillaging Tortuga, not even several 20ft hostile giants. The violence in the movie truly gets my love balls stirring a lot every time I see it due to the beautiful violence. This film also made me incredibly nostalgic and reminded me of better times for my beautiful country, it just goes to show our government is still not afraid to showcase great British Imperial attitudes on films and as a magical Briton who lives and hunts in the beautiful forests of Britain, I really appreciated the amount of magic in this film which made the film so much more realistic, complex and closer to my lovely culture."

","Disney seemed to be going down the tubes lately, with Atlantis and Home on the Range, but this movie is a masterpiece. If it wasn't for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn't be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don't buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10"

","When the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), is proposed by Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), she faints, fells into the sea and is rescued and saved by the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but he is arrested and sentenced to death for piracy. Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew.<br/><br/>The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb. This film has action, humor, romance, mystery, special effects and is so delightful that the viewer does not feel the running time of 143 minutes. I saw this movie for the first time on 24 April 2004, and I have just watched again today (10 Feb 2007) enjoying the same way as in the first time. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Piratas do Caribe ¬ñ A Maldi√ß√£o do P√©rola Negra"" (""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"")"
"Igenlode Wordsmith","8","110","154","23 November 2003"," Finally, a real swashbuckling film to make me laugh
","""Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male,"" a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.<br/><br/>With hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!)<br/><br/>The moonlight special effects were overdone, in my opinion - not that they aren't believable, but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly, for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However, that's a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, *not* computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars :-)<br/><br/>The other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren't a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily-sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character...<br/><br/>The basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough, with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century (though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated - she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man, she doesn't have to strive to be his physical equal as well...) However, it is the pirates themselves who really make the film, simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains (from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect) who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review: ""we have been waiting [50 years] for a modern pirate film featuring someone who, in all seriousness, actually says the words, or perhaps the two-syllable single word: 'Ah-harrrrr!'""<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow, as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue (of course, totally honest in his own way... ahem) is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend - outrageous and unpredictable (there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as ""the worst pirate I've ever seen"", as in ""the worst at it"", only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful).<br/><br/>This character saves the hero in more ways than one - without him, the film would be another ""Mask of Zorro"", a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modern-day sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier sword-fighting (swashbuckling is not *about* fighting! It comes into it, yes, but it's not the point.) But together, the pair work off one another beautifully - reliability and inspired lunacy, self-doubt and cocky flamboyance, dogged devotion and shameless self-interest. The only question is which, precisely, is the sidekick...<br/><br/>There are two beginnings to this film, neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costume-drama-by-numbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move (it could scarcely be less subtle) is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape, when he seizes the rope and swings up, up, and out, in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat, and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie, when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.<br/><br/>The film is far from perfect - characters like Captain Norrington (*please* - 'Commodore', like 'Prime Minister', is a job description, not a form of address!) and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes, with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in - ""it's okay"", ""I was rooting for you"" - most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language, and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film (was it my imagination, or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache?), but, alas, any resemblance ends there.<br/><br/>But then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp, not Bloom, who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination - and, since I'm extremely impressionable, also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say *that*..! √ø"
"labrat-8","Null","79","111","2 March 2004"," Lots of fun, perfect popcorn entertainment
","This is a movie to sit back and enjoy. Funny, fast-paced and with sterling performances from all of the cast, it's not to be missed for good, old-fashioned entertainment. I'm not a huge fan of Depp, but here he excels. Knightly and Bloom make an engaging couple and I enjoyed the fact that the characters of Governor Swann and Norrington were taken in a different direction from that which might be expected by Hollywood. The former could have easily become the stereotypical ""You'll marry who I say you'll marry, girl!"", while Norrington could have been the standard English navy bully and nasty piece of work. Instead, both were engaging good guys and Norrington's graceful dealings with Will and Elizabeth brought a core of humanity to the movie.<br/><br/>
And to the previous reviewer who thought they'd spotted a plot hole:<br/><br/>S<br/><br/>P<br/><br/>O<br/><br/>I<br/><br/>L<br/><br/>E<br/><br/>R<br/><br/>while there`s a serious plot hole at the end where it`s revealed that Jack Sparrow has been suffering from the curse all along so how did he manage to stay out of the moonlight without anyone noticing his skeletal state ? And how did he manage to get drunk on rum ?<br/><br/>Actually, you just weren't watching the movie properly. Jack wasn't in a skeletal state all along. Shortly before the swordfight in the caves with Barbossa and being shown to be skeletal, Jack stole one of the cursed coins from the chest. When he was stabbed by Barbossa, he became skeletal because he was cursed from that moment on. This was made clear at the time when Jack's response to finding out he was suddenly skeletal was to declare, ""That's interesting!"", flip the stolen coin between his fingers and tell Barbossa, ""I couldn't resist."" Indicating that he was aware that it was his stealing the coin that had turned him skeletal once he was stabbed."
"random_raven","Null","137","209","9 August 2003"," Brilliant!!
","This is a fantastic movie full action, adventure, humor and a hell of a lot more! The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but that time flies by as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and sword fights.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.<br/><br/>The film may not be the most historically accurate pirate film of all times but all that is forgotten as you enjoy the brilliance of this marvelous movie. Did I also catch a subtle omage to the 1953 swashbuckler 'The Crimson Pirate' when Will and Jack walk underwater in an upturned rowing boat? Sneaky!<br/><br/>The only negative thing I have to say, and believe me I don't want to say it, is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the black pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son. Despite this plot flaw however, Pirates of the Caribbean is a magical journey that will drop the jaws of parents, children and grandparents alike. I'm definitely buying it when it come out on DVD!"
"allisonmckinley","Null","122","196","21 March 2004"," Johnny Depp puts a little swish in swashbuckle...
","Despite being rife with technical blunders such as the longest full moon in history, Disney's first non-PG film is proving to be a financial boon while at the same time collecting reviews from critics that run from tepid to red hot. I am in complete agreement with Roger Ebert on one point: Somewhere in this 143 minute tour de force there lurks a very good ninety-minute film.<br/><br/>Other than Johnny Depp, who fashioned his character's personality (and eye makeup?) after observations of his good friend Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the cast of 'Pirates' reads like a Who's Who of English film actors, including Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport and Mackenzie Crook.<br/><br/>When screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio originally pitched the movie to the Disney executives in the early '90s, Disney rejected it. It makes one wonder just who is running the Disney empire. Universal Studios have been combining action/adventure movies with theme park rides for over two decades (E.T., Jurassic Park, Jaws, and Back to the Future to name a few) only in reverse order-first the film, then the ride. This combination has worked well for Universal, and it seems almost absurd that Disney has taken so long to pick up on the obvious.<br/><br/>I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt's performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner's in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, 'Pirates' is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy 'Pirates'.<br/><br/>That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom's performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.<br/><br/>Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you're a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that's about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.<br/><br/>A few predictions may be in order, however. Look for an Oscar nomination for Depp's efforts. Look for nominations as well for sound, set design, makeup, and cinematography. As far as best picture? Next to Lord of the Rings (Return of the King)? Not likely.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski, who used to play in a punk rock band and is best known for creating the Budweiser frogs, does an outstanding job keeping track of the myriad details required of a director, given his limited experience. True, 'Pirates' has countless errors in continuity, but those occur in any film of such scope. Mr. Verbinski has only four other films to his name: a short entitled The Ritual (1996), and then three very different but effectively made films, Mouse Hunt (1997), The Mexican (2001), and the very creepy thriller The Ring (2002). Again, it makes one wonder just who is at the helm of the USS Disney to put a $125 million movie in the hands of a neophyte. Well, it worked with Lord of the Rings and a very inexperienced Peter Jackson, and it worked here for Disney as well.<br/><br/>'Pirates of the Caribbean' is a fun movie for most of the family. It may be rather scary for children ten and under and somewhat boring for many over twenty-five. I enjoyed it immensely for exactly what it was... an amusing ride."

","What lifts this film above typical Disney fluff is Johnny Depp's humorous performance as pirate Jack Sparrow, the eccentric, individualistic anti-hero, who confronts other pirates, and outwits a humorless, incompetent bureaucratic establishment. Sparrow looks more like Cher than Johnny Depp, and talks more like William F. Buckley than a pirate. Geoffrey Rush is a worthy foil as the main rival pirate, Barbossa, a character who vaguely resembles Margaret Hamilton in ""The Wizard Of Oz"".<br/><br/>Most of the plot is silly. There's lots of fighting, shouting, and general mayhem, all accompanied by a frantic score. It's a cinematic slight of hand that conveys an illusion of substance. Still, it's an entertaining popcorn flick. <br/><br/>I'm glad I watched it. Depp's deft performance gives us a memorable character, one that is perhaps unique in cinema history."

Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well.

In principle, it's worth it, this film can already be called a legend, and it's a pleasure to watch such films.<br/><br/>And now also compare with the sequel, but in fact someone seriously believes that the sequel came out better than the first episode. I, of course, do not agree with this, but I will not argue, everyone has an opinion, and there will be euphoria from viewing (views) of the ""Deadlock Chest"" and people will soberly look at the ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" and realize that the second part is not even nearby worth, but it is also a product of the highest class.<br/><br/>The first film is better, maybe not all, but in humor and the plot exactly, and even such a banal sign as novelty, in the second part we saw only a sequel, a slightly different story with the same characters, and in the first film, it was all new , and moments are brilliant. When I speak genius with regard to this film, then, of course, I have the look of Jack Sparrow in the incredible performance of Johnny Depp.
This is one of his best roles, from the very beginning he was performed in a genuinely brilliant way, from the first appearance on the screen to the eighth when he sailed on a small boat, flowing through all the cracks, to excellent music - completely capturing the episode, one of the best in all movie. And his first step to Port Royal, an English colony in the Caribbean. And after it began ...<br/><br/>The whole genius of Jack Sparrow's image can not be conveyed in words, that's why we watch this film and review it time after time, and expect the continuation. Especially the second part is the benefit of Jack, and in the first and except for Jack there was a lot of interesting things.<br/><br/>About humor, plot, music, I already said. And also this is the Captain of the ""Black Pearl"" Barbossa, some minor characters among the Barbosa pirates and among Jack's team. In addition, you can add to the appearance of Jack in the city of Torturra, a meeting with old friends and friends. Or repeated scenes, when Barbossa and Sparrow are in one frame. All these and other episodes can only be admired, for, they do not bother and remain in the memory.
The plot of the first part is much more interesting than the plot of continuation, besides the ship full of skeletons under the moonlight, where it surpasses the ship from the team in the form of sea monsters-yudisch. Special effects are here and there at a level, at a high level.<br/><br/>Pirate films now go to the screens of the world a little, and no one can surpass the Pirates of the Caribbean Sea, here in fact there is even a romantic story between Elizabeth and William, the only problem for them is that it moves back to the second or third plan , thanks to the excellent performance of pirates of their roles.<br/><br/>Young Bloom and Knightley could not support the level of their older colleagues, I would say that it's forgivable for them, if they were not so important to the director and producers, and in the eyes of ordinary fans of this film, they are not visible, they swam far beyond the horizon, only, unfortunately, sometimes appear on the screen saying important phrases, for me these characters are superfluous.
About Bloom, you can talk separately, his goal is to play a simpleton, spinning around the main character, sometimes trying to throw out an incredible and very daring trick, in the first part he still copes with the role of a simpleton, but when he tries to play the guy, everything fails, he does not go, and should run all career in a skirt of Paris. And in the second part of it they are already trying to make a serious man, give a chance to steer at the head of the film, but time to think, because Jack can not block him, and he does not want to be funny, but could try, maybe an idiot with the protagonist - his role ?<br/><br/>The screen time for the Knightley-Bloom duo is very little allocated, I mean when they are together, and for this it is necessary to say a special thanks to the creators of the film, this does not allow to turn the film into a love story of two childhood friends, but, damn it, from time to time they turn out to be in one frame, and these frames can easily be called not the most interesting for the whole film, in the sense of an acting game, because these young actors do not show anything super-ordinary.
Ditch the ocean, shoot cannons (even with forks), rob ships and ports here is the destiny of pirates, and after they also appear on the screen under the magnificent setting of Verbinsky - that's the real movie. The spark from the sensations is getting stronger, the film practically does not allow him to tear himself away for two and a half hours of viewing, except for the episodes of Knightley-Bloom, but this does not prevent the movie from watching when Jack Sparrow appears from the second to the second.<br/><br/>The film really deserves only flattering reviews. The ending of the film, although romantic, but much better than in the second part, when I did not see the ending, it was simply not invented - it's the main and very big minus of the second part, but now the conversation is not about it, because the first part ended very much in rating , I do not mean the MPAA rating, but the main thing is that it's a cobblestone in the sequel garden.<br/><br/>This movie you will remember as the best one in which Captain Jack Sparrow was almost hanged."

"Little_Dream_Goddess","Null","8","12","14 September 2005"," Freedom
","When I first saw the film, I thought it was awesome- the graphics were great and no doubt, Jack Sparrow (Depp) and Will Turner (Bloom) were hot in their own ways. I was surprised that Disney would have scary skeletons in a movie, but it was a very good film indeed.<br/><br/>This movie starts off with a song about pirates, which, I think, is genius. Not subtle, not direct, just genius. The whole plot revolves around rescuing... and rescuing... and rescuing, again.<br/><br/>The second time I saw this film, I thought it was disgusting. What the heck, I thought to myself. It's so... so... unrealistic (which is really unlike me, because I adore fantasy- just not too far-fetched in the fantasy world, like Mary-sue or people popping out of no where to help others). Until I saw it for the third time. I loved it then. (And yes, to watch a film for 3 times and have 3 different opinions each time makes the following statement true- 'there is obviously something wrong with me.') The thing that made me love this movie SOOOO very much was- 'Freedom'. As Sparrow had said, being a pirate is like having freedom. I had a knot in my stomach when I heard this- I mean, oh my god, I hated being trapped in a boring routine everyday. Being a pirate meant adventures, risks, excitement. And that really attached me to the movie. Whenever I read books or watch TV shows or movies about high adventures or fantasy, I almost cry because I'm not the main character- it's not me who's having all the fun, and reading these books or shows or movies might be the closest thing I will ever be to having the adventure of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. It will give you a knot in the stomach if you will just pay close attention and hope to feel like you are one in it."
"kdix-2","10","9","14","2 August 2004"," Pirates is one of the best movies and Johnny Depp is amazing
","Having always been interested in pirates, curses, and adventures (when it comes to movie entertainment) this movie appealed to me the first time I saw a preview for it. I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and I still can't get over how amazingly well Johnny Depp fits the part of Captain Sparrow. His gestures, facial expressions, and his script make this movie not far from a masterpiece. Honestly it took me 2 or 3 times to completely understand the plot and all the dimensions of the curse. However, watching all the extra scenes and info on the DVD made me realize how much fun the director had making the movie (when was the last time you saw a pirate movie that cool??) Again, I greatly applaud Johnny Depp's performance and I can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2!"
"lucky_star_1","10","6","9","29 May 2006"," Depp made this movie, with a little help from his friends
","Johnny Depp is truly an acting legend of recent years. This film is proof of it. He is always very considerate of what roles he takes on and is usually a totally different character in each of them.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow is no exception. He is absolutely hilarious, as is his accent which does ring true; plus his friendship with Orlando Bloom's character Will Turner also rings true. There is chemistry between Depp and whomever he shares dialogue with because he is central to the whole movie - thankfully. Depp is my all-time favourite actor, I think he is so much more talented than he gives himself credit for. Bloom and Keira Knightley form the romance, which expected in all modern movies so I can't complain because the acting is great all round. Another talented actor who proves himself in this movie is Geoffrey Rush. Like Depp he brings charisma and comedy to the role, as well as threat. Barbosa is a character you love to hate (because of how he treats Sparrow as you will see for yourself and what we learn from their history).<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow's drunkenness will have you splitting your sides with laughter, believe me. If not then you can't possibly be viewing the same movie. 'Yo ho a pirate's life for me' was sang by Depp and Knightley who are rightfully paired by a campfire in one scene. There is a spark but the romance is firmly between Will and Elizabeth (Knightley). A great movie I would definitely recommend for anyone over the age of 12 who loves a good action movie mixed with comedy, romance and the talent of Johnny Depp! I give it full marks"
"Li-1","Null","19","40","15 August 2003"," Depp and Knightley are fun to watch, but it's not the rousing adventure I was expecting.
","Rating: ** out of ****<br/><br/>I saw the movie in the hoopla of all the hype, when most people I knew were proclaiming this one of the summer's best films. Not unexpectedly, I walked into this one with high expectations, hoping for perhaps another Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or even The Mummy. Walking out of the theater a very long two-and-a-half hours later (actually, more like 2 hours 50 minutes, given the previews and the final scene after the credits) (this movie has way too many double crosses and false climaxes), I'm not even sure if this is better than The Mummy Returns.<br/><br/>Based off an amusement park theme ride, a lack of solid plot isn't a surprise. Orlando Bloom stars as Will Turner, a dashing blacksmith who's in madly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, a Natalie Portman look-a-like, except she's much prettier and appears to be a better actress). But when she's kidnapped by a group of ghostly pirates (led by Geoffrey Rush), Turner enlists the help of pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who appears a few cards short of a complete deck. Dark secrets are unearthed and it is revealed the undead pirates need to make a blood sacrifice to become human again.<br/><br/>It's not that Pirates' premise doesn't hold any potential, the movie does, after all, give us the prospect of an oceanbound adventure, the kind of movies you don't see too often. But Indiana Jones on water, this is not, for it lacks all of that trilogy's infectious sense of fun and thrilling ventures into the unknown (not to mention the smart dialogue and rousing John Williams' score). If not for Johnny Depp's performance and Keira Knightley's beauty and strong screen presence, Pirates might very well have lulled me into sleep.<br/><br/>The movie's biggest problem is its generic action sequences. Most of the swordfights are routine, directed without much flair or energy, and their bloodless presentation is just too juvenile-oriented for me. In fact, they all start to look the same after a while, so a little variety would have been appreciated. The film's one semi-creative fight, between Turner and Sparrow, is ineffective since you realize neither are in danger, and the climactic battle, pitting dozens of the undead pirates against the living, doesn't work since the fighting is done by characters I didn't give a damn about.<br/><br/>I like the actual concept of fighting undead pirates, but most of the villains are so goofy (especially the one keeps that fake eye), it's hard to see them as an actual menace. And when they are played for laughs, they're not very funny, either (how many times can we see an eye pop out before it stops being funny?). Also, making them former mates of Sparrow's sort of demystifies them (as if their goofy behavior didn't do so already).<br/><br/>As a pure adventure, Pirates is fraught with a lot of problems. It's repetitive, the characters keep going back and forth between the same islands and boats, sneaking in and out. The most successful adventures usually get the characters going from A to B to C, rather than A to C, then B, and then back to C, then B, and then back to C (and in this case, even back to A!). I got sick of seeing that island cavern over and over in ten minutes.<br/><br/>But Pirates is not without merit. Its singular savior is Johnny Depp, whose introductory scene is so hilarious, I was afraid I'd choke on my laughter. Sure, some of his scenes don't work so well (like when he tries to get those two guards to distract themselves), but he's more often a blast to watch than not, and most of the scenes he's in are pretty enjoyable. I also liked Keira Knightley (almost easily the movie's best piece of eye candy when you compare her good looks with some of the goofy visual effects), who displays genuine fire and feistiness even when she's mostly played as a damsel in distress. Both performers make the best of their parts, elevating the material quite significantly (if Depp and Knightley weren't present, the movie would have gone from middling to bad in a heartbeat).<br/><br/>Klaus Badelt's score sounds almost exactly like Hans Zimmer's work in The Rock given a period flavor. It's distracting, I spent too much time wondering in what ways Badelt would rip-off scores from Jerry Bruckheimer films. But at least it gave me an excuse to pay attention to something in-between th e scenes featuring Depp and Knightley."

","I must say when I first watched this movie, I loved it, I loved the plot, music, characters, and the actors. The actors are so good in this movie that I surprised that they were even acting, and pretending to be like the people in the movie. Johnny Depp really did his best in this one, and I was not even the smallest surprised that he did an amazing job in this movie. Seriously, if they picked anyone else for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, then I would not like this movie, and no one else would like it. Everyone I know believes so, and no one yet has stepped up and said something about changing the actor for Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>The writers did an amazing job with the script, but obviously Johnny Depp did a little improv while acting this role. Very good improv at that. All the other actors where good too, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, and Geoffory Rush, which happened to also be one of my favorite characters in the movie also. Oh yes, the role of Barbossa really knocked me in the head. His acting was almost as good as Johnny Depp's. The way he looked and talked just freaked the hell out of me and I just wanted to scream my lungs out.<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie also got me too, the way the Skeletons look when the moon rises really got me. The special effects people did an amazing job at that, as well as the Make-Up people. Putting Make-Up on Johnny must of been tiring for both him and the people, as his role had a lot to do with that. I for one would not like it at all, I can't even handle 2 days of it.<br/><br/>10/10, most people would agree that this movie is very stunning, and well done. The actors play their roles as if they themselves are that person, and all the other people who made this film possible, I bow down to your success pf getting into half of the worlds hearts."

J.R.R.Tolkien had a saying - ""not all who wander are lost"".<br/><br/>And another truly great thing about this movie - it is not in the least pretentious or heavy handed nor does it wallow in personal issues like so many self-important films today.<br/><br/>'Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl' is just one very cool, well made and fun movie!! <br/><br/>p.s. <br/><br/>if you liked this Pirate flick - another kind of 'pirate' in our more contemporary times (1992) that you might enjoy and might want to check out is 'Captain Ron' (as in the movie with Kurt Russell).

"Torgo_Approves","5","6","10","26 July 2006"," Fun movie, but doesn't deserve such high praise
","Yes, Johnny Depp is one of today's greatest actors and it's amazing that he'd dedicate so much time and effort to a character in a flavour-of-the-month fad movie like this one. But really, that's all there is to this film. If another actor entirely had played Jack Sparrow, this movie would get a 5 from me, tops. It is simply an extremely forgettable film. In 20 years, who will even remember who played Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann? Knightly and Bloom are good to look at, but they'll soon be past their expiration date and, let's face it, no one watches their movies for their acting.<br/><br/>The entire movie consists mainly of CGI skeletons, CGI ships and tired children's' humour derived from would-be funny characters (the transvestite ghosts, whatever their names were, are the most forgettable sidekicks this side of Tantor). The plot is as uninteresting as they come. The only reason to see this film is Depp, and although his performance is positively amazing, it's not enough to boost this flick to ""great movie"" status. His great job and the gorgeous Caribbean scenery is enough to make this movie an above average kids' flick, but no more, no less.<br/><br/>There's not much else to say on the subject, so I'll leave you eunuchs to re-watch the film and consider that maybe everything about ""Pirates"" really isn't as amazing as you first thought it was.

","Gore Verbinski follows up The Ring with this incredible family film. Johnny Depp turns in another incredible performance that should get a laugh out of everyone. This is the type of incredible family adventure/comedy that should be a favorite of the youth in this generation as The Princess Bride was for those before it. Both movies give you that good feeling and have that quality where you never get sick of watching it and hearing the lines over and over. This is a film that everyone should see a couple of times, just to enjoy the pure fun it has to offer. The great film was a surprise to me, since I knew it was based off of a Disney ride and I thought it was going to be a film for kids, but it is definitely something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Captain Jack Sparrow is the pathetic yet savvy and smooth pirate that you can't help rooting for. Orlando Bloom is the one actor I don't particularly care for in any movie, but he doesn't bother me in this one. Geoffry Rush is cast perfectly and the special effects are nice. If you haven't seen this great film yet, go out and rent it or buy the DVD which is loaded with extras that will keep you happy."

","Before this film i had never heard of Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly or Geoffery Rush but i had heard of Orlando Bloom. I had never even seen the trailer to 'Pirates of the Caribbean'! My sister first saw the film and told me so much about it and told me that I really should go and see it with her... I kept on saying no because it just didn't appeal to me. I then spoke to other people about it who said it was great so i finally decided to go and see it. From start to finish i was taken on a swashbuckling adventure! It had everything that a movie should have... love, comedy, adventure, a kidnapping and cursed pirates after treasure. The film was mainly carried by the fantastic Johnny Depp... playing the slightly drunk Captain Jack Sparrow who's main mission in the film is to get back his ship 'the Black Pearl'. However, he ends up taking on board Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) a blacksmith who is in love with the Governers daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). Elizabeth is kidnapped by Pirates and it is up to Jack and Will to save her. However the Pirates are cursed and are neither living nor dead...they must repay their blood otherwise they will be cursed forever. So as you can see there is a lot to go by on the film. Can Jack Sparrow be trusted? Will they reach Elizabeth before it is too late? Will the pirates ever be rid of the dreaded curse? Watch this film as it is perfect for anyone!

","I was a huge fan of The Pirates of the Caribbean long before the movie, so I was very nervous--would the movie do justice to the attraction? Or would it be another stinky pirate movie? The first time I saw it, though, I knew it would be a hit. The casting was perfect, the music spectacular, the special effects astounding, the story intriguing--this was as close to a perfect movie as I have seen in a long time. It's great fun, making you laugh, gasp, hold your breath, cheer, and sigh, and it appeals to all ages--I even heard grandmothers commenting on how adorable Johnny Depp was! It's not surprising that we've seen more of Keira Knightly, who gave quite a twist to the ""damsel in distress"" role. Orlando Bloom was a pleasure to look at, but his character was the only ""cardboard"" one of the lot. He did OK, and at times was great, but overall he was just overshadowed by Captain Jack, whereas the other characters seemed to hold their own. Maybe he was tired from fighting trolls (Lord of the Rings)? I've seen the movie a good two dozen times now, and it just never gets old, mostly thanks to Depp, who so deserved the Oscar for his performance. Maybe he'll manage it with one of the two sequels. Even if he doesn't, though, this will be one of his best roles ever, and it's truly a movie that everyone involved can be proud of."

I wanted to go see it because people kept on bragging on about it so I just wanted to check how it really was, and to tell you the truth, I don't regret any of it.<br/><br/>This is also probably one of Johnny Depp's best movies. He was a perfect and sometimes even funny character in the movie. He met the exact pirate voice, which is kind of weird because I haven't heard him talking like that before. Also, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley did a good job. It was just a really good movie with an awesome storyline.<br/><br/>The reason I'm giving it a 10 is because of the plot, the cast, the acting and so forth..

The CGI effects were truly amazing, as they were able to characterize the skeletons to the characters, which made it easy to keep track of them.<br/><br/>Pirates, well put together, is not just a family-fun movie or a chick-flick, but rather something that just about anyone can enjoy: action for men, romance for women, and humor all around.<br/><br/>Shorlty: humorous and captivating, this is a must-see.

Although the movie is a little bit long, nobody can get bored while watching it. What I liked most -and I think most people liked- is Johnny Depp's performance.

"tedg","Null","10","20","11 July 2003"," Stealing
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Disney films usually have a moral. Here they stretch themselves in several ways beyond the obvious first-time PG-13 rating. The implicit moral here is that it is okay to steal so long as the establishment is unreasonable. And further that there is a higher justice.<br/><br/>What's interesting is how the Disney machine works. They'll exploit any cinematic notion they can to give a thrill if that thrill is somehow tied to increased admissions. Disney has the industry's most advanced lab on these matters: they track artistic notions and cognitive science in quest of maturing artistic notions as fodder for their products. This is no collection of artistic types, but serious scientists, intent on engineering your response.<br/><br/>Put those two together and here you have an interesting theft: the wholesale adoption of the architectural camera. We saw it in ""Nemo"" where the whole thing played with the three-dimensionality of the space. We saw it in the second Harry Potter movie, where they paid lots of attention to the placement of the situation in relationship to the actual building of the school. In Hollywood filmdom, this technique -- always locating the camera in relationship to a wall -- was developed by Terry Gilliam. That explains why Depp works so well with the effect. He knows where your eyes are supposed to come from.<br/><br/>Rush has worked on four films that reference the placement of self in space. These two together: the good and bad pirates, are both intelligent actors that can listen to the lab. This is an engineered product, openly stolen from others (like the equally well- engineered ""Charlies Angels 2"").<br/><br/>It's not as clever as ""Nemo,"" not something you will actually remember like ""12 Monkeys,"" not something that challenges you like ""Panic Room"" started out to be, not as self-aware as ""Hulk""s swoops. But it uses the same notions, and uses them well enough to give a good ride. Now that this has entered the mainstream, what's next for real creative types?<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

However how can you trust a pirate's word?<br/><br/>I'll be honest and say that I didn't want to see this film ¬ñ I had been totally turned off by the trailer.  The one attempt at humour in the trailer is that awful `try wearing a corset' line, it didn't get a laugh in the film or on the trailer.  However I did go and see it and, after Hulk and Matrix, I was very glad I did.  The plot is pretty enjoyable allowing for lots of fights but also enough twists and turns to hold the interest.  It doesn't all make total sense but, like the ride it is based on, the film moves on before you have time to think too hard about anything.<br/><br/>Unlike those other blockbusters I mentioned, POTC doesn't take itself too seriously.  It doesn't make fun of itself either, but it does have it's tongue in it's cheek the whole time.  This is seen in the vein of gentle humour that runs through it in the dialogue, action and characters ¬ñ the film is basically having fun so it is easy for the audience to get with it too.<br/><br/>As every other reviewer on earth has said, the biggest strength of the film is Depp's Captain Jack.  Playing him like a drugged out rock star who clings to his half-fame like a life raft, Depp wrings so much humour out of every line, every scene and every little thing he does (`but why is the rum on fire?' being my favourite line).  It is a performance that could have been awful but he pitches it just perfectly and stops the film ever becoming anything less than fun.  The only downside of his character (who makes his appearance on a ship revealed to be a tiny, sinking boat) is that the film sags a little when he is off screen for longer than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Bloom and Knightly carry the film's more serious core and thus have a less glorious job.  Both do well however and are good if not quite stars ¬ñ certainly I was surprised to see Knightly with such a big role in a big film.  Rush enjoys himself as Barbossa and the crew also have fun.  The effects are used just as they should always be used ¬ñ to compliment the film rather than be the raison d'etre!  The effects are good without replacing plot or characters ¬ñ they are well blended into the flow so never bring the film to a halt by their use (although wine flowing through and out of Barbossa is pretty impressive).<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal.  Sure it is not a classic film or a perfect one, but it does exactly what a summer film should be ¬ñ entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously and moves a long at a fair pace without ever lapsing into impatient editing or flashy visuals.  Having said that, if Depp was not onboard the film would be much the lesser.  His exaggerated performance enhances the tongue in cheek feel to the film and makes it a much funnier, livelier and all round fun experience."

","I very much enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it but lost interest on the second viewing, for some reason. It's the usual Disney adventure story which means the same good and bad traits I usually find, namely:<br/><br/>THE GOOD - Nice camera-work and very slick-looking on DVD. Interesting characters, mostly here the ones played by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. It's difficult to find a role in which Depp doesn't play someone odd and/or fascinating. The story has a good mixture of drama, action, suspense and humor. Keira Knightley is attractive as the female lead and the story is interesting for the full 133 minutes (the last 10 minutes are ending credits.)<br/><br/>THE BAD - Once again, the messages are ""laws are made to be broken;"" ""rebels in society are the good guys while authority figures are the villains,"" and the girl wants the poor man over the rich man, etc. etc. That all is so '60s clich√©d by now, you'd think the Baby Boomers in Hollywood would grow up, but apparently not. These traits are in almost every film, including a worldly outlook on everything, which includes glorifying occult nonsense. Disney will never change.<br/><br/>OVERALL - A fun movie, thanks mainly to Depp, director Gore Verbnski and his cameramen, and successful enough to spawn a sequel."

","I guess I am a bit of a nut when it comes to pirates, but there simply aren't enough films that depict this brilliantly caricatured era.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Carribbean adds to the mix a tad of supernatural elements and makes a very standard plot into a fun adventure by adding several memorable characters. The special-effects add to the feeling of the film, but at no point does the film become too big. There's no plot to conquer the world. Everything in the film is very down to earth and personal.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp naturally adds to the film with his brilliant performance as Jack Sparrow, possibly one of the most original characters I've seen in a long while. He's become one of my favorites alongside such figures as Darth Vader, Bond and Riddick.<br/><br/>A very nicely done adventure. Brilliant movie!"

"duffster","6","18","45","21 January 2004"," Romantic comedy meets campy horror film.
","After watching Pirates of the Caribbean last night, I was very surprised to see that it had an IMDB rating of 8.0! Could THIS MOVIE really be one of the best 250 movies ever made?!? Then I looked at the voter breakdown, noticed that females gave it an average rating of 8.7, and the 1,041 females under 18 gave it a 9.5! Suddenly things started to make sense. A little sense.<br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW* Basically what we've got here is a pretty typical story. The rich governor's daughter loves the poor blacksmith boy, and he with her, but she's supposed to marry the military man. The blacksmith boy is amazingly handsome, makes the most beautiful swords that you've ever seen, and is an amazing sword fighter, since he practices in his free time-- apparently against no one. The military man takes a role that's been popular in romantic comedies lately. He's not a horrible, slimy jerk. He's just not the type of guy that women want to marry. He's stuffy, always follows the rules, and there's nothing the least bit entertaining about him. Of course she ends up with the blacksmith. Yawn.<br/><br/>The story was incredibly predictable. The evil, vile pirates don't seem that evil and vile, perhaps because they were given too many comedic gags. Additionally, their fighting scenes looked like some sort of a cheesy video game. They never really seemed as real or threatening as they should have.<br/><br/>Bloom and the girl turn in average performances, as does Geoffrey Rush. I was really disappointed with that, as I expected him to really blow me away. Unfortunately, he either wasn't feeling it, or he didn't get adequate screentime.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was quite good. He really brought some fun to an otherwise drab movie. Had it not been for Depp's performance, I don't think that this movie would have made half of the money that it did. If you DO watch Pirates of the Caribbean, watch it for Depp.<br/><br/>6.5 of 10, rounded down to hopefully drag this thing out of the top 250. :)"

","Oh and what a movie this is. There is something for everyone in the family with this movie, romance, action, drama, horror, adventure and fantasy. A quality of acting rivaling no other movie in recent times, except for the Rings trilogy, but that's another thing altogether. I have watched this movies so many times that I can't even keep track. This movie never gets boring. Johnny Depp is at the top of this career with this film!! A must see, many times over. A true classic! The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle. He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead. He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself. The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez. With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after. Well, not exactly like that but almost. This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film. Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie."

I bought the DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie, and I've been to both Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland Florida and loved the Pirates ride at both of them. Having been on the ride, it's quite easy to spot many things in the movie that pay tribute to the ride, especially in the town scenes. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I definitely didn't expect to laugh so much! This movie has such a wonderful combination of excellent acting, astounding special effects, and dry humor. Johnny Depp steals practically every scene he occupies, and Geoffrey Rush is excellent and sinister in his villainous turn. It's about as high-quality fun as one might demand in a summer blockbuster, and will have you singing ""Yo ho, ho ho"" for days and days to come. A ""pirate's life"" is plenty the life in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", an worthy, intelligent sea-faring adventure guaranteed to leave you, at the very least, plenty satisfied."

","There has been so much hype about this film, but in reality (well, in my opinion anyway) it is seriously bad. Let me explain myself...<br/><br/>Firstly, Johnny Depp, who everyone thinks has given some career-defining performance, simply hops around dressed as a woman and makes cliched little comments that really grate. Secondly, Depp and Bloom's swordfight near the beginning of the film is horrifically dull. They spend the first few minutes exchanging limp jibes (physical and verbal) walking indifferently around the set... one is left half-asleep. I know the action comes later, but this dull, empty screen-time is unusual for Disney. But the most laughable element of the film (so far) is this absolutely ridiculous idea that between the ragtag, thieving bunch that pirates were, there existed a 'code of honour'. We see in the film one of the characters asking not to be killed because, according to 'the code', she has the right to 'Parley' and can be saved from death and have a nice chat with the captain instead. When the captain later tries to distance himself from this and says that the code is 'less rules...more a set of guidelines' I was crying into my chips. This is Final Destination-quality craziness.<br/><br/>Anyway...just thought you should all know this film really ain't that great."

I never thought they would be resorted to base their films of rides in their amusement parks. It's a pirate film with some good acting but Orlando Bloom proves yet again that he can't act. <br/><br/>After the daughter of the governor of an island in the Caribbean is captured by mysterious pirates, only two people are able to save the beloved Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). These two men are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Some how they are able to comender a British super vessel able to navigate it across the ocean. <br/><br/>The movie just went way to long, topping two hours and twenty minutes, way to long for a Disney film. Jerry Bruckheimer adds tons of corny lines and supposed battle scenes between undead pirates and British Soldiers . Johnny Deep and Geoffery Rush do what they can with the roles they're given. Their are some beautiful filmed scenes of the ocean but their really isn't a story. I guess you could call this entertaining for a nine year old but for anyone else it's just a yawn fest. <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.

","The Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the black pearl, is  a very good film. Everything in this film is quite outstanding, but lets face it, people are starting to get over obsessed with this film and calling it ""The best"". I don't think it deserves to be in the TOP 250, and in a better number than IN America, Henry the Va and 21 Grams. Johnny Depp's performance is very good, funny and realistic, however, it didn't deserved an Oscar nomination. The OSCARS should pick the best performances for the nomination, but Johnny's performance was not that great.

Anyway, ""Pirates..."" is just that, a funny adventure in the tradition of ""Indiana Jones"" and ""The Mummy"". It's got everything: ghost pirates, abandoned islands, a beautiful governor's daughter and a brave young hero (or two heroes that is). The dialog is witty although I feel that it could be even wittier. The direction and the special effects were not too special (nothing compared to Gore Verbinski's great job for 'The Ring'). It was funny to see Steve from ""Coupling"" and Gareth from ""The Office"" on the big screen for the first time. They should have brought Jeff in as well! All in all ""Pirates..."" is a fine popcorn movie and surely the summer's best Blockbuster.

Take out Depp, and you have a Shakespearean tragedy without the Shakespearean part. <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom has already proved in recent times that he is completely incapable of carrying a film. He does not only not have the stage presence, but his acting varies from poor to woeful, and always with that unnecessarily husky voice, to show that he's conveying either aggression, passion, fear, loathing and just about every other emotion under the sun, as he is just so damned monotonic. <br/><br/>Knightly is THE most over rated female actor of the present day. I hear people raving over her acting skills, yet this and Pride and Prejudice have been the biggest films she's starred in, one flopped and one was carried through by Depp, hardly a sparkling resume. Not only is she incapable of acting (like Bloom) but she has THE WORST line in cinema of the 21st Century ""Try Wearing a Corset""....no thanks.

That he could come back over and and over would create respect in many and, sometimes, those who seem craziest are most feared, so perhaps he could do it.<br/><br/>Verbinski knows what he's doing but I wish so much of the movie hadn't rested on Depp's shoulders. That being said, it still works beautifully and Depp's acting is spot on. I guess it comes down to this: When you're watching the movie it can be totally absorbing and any criticisms spring to mind only when the lights are up and I've moved on to other things. I've seen the movie several times and get sucked in every time. If I were to judge a movie only by my thoughts after it's over, that wouldn't be fair.

No one in my opinion could have done the role better and I could probably find a better person for the role of just about every main role in a movie except this one. The way he says things are the kind of jokes that make you laugh in your head and think about what and outstanding movie it is without laughing out loud. It's like when you go a movie with someone and you don't hear them laugh once but when they come out they say it was the funniest movie they've ever seen it's because the jokes are the kind that if you laugh out loud you're going to sound crazy.

I can't wait. As Captain Jack Sparrow might say, ""Go see this movie. Savvy?"""

","What can i say?, its a brilliant movie. Casting is just right, especially with the fantastic Mr.Depp, he outshone everyone, and also gave the movie its humour, The story line was very original, and an ended most people wouldn't of expected. The special effects were very well done, especially the pirates turning into Skeletons, and looked very scary at parts.<br/><br/>Jeffery Rush, also acted brilliantly with his part as the evil captain Barbossa, and orlando bloom as the young man, falling n love and what he would do for love. All i can say is i cant wait for the next movie and i bet it will be even better then the first."

","I have probably seen this movie 15 times. I love movies and I am terribly critical of them. When I read the goofs page on this movie, I was shocked to see how many there were. IT is not good that the editors let so many slide. But, as a whole, this is a great mindless movie. I read a review by another user that said a good movie is one that raises important issues and questions; I agree. But, there can be other kinds of good movies. This is one! Watch it with an empty mind needing entertainment and the willingness to pass off goofs by saying ""it is a movie"" and you will find great satisfaction in Pirates. All in all, I would call this a new classic because it appeals to the masses who generally care nothing for ""great art films""."

","Johnny Depp, in my humble opinion, has been ignored far too long by Tinseltown. His acting in this film was truly gifted and inspired. If you have not seen this movie, please do so. Mr. Depp is able to completely submerge in whatever character he plays and he does so amazingly in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. A pirate with a heart of gold! Oh, the movie is great, too! Orlando Bloom is fantastic and the special effects are quite phenomenal. I cannot believe that the Disney Studies actually produces this film so perhaps there is still hope for them after Eisner."

","Movie was awesome!!Johnny Depp can play any character he's a well rounded actor, one of the best in the business (I feel). He's not to bad on the eyes either:). I'm so excited he's going to be in the 2nd movie, I feel that if they had chosen some one else to play Cpt. Jack Sparrow, Will Turner or Elizabeth Swan, it really would have not made sense. I saw the movie 6 times mainly for the actors and the plot it was very interesting and well thought out. Many people said it was too long, I believe it was perfect it kept getting interesting just as you thought Jack was going to be hung Will's to the rescue and then you think Jack and Will are caught and will go to jail Elizabeth is there.

It never speaks down to its audience and the script is pure genius. The characters are so well developed that you feel that you have known them all your life.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp however, is the pride of this film. He shines through as the mischievous, and mysterious, Captain Jack Sparrow. His acting skills are amazing as he creates a character that is surely the most memorable pirate to ever sail the Spanish Main.<br/><br/>It is BRILLIANT, the movie never slows, never bores its audience.

The chemistry between the two of them was a beautiful thing to see! I bought it on DVD and have almost worn the disc out, enjoying every second over and over again. I am definitely looking forward to their second one and hope it will be out soon! Even the female, Kiera, was good, though we all could have done without the Will/Elizabeth romance at the end! About the only bad things in the story were the bad pirates and the lack of Will sailing away into the sunset with Sparrow on their ship! These two fine actors deserve a pat on the back and more like about a thousand stars for making their characters likable, enduring, and leaving a taste on your tongue for wanting more! I highly recommend it for all family members! Once seen, this movie will stay with a fond place in your heart forever!"

","I saw this movie and I thought it was excellent. Admittedly, I originally was only going to see it for Orlando Bloom, but I ended up loving the film as a whole. The actors are excellent in their individual roles and all worked very well together. Johnny Depp was hilarious and portrayed a unique and lovable pirate. Geoffrey Rush played an excellent adversary who was both sinister and entertaining. Orlando Bloom played his part of a devoted lover wonderfully despite many people's opinions that he was weak and too lovey-dovey. The plot was interesting and captivating, and although I found a loophole, I think it was purposeful as they are making a sequel. Wonderful special effects and sets helped to make this movie excellent. Wonderful direction from Gore Verbinski held this movie together and an awesome score by Klaus Badelt accompanied the entire movie very well. Overall, I thought it was an excellently made movie that was fun for all ages."

Pirates of the Caribbean, is an action adventure film with a great cast and a wonderful story line. It starts in Port Royal, Jamaica. Where Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter gets kidnapped by a crew of cursed pirates. Right before the kidnapping a pirate by the name of Jack Sparrow comes into town looking to commandeer a ship. Sparrow agrees to team up with Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner in search of Elizabeth. But what Will does not know is that Jack is linked to the kidnapping and the cursed pirates in more ways than one. To find out the rest, see the movie!

","Naturally, computer graphics had to get in there --- pirates alone could never be enough for the modern child. She has to have pirates who are ghouls as well, so that the film is a messy hybrid of horror and adventure.<br/><br/>The combination of men who can't be killed fighting endlessly with characters made of wood while a symphony orchestra goes crazy is utterly tedious.<br/><br/>It's so sad that worldwide youngsters subject to the American global market have only this junk-food to consume on DVD.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole deadening two and a half hours, there are about five seconds of shots of the Caribbean. The picture might as well have been shot in Disneyland.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is even more pathetic here than in his next role, The Libertine, in which he played a sex-crazed poet who never touches a woman throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>His British accent, predictably, is a mess (as in The Libertine) and his role in this film is to spend long periods in a cell while everyone else gets on with it. The idea that he is some kind of commander of men is ridiculous. He simply camps up the whole picture and makes a mockery of it.<br/><br/>Naturally, the plot is the most ludicrous imaginable, it's not even worth discussing. Suffice it to say that it is full of holes you could navigate a ship through.<br/><br/>As for black people who populate the Caribbean, just two appear in this picture: one a glimpsed female pirate captain (!), the other a glimpsed huge stereotyped brute with a studded face and massive muscles. So, take your pick: cheesy stereotype or politically correct cut-out. As for the other millions who inhabit the Caribbean, they don't exist.<br/><br/>If there was a scrap of history that validated this film as a nostalgic romp, it might be excusable. But since it is a farrago of fantasy and faux-fairytale, it is to be roundly condemned. Everyone who raves about this film is doomed."

He makes the movie, hands down, and I couldn't imagine it being anywhere near as good without his magnetic, amusing performance.<br/><br/>The film/locations look stunning, and the story is good.  In fact, there's very little wrong with this fun adventure - the effects are superb (especially fighting in & out of the moonlight) - but I don't think it quite lives up to the hype (everyone I know said it was fantastic, but I see a lot more films than they do).<br/><br/>First off, the pacing drags here and there (not really during scenes, but between the set-pieces).  The swordfights (and other fighting bits) are inventive, but let down by lacklustre angles and editing.<br/><br/>And in the script, they've tried (a bit too hard) to make comedy duos out of two of the royal officers, and two of the pirates, with scenes that would fit right into a Disney cartoon but only serve to hold up the story in this live action film.  And while Geoffrey Rush is always great to watch, he just isn't evil enough.<br/><br/>In fact, I think that's the real fault of the film - it's written as if it were a cartoon.  For a comparison, it's not as good as The Goonies.<br/><br/>But go see it.  Johnny Depp = most entertaining performance so far this year."

","To tell you the truth I can't remember much about the plot--and I just saw it last night!  Something about a cursed pirate ship and its crew and how they all turn to skeletons when moonlight hits them and how they need some coins or something to release the curse...I was so bored during this film my mind kept wandering.  Maybe I just don't like pirate films but I think there's more to it than that.<br/><br/>This film has some major problems--it's way too long (half an hour could have been cut out easily); the story is (needlessly) convoluted and very badly done (I'm blaming the screenwriters and director, NOT the actors); despite all the explosions and fights the action scenes are surprisingly dull; there's loads of casual violence; leading lady Knightley is constantly being hit in the face and the admittedly great special effects just didn't grab me.  There is a spectacular sword fight at the end with the men going in and out of moonlight and going from skeleton to man and back again--but it's too little too late.  The direction is WAY off too--he seems unsure of how to frame scenes and it makes things very confusing.<br/><br/>I can't fault the actors--Orlando Bloom (very handsome with beautiful black eyes) is very good in a badly written role. Keira Knightly's role is even worse--she's just ""the girl"" in the movie and no one could be good in it. Geoffrey Rush is OK as the pirate chief.  Johnny Depp is the one reason to watch this movie.  His performance is so off-beat and funny he keeps the film afloat.  Just his mannerisms and facial expressions give an unexpected kick to lines.<br/><br/>So...this handsome production sinks because of bad direction, ridiculous length and many many boring stretches.  Unless you're a huge fan of pirate movies you can skip this one."

Its plot was totally predictable, filled with all the usual silly impossible heroics. The protagonists, by all rights, should have been killed many times over.<br/><br/>The movie also had a rash of other implausibilities, e.g., no one on the protagonists' crew died despite sustained mortal combat against a superior foe, who by virtue of a curse, could not die. The ending was especially nonsensical: several times throughout the movie, Orlando Bloom had been condemned to death (of course, he implausibly escapes each time) after having saved the life of the beloved fianc√É¬©e of the commander (and daughter of the governor). Then at the end, they simply lets him and his accomplice go?!?! Even the Johnny Depp character, which admittedly had some charm and craftiness, didn't make sense: why was he seemingly quasi-drunk all the time, slurring his syllables? And why all the eye-makeup?

I've learnt my lesson now. I'm not going to watch a film if it is doing well in America and just okay everywhere else. Don't get me wrong, i love America, but sometimes i have to wonder at the intellect of it's youth! (meet the fockers made $277m in America and only $113 in the rest of the world. Need i say more?)

It seems to me that 1999 was the last great year of Hollywood with original ground breaking movies like The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, The Green Mile, Toy Story 2 etc.<br/><br/>But i guess, now with dvds, Hollywood producers know that if a movie sucks at the box office, it will find an audience on DVD and eventually make it's money back. I guess thats why they'll give the go ahead with any movie idea these days. I just heard that they wanted to make POTC back in the 1990's, but the script was rejected. 95% of the movies i've seen in the last five years i hate. I officially hate Hollywood!!!"

The characters are all one-dimensional, either good-to-the-heart, or bad-to-the-bone, with absolutely no variations. The acting is horrendous, Johnny Depp is like a washed-up rock-star, heavily drugged and very drunk, the entire time. Orlando Bloom is nothing but a simple rehash of the knight in shining armor, if only a bit more easily tolerated. Keira Knightley is just a damsel in distress, pure and simple, nothing else. Something I found ridiculous, was that every other character, even minor characters, mastered sword fighting. The humor is unbelievably childish, at several times it was on the level of the newer Simpsons episodes, which made me cringe more than I believed was possible. All of the CGI effects were very bland, most looked like they could easily have been made at the same mediocre quality several years ago. Why so many people claim this is a great film eludes me. If you ever even consider to sit down and watch this, make sure you keep your expectations very low. Very overrated.

I clicked on it to see if it was the same movie I saw because I simply couldn't believe what I was reading. This? In the top 250? What's my point? Well my point is that I thought the movie was ordinary at best. Maybe it's just me? As soon as the ghosts came into play I was instantly turned off by this unrealistic pointless add-on, so maybe this is what sent me to sleep. If it was the ghosts or not, it doesn't matter, I didn't like it.<br/><br/>The script and directing were good, so was Johnny Depp's acting.

This sort of treatment was fine during the 1980's when Indiana Jones and the like seemed fresh and fun but surely young cinemagoers are entitled to something more intelligent in 2003 - such as a plot that makes sense, straight acting and some semblance of historical accuracy.

","The poster doesn't do justice to this movie. It has single-handedly brought the genre back from the dead. Yes, the plot requires actual concentration on the details, but that's part of the fun. The pacing is fast when it needs to be; the camera can linger, too. Depp is a wonderful pirate: cocky, self-assured, disarming, dangerous, single-minded. He flouts the rules and rulers with the aplomb one expects of an outlaw. He brings a particular zest to the role that he skews in interesting directions. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann (see Maureen O'Hara in The Black Swan) is one of the few fully-realized female characters in a genre film. Her bravery and longing for adventure are clearly shown as traits held even as a child. So it's no surprise to see her reject the proper suitor and insist on meeting the pirates personally. Orlando Bloom is pretty, but pale except in one smashing fight scene. Fun, fun movie with great outtakes on the DVD. Go see it; then rent Captain Blood, Against All Flags and the Black Swan."

The movie jumps from one topic to the next without any logical sequence. The characters are not properly developed. Keira is excellent, but cannot save this non-product. You expect a pirate movie - not necessarily full of romance, but this film lacks any trace of it. For instance: if you don't love Norrington, who then do you really love? A writer could do better than this. The movie is definitely not based on Disney's P. of the C. Anyone doubting that should go and visit the Real Pirates at Disneyland.

Sure, it has a huge budget, a different cast (which included Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce!), great special effects, and a lengthy two hour plus run time but this film never did anything for Me and here are the reasons why it didn't.<br/><br/>The following is in My opinion.<br/><br/>1. Johnny Depp is a good actor but I just didn't know what to think of his character whether I should like him, hate him, or feel sorry for him.<br/><br/>2. I'm an action movie nut and there was a lot of action but the action just wasn't exciting enough that its so great it'll be one of the films I'll see over and over. In other words nothing special or spectacular happened in this one.<br/><br/>3. The music by up coming composer Klaus Badelt was ok but most of it was just recycled of Hans Zimmer's one of a kind score from the greatest epic called Gladiator (2000)! Badelt composed an excellent score for the Time Machine and retooled the music and this is what we get for this? Why?<br/><br/>4. Some of the things that happened in the film was supposed to be funny but I didn't think it was and I didn't think the comedy stuff was needed.<br/><br/>
5. The late great Trevor Goddard had a brief role in this movie and I believe it was his last one. Why give an actor with an incredible muscular build, a unique accent, and amazing talent a scene where it makes him look like a complete joke?<br/><br/>You may be thinking why I am saying this. How can I say this about a movie that is so high in fame and stature? I am just saying how I feel about the film. The film had all the potential and everything going for it but it just didn't do it. I wanted to like the movie but it never changed. I don't agree about it being on the IMDb's Top 250: #235! In fact, I think it shouldn't even be on the list. There are many other films that deserve to be on the list more than this film! You mean to tell Me that this is on the same list with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? Plus there are many more movies with much more excitement similar to this movie like the Planet of the Apes (2001), The Mummy, and The Mummy Returns, and Cutthroat Island! In My opinion Pirates of the Caribbean's competion The Hulk and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was so much better and exciting in My opinion! Anyway I feel if you wanted to watch a much more epic pirate movie instead see Cutthroat Island, its much more exciting! I hate to say this but Pirates of the Caribbean is awfully dull, boring, uninteresting, uninspiring, it has no depth, and it should be avoided like a flood!"

Probably because I occasionally enjoy fun adventure films in the manner of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) or ""The Mummy"" (1999). ""Black Pearl"" is a film of this ilk.<br/><br/>WHAT WORKS: The film looks and sounds great, which includes the actors, costuming, cinematography, locations and score. Johnny Depp as pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow is a notable character; Sparrow comes off as a young Keith Richards gone Pirate. Keira Knightley is beautiful as Elizabeth Swann; and Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Lee Arenberg are all fabulous in their roles.<br/><br/>WHAT DOESN'T WORK: When I first saw it in 2003 the film struck me as too long for such lightweight fare (2 hours and 23 minutes). It also struck me as boring and forgettable for some reason. I decided to see it again recently and came away feeling the exact same way. What makes it boring and forgettable? I don't know, it's hard to pinpoint. Maybe because it's too drawn-out; light film fare like this works best at around 80-95 minutes. Maybe it's because many of the characters are unable to die because of the curse, which naturally creates a lack of suspense. Mostly it's because the story and characters, although fun, are absurd and superficial. Also, I suppose it's too much to expect to glean some morsel of depth or truth from a film like this.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: ""Black Pearl"" is a fun, goofy pirate adventure; it's okay but far from great like, say, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or even the 1999 version of ""The Mummy."" It's overlong, overly light, kinda boring and ultimately forgettable. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not a fan and can't recommend it, except maybe to kids. But if it trips your trigger that's great.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+"

","*Minor spoilers*<br/><br/>Much praise has been held over 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the black pearl', and not one, but TWO sequels are in production.<br/><br/>The movie is also rated 7.9 and #227 (today, may 08 2005). <br/><br/>The cast is very good, but the script and plot is WAY to cheesy for me to take in. I find it ironic that a very good movie like Master and Commander, who is also a pirates-vs-soldiers movie and a hell of a good one at that, aiming for realism, gets surpassed by Potc with a plot of undead pirates walking on the bottom of oceans and turning to bones by night? There's also a lot of bridges that doesn't really add anything to the action (the movie tops 140 minutes), which only becomes an annoyance. <br/><br/>Fun for 11-year olds mayhap, but for us a bit older...

","I usually love anything that Johnny Depp is in, but this film is an exception, mainly because they picked the worst actress in the world to play the leading lady. Keira Knightly is given so much credit about being the finest female actor in Britian, I think however that her acting in this film somewhat contradicts this statement. She is truly terrible, the only bit i thought she was good was when she fell off the castle wall. But otherwise this film is quite good, i thought Johnny Depp was brilliant playing Jack Sparrow and also looked gorgeous in the process, which isn't very hard for Johnny Depp. Unfortuanatly i could only bear to watch this film once because of keiras unemotional presence and Orlando Bloom being overcast by Johnny's shadow."

","I'm not much of a fan of Disney movies, pirates and Johnny Depp so I was really reluctant to see this Disney flick. I was pleasantly surprised by how the movie started. I was actually riveted, by the funny action and the amazing performance of Depp. Like I said, I'm not a Depp fan and I usually can't stand him in anything but as Jack Sparrow, Depp is totally amazing. Depp created a real character here, no matter how campy he is. Unfortunately, once the pirates invade the port and the story concentrated on them, the film became really tedious and I didn't care about anything. The film should have concentrated more on Sparrow and the two other characters. The pirates, or ghosts, are devices and it's almost impossible to care for them. The story became sillier and sillier and Depp, who's the ONLY good thing in this movie, went missing for long periods of time. Bloom and the actress were pretty much flat. And this film is very LONG!!! Oh well..."

","The only thing memorable about 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' will be Johnny Depp's usual out-standing performance.<br/><br/>I can only hope that this 'Blockbuster' featurette won't do for his acting career what ""Leaving Las Vegas"" did to Nick Cage's.  Remember Nicholas Cage, a quirky, interesting actor who was almost always worth watching, no matter how bad the movie?  Then his big moment in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", and he hasn't done a thing worth watching on-screen since then, including his woefully lackluster performance in Martin Scorcese's 1999 film, ""Bringing Out The Dead"", where Mr. Cage would only be considered interesting in contrast to John Goodman's typically bombastic, bizarre, supporting-actor overdoses.<br/><br/>Now it's Mr. Depp's turn as an actor.  Either he will continue to pick and choose his movies based on the merit he sees in them as an actor, along the lines of the late, great, Gregory Peck, and the still living, and equally astounding, Meryl Streep; or, he will pick and choose his movies based on how much money someone is willing to pay him for his 'appearing in' their studio's (insert studio name) production of (insert producer's name and/or production company name)  film directed by (insert director's name), and starring (insert actor's name).<br/><br/>I am rooting for the uniqueness of Johnny Depp, of course.<br/><br/>For a movie as over-produced as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is, with the occasional well-done special effect (which should be a given considering the money spent), and interesting costuming (especially in the 'heaving-bossoms' scenes), some of the 'special effects' come off rather mediocre in comparison to better done summer fodder.  The distance shot of the burning Port would have been at home in Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"".  The underwater skeleton-walking scenes looked like out-takes from ""Clash of The Titans"".<br/><br/>The humor of the movie is also in question, first during the looting of the British Naval Port and attacks on it's citizens by the pirates, with scenes of murder and attempted rape, played on film as quasi-comedy (in someone's seriously disturbed idea of entertainment); and also during the scenes when British Sailors are being slaughtered left and right onboard their own ship, immediately after the Pirates' underwater skeleton-walking scene, although these sailors are mostly being dis-embowelled off-screen so as to further distance us from contemplating the possibility of their deaths, and we are coerced instead into laughing at a Pirate's severed boney claw, clutching for the cowardly Governor Swann's throat.  A character foppishly over-played by Jonathan Pryce. Can anyone say ""Vincent Price"" cheese-ball?<br/><br/>The dashingly pretty Orlando Bloom, as Will Turner, barely registers a ripple of a human nuance, rather like observing an interesting wall-paper. Likewise for Keira Knightley, as his longed-to-be-statuette-on-a-pedestal, Elizabeth Swann, the (of course!) Governor's daughter.  For a good acting comparison see Kate Winslett in ""Titanic"". Both parts seemingly conceived by a group of writers discovering cheap plastic glow-in-the-dark religious icons for the first time and attempting to pass them off as feminine Heaven.<br/><br/>On screen for an hour too long, with convoluted plot 'twists' packing the wallop of moist cardboard, character actors required to do uninteresting comic 'bits' that might amuse a two-year old, screen-writing that barely rises to a fourth grade school play, wooden acting filmed along the lines of ""Stand there and don't move while we shoot the scene"", yet another 'typical' Hollywood feel-good ending, and, voila!, this summer's simple-minded Block-Buster movie is completed.<br/><br/>On to the usual mass-merchandising, burger chain tie-ins (no matter how oddly far-fetched), and 'direct-to-DVD' sequel(s)!

","This is a perfect movie if (A) you are a twelve year old boy, (B) you like to see stunt men ejected from explosions over and over and over again (C) you will watch anything with Johnny Depp, regardless. <br/><br/>For more discriminating adults, the two and a half hours of noise and chaos unrelieved by any semblance of careful plotting becomes tedious. Depp is certainly fun for the first half hour, sending up the pirate image by coating his eyes with kohl and sending up the Disney image by acting a little less than wholesome, but after a while, one longs for more than people screaming with swords in their hands backed up with a bombastic music score that underscores the emptiness of the enterprise.<br/><br/>One longs for the sense of heroic purpose and genuine derring-do exemplified by Errol Flynn/ Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, or Burt Lancaster in such grand adventures as The Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Sinbad The Sailor or The Crimson Pirate, all recently released on vivid, family-oriented DVDs; Pirates From The Carribbean is cynical corporate entertainment, the humor ironic or tongue-in-cheek, and, though marketed as such, is really not for children unless they are so desensitized to blood and savagery from video games that nightmarish visions do not bother them."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","2","6","13","24 July 2006"," This can impossibly appeal to an adult audience
","If you voted 10 for this film, you'd better be 10 years old or else this is simply unforgivable.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is a truly excruciating experience. I hate this film on so many levels, covering so many aspects and ranging from crew to cast that it actually makes me physically ill to watch. So if I hate this film to the core, then what's the 2/10 for, you ask? The answer is; I think this film could be entertaining to kids and the odd pre-teen. It is, after all, a Disney production based on a popular Disney ride in a theme park and I think this explains its paper-thin plot of ""saving the damsel in distress (Keira Knightley), killing the bad guy (Geoffrey Rush) and having an over-the-top comedic sidekick (Johnny Depp) whilst doing it"".<br/><br/>I don't know whose genius idea it was to cast Orlando Bloom as the romantic and heroic lead, but this choice helps him cement his position as the resident Hollywood lucky-guy, getting by without so much as a shred of talent, but inexplicably being offered big-budget project after the other. Furthermore, my theory is that Bloom's bad acting is contagious and affected the rest of the cast of Pirates of the Caribbean like a nasty case of the flu. Keira Knightley is a stunning woman but all she does here is pout with her pretty lips until she gets to deliver some cheeseball tough-chick line like ""You like pain? *WHAM* Try wearing a corset."" I'm no member of the Depp camp but I think he has pulled off some great performances in the past, but in Pirates, he is so over-the-top and corny that this can impossibly appeal to an adult audience.<br/><br/>So aside from the cringe-worthy ""corset"" line by Keira Knightley, the dialogue-writing on the film really puzzles me. It's like it's camp but not intentionally. I believe this film truly thinks it's clever and amusing when it's only extremely embarrassing. Juvenile generic action sequences, long-drawn segments, contrived performances, dumb plot and overblown special effects make Pirates of the Caribbean an unwatchable adventure.<br/><br/>2/10"
"Buddy-51","5","6","13","22 February 2005"," Depp is the only real treasure here
","God bless Johnny Depp, for without him ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" would be just another empty big budget studio extravaganza - juvenile, bloated and over-reliant on stunt work and special effects. But thanks to Depp's brave and witty performance, the film rises above its own inherent weaknesses to become at least a halfway entertaining picture. He is the real treasure here.<br/><br/>""Inspired"" - if one dares use so lofty a term - by the Disney theme park attraction of the same name, ""Pirates"" takes us to the never-never land of swashbuckling heroes and shiver-me-timbers foolishness. Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who was left for dead on an island by his mutinous crew. Sparrow, captain of the legendary Black Pearl, a ship with the reputation for possessing evil, unearthly powers, has now returned from his exile and is ready to exact revenge on the mates who abandoned him. There's really no point in thrashing out the complicated but essentially simpleminded plot here. Suffice it to say that it involves a diabolical curse, a literal ghost ship with a literal skeleton crew, a feisty damsel-in-distress and enough repetitive swordplay and ""avast me, hardy"" dialogue to keep the action adventure crowd purring with contentment.<br/><br/>For all the care that has gone into the look of the film - the costumes, set design and computer-generated special effects - ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" would sink pretty quickly were it not for Depp giving his all to keep it afloat. His lisping, flamboyant, over-the-top approach to the character is exactly what this stale little tale needs to lift it above the ordinary. One has only to see Depp mincing around - where anyone else in the part would have been swaggering - to verify what we have known all along about Depp as an actor, which is that he is willing to take risks and explore different avenues when tackling a role, even one as lightweight and insubstantial as this one. He turns what could have been a mere walk-through, check-cashing part into an inspired comic turn. One can only imagine what a boring movie this would have been without him. For, indeed, the story itself is silly and the other characters (except for Geoffrey Rush's evil Captain Barbossa) stiff, dull and uninteresting. But Depp is the real deal, and all I can say is that I hope he received a large percentage of the film's phenomenal box office booty. Like any good pirate, he deserves it."

","Could their be a more over-rated film this year. While okay in part, I think the main reason behind it's success is the fact that some people take a liking to Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. It has problems classifying what type of film it is. Not enough action to be a action film. Not enough laughs to be a comedy. It has also been put up for major awards, yet it is clearly a blockbuster. 'Its both of these,' you may say. That is not the case as the poor attempts at jokes do not work. Johnny Depp probably deserved his Golden Globe nomination, not his Oscar nomination though. His character, along with everyone elses, is one-dimensional and conforms to stereotypes. Bloom plays Legolas very well to say the setting has changed. the other actors are fairly decent in their roles. A plot that i could predict in my sleep and a boring script prevent it from being good.

And it copies other things like not only it being set in the caribbean and having a voodoo lady, but the actual set and having to row through a swamp to get to the voodoo lady's shack, pirate towns made of broken ships and so many things just completely lifted from the game and lazily put into the film. The main villain of Pirates of the Caribbean also looks identical to the villain in Monkey Island.

There where Pirates, cannons, sword fights, treasures funny monkey's and a beautiful girl, What more could you possibly ask for. <br/><br/>I can still remember when I saw Jack Sparrow for the first time. He may not of had the typical ""hero"" qualities that would see in somebody like say William Turner, but that is what made jack so undeniably brilliant, he wasn't somebody we have experienced before. He was a witty, drunk, Sword fighting Pirate, with a flare for the dramatic. Seen for the first time in possibly the greatest hero entranced ever made. I glanced my stunned eye's at the screen to behold the one they called Jack Sparrow, or should I say ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow. There he stood in all his glory, the anthem soundtrack blared as he stood on top of his wooden sinking ship, or boat... As he floats by the pirate outlaws hung by there necks, with a sign on them that states ""pirates Ye Be Warned"" he stops bailing his sinking boat in time to offer a kind salute, to his fellow dead pirates.<br/><br/>Its not long in till we are swept away by a amazing story of a two men desperately trying to find the loves of there life. One a Pirate after his stolen ship, and the other, a working hard blacksmith boy, trying to find his true love. Luckily for them, both loves have been taken by the ""crew of the dammed"". Barbossa, the fearless pirate with a pet monkey, yes a pet monkey. It soon becomes apparent that everyone in the story wants something, and they will screw and back-stab anyone who gets in there way, honestly this film there are know such thing as true friends, everyone will become an enemy in time.<br/><br/>After years of watching this film, it still reveals itself as nothing more but a great adventure movie, just plain fun. So why not give it ten out of ten. There is everything you want in an adventure movie, girls, fights and a little magic and mystery. Not to mention some of the best 1-liners you will ever hear, ""you best start believing in ghost stories miss turner, you're in one"", and my personal favourite, the very last line in the film, as Jack prepares to embark on more of his adventures he quotes ""bring me that horizon"" as the ship sales off into the sunset."

I consider it to be a very well done pop-corn flick which was very well directed, managed to combine in a clever way the comedy, the adventure, the action and the fantasy (And this even adds some little hints of horror) without insulting the intelligence of the viewers.<br/><br/>It is something that whole family could enjoy, and it certainly has many virtues that deserve appreciation: The production values are wonderful, the soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is excellent, and the performances of the entire cast were more than appropriate. Even when the story of the movie isn't very deep or complex, the result is pretty satisfying.<br/><br/>What I don't understand is the absurd comparisons between this movie and superior films such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" from Peter Jackson or the original Indiana Jones trilogy. Those movies are in a completely different league, and (for me, at least) were life-changing experiences, with many memorable scenes, while this didn't have anything remotely comparable to that. <br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean"" it's a decent adventure flick, but it's way too overrated.

"oneloveall","5","3","5","30 November 2006"," High production values do not cancel out the mostly hollow affair
","This big budget swashbuckler reinstated Hollywood's interest in pirates, reaffirmed Johhny Depp as a bankable mainstream leading man, and refocused the industry with it's surprisingly high box office performance, followed by an even more surprising (though widely regarded as inferior) net gain from it's sequel. So why did I not have half the fun as I was anticipating with The Curse of the Black Pearl? Despite having all the key ingredients at making this rousing adventure come to life, Pirates still flounders with a repetitious script, an overkill of production, and of course the general disengaged, auto-piloted mentality that one immediately associates with any massive studio release. Yes, Depp's inspired take as the woozy captain Jack Sparrow does breathe some fresh air into the stale script, though his acting, more often then not, devolves into processed caricature rather then the engaged perceptiveness we are used to seeing from an accomplished actor such as Depp. Also, the casting of uber-talented Geoffry Rush did help break up much of the monotony the time-killing script wished to parlay. Ultimately though, these elevated Hollywood performances are buried under ten tons of sheen, smoke, and explosions that could only be appropriately titled ""The Bruckheimer effect"" which finds the mega- producer, as usual, filling in any actual emotional content with a barrage of over-excessive special effects and action sequencing. Shame too, because with Depp at the helm, and the few scenes that show off the inherent humor, personality and flavor this franchise could have offered, it became obvious that this could have been so much more memorable then the hollow ride it turns out to be. As far as popcorn family entertainment goes, I can justify the massive amount of success the movie has reaped, although to elevate this movie past the point of good, into the realm of great, as many reviewers have done, seems well overrated, as I mostly spent my two and a half hours waiting for the resolution in this lackluster plot."

Orlando Bloom is totally wooden as usual, Kiera Knightley doesn't exactly leave an impression, and Johnny Depp, although he is a god of acting, doesn't take his cool role nearly as far as he could have(with a script like PoTC's, there's no room for anything outside the frames of well-tried movie/money-making guides).<br/><br/>The plot is the standard damsel-in-distress scenario and some Incan curse thrown in for good measure.

Elizabeth swan has a connection with the black pearl that she does not know until pirates from the black pearl attack the island that she is on and kidnaps her. when she gets on the ship they ask her what is her name she Elizabeth turner, but little did she know turner was the name another pirate that used to be part of the black pearls crew. jack sparrow knowing this while in prison. when a young blacksmith named will turner (bloom) who secretly has a thing for Elizabeth turns to jack to get her back.<br/><br/>so over all this was an excellent film no doubt"

","I didn't see this movie till it came out on DVD back 2 years ago.<br/><br/>I regretted not seeing it in theaters, because I kept thinking it'll suck, because it didn't look like it be anything similar to the ride at Disneyland.<br/><br/>But I was surprised to see that it's a very well done action movie. And surprised that it's even done by Disney. Cause it's not the common Family Friendly movie you'd find from Disney.<br/><br/>The movie of course takes place in the Caribbean and during the 16th or 17th Century era. Which is when pirates ruled the 7 seas. A ship was sailing across the Atlantic which came across a wreckage of another ship. With only one passenger who is a young boy named Will Turner. Who had a gold medallion in his position. A girl named Elizabeth noticed the medallion to be pirate related so she took it and hid it from the ship's crew so that way they wouldn't think that Will is a pirate.<br/><br/>8 years later Elizabeth is more grown up and Will is a blacksmith who makes and repairs swords for the army of the seaport town of Cape Royal. Life was very calm and peaceful till Jack Sparrow came ashore of Cape Royal. He is not your average pirate and he's very well known throughout the Caribbean. And there's a lot more to his back story than there seem to be.<br/><br/>The medallion that Elizabeth holds is the key to breaking the curse of the pirates of the black pearl.<br/><br/>I gotta admit i did like it quite a bit. I just wish I knew it was going to be a must see movie. It had action, great special effects, plenty of humor in some parts, and great characters to know while watching the movie.<br/><br/>It's also unlike the common pirate movies you'd see anywhere else. Which is because it's a modern day made pirate movie. Those who are obsess with the ride might enjoy this movie a lot."

","POTC: TCOTHBP was occasionally interesting. What can one expect, the movie is based on a ride? Keira Knightley fills well the lovely young woman role. Johnny Depp is occasionally hilarious and interesting.<br/><br/>What largely lacks for POTC is the story (hey, I understand, the ride was supported by effects and posing too, but it is only a few minutes long) and... well... the male second. While one can certainly understand Orlando Bloom's Will Turner's interest in Keira Knightley's Elizabeth, one can't, however, understand the reciprocation. I understand actors' withering beside Johnny Depp's irresistible, on-screen energy and force of personality, but poor Orlando Bloom nearly puddles beneath the glare. For LOTR all he had to do is stretch his neck and furrow his brow and that, beneath his lovely, light locks is what we needed from him there. Unfortunately for us, it seems that producers haven't yet realized that is all he can do.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush ranged from over-the-top (which worked) to occasional attempts at being a sympathetic character (which didn't).<br/><br/>There are some decent moments of entertainment including some laugh-out-loud funny lines involving Captain Jack Black. But this is not a keeper -- at most, a renter, preferably a borrower."

I wasn't too impressed with any of the characters. Jack Sparrow was kind of amusing, but his antics got really old very fast. Orlando Bloom and Knightly's characters were plain boring. But the character I was most disappointed in was Captain Barbossa -- such an uninteresting villain, absolutely no noteworthy character.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10, and I feel like I'm being generous.

"rebeljenn","4","3","5","5 March 2006"," Offers fun times but little else
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' is an old-fashioned adventure pirate film, combining new animation techniques with humor, romance, and pirate battles. The film is not a great film by any means; it is simply fun. The film moved a little slow in some places, and I was not impressed by Johnny Depp's performance at all. The film really had little to offer in terms of an original story, but if you are looking for a film that is fun and something to liven up a dull evening, this film is okay. Children and adults can both enjoy this. It's not great, but it can probably be enjoyed by a wide audience. I give this a 4/10 because I did not think it was anything special."

The reason being for this is that after I saw that it had been over two hours and the movie was still going on, I just got up and left.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether or not you'll enjoy this movie. To be honest, I didn't really like it much. However, every other person that I have talked to who has seen this film has said that it was cool. I just didn't feel that way personally.<br/><br/>I found it to be just another boring, typical pirate movie with predictable plot movements and unfunny comic relief. There was way too much dialogue and not enough action. And, well, I realized that I had been sitting in the theater for an hour, but I thought that I was only just FEELING like I was in there for so long just because it was so tedious and I was just waiting for it to end. However, it never ended.<br/><br/>Although I didn't like it personally, everybody else did. So, I don't know what to say.

I thought Johnny Depp's performance was really good and you couldn't help but love him. I also liked that the movie didn't have a lot of gore and sex in it but still kept the viewer captivated. As for T. Robertson's comment on Captain Sparrow having been under the curse too the whole time-he was not. Jack only came under the curse after having slipped a coin out of the chest after Will had been captured (You have to watch closely). That in itself was rather clever on Sparrow's part since you can't do battle with an immortal pirate and win if you are mortal. :-)This one definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies. I hope they make another one."

I cannot work out the mystery of why critics gave it such bad reviews. The special effects were excellent, as well.<br/><br/>I was very choked that it did not get a single Oscar award. I especially couldn't believe that Return of the King got best Makeup over it. I saw NO makeup in that (the Orcs were people wearing masks), and then in Pirates, in come Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in spectacular makeup. I certainly think that Johnny should have gotten ""Best Actor"" for Jack Sparrow rather than Sean Penn.<br/><br/>A great movie for all pirate lovers out there, and well - any movie lover out there."

Johnny Depp is incredibly funny and incredibly sexy, and since potc I have become a JD addict, which is costing me a fortune on Ebay. The special effects are perfect - the pirates are very funny and not overdone at all. It is fun for all the family, and I can't think of anybody who isn't a complete kill joy, who wouldn't enjoy this film. It's always worth a watch when you need cheering up.

","I watched this while babysitting my neighbor's kids ages 9 and 12. They liked it a lot, I thought it was okay. I got a little bored about half-way but not enough to turn it off, I wanted to see how they would wrap it all up.<br/><br/>It has some neat effects and the story line is pretty good, every kid wonders what it would be like to do something amazing. The acting was pretty good, especially from Johnny Depp he delivers an excellent performance. The beautiful Keira Knightley delivers a good but not great performance and so does eye candy Orlando Bloom. I think that this movie is a good movie for Keira Knightley's future career, she is a beautiful young actress that has a lot of potential. I thinks that she would be in many of the future ""big"" movies! I also think that Orlando Bloom would become a big actor, but I don't think that he will become bigger than Keira Knightley. Well this wasn't the greatest pirate movie ever told, but the potential for it to be above average is definitely there. I went into this movie expecting it to suck right up there with one of those crazy Lampoon type spoofs of a movie, not to mention something that was just for kids. I was totally wrong. Me being a 18 year old adult found it to be quite humorous and quite exciting in most parts. Johnny Depp, in my opinion was cast perfectly for the role. Of course I tend to be a bit biased when it comes to good ol' Johnny( I loved him in Edward Scissorhands). He definitely shines in all of his performances and will blossom into one of the great actors of the upcoming generation. As far as this movie goes, its all about having fun, and that's exactly what Johnny accomplished with this film... hail Jack Sparrow (Johnny). When I took my cousin out to see ""Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"", I fully expected to be bored and go away hoping that at least the children enjoyed it... boy, was I surprised! Johnny Depp played a great pirate, and Keira Knightley was a cute rich girl. I thought it was really funny and full of action, and my cousin thought it was ""really cool!"" It's a creative family flick...fun for the whole family. (Even I enjoyed it!) I think this movie will be on every kid's top ten for a while to come...as for me, I'll be waiting for a sequel.  I know what you're thinking, and you're right. Keira Knightley's acting really doens't leave much to be desired, but the witty script, good lead from Johnny Depp and excellent fighting make this a must see. A great movie. I liked ""Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"". It was cool, funny, thrilling, and had a lot of action. Although I am a big fan of Keira Knightley's and was disappointed at her acting in this movie. Sure, she was great in ""The Hole"" but in this movie I found her to be a bit over-the-top. I know Keira could've done better than that. On the other hand, Johnny Depp did great playing Captain Jack Sparrow. Keira's clothes weren't really appropriate for a PG movie. But I thought this movie was a little bit too intense for a PG and for little kids under the age of 7 to watch. Some of the violence was just a tiny bit intense. In one scene they show Will running his hand up Elizabeth's chest, but I don't think it was meant in a sexual way, and some woman show cleavage and look like prostitutes.  But I still recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it, you should!!Pirates of the Carribean :Curse of the Black Pearl has an interesting premise even if at first I was a little cautious about it. But we must look at it from the right point of view, meaning like a kid would. Who never wished to be to be a pirate? Even today I think about it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is perfect for the role. He represents a feisty pirate captain. Orlando Bloom is also great as his tough, icy partner. The amazingly beautiful Keira Knightley however suffers from a huge lack of screen time. Her acting could also be better and we can clearly notice the girl has a huge ego. With her looks she can go far no doubt about it. But she has to be a little humble and be ready to learn. I'm not sure that is the case. With full knowledge of the power of her physical side she appears not the least interested and I would say even bored throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The story is simple and without a touch of reality to it, just like it was supposed to be. The humor however could be more efficient. Some jokes, maybe too many, fall flat. The action could also have been improved. It's not even close to spectacular. The opening scene is very attractive but then all we get is some explosions and a few swashbuckling fights. There's also some violence, but nothing too extreme.<br/><br/>POTC:COTBP has some flaws. Its slow to build, some scenes fail miserably and sometimes its just too stupid.<br/><br/>But since I'm not in its target audience. not anymore, I would recommend it because I still enjoyed it very much. It has a light, childish atmosphere that works very well and provides an innocent fun. This was a very entertaining film for anyone of any age. It had cool action, and good special effects. Johnny Depp was good as Jack and was excellent at playing the beautiful Elizabeth Swann. When Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce) is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter.Perfect Film to take the whole family to. This was also pretty funny. Very good action/family/comedy/pirate movie.Loved this movie! Saw a free sneak preview and would pay to see it again. Johnny Depp was crazy/wonderful as usual. Funny, creative, handsome, surprising - as he always is.Orlando Bloom was like a young Errol Flynn. He was a dream in Lord of the Rings and this proves that was no fluke. He can act, he's good to look at - has a sweet personality and the physicality to carry the role. The swordplay between Bloom and Depp was terrific!Geoffrey Rush pushed the envelope at being wonderfully hammy and the rest of the cast was simply great.Beautifully visual, a bit too long, but worth the ride. And I mean Ride!<br/><br/>
Really cool! 8.5/10<br/><br/>
I liked the action parts and the skeleton pirates. If you think of yourself in place of the actors,it helps you get a feeling of how the actor were.<br/><br/>There is also romance at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie.Went to see this on a rainy evening on vacation with my cousin. They loved it, and my parents and I enjoyed the experience too.<br/><br/>Depp is an excellent lead - charming and likable, and the other cast members are well cast. Interesting story, good dialog, pretty decent special effects, great pace and length - what more could one ask for?<br/><br/>

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl truly is a work of art.<br/><br/>With the notable exceptions that the Disney logo is slapped on beside the title and a ride bearing its name exists within their parks, this is far from the clich√© kiddy flicks they have grown famous for.  It's obvious that they've done little other than collect royalties and throw a killer premiere party for this film, leaving it in the very capable hands of Verbinski and Bruckheimer.  So for those of you who swore off seeing it, claiming you'd rather die than deal with little mermaids and lion kings, get over yourselves and give it a try.<br/><br/>First off, this film brought together the very best of Hollywood, with a stacked cast both in front of, and behind, the camera.  It is obvious from the beginning that more than one or two people threw their all into this production, for everything oozed precision.<br/><br/>The ships were incredible and the attention to detail was startling, especially on the Black Pearl.  The cursed pirate vessel was everything one would imagine it to be.  The weathered wood was dark as were the shredded sails (although they were a bit over done and sort of resembled Swiss cheese, but you can't win 'em all...) and everything was draped with cobwebs and immersed in fog; it was incredible.<br/><br/>The setting was utterly breathtaking, and the views of clear blue-green waters, white sand beaches, and tropical foliage were enough to make anyone in the audience damn near suicidal.  The re-creation of the colonial ports was very well done and, once again, the attention to detail was insane!<br/><br/>But the storefronts and marketplaces would not have gone far without the great work of the many extras employed.  Between soldiers, sailors, and townsfolk, the amount of people needed for filler was staggering, and yet they seemed to find the very best to provide a foundation for this story. The pirates were especially well done, reviving the idea that the supporting characters can, and will, steal the show.  They were funny and disgusting cutthroats who each had their own personalities and quirks, making it seem like there were eighty main characters instead of four.<br/><br/>Speaking of the main characters, the casting done for these roles was simply masterful.  While the character of Will Turner is a bit melodramatic and annoying, Orlando Boom's good looks and some really smart one-liners make him loveable in the end.  Kiera Knightly's character wasn't all that special or different, but she shined in her portrayal of the beautiful rich girl who secretly longs for adventure and the not so rich boy, so snaps to her.  Geoffrey Rush was Captain Barbossa, and it is next to impossible to imagine him as anything else.  His gait, his costumes, his speech, it only added to his mystique, making it completely impossible to outright loathe his character even though you know you should.<br/><br/>But the man of the hour is without a doubt Johnny Depp.  Known for taking the most bizarre and least publicized roles, he went from the pasty introverted Edward Scissorhands characters to a very tan, very loud, and very drunk pirate by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow, solidifying his status as one of the foremost acting talents of his day.  With the aid of incredible costuming and extremely witty writing, Depp becomes the man, swaggering and slurring, not once falling out of character.  If he doesn't win the Oscar for this performance, the Academy is most definitely on all of the drugs in Raoul Duke's damned briefcase.<br/><br/>Basically, this film is a gem, and while it doesn't solve world hunger or confuse the viewer into a coma, it does take the audience away from their humdrum lives and into a simpler time where adventure was a way of life, not office work in a cubicle.  Many people have griped about this film, and to them I say this: There simply isn't a need to overanalyze it, so just sit back and enjoy, and grow a sense of humor, for Pete's sake!"

","""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a fine fantasy movie.  The poster alone conveys all the elements to be found here: action, mystery, piracy and a hint of sexy romance.  The result is a slick and exciting film that entertains from beginning to end.<br/><br/>A brief sequence at the beginning shows a young girl, at sea with her sailor father (Jonathan Pryce), retrieve a mysterious medallion from the neck of a drowning boy.  The young girl grows up into the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and the young man, who has admired from afar, is now a local sword-maker Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) in a Mediterranean coastal town.  Chaos ensues Elizabeth is captured by undead pirates led by Captain Barrabosa (Geoffrey Rush), who need Elizabeth's medal to restore their souls.  With the aid of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a mad pirate, Turner sets after Barrabosa, intending to rescue Elizabeth....<br/><br/>The story is excellent, very conventional but enjoyably so.  The usual pirate cliches are in evidence; buried treasure, scurvy seadogs, buxom damsels in distress and dashing heroes.  All of this works through a line of outrageous humour that satirizes the kind of thing the film is paying homage to.<br/><br/>The technical aspect of the film is marvellous.  Well lit and directed with sumptous costumes, scenery and props, it looks great.  Special effects are a good mix of CGI and model work.  Fight scenes are fantastic, the first duel between Turner and Sparrow, and the last between Sparrow and Barrabosa being especially inventive and memorable.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp all but steals the movie as mad pirate Sparrow.  With a raspy Cockney English accent, and a sense of humour that's ahead of his time, it's a very memorable performance.  Only Geoffrey Rush as the villain can really stand out with him on board, and Rush turns in his usual fine performance. Orlando Bloom plays the straight good guy role he's fashioned so well in ""Lord of the Rings"", and Keira Knightly is gorgeous and spunky as the girl of his dreams.  Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport are on hand to play the standard British fops.<br/><br/>Never dragging on, there is not a moment wasted here.  They certainly don't make them like this any more."

","In a time where movies of this type had practically disappeared or bombed badly at the box office (Cut Throat Island springs to mind), it is nice to see Hollywood once again embracing this classic genre.<br/><br/>Despite suffering from a mild case of over hype, this is actually a very good movie, mixing in modern day film making with the classic pirate yo ho ho's without getting all lost at sea (Da-Dum!!)<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the lovable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow who along with the dashing Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom, sail the Caribbean Seas to stop a ship of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew, who are trying to break an ancient curse... by using the blood of the Governor's daughter (Knightly)<br/><br/>From the outset the film is light hearted and playful in tone giving it an old fashioned ¬ëboys own adventure' feel without coming across as camp. The set design, locations and costumes are fantastic and really help to set the scene and create the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The story is told well and although getting bottle necked at times, keeps a jaunty pace. There is plenty of swash buckling sword fights and sea bound action, plus some effective if sometimes overused computer driven effects to create the cursed pirates.<br/><br/>All of the main performances are strong. Bloom is fresh faced and as charming as a modern day Douglas Fairbanks (if sometimes too much of a goody goody), Knightly is beautiful and compelling, adding a touch of glamour and Rush is superbly extravagant and plays his part with a good sense of fun.<br/><br/>
However all are very nearly played off the screen by Depp as Sparrow, a fantastic character who is swaggered, eccentrically unrefined, wiley, self-promoting and loveably roguish. This is one of Depp's more funny and notable performances making the film worth watching for him alone.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that we will see more of Captain Sparrow in the future and I will look forward to it as POTC was head and shoulders above the rest in a summer of disappointing blockbusters."

","Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl - The movie is as aimless as the tittle. Pirates attack a settlement known as Port Royal and capture the town's governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), as they believe that she is the one who can remove a curse set upon them. They lug her aboard the Black Pearl, their ominous sailing ship. In a prison in a battered garrison in Port Royal, William Turner (Orlando Bloom) makes arrangements to free Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), A captive, and some-what idiotic pirate, in exchange for his aid to rescue Miss Elizabeth Swann, the woman who William is madly in love with. Along the way, there are many sword fights, but as this movie is a pirate one, viewers will expect a major death. Sadly there are none. Most of the time it miraculously stops or those cursed pirates never die, because they're practically undead. Many of the fights are absolutely retarded and pointless, with no purpose what so ever, except just to allow this movie to be classified under a pirate theme. The director, Gore Verbinski, made a horrific effort to add suspense, and about the only scary thing in the film is a cursed monkey!<br/><br/>The characters, although interesting at first impression, soon get boring and ridiculous! Jack Sparrow has a major speech impediment, always looks like he's drunk 24/7 and seems to have hands that don't look connected to his wrists! His opening scene where viewers first catch a gimps of Jack was quite comical, but his later acts were plain, foolish. It's impossible to believe that such a pirate could even be conceived! The actor Johnny Depp played a magnificent part, but it's Disney's lack in concept to produce a more credible character, which unfortunately destroyed the feel of a real pirate film. The character William Turner was an even bigger let down. His jokes are dry to the bone, at best they my cause a chuckle. His character's desires are typical of what modern movies are about. All of this was made worst with the selection of actor to play the role. Orlando Bloom's parts in the film were particularly weak and lacking in emphasis, as you felt that Jack Sparrow was more important then the less adventurous blacksmith Will.<br/><br/>The few good things about, The Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl are the tunes and the CGI effects. These are the only factors that keep the viewer from going to sleep! The music is on the dot, particularly when you see beautiful long shots of the surroundings. You'll get butterflies in you stomach, similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, when you witness the sight of the Computer Generated Images! Since the cursed pirates can only take the undead form in certain conditions, the lighting, and shadow effects make these images top-notch.<br/><br/>This film is better of to just have CGI pirates walking around, raiding random ships, then to have poorly thought of characters, residing in the picture. There is too much that has been added to the film, and the mambo-jumbo comedy, action, thriller, love story, adventure theme is just a missive clich√© of genres. The attempt made by Disney to have a classical family movie was a disastrous shamble! Millions of dollars have been wasted, down drain on actors who don't even suit the characters. I strongly recommend no one see this monstrous movie, as viewers would also be throwing away their money down the drain."

","There's a slew of classic films that haven't made it into the IMDb top 250, but at the time of writing, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has achieved a comfortable place among the best films of all time - presumably because Kiera Knightley is hot and Johnny Depp is funny, right? I mean, I can't think of any sensible reason.<br/><br/>Truth is, this is a fun little potboiler that is way too long (people complain that Harry Potter is padded?) and completely lacking in anything resembling drama. The script has the same cringe-inducing qualities as the average Hollywood blockbuster, including the Mandatory Irksome Catchphrase that is continuously spouted by characters even though it wasn't funny the first time (""they're not rules...more like guidelines!""). If Depp didn't spend the whole movie wobbling and acted brain-fried, viewers would all be bored to tears.<br/><br/>I must confess that the sets and costumes are impressive, and I enjoyed seeing the spectral pirates marching to attack the ship. I can see liking this movie - I can even see loving it - but a classic? I think everybody gave ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" an ""8"" because it's a crowd-pleaser, and somehow that's enabled it to rise way above where it ought to be in the rankings, which is definitely somewhere below ""The French Connection.""<br/><br/>P.S. Forgive a quick aside about Roger Ebert. I like his reviews of classic movies, but he seems out-of-touch when commenting on recent ones; he thinks ""Van Helsing"" is better than ""Spider-Man,"" for example, and he labels the third Harry Potter the weakest in the series. Most bizarrely of all, he argues that Kiera Knightley is not attractive in this movie. Does anyone, in the entire Universe, agree with that assessment?"

","Without Johnny Depp, this basically animatronic mess would have been ignored by anyone with half a brain.  But the general reactions to it underscore one aspect in particular:  popular films, whether truly good or truly bad, have lately demonstrated that a large component of the viewing audience haven't a clue about what constitutes good cinematic art.<br/><br/>While many of us of a certain age look at movies as an extension of dramatic art moving forward in time from Aristophanes to Arthur Miller, just as many if not more of us seem to evaluate them based primarily on the sort of criteria usually reserved for rating computer games and cartoons. Literature and history be damned; if it ain't got visual sparks, it ain't no good.<br/><br/>I did manage to stay awake through this one, wondering from time to time what the hell I was doing it for.

","This is one of those movies you hate to pan, everyone on screen seems to be trying so hard to make something out of the material. Sometimes, even the best efforts can't rescue a plot thinner than the skins of the villains. And therein lies the problem. All the special effects, all the fencing, and ship to ship fighting, can't rescue this film. Given the lack of a story worth hanging a hat on, Johnny Depp does his best to give the film a center, but he is undercut. On one side is Geoffrey Rush chewing scenery faster than it can be built. I keep hoping to see him in a role that requires some subtlety, because I believe he is capable of greater things than anything I've seen him in recently. On the other side are Orlando Bloom and Kira Sedgewick gamely trying to give the film some romance. If only they were given some material to work with. At best, this film is a good way to spend a couple of hours where the alternative is banging your head against the wall."

Perhaps I should not have expected more, given that it's just a Disney SFX vehicle with a bankable lead, but I thought this fell far short of the hype. The apparent premise that some of them were dead and cursed to go on and on ... it seemed to change somehow toward the end, as if no one was sure what the rules really were. <br/><br/>It's set up of course for a seQuel, probably even lamer than this one.

"Quinoa1984","7","4","8","16 July 2003"," An entertaining jumbalaya of a pirate movie
","Two reasons to see Curse of the Black Pearl (and I'm speaking more to adults, kids will see just about anything they can get into admission-wise) are the effects done on the crew of the Black Pearl, and two performances amongst those that were OK but nothing special- Geoffrey Rush as the taut, creepy captain of the Black Pearl, and especially Johnny Depp as the somewhat unconventional captain Jack Sparrow. On this site it's said that Depp patterned his character's moves and voice after Keith Richards, which I can see, however my first impression watching him was that he was basically playing Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in a pirates cap and with gold fronts. This is indeed an original turn for Depp, even if we've seen him do something like this before, and it helps when a persona is this fresh in a story that counts the numbers a bit too often.<br/><br/>Curse tells of a governor's daughter, Elizabeth, who is on the verge of being married to an uptight British officer, despite to pining of blacksmith Will Turner (LOTR's Orlando Bloom). When she is kidnapped by a looting band of pirates one night, he enlists the help of imprisoned Jack Sparrow to find her and the Black Pearl. But when the curse is revealed to Elizabeth that's when things get suspenseful (to a degree). <br/><br/>One thing that makes this a worthwhile time for the kids is that it's the first PG-13 film from the Disney people, and though it might have fared a higher calling if it was under a different studio with an R rating, it can give them a chance to see some scenes parents may find a little risqu√©. For instance, at one point Jack and Elizabeth are stranded on an island (which is all I'll say as to not spoil it), and he finds a stash of rum in a hiding place, and then the two get hammered under the moonlight. Another instance is when the curse is first revealed, once again under the moonlight, and this can be a perfect introduction to the magic of zombies. <br/><br/>The action scenes, however, are the weakest scenes of the film, which is a let-down since there's some good choreography in the swordplay, but there's just something about the way they go on that doesn't catch the viewer in (at least me) like how other action scenes this summer have. By the end of 'Curse', the audience can see it's nowhere near greatness, but as popcorn fodder it is a pick of the moment. B-"
"MovieAddict2016","6","6","14","3 April 2006"," A fun movie with a great performance by Depp
","(Note: this review is from 2003.) In its fullest, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Curl"" succeeds as entertainment. It is one of the great adventure films of this year, jam-packed with chills and thrills. It's a rousing swashbuckler with a great cast and a great story. But, ranking in at 143 minutes, it goes overboard on scenes a few times. Just a few.<br/><br/>When ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" first opened, my Website was bombarded with desperate letters from frenzied fans of the film, all asking me to post a script for the film. It is perhaps the most requested script I've ever had people write to me about. It's amazing what an impact a film such as this can have.<br/><br/>It stars Johnny Depp in the lead role as the infamous pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, the worst pirate the film's Good Bad Guy has ever heard of. ""Ah, but you have heard of me,"" Jack says. Jack used to be the captain of a deadly ship named the Black Pearl, before a mutiny took place at the command of Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), who left Jack for dead on an island where he drank rum for three days and got a permanent case of sea daze.<br/><br/>But Jack survived, and now with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), he will track down Barbosa and claim his ship back. Will is not in it for the ship, however, but rather for the young girl, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbosa in hopes of removing a curse put upon him and his crew after they removed gold coins from a cursed treasure chest. By the moon of the light, Barbosa and his idiot crew turn into skeletons. They cannot die, they cannot feel pleasure. They are ""cursed pirates."" First, they must restore all of the golden coins to the treasure chest, then pour the blood of a Turner over the stash of treasure. Captain Barbosa thinks that Elizabeth is the late Bootstrap Bill Turner's daughter, but he never had one -- his single child was a boy, and the boy is Will, who is coming to save Elizabeth from a doom that he himself should be facing more than anyone.<br/><br/>Confused? Don't be. When you watch the movie it will all make sense, because it just does.<br/><br/>The main element that carries along ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" well past its expiration date is the casting of Johnny Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow. In a constant drunken stupor and with a splendidly funny rough British accent, Depp has finally hit payday in a mainstream motion picture. He's been cast in cult favorites over the years, specifically those directed by Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Ed Wood""), but he's been around since ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Platoon."" He hasn't exactly gotten major recognition over the years, and though movie buffs know him by name, mainstream filmgoers probably wouldn't recognize him at first. Not now, however. Now everyone's jumping on the bandwagon. Depp, at forty, has finally gotten a mainstream break.<br/><br/>Also helping the film is Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa. He's a dastardly villain with bad teeth and, we can only assume, bad breath. He's good at being a bad guy, but because the film is rated PG-13, a big step forward for Disney, he isn't allowed to be quite as vicious as he probably would be. And, I can only assume, the rating prohibits him from taking advantage of poor Elizabeth while she is held captive aboard his ship....<br/><br/>The movie's score is by Klaus Badelt, who has been getting his big break lately with films such as ""The Recruit."" It's a good score that fits the film's tone of pirates. Pirates are everywhere in this film, and at one point a character remarks that it's good to be a pirate, or something like that. I just wonder: If that's true, why does Disney prohibit pirating of its films? Har, har.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is one of the better entertainments of the year, helped primarily because of a great cast and witty script. But the character that will stay in your head long after this is over, more than any other character in the film (including Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's father, who I have not mentioned before now and I think I should have), is Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. He's going to go down in the books as one of those famous film heroes. And what saves him from becoming another gung-ho hero is what helped Harrison Ford make Indiana Jones so likable: He's an apprehensive and cautious hero with wit and loads of dry humor and funny one-liners to spare. He's not the type of hero who is necessarily always looking out for the best because he wants to save the world, but rather because he knows it's sort of his duty to do so. And he does so with apprehension. It's a key to making a great screen hero, and Johnny Depp succeeds where I can only assume most modern action heroes would fail.<br/><br/>Let's just hope the rumored, upcoming back-to-back sequels don't sink to Davy Jones' Locker, eh?"

However, there was no black eye patch, no peg leg, no hanging from a yard arm, no pieces of eight or dubloons, and its common knowledge that planks were always walked blindfolded which was a big part of pirate fun.

","Pirates of the Caribbean is a film based on a Disney theme-park ride.<br/><br/>This over-long bore-fest is full to the gunnels with swashbuckling and other pirate-based antics. We have Johnny Depp putting in a very Deppy performance indeed, which is no doubt terrific for those who like that kind of thing. In this one he played a pirate in the style of Keith Richards. I personally would have much preferred it if he had did it in the vein of Bill Wyman instead. Wyman's famously slightly tedious personality would have fit this movie quite a bit better and would have been at least a little more amusing, with Captain Jack Sparrow spending a good portion of the film waxing lyrically about subjects as disinteresting as the differences between different types of wood or the differences between different types of flags. It would have been tiresome to watch I suppose but much less intolerable than Depp's irritating Rolling Stones pirate. Generally speaking, the story-line to this one was so tedious that I can't remember it very well at all and am not motivated enough to read the synopsis to remind myself. It seemed to incorporate zombies though, which on the face of it was an okay idea but there also seemed to be a lot of other bits involving people swing on ropes and running around, which I found increasingly more unacceptable as the film progressed. This wasn't for me I suppose, I preferred Captain Pugwash a lot more."

","What an incredible, dashing, romantic and fun-filled adventure was the unexpectedly good film ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"". Johnny Depp's performance is universally extolled and rightfully so however for me the tour de force performance was that of Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. Rush morphed into an 18th century pirate from the golden-age of piracy and for me his performance is the gold standard for portraying a pirate. Good performances abound in the first installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean series (it should have been the first and last but greedy studio executives had to soil a good thing for a buck) it wasn't merely the Depp and Rush performances there was also the performance of lovely and delightful femme fatale Elizabeth Swann (aka. Keira Knightly), the noble and proud Norrington (Jack Davenport), the amusing but sinister Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and many other convincing performances as well. It simply is the epitome of movie entertainment, it's a movie worthy of the price of admission!"

","I've always liked this movie. It's lighthearted and grand all at once, with an iconic character and performance at its center that still feels wholly fresh and original despite the overbearing nature of the character in subsequent films. And his introduction is so good; iconic even.<br/><br/>Despite the presence of Jack Sparrow, it's Elizabeth Swann that's the true protagonist here (and the first 3 films). She's solid, and so is Keira's performance, and it allows the strangeness of the story to creep in from the margins without overwhelming the main narrative. The romance with Will Turner is definitely the weakest aspect of the movie, but it doesn't detract from the fun of the story and it's certainly necessary for the film to work as a whole.<br/><br/>I love the throwback to the era of sword fights and battles with cannons on pirate ships. When I think of adventure, I always look to this movie. The rousing score definitely helps, but also the open ocean and the tropical locations. They really make the best use of the blue waters and palm trees. <br/><br/>Romance, daring escapes, backstabbing, ancient curses, comedic bumbling; it's all here, with great production values and a sharp eye for the visual witticism."
"scott-1429","6","2","3","22 July 2006"," Special Effects: 10, Storyline: 2
","I am a HUGE fan of both Depp and the original Pirates. Naturally I went into this movie with a bit of skepticism as I do with ANY sequel. My daughter (15) had seen it twice and raved about it. So my 13 year old son and I went today. As we walked out, he said EXACTLY what was going thru my head: ""I was kind of bored"". Me, too.<br/><br/>Special effects do not a movie make any more. We've come to expect that. Something that NEVER changes, though, is the critical element of a strong plot, something that ""Dead Man's Chest"" lacks. As near as my son and I could figure, the whole plot line was that everyone wanted Davy Jones' heart to control the seas. Yawn. The rest was a showcase for some admittedly fantastic special effects.<br/><br/>Another gripe I had with this movie, as I do with many nowdays, is that the trend towards such utterly authentic dialogue almost makes much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Okay, maybe it's because I'm ""old"" (51) and my hearing sucks. But the dialects used by Naomi Harris (Tia Dalma) as well as the usual cast of ragamuffin sailors, was often impossible to understand. I love the realism; I hate the fact that I missed so much of the dialogue.<br/><br/>It's hard - almost impossible - for a sequel to live up to the expectations of an original. Only a very few (""Aliens"" for example) can come close or achieve it. In my opinion, and my son's, ""Dead Man's Chest"" fell a bit short. Am I glad I saw it? Absolutely. I was moderately entertained. Would I see it again or buy it on DVD? Absolutely not."

It was strictly about the everyday lives of a group of pirates, and had no extraordinary plot elements. Instead of being a movie, it should have been made a sitcom. At least sitcoms ARE generally about the everyday lives of a person or group of people. Movies should have something more. <br/><br/>Secondly, this was one of the most monotonous movies I have ever seen. Most of the hour that I watched was the same dialogue, paraphrases over and over: ""I'm a pirate."" ""Are you a pirate?"" ""Is he a pirate?"" Hearing the same word in ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE grew very tiresome after an hour. <br/><br/>Lastly, constantly hearing the word ""pirate"" was only half of the problem with the dialogue.

","-Spoiler Warning-
For centuries, stories of pirate adventures and exploits have captivated people.
Legends of pirates like Black Beard are still known to this day. Disney's 2003 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl directed by Gore Verbinski embodies this captivation in a movie that is guaranteed to entertain a wide audience.
The first successful element of Pirates of the Caribbean is the engaging and consistent plot. The movie takes place during the mid 1700s in the Caribbean. A group of pirates is cursed and turned into undead skeletons. They require the blood of the child of a crewmember they killed to break the curse. Initially, they capture Elizabeth Swan (played by Keira Knightly) mistakenly thinking her blood can break the curse. The legendary pirate, Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) is recruited by the underdog hero, William Turner (played by Orlando Bloom) to rescue Elizabeth Swan. Jack Sparrow was the previous captain of the pirates and hopes to reclaim the ship by using William Turner, the child of the crewmember they needed, to break their curse. They save Elizabeth Swan but are followed by the Royal Navy who start fighting with the cursed pirates. While they are fighting, William Turner breaks the pirates curse and the Royal Navy is able to kill the pirates. After the battle, Jack Sparrow reclaims his ship and continues a life of piracy.
Another outstanding aspect of Pirates of the Caribbean is it's script. The
dialect and phrases spoken help establish the setting in the 1700s and make the movie seem authentic and realistic. Conversations like the one between William Turner and Jack Sparrow when William convinces Jack to save Elizabeth are important to the continuity of the film and support the plot. The script also realistically conveys the motivations of the characters. It is made apparent there is a love interest between William and Elizabeth despite their limited interaction and without it being explicitly stated. Because of this it makes sense when William so desperately wants to rescue her.
Settings, costumes and props are all lavishly crafted in Pirates of the
Caribbean. Historically accurate costumes and props, like the soldiers' uniforms and guns, are used to create a very realistic setting. Another successful element in the movie is mixing real props and settings with CGI. Real cannons and ships on the open ocean are seamlessly blended with CGI to make it look like cannons are actually being fired and ships are actually being hit and destroyed.
The motivating and engaging theme is yet another success of this film. Pirates
of the Caribbean is about determining your own destiny and defying expectations. The life of pirates is somewhat glorified through how they have rejected society and paved their own path on the open ocean. More specifically this theme is shown through the experience of the character, William Turner. His father was a pirate and left William at a young age. William grew up to be a blacksmith's apprentice who did all the work but let his master take the credit because it was expected of him. While adventuring with the pirate Jack Sparrow, he realized that as a pirate he could pave his own path and break free of the expectations that burdened him.
One of the few criticisms I have of Pirates of the Caribbean is the use of
clich√©s. While the plot and motivations of the characters are captivating the movie still largely revolves around the saving a damsel in distress clich√©. Another clich√© that this film overly exploited was the comedic pair from Of Mice and Men, George and Lenny, large and skinny, smart and dumb. It is a commonly used clich√© but the problem I have with it in Pirates of the Caribbean is that it is used with two sets of characters. There is a pair of British soldiers and also a pair of pirates that both use this clich√©. Initially the characters are humorous but the clich√© is quickly overused and is no longer enjoyable by the end of the movie.
At face value, Pirates of the Caribbean is an entertaining adventure story with
action and suspense. If you look deeper, you will find that it is also a movie with a complex plot and motivating themes of defying expectations and determining your own destiny. It has become a classic movie that will continue to be enjoyed by a wide audience for countless years after its release."

My mother and 19 y.o. sister moderately enjoyed it (or may be just thought it would get better), but after less than two hours said they will watch it sometime later (read 'never') and stopped it.<br/><br/>Well, my impression was that the movie was pretty stupid and cliche. May be not the worst script, but nothing to write home about. The acting was either over the top (Johnny Depp) or bland and boring (everyone else). There might have been some brilliant special effects that I missed on the cam-copy, but I doubt it. There was hardly any sea worth looking at, and everything else was taken out of the Hollywood library of generic effects.<br/><br/>If you have nothing better to do, see it on the big screen, may be it will look cool (it probably won't). Don't pay much for the tickets, though."

","Well, I have to say, this movie was such an exciting experience!!!!! I rented this one stormy night on DVD and boy, this movie was so exciting!!!!! This movie, of course, is based on the theme park ride at Disneyland and Disney World. I liked all the action and stuff in there; it was awesome!!!!! I especially liked the bonus features, too: there were the bloopers (""Is that a plane?????"" - Johnny Depp heard a small jet rocket by the ship), and of course, the excerpt from ""Walt Disney Presents,"" which I actually remembered seeing on the old Disney Channel one night in 1998.<br/><br/>Buuuuuut, there is a problem. (OH NO!!!!! is right!!!!!)<br/><br/>This is a ""BAD PERIOD"" movie!!!!! That's right, for one, this movie totally changed the way we go to the parks now!!!!! The ride was changed to make it look like the movie now, and even worse, there are rumors that the Tom Sawyer ride at Disneyland will go away with - get this - a new ride based on this film!!!!! Plus, the worst part????? IT'S RATED PG-13!!!!! Yes, you heard right!!!!! A ""Disney"" movie, given such a controversial rating so that families can't see this or any other movie in this series because it's too scary!!!!! So basically, Disney now robs of its usual audience in the ""Bad Period.""<br/><br/>""PIRATE DVDS OF THE EAST: THE CURSE OF THE MPAA'S FOCUS"" is a film that, while it appeals to us adults, JUST DOES NOT APPEAL TO CHILDREN!!!!!

","Lots of action but overly long. Could have been cut by a half hour very easily. Some interesting special effects but the characters are difficult to relate to or really care about. Sheer fantasy that might appeal to those who want some mindless escapism. There are better films to spend your 140 minutes on. The special effects seem to be derivative of other modern action or horror films like Matrix and The Mummy. Most of the acting in this film is rather wooden and the actors seem to be just going through the motions, hoping it will soon end. But it doesn't. It just keeps going on and on and on. The musical score is the best part of the film. It is hard to believe they are making a sequel to this movie, but money talks. It was obviously a big hit and must have brought in a ton of money at the box office. I will take a rain check on the next installment."

","I never believed I was going to enjoy CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL as I stuck it in the DVD player . After all it was produced by Jerry Brukheimer who's only real critically acclaimed film BLACK HAWK DOWN is down more to director Ridley Scott rather than producer Bruckheimer and let's not forget he also produced Armageddon and PEARL HARBOR two of the most obscene wastes of money Hollywood has come up with in recent years . In fact I would have paid good money NOT to have seen either of these films <br/><br/>The production team seem to have taken a leaf out of the Peter Jackson book of film making by casting hunks as heroes with Shakespearian trained actors in the supporting roles . The cast are very good . Johhny Depp was atrocious as an English police inspector in FROM HELL but here as Jack Sparrow his camp English accent is entirely in keeping with the tone of the film . It also makes good business sense too , just think of the amount of 20 something woman who'll go to watch Depp play a swashbuckling rogue . Same with Orlando Bloom who's incredibly popular with a teenage girl audience . Keira Knightley ? Yeah she's really fit but like these other much hyped English Roses such as Julia Ormand in LEGENDS OF THE FALL and Kate Winslett in TITANIC I doubt if she'll be a household name many years from now , she is good as the ballsy heroine in this though . The always under rated Jonathon Pryce is slightly disappointing probably because like so many great stage actors he's not very good with camp humour . By an ironic contrast Geoffry Rush gives the best performance as the villain , a performance that may see him get an Oscar nod as best supporting actor <br/><br/>There does seem to be a lot of debate as to how well this film will do at the Oscars . I very much doubt if it'll be up for best picture or director ( It is a fantasy film and this genre is always over looked by the academy ) but it does deserve a handful of technical award nominations in the fields of cinematography , editing , sound , costume design and special effects . Unfortunately it's going to be up against RETURN OF THE KING and MASTER AND COMMANDER which means a probable empty treasure chest for these pirates which is a pity <br/><br/>***** SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>No review of mine is complete without a few grumpy complaints so here they are : Once again the Brits are shown to be stupid and incompetent but that's Hollywood for you , while there's a serious plot hole at the end where it's revealed that Jack Sparrow has been suffering from the curse all along so how did he manage to stay out of the moonlight without anyone noticing his skeletal state ? And how did he manage to get drunk on rum ?<br/><br/>But no matter I liked this movie and I thought I'd I never say this but I hope to see the words "" Produced by Jerry Brukheimer "" a lot more in the future<br/><br/>Update - Sorrymy mistake .

"triple8","8","4","9","29 July 2006"," Originally a skeptic, it got to me! A mighty fun adventure!
","SPOILERS THROUGH:<br/><br/>Well believe it or not I just saw this movie! Up till now I had no desire to see it. I'm not a particular fan of pirate movies and not a big fan of action/adventure type flicks(though that's been changing a bit in the last few years.) But I have to admit I have been curious. So many people I know have seen it and told me I am really missing out on something special. So I did indeed see it this week. And the movie got me! I thought it was excellent.<br/><br/>As has been mentioned, the best part of the movie is Johnny Depp. Now I'm not exactly a huge Depp fan. I appreciate him and do think he's an amazing actor but have never taken to him as strongly as some other actors. But I have to say, his portrayal of Jack Sparrow was brilliant and easily the best role I've ever seen him in. Depp takes this role and Creates an unforgettable history making movie character. His Sparow is fun, funny, mischievous, lovable and quirky. He definitely made The movie for me.<br/><br/>And the cinematography is fantastic. The movie rippled with adventure and drew the viewer in immediately. The campy fun atmosphere was perfect as was the larger then life quality. If one's ever been on the famous pirate ride, they will find things they recognize about it too. And Bloom was very good as was Kneightly as the fiery pirate loving Elizabeth. Perfect casting.<br/><br/>The movie may have been a little long for me and I won't say there weren't a few draggy moments but by and large this was a wonderful adventurous ride and I really felt bad I didn't see it when I originally came out though I'm not sure I'd have appreciated it as much then, if I had. As mentioned, I had been gradually getting more into these type of flicks and I think the more appreciation one has for the action/Adventure film the more they will appreciate this though it is the type of film one can enjoy without necessarily being a major fan of pirates and sword fighting. The reason that is so, is because, simply put, these characters are fun and different as is the movie and there are moments of pure exhilaration. That's something that a good adventure movie needs(actually almost any type of movie) and Pirates has it. It is so utterly unique it isn't surprising to me now that it has received so much recognition though I admit I didn't get it before I saw it.<br/><br/>Not that there were not some negatives. The biggest one is the length of some of the sword fighting scenes. Some of them I thought, just went on an unbearably long time, particularly the one toward the end. It did get to the point where it really became a little numbing and unless one is terribly into the sword fighting element I think a lot of people might feel that way. I'm not sure how long the last sequence was but it seemed like hours. I wish that had been a bit shorter. One scene I loved though, was the fight between Depp and Bloom in the beginning. That was excellent and one of my favorite scenes.<br/><br/>So....I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and can't wait to see Pirates two which I will be doing very soon. I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it and maybe Skeptical. It's a mighty fine time!!!!"
"Boardbreaker03","10","4","9","15 April 2004"," This was an okay movie.
","I must admit, this movie was pretty good. But, the ending was cheesy. As Stephen King once said, ""You can have a really good storyline, but it isn't as good as it could be because of the ending. After all, it's the ending that matters most in a story. Without something special to wrap it up, the story is worthless."" With Pirates of the Caribbean, the storyboard directors should have been more choosy about what makes it in the movie. The ending of Pirates of the Caribbean makes it seem like the entire plot is a whole big love story, even though romance was shown very little throughout the film. Though, the hanging scene was good, the ""As is mine"" part wasn't necessary. Jack could've just thanked will and went on his way. And After Elizabeth's dream and before Johnny comes in, it was rather boring. I mean who CARES about Will and Elizabeth. It's setting up for a romance movie, when the movie should make the audience focus on the cursed pirates and Captain Jack, which is after all the focus of the movie. They could've just shown the part where Elizabeth puts on the necklace, then opens the window showing Port Royal. Then, the next part could be when Jack comes in on the boat. It would have kept the pirate theme alive, while still showing the movie from Elizabeth's point of view. There was a lot of action in this movie, so it should have ended shortly after a part with a lot of action. After the pirates become cursed no longer, they could've had Jack become captain, once again, and end the movie there. It would have made the people leaving the theater, thinking thet just came back from a really good pirate movie. Instead, they just remember the final part, so they leave thinking, ""That had a really good love story in it."" COMPLETELY forgetting about Will and Captain Jack's huge sword fight and the climax of the 3rd act. The movie was overall good, but I would've tweaked it a bit to make it perfect."

One of the major problems with this movie was that it was so unrealistic that it ruined the whole movie. The real pirates were nothing like the pirates in this fake piece of trash. I would rather watch my finger nails grow than watch this stupid movie again. If your into the fake stupid pirate movies than I would recommend this movie, but if you like movies that are realistic than avoid at all costs.

Just an average Disney story, a well known, good looking actor and a huge marketing hype, so that even all the movie critics and the Oscar jury believe that it is a good move doesn't make it good. If it's not entertaining or contains a great, unusual idea, it could at least have contained some serious message, but of course also didn't - so I just don't get it why everyone likes it.<br/><br/>At least I got most of my money back, but I still hope that some day there will be a real movie using the Monkey Island Plot.<br/><br/>What I've learned: Never buy a DVD (at least not for full price) just because everyone says it's great."

","That's not exactly true of this overblown, over-budgeted, over-long, and over-praised piece of garbage. I've seen plenty of things that were worse. But this movie, which is somehow at the time of this writing on IMDb's Top 250 page, was something I greatly anticipated seeing in theaters.<br/><br/>But I, like so many other fans of genuine cinema, was deceived and betrayed. That is because this movie is just another in a *huge* line of recent (dating back to the '80s) films that favor massive amounts of special effects, action, and star power over any semblance of substance. The special effects are good at certain parts (I like the curse reveal), but you can tell they sucked up *far* too much money. And the action is well-conceived, but a two-year-old could execute it a darn sight better. And star power? Don't get me started-- it's sad to think that Johnny Depp has ever been considered as being in that category. He has no talent, no taste, and no respect for either himself or his audience. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have potential-- but it all goes seeping out of their heads from just being around Depp (watch the movie; I think you can see the leaks!)<br/><br/>While not wholly poisonous, this dim and dull ""blockbuster"" is pretty terrible. This is another high-profile example of the recent cheapening of the American cinema."
"CrassActionHero","5","3","6","1 December 2006"," Johnny Depp is Awesome, Pirates is Not
","Pirates of the Caribbean is a huge movie. However, quite a disappointment. Pirates starts off right. The first appearance of Jack sparrow is quite funny and effective. Johnny Depp is wonderful as Sparrow. His performance is top notch as the dubious and ragged pirate. The story is unconvincing. I truly never understood the curse at all.<br/><br/>Pirates does have some excellent sword combat. We see one between Sparrow and Turner(Orlando bloom)does quite well. The dialog here is mostly lame. It would have been better with good dialog or if these two just fought without saying a word. Some later combat is just lame. Your opponent is a undead monster that can't be stopped by your sword. If the two were living, then the combat would be much more satisfying. The sword combat does suffer from being repetitive as well.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp aside, the acting here is okay. Nothing breathtaking. Keira Knightly is great eye candy, but seems like wasted talent here. Orlando Bloom is not bad, just over-acts his role. Keep it simple kid. There are many others but the only other one worth mentioning is Geoffory Rush. He has one line in this movie that is just juicy. Every time I hear it, it just rules.<br/><br/>The Special FX are amazing. Convoluted story aside, the skeletal pirates are dazzling to just look at. Never has the undead looked this good. Most of the comedy does not work well here. There are exceptions to that though. Example, Jack Sparrow, no matter the situation always gets annoyed when he is not referred to as ""Captian"". Another is The Black Pearl is getting damaged during a sea battle and during all the danger, Jack shouts out: ""Stop putting holes in my ship!"". Depp is good like I say.<br/><br/>Pirates also suffers from overstaying it's welcome. It's just too long of a movie. Also, one sequence of scenes that should have been immediately sent to the cutting room floor are the scenes with the Govener dealing with a severed hand. Useless and plain annoying. I did not much care for the pirate with the fake eye either.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Pirates, not a terrible movie is not engaging enough either. There are some high marks and lows. To many characters and a difficult story. Depp is the best. Jack Sparrow is very likable. Pirates just could have been a much better movie. **1/2/*****"
"grant-210","2","3","6","22 October 2006"," Overrated and boring
","I cant believe how highly this film and Johnny Depp are rated. I thought that Johnnny Depp as a pirate was about as believable as Tom and Jerry. He minced on to the screen looking like a young girl who was blacked up and given a false moustache and beard. His accent although better than Dick van Dykes effort in Mary Poppins was unconvincing, and the character was lame, effeminate and generally rather laughable.

"the-evil-cult","2","3","6","13 July 2006"," Many Enjoyed it But You May Not
","I watched this movie with some friends at the cinemas a long time ago and I'm reviewing it now because ads on TV about the sequel jogged my memory. I can see now that Curse of the Black Pearl is very popular among IMDb members, especially among females and young people. If you are a young female you are much more likely to think you enjoyed this movie than if you are an old man. That's what the demographic breakup statistics say. I remember being very disappointed with this film and one reason why I was disappointed was because it was so long. I remembered getting up at the end of the film and because the film was so long my butt was aching as if someone had jabbed a needle in it. I am not averse to long movies but this one in particular was just not at all entertaining. The first reason for this lack of entertainment I think is the behavior of the characters. Johnny Depp's character is deliberately crazy. If one of my friends were to act like that in real life I would stare at him and after some time I would ask him, ""Man, what is wrong with you?"" In this movie, I am consistent with my behavior and badly wanted to ask Johnny Depp's character what was with the crazy behavior, but of course Depp is just acting and I obviously can't talk to the character through the theater screen, so that just left me feeling frustrated. Most of the movie is filled with humor that I didn't find funny at all, but many in the audience obviously thought it was very funny. As with the Depp character the humor was just crazy and weird, but of course humor is very subjective so it's a matter of taste I suppose.<br/><br/>Another issue I'd like to bring up are the fight scenes, which I thought were very disappointing as well. The reason is because they were very plain. Usually in a fight scene I like to see something coherent. I want the camera to stay and I want the fight participants to engage in intense, suspenseful, but also aesthetically pleasing fights. The fight scenes in this film don't have that elegance. A bunch of people just get together and the camera cuts and shakes as if we're looking at everything from the perspective of a drunk man.<br/><br/>The plot is another sorry part of the movie. That woman (as you can see I'm not good with names) was your typical annoying pretentious woman and at the end when she kisses the guy I actually said out aloud in the theater, ""Oh, please!"" How clich√©d can you get? It's like a fairy tale your parents might read to you as a kid."

","Why do the pirates of the Black Pearl need Will Turner's blood to lift the curse? Easy peezy and this is (not clearly) explained in the film. Because Will's farther, Boot Strap Bill, was sent to Davey Joan's Locker, after the treasure was taken from the casket, therefore he could not appease the cure for the treasure he stole. Therefore, the blood of his siblings must be used to represent him as the pirates return the gold to the casket and appease the curse. Hope that helps in explaining the plot hole, well, that's how I and my mates saw it.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare films I can watch again and again and again, because it is so entertaining!

","A tiresome Walt Disney kiddies movie with appalling dialogue and a Bodger Award for the most dreadful performance by a leading actor in a major movie of all time. Everyone just woodenly and stiffly and badly moves through this movie repeating their dreadful lines with a lack of enthusiasm. Some embarrassment is evident. The storyline is pathetic and boring and dull. The initial action is limp and dull. In fact dull is the key word. Dull and boring and bad and wooden. And how on earth did this ever get filmed. Surely it can't be that hard to make an exciting, interesting and worthy pirate movie in such pleasant locations?

He was better in Lord of the Rings. He's better being silent, elf-like and graceful. <br/><br/>5) Keira Knightley... *shudders*... is better off playing people like Jules in Bend It Like Beckham: half friendly and half bitchy.

","Pirate lovers have been waiting for a movie like this since the days of `Waterworld' and `Cutthroat Island.' Set in Port Royal, an island historically associated with pirates, and based on a Disney world ride, the movie follows Orlando Bloom as a sword smith with a dark past, who enlists the help of famed pirate (Depp) to rescue the object of his affections (Knightly). To go in more detail would take hours because, unfortunately the plot's long-winded and has more twists and turns than one can keep up with in one sitting. Nevertheless, while Pirates veers into the basic formulas and clich√©s of any other pirate movie, it does so with purpose and style, to make a quality ride out of a familiar outing. The movie also has some truly original elements, most notably Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow, a name you'll remember long after you see this movie."

","I'm surprised about the great rating this movie got. It's basically just stereotype and rumination of old themes. It's done in an ok way but there's nothing really special. The effects were up to date as one would expect. And yes, Johnny Depp is a very good actor. But was this movie witty, inventive, creative or... pensive? None. To make it a good movie it should have had some of these qualities. Once the <i>curse</i> is revealed the plot drags on lengthily. Yes, you know right from the start who is at the bottom of it (after all, you don't cast J. D. for nothing). And yes, the 'love' story with the two youngsters and the evil Brit (the villain is British, how new! <b>yawn</b>) is genuinely disingenuous. Don't get me wrong, I always enjoy love stories, this one too, and a young'un that fights for his love is always engaging. But they would have done the actors more justice if they'd missed out on <b>some</b> clich√©s.<br/><br/>I wouldn't watch it twice. As a friend of mine put it 'it's a silly movie'.

","In a summer where most everything has been little more than shark bait, it is refreshing to see a truly enjoyable blockbuster like ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"". A production that is very reminiscent of those old Saturday serials and even more closely the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy that dominated the 1980s, the movie is a dominant success by the time it completes its voyage. It is the mid-1700s and the breathtaking Keira Knightley (who has already made a name for herself this year with ""Bend It Like Beckham"") has been kidnapped by a band of ghostly pirates led by the always dependable Geoffrey Rush. It seems that Knightley possesses a medallion that may bring Rush and his crew back to life. However the medallion is far from one of a kind and it is far from certain if Knightley is even the person they need for their deviant scheme to work. Now it is up to blacksmith Orlando Bloom (who has become an international sensation with ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and outrageous pirate Johnny Depp (in arguably his finest role) to save the day. Knightley's uptight father (Jonathan Pryce) and would-be fiance (Jack Davenport) add well-timed comedic turns in limited action. Director Gore Vabinski (who impressed me verily last year with the atmospheric thriller ""The Ring"") is beginning to show a real knack for handling large productions. Admittedly the film is a little long and suffers from sometimes uninspired writing, but the strong cast and the mind-blowing visual effects are more than enough to make ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" one of the more likable productions of 2003. 4 stars out of 5."
"HCG714","3","3","6","13 July 2003"," ""The Fog meets ""Treasure Island"".
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" has to be one film I'm addding to my ""Worst Films of 2003"" list.<br/><br/>""Pirates"" has to be ""one"" of the oddest, strangest, most over-the-top, far out, blockbuster film's of the summer 2003 lot. For starters, director Verbinski isn't enough of a stylist to pull off the script's delicate balancing act. As he showed with the ""The Mexican"" Verbinski has problems finding just the right tone between humor and adventure. The film is never quite funny enough to make us forget that dramatically it's pretty slim stuff. With is combination of action, comedy, over the top acting, big sets and one-liners this movie couldn't be taken too seriously for an action film and it so far off the map that it couldn't be called a comedy.<br/><br/>For one thing Johnny Depp, who delivers what has to be the strangest lead performance in a $150 million Hollywood production to date, and has to be the only one brave enough to play a gay drunk pirate this side of the Caribbean. Wait until you see what Depp does here. You can't take your eyes off him!! He is funny, crazy and he over takes every single scean he is in. Even Geoffrey Rush is over shadowed by Depps's over the top performance.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush was great in his role as Barbossa, and it shows what a great actor Geoffrey Rush really his; and how multi-talented he really his even when he sells out to crap like ""The Banger Sisters"" or ""pirates"" He can make a really bad role work for him. But it was Depp's film and he ran with it!<br/><br/>Keira Knightley, well not much to say except she is a really bad actress and how many times do we have to set her either wet or getting her clothes ripped off with out once having bad hair or runny make-up?<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom was flat, his character was a cardbaord cut out of every single character out to rescuse the woman he loves and finds himself an adventure.<br/><br/>""Pirates"" was a bad movie, but Depp's over the top performance was the best thing and the only thing besides the over top F/X and interesting story line that keeps this mess afloat!<br/><br/>Yes folks; the story had promise. Real promise. But somewhere between directors Gore Verbinski ideas, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ideas the story somehow merged 2 diffrent out looks with no real mediuem. The whole film felt like ""Treasure Island"" meets ""The Fog""!<br/><br/>With a running time of two hours plus, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" feels terribly flabby, even the over the top battle scenes are so drawn out we start to lose interest.<br/><br/>Depp's odd performance should probably make this film live on as a cult classic and become recognized by film buff's as a bad film that we love.<br/><br/>One word to describe ""Pirates"" is ""BIZZARE""!"

","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN : THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003) ***1/2 Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Jonathyn Pryce, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Damian O' Hare. Rip-roaring adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction (!) about a cursed platoon of pirates haunting the Caribbean in search of gold (and their souls) leading to a final confrontation with the owner of a certain trinket that holds the curse intact. Depp is a marvel of physical shtick and with comic aplomb steals the movie with his unusual choice of vocal (think a particularly cagey Keith Richards) and acrobatic maneuvers from swordplay to flights of fancy. Bloom holds his own as the straight-man like hero out to save the damsel in distress (the fetching Knightley) while battling the raggedly nasty villainous Rush as the captain of the doomed. Fun, fast and a true treat for all audiences that sends-up the genre it clearly embraces and salutes thanks to a witty script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio with Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert; an amazing production design by Brian Morris and skillful direction by Gore Verbinksi."

No one.  I didn't care about any of these people.  In addition, this is a two joke movie: 1) Look mom. The pirates turn into skeletons in the moonlight at least 1567 times.  Isn't that fun?  2) Look mom.  An eyeball has a fork in it and it rolls along the ground and it falls out of that guys face and...Isn't that fun?  Nope.

","Say `Pirate Movie' in a crowded theater and you're likely to be facing a mutiny or a stampede, and for good reason:  the rollicking adventures popularized by Robert Louis Stevenson and brought to life by Errol Flynn have, of late been replaced by overblown soulless drivel along the lines of Polanski's `Pirates' or `Cutthroat Island'.  Jerry Bruckheimer and Johnny Depp to the rescue.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is quite likely the unluckiest pirate alive:  after  having suffered the ignominy of mutiny and being marooned, he finds his way to port in the one town that has a serious hate on for pirates.  If that weren't enough to spoil his already bad day, Sparrow is thrown back into the fray when he promises young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) that he will help rescue Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the young woman kidnapped by  Sparrow's  old enemies.  Oh, and there's that pesky little curse to contend with¬Ö<br/><br/>Let me state from the outset -  this is a fantastic movie that epitomizes what a summer movie should be.  It features  oodles of action ¬ñ both in the form of swashbuckling sword fights and big time explosions, is packed full of accessible humor, boasts great special effects (note: not gratuitous), has beautiful and eerie locations, nasty villains, reformed heroes and fantastic performances.  Am I making it clear that I liked this movie?<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is solidly low key in his first post `Lord of the Rings' outing, and makes good use of the martial skills he leaned while filming the trilogy.  His character is equal parts tragic and noble, and he balances these  the facets well.  While Elizabeth could be rightly classified as the obligatory damsel-in-distress of the piece, she most certainly is not helpless ¬ñ Knightley brings the same determined  empowerment that she displayed in `Bend it Like Beckham'.   You have to give props to any woman who can act and kick butt while bound in a corset and frilly fluffy dresses (and yet somehow manages to look even more beautiful while doing so ¬ñ forgive me, I'm only human¬Ö). Geoffrey Rush is deliciously devilish as Captain Barossa the dark hearted scoundrel of the piece, the, who dispenses death the with a smile.  You know he's bad just by looking at the man's teeth!  And then there's the Depp factor.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp could long ago have been a major Hollywood star ¬ñ he certainly has the charisma, the drive and enough  talent for a few careers ¬ñ however he's made a conscious decision to stick with character driven  films, which are often only found in artsy or  edgy films.  Thankfully  he chose to tackle this role with the same fervor¬ñ Depp is hilarious as John Sparrow, the glib roguish pirate cursed with a streak of goodness and bad luck, who seemingly dances between madness and lucidity.   To say that his portrayal binds the film would not be indulging in hyperbole, as he brings all the elements of the story and the characters together.  Is that all there is you might ask?  Not even close.<br/><br/>
****Okay, I'm going to give you a warning here ¬ñ if  you haven't seen the trailers some potential spoilers lay  ahead****.<br/><br/>
 The CGI work in this films is remarkable on several fronts:  the film does not rely upon them, they are not excessive and they actually enhance the film.  The characters'  transition from human to skeleton and back (there sequences are rapid and many) are amazingly fluid and realistic.  Need more? The swordfighting are beautifully choreographed, the city sets are brilliant, the pyrotechnics in the battle scenes are pure Buckheimer (read: big, loud, and many) and the film is also fit for the youngsters.<br/><br/>If you're in the market for a film that will appeal to anyone between the ages of  5 to 95 , look no further."

This movie was nowhere near the standard of that.

","As everyone here can see, many of the comments about this movie is positive. The Writing was excellent and i can give it a 9/10 for just its writing. There are tricks and twists in this story. Hence, for those who have not vote, watch this movie again and concentrate with their actors and the script. I am sure that, you are going to enjoy this movie for the next round. I think there will be another movie coming out for this, hence i encourage everyone of you to watch it. Although not a classic piece of film-making, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played. The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil. Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie. Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them. Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long. That said, the movie is still surprisingly good and very entertaining."

But the one that really stands out it is good old Johnny D not to mention he's hot but he has a lot of talent. his portrayol of capt. jack sparrow is what makes this such a great movie to watch he's funny charming and witty. my suggestion is to go out and buy the DVD. it has a whole CD of special fetures that are just as good as the film. I rate this movie 9/10. The extras on DVD are fantasticE to get it, it will be WELL worth the money, you will not be disappointed one bit. I have seen it MANY MANY times and I still find it funny, it REALLY is a must see film. The only problem with this movie is Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley. Too much screen time for such unimportant story lines. Pirates should have just been more on Captain Jack Sparrow and less on the sickly love birds. It doesn't add much to the story."

","For some time now I have been putting this movie down because it didn't seem to appealing to me when I first heard about it. Now, I know, I was so wrong to say I didn't want to see it. One reason was because I knew the sequel was on the horizon and that I felt I should see the first in order to get a sense of what Pirates was all about. I loved just about every aspect of this film. The acting was great and the story had so much to tell that I never felt like the film was long just for the sake of being long. Johnny Depp played a great pirate and so did Orlando Bloom, only in the latter part did he really shine though. The story is pretty simple but is an old tale that people of all ages will react to, for some time, as they always have. The effects were not over the top and they were done to a point where I thought I wouldn't care if I could tell the difference between live action and CG. The only thing I felt to be off balance was some of the Disney dumbness, that plagues most Disney movies and was probably put in at the request of Disney to make it more audience friendly. Overall I felt that I saw a movie and not some action flick with no backbone....ie(STORY). When I was finished, the movie gave me a sense of pride I have not had in a long time when I watch film. I have seen something I will never forget."

","OK, here we go... 2 years after initially seeing this movie, it finally hit me. This movie should have been absolutely terrible. It had a mediocre plot, terrible screen writing, Disney (which, at this point in time, if it didn't have Pixar attached, it sucked). The initial character development and interaction was contrived and shallow. <br/><br/>So, why such a wonderful movie?<br/><br/>Because of the people behind it. Everyone talks of Johnny Depp, whom i will agree got robbed of a worthy Oscar that year. He is an excellent actor, whom was hilarious and refreshing in what could have been a clich√© role. But, we cannot forget the ENTIRE cast. Geoffery Rush, once again adding his own ingredient to a meal already been had, played a devilishly enjoyable villain. Orlando Bloom gave us proof that he can, in reality, handle dialog with other characters, and i believe successfully broke the chance of possibly being type casted. Keira Knightly added a visually stunning character, which would have been understood from the beginning. But, she didn't allow her character to fall into such an easy ""no-so-damsel-in-distress"" role, which has been played again and again.<br/><br/>In essence, it was the people involved that made it what it was. While i'm concerned for the sequel, this is truly an adventure classic, with very little clich√©'s, awesome and intriguing characters, beautiful and fluent choreography, awesome set design, and most importantly, a clich√©' and boring plot/script in the hands of true talent, who were able to break it from the Blockbuster purgatory that it was doomed to."

It was a delight from start to finish, and I can't think of anything bad to say about it aside from the fact that it bugs me that Jerry Bruckheimer actually produced something I liked.<br/><br/>Here's the top ten things I loved about this movie:<br/><br/>1) Johnny Depp. A simply amazing, scene-stealing, MOVIE-stealing performance. Pure genius.<br/><br/>2) Restrained use of CGI. It was thrilling to see REAL PEOPLE swinging from the ropes on those ships. And the CGI is effectively employed when it is used, especially during the underwater march of the cursed pirates.<br/><br/>3) Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>4) A great cast. Orlando Bloom doing an amazing impression of a young Errol Flynn and holding his own in scenes with Depp. I look forward to watching this guy's career. Geoffrey Rush doing a great job as the villain and making him almost as fascinating as Depp's Jack Sparrow. And Keira Knightly as a beautiful, smart, believably spunky heroine. Can't wait to see more of her! Uh, I mean, in other movies. Acting. That's what I meant. What did you think I meant? Get your mind out of the gutter. Oh, and Johnny Depp is great, too!<br/><br/>5) Everything you'd expect in a pirate movie, including a talking parrot, a monkey, Spanish gold, a ship battle, a young hero of uncertain lineage, the governor's daughter, walking the plank, ""Avast!"", ""Davey Jones' Locker"", hats with big feathers in them...and yet it NEVER seems cliched.<br/><br/>
6) Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>7) The exhilarating music.<br/><br/>8) A movie without one use of the F-word, not to mention a restrained amount of swearing since this IS a pirate movie. Oh, and no nudity or car chases or buildings exploding. It is summer, isn't it?<br/><br/>9) Amazing fight sequences; the early, acrobatic sword fight between Depp and Bloom, and the ship battle, were stand-outs.<br/><br/>10) Oh, yeah, and Johnny Depp is great! Did I mention that?<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the two recent Mummy films, and I think this one falls into that category of enormously fun, endlessly entertaining adventure flicks. There's nothing profound here, but hey, it's summer, and this movie is great fun. This is one of the few times in my life when I've said this, but God, I hope they do a sequel! 9/10"

I gave this movie a 3 in the vote, and that was for its only redeeming feature, Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.  Without the characterization he gave, this movie had nothing, nothing to hold my interest.<br/><br/>The love story was uninvolving.  The pirates were kind of cool, and the action was decent.  But you know things are going bad when at one point in the movie, you're laughing because the lead actress's lipstick glaringly sticks out considering her circumstances at the time.  Set in colonial times, and lacking access to anything remotely resembling Revlon, I couldn't decide to laugh or groan at such poor makeup, direction, and review.<br/><br/>

","`Shiver me timbers!' <br/><br/>Matey, we have the coolest pirate film of the summer with Gore Verbinski's (`The Ring') `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Jade.' The coolest pirate of all time may be Johnny Depp's (`Chocolat') captain Jack Sparrow, a fey swashbuckler with androgynous mannerisms and a slightly besotted mien possibly from too much wine or just an overactive actor's imagination.  <br/><br/>At any rate, Depp steals the booty and the film in a gracious act of saving the summer from the absence of any unforgettable performance. Verbinski clearly let Depp do what he wanted, and he did. Fortunately, unlike Marlon Brando on the loose, Depp can contain his genius and entertain while still showing formidable talent of the very best in film today.<br/><br/>Inspired by the Disney theme park ride of the same name, `Pirates' tells of Sparrow pursuing the ghost ship Black Jade, run by a real skeleton crew and headed by the sordid Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). They seek to break an ancient curse by kidnapping the luscious Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, `Bend It like Beckham'). Most of this is parody of all the pirate films ever made, right down to the talking parrot on the buccaneer's shoulder, swordfights, treasure coves, and a post-modern pirate's code interpreted as just `guidelines.'  Even Orlando Bloom as Knightley's love interest looks like a young Errol Flynn.  <br/><br/>With over 600 visual effects shots as well, Verbinski succeeds in making a rollicking good story while satirizing the genre at the same time. But at 143 minutes, with several returns to the same locations and a tedious father-daughter tiff, `Pirates' is too long and repetitious.  Without the watchable Depp, it could have been the sunken `Cutthroat Island' of mid-nineties infamy. <br/><br/>The bard as always catches the cavalier spirit: <br/><br/>'Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage, And purchase friends, and give to courtezans, Still revelling like lords till all be gone . . . .'<br/><br/>As it is, in a summer of mediocrity, `Pirates of the Caribbean' is worth seeing for its unpretentious fun for the family, just like Disneyland."

Elizabeth and Will make a boring couple and there is no chemistry between Keira and Orlando.<br/><br/>The story is boring, confusing, twisting into such incomprehensible storyline and dumb scenes, that if you won't sleep yourself to death, then thumb up.<br/><br/>But why did I bother to watch the sequels, when this one I didn't like? Because I happened to watch the sequels first and loved the story of The Dead Man's Chest and the sequel of its storyline in the third movie At World'd End. I completely got into the story without even watching the first one, so it seems.<br/><br/>Meant as introduction this Curse of the Black Pearl is, but there is no introduction at all. You can well meet the characters in the sequels and don't need to be sorry for skipping this one.<br/><br/>Barbossa as the main villain is lame, old, boring and inexpressive, nothing compared what is to come next. He doesn't even have his own soundtrack song, and well, speaking of the OST, there isn't much to say either. <br/><br/>I promise, watching the sequels will make you laugh at sophisticated jokes and hold your breath when the REAL enemy comes.<br/><br/>This Curse of the Black Pearl is nothing more than a fairytale for 10-year-old boys. <br/><br/>The only reason why I've given it 5 stars are for the respect I keep for its two younger brothers."

Keira Knightley fails to fill out her dress, but that's okay because she's cute too. Geoffrey Rush plays another retired rock star, and between him and Depp the movie is nearly watchable.<br/><br/>I stayed awake through this movie the first time. The second time, not so much. The third time, I'm not sure. I intentionally turned it on a fourth time while I was on a trans-Atlantic flight and needed to sleep. The plot is kind of unintelligible, with characters escaping and getting captured and being held in prisons and escaping again every five minutes or so, and no one ever bothers to clear up which ship they're on at any given moment. It's a little too lead-footed to really be swashbuckling.<br/><br/>But anyway, it's got Johnny Depp. He's cool, right? He does stuff in this movie, so that must mean something.

"galensaysyes","2","2","4","2 July 2007"," The big conglomerates have pretty much driven the little guys out of business, you know?...Oh, the movie, right.
","Johnny Depp must work a potent magic on his admirers: by its power he's able to communicate to them, and to them alone, the character he has it in his head that he's portraying. The rest of us have to do a good deal of guessing, since the actor goes only a little way in manifesting his purpose by means of the normal external signs, e.g. facial expressions, body language, tones of voice. Lacking these to go by, I hazard that in this movie he thinks he's impersonating a would-be buccaneer who's generally too drunk, lazy, incompetent, or good-natured to carry off his boasted predations: a role for a W. C. Fields or Wallace Beery, not a performer with the look and the aura of a spoiled altar-boy twenty years past his prime. The star's deficiency might have been compensated for in some measure by intelligent casting of the leading lady; but the one we have here is Keira Knightley, doing her usual, i.e. wanly striking poses for an imaginary photo shoot. The villain, Geoffrey Rush, supplies the color and panache the other two lack; but there's not enough of him to go around. The movie is rather at pains to present itself as a piece of good fun; but for me it was a piece of hard work, all on account of the director (the same one who bumbled up the American ""Ring""). He appears to have one virtue: shooting all the script he has, so that all the pieces are there, as they often are not in films these days. But the pieces are nearly all wrong: in the staging, the perspectives and proportions are so far off what one might imagine in reading the script (or any of its published story-izings) that one almost has to revisualize the movie as it goes to get what it's about. And the script, which is a mishmash at best, is confusing in places. The first scene ends with the pirate ship bearing down on its apparent target...and then what? Pondering this enigma distracted me from subsequent developments for a good hour or so; not that they compelled much interest in themselves. I feel a gallon of ill will toward this movie: as a product for sale, which is all it is (it's a lot farther from being a work of art than the amusement ride that inspired), it's a piece of inferior merchandise, with its seams still unfinished. Yet buyers seemed not to see that. Depp's magic at work again?"

","Pirates is potentially a terrible film rescued solely by the talented cast and crew. The plot is as lame as a wooden legged sailor. The directorial kiss of life is apparent right from the entrance of (not so) Able Seaman Depp with a beautifully crafted and acted introduction to the Keith Richards inspired pirate. As is so oft the case from Hollywood a simply shocking plot never stands in the way of the lure of gold. The pirates in this case are the accountants of tinsel town. Geoffrey Rush hams it up in equal measure with Mr Depp and must wonder whether his digital skeletal pirate is as transparent as the plot. Laughing all the way to the bank is the phrase that springs to mind. Enjoy at your leisure but expect to have sacrificed a few brain cells by the time the credits appear."

","I'd like to ditto everything said above, however I'd like to comment on the ""flaw"". It was explained several times why Turners blood was needed to break the curse. The gold was cursed and the only way to lift the curse is by retuning all the gold to the chest and paying a blood price. and since everybody stole the gold (the pirates) all of them had to pay the blood price, however, Bootstraps couldn't pay it because he was dead at the bottom of the ocean, so his son (who had the same blood as bootstraps) paid it for him, and the curse was lifted.<br/><br/>Now about the movie, i definitely recommend this movie for everyone.

Having enjoyed watching Depp in a romantic role, I was surprised at how smarmy he came off as when he was making his moves. Even though he is an attractive man, he managed to make himself seem, unappealing? Is that even possible? But it was fitting for his character, which is a testament to his talent, as usual.<br/><br/>The plot was interesting, they squoze all the ride scenes in, the effects were REALLY good, and the swordfight scenes are just plain fun to watch.

","I think this film is spectacular because it presents you a new and stronger character: a ship. The Black Pearl inspired me suspense and curiosity. The film gives you the sensation: ""I want to be there"". The backgrounds are great, Johnny Depp has an amazing facility to interpret a drunk pirate ( how strange..., is it a ""casuality""? ). I think Johnny Depp is the best actor in this moment, and I'm so proud to say: ""I love I'm"". I really wish Vanesssa Paradise to disappear... but we are talking about the film, I don't find enough mistakes to say: ""This film is crap"". And if it is, well, I really don't matter, I love this film, I love when Johnny says Elizabeth Swan: ""Easy on the goods, darling"" ( I wish being Elizabeth Swan in that instant ) and finally, I love Johnny Depp. Sorry if I have spelling or writing mistakes, but I'm a thirteen year-old Mexican girl... 10/10"

","""Pirates"" is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever made! Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, Jack Davenport, and of course the esteemed Jonathan Pryce, come together to form the cast of this amazing, sea-faring adventure! 10 years previously, Elizabeth Swann mets Will Turner after he is rescued from a burning ship. Fast forward to the present, and Will Turner is a dashing young man (an unbelievably hot Orlando Bloom), hopelessly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth. But before he can declared his love, Elizabeth is kidnapped by pirates, cursed pirates looking for something that they desperately need. Enter Johnny Depp, the mildly tipsy, rogue-ishly good looking, and always charming Captian Jack Sparrow. He and Will set off to rescue the girl, and thus start an amazing journey full of ghost stories, curses, pirates, and of course, apples. Watch for the scene in the treasure cave, where Jack Sparrow, mildly concussed, attempts to beg for parlay... ""par..parsip...pplla..."""

I think it was smart to stand by Will. I like the part where Jhonny Depp and Orlando Bloom are in his house and they have that sword fight.I think the part where Jack is in the house alone and he puts the hot metal rod to the donkeys butt is very funny.It is so cool where Barboosa drinks that red wine.

","I really liked this movie because it was generally quite fast-paced and kept the viewer interested. There were a few parts in the movie where I can imagine some people would get confused but I think the movie later explains itself. I think the dialogue was good and the acing was excellent. I really liked the character building throughout the movie and I also like the little characters too. I think the scenery was amazing with all the detail which I think plays an important part in any movie but especially this one. I think that this movie is appealing to younger children because of the whole pirate and sword-fighting theme but older people because the more deeper side of the storyline.

The sparring scenes are definitely a plus. I hadn't watched a movie in several years and I'm glad this was my intro back. The good guys are really good and the bad guys really bad but Johnny Depp manages to be both really good and really bad. His character is what every gal dreams of; a bad boy with a good heart.

I was WRONG! Johnny Depp is brilliant, incredibly funny and mmmmmmmmm... Orlando Bloom is brilliant and Keira Knightley is not half bad. The movie was fast paced, had a good storyline and was acted out brilliantly. I loved it!<br/><br/>My only thought now is that I was under the impression that the movie had tied up all it's loose ends at the endings.

","While I absolutely loved this movie, and while I have been a huge fan of Johnny Depp's since ""Benny & Joon"", I must say that toward the end of the movie I found Depp's portrayal a little cloying. Most of his portrayal was GREAT FUN, but toward the end when the Black Pearl and crew arrived at the Isle de la Muerta, his actions and mannerisms got so repetitious that I just wanted the movie to be over. It didn't help when one of the pirates explained his behavior to Orlando Bloom's character.<br/><br/>I read later that Depp said he had based his performance on Keith Richard(s). I've spent time around Keith in the past and, while that ""wavy gravy"" thing he does is indeed one of his mannerisms, he does not go around acting like that every split second. Sorry, Johnny, but your portrayal during the last third of the movie was a little over the top for me.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I eagerly await the second and third installments of ""Pirates"" -- glad to have the blighters back in my life!!!

","Having fond childhood memories of old pirate movies and stories, I was really looking forward to watch this one. I certainly didn't expect some brain challenging epic, but good entertainment. I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Many things may be said of old, classic movies, but one thing is certain, they generally had good scripts. What has happened to good Hollywood scriptwriters? Don't they exist anymore or are they all working for TV at HBO? This film has a potentially good story and a completely pathetic script that results in a plot that most of the time makes no sense whatsoever, with bad dialogue lines, and awkward twists trying to disguise as ""complex turns"". Simple bad writing.<br/><br/>At least they got someone witty to write Captain Jack Sparrow's lines. Without doubt, the one outstanding thing about this movie is Johny Deep's character and his rendition of it. It is very funny and thoroughly enjoyable. Depending how you look at it, Deep's performance is either wasted in this movie, or saves it."
"Fidelio111","4","2","4","23 September 2004"," Overlong, dumb, dull action/adventure for the cognitively challenged.
","In theory, Pirates Of The Caribbean really could have been a good film. What with Johnny Depp playing the campest pirate ever and a young couple at the centre of it who just want to get together were it for those damn undead pirates and the woman's fianc√É¬©e. Such inspired ideas however admirable can not salvage this film. Under the hand of director Gore Verbinski, Pirates Of The Caribbean dispenses with character development, comic timing and structure in favour of constant frantic movement and an eagerness make sure that something is exploding, somebody is falling down a trap or Johnny Depp is eliciting a wisecrack every two seconds. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are hopelessly bland when they should be appealing while the visuals suggest a much cheaper film than its $115 million budget would have you believe. Some critics have noted that Pirates would have benefit from a 45 minute truncation of its running but even in its first quarter of an hour, I found myself getting bored. The script is also weak, with Saturday morning cartoon show level humour and not one inspired moment. The only notable thing about this film is the clever CGI used on the undead pirates and the lenience (and some might say praise) with which critics have graced it.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and see Disney's Peter Pan instead, it's a funnier, more technically groundbreaking, more artistically credible and infinitely more entertaining pirate film than this two and a half hour bore. It'll probably keep your kids more entertained too, not to mention it being more suitable for them."

And besides, pirates are cool!<br/><br/>The best thing about the film is, without a doubt, J. Depp's character: Jack Sparrow (sorry, I mean CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow).

","This is another one of those highly over-popular films like the Lord of the rings trilogy. Of the main cast, the only two actors that I liked were Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp, but the rest, especially the over-pretty girl, all make me cringe. The people that made the film were obviously intending to make a swashbuckling classic, but instead they made a swashbuckling pile of cow diarrhoea. It is insulting in the memory of such real swashbuckling heroes of the cinema, such as Erroll Flynn. If this film had been made in the 1930s it would have been a million times better without a doubt, basically because it would be entirely different. I am going to get murdered by the entire world's population of women for saying this, but Orlando Bloom is nothing but another one of those really annoying pretty-boys, but, to be fair, that is just the opinion of an ugly teenager who has to go into school each week and watch all those bloody pretty-boys snogging whoever they want, while all the girls look at me and in disgust. But in my opinion, being ugly and being well aware of the fact isn't such a bad thing. It makes you wiser. But that has nothing to do with the film that I am reviewing so why the hell am I talking about it? Anyway this film is pointless and overlong and completely pathetic, and I am pretty sure that if pirates knew that this film was going to be made, they would have decided to become regular bank-robbers. 5/10 (I am giving it such a high score for Geoffrey Rush's sake. You rule Geoff.)"

","Johnny Depp is a fine actor. I enjoy him in all his roles, and in fact just finished seeing him (again!) as Don Juan Demarco, an underrated movie where he and Brando interact so well. He also did a fine job here as Captain Jack Sparrow, the pirate without a ship. Keira Knightly is fine as the beautiful maiden in distress. Geoffrey Rush, one of the great and versatile actors of our time, is superb as the evil and wiley nemesis Captain Barbossa. The special effects are very well done, and the cinematography is beautiful. However, both times I have seen it, I was never able to get into the story, the curse, and the pirates who appeared as skeletons under moonlight. It is a good and fun movie, but maybe more for the younger crowd, as my 15-year-old neighbors and my two young grandchildren enjoyed it very much. I don't believe it belongs in the top 250, nor does it warrant the (so far) 34% of '10' votes on the IMDb."

As an adult, I felt a waste of time sitting down and trying to watch this kind of material, even with one of my kids besides me, enjoying it. Saying this, if you take this movie seriously you can point out the following: 1. It lacks of historical accuracy or even the remotest realism (pirates were bandits blessed by the Queen who used to attack Spanish vessels, I guess, or someone told me that). 2. All the characters are caricatures from a comic strip 3. The plot is 0, nil, nought, zero. 3. The formula: Maximum adventure with Minimum suspense (poor Hitch!) 5.

","One name strikes contempt into this reviewers heart: Jerry Bruckheimer<br/><br/>He is to producing what Ron Howard, Peter Weir, and Michael Bay are to directing; a loud, noisy individual with nothing useful to say.  Yet what makes this movie so interesting?  Does that question need to be answered?<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>There are two types of crew to this movie.  There's the crew that plays it straight and there's the crew that either elaborates or plays against the norm.  The directing is dull, Gore Verbinski still hasn't made any impression on me after 'Mouse Hunt', 'Mexican', and 'Ring'.  He's been getting steadily better in his final products though.  Is it accident or serendipity?  The production designer and editors join him as the clueless individuals.<br/><br/>The ones playing against it all are the writers and photographer.  Despite the boring incident that was 'Crimson Tide' (another Bruckheimer effort), Wolski showed talent with 'Crow' and 'Dark City'.  Here he creates what 'Goonies' wanted to be.  The writers come from such notorious work as 'Aladdin', 'Godzilla', 'Small Soldiers', and 'Mask of Zorro', but this shows an actual interest in their work.  Stereotypes are played against (the blood of the virgin doesn't break the curse, Depp's mighty boat, etc.) and Depp makes it work.<br/><br/>If Depp hadn't been on this excursion then it would have been like 'Waterworld'--nothing remarkable, quickly forgotten.  Since Depp knows this material (and is having a lolly-gagging good time with it), he puts a plethora of energy into it.  Everyone else is too busy being serious--similar to Burton's first 'Batman'.<br/><br/>That has me interested enough to want to look into the sequel.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Midrange Material"

","Fun stuff, and I think Depp is definitely the best part about the movie. My major qualm with the film is that it was way too long, this could have been cut down to a 90 minute non-stop adventure movie. But instead it gets a little repetitive and unnecessary at times (fighting the undead?).<br/><br/>
The second major annoyance was that the fight scenes were shot too close. The cinematography was very fast paced and close up (remember Moulin Rouge?), there are really no long drawn out panoramic shots here. This may seem trivial, but I had trouble following the action, it seemed very rushed and inconsistent.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, given the fairly straightforward, cut and paste adventure movie script. With the exception of Depp's eccentricity, the dialogue is mainly to advance the plot instead of develop any interesting characters. Geoffrey Rush overacts as normal but is an entertaining villain. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are at times a bit stale, but otherwise do a decent job with the material.<br/><br/>Overall, Depp is entertaining, and good swashbuckling action is rare these days.

Much of it involved sword fights and plot twists that didn't add much. The plot was like a thread that would be dropped for 10 minutes, then picked up again. Johnny Depp was superb. What a strange character he created. It begged the question, though, of how this goof could have lived more than 20 minutes as a pirate. Finally, and a minor spoiler. if you end up cursed for stealing Cortez's gold, didn't the governor's daughter steal the gold from the unconscious boy? Just wondering.

The images are fairly beautiful making a pleasure for the eye, both static and action ones. The characters are sufficiently typical and convincing and the stereotyped traits of some of them are aimed at making you laugh. And what about the story?

"nurse_ratched","9","2","4","17 August 2003"," I'll drink to this one me hearties!
","At first glance, you can be forgiven for being sceptical about Pirates of the Caribbean. A movie title taken from a slow-moving, Disney theme park ride in a genre in which Hollywood has failed to make any real imprint onto since Errol Flynn's swashbuckling days. On closer inspection, however, Gore Verbinski's latest offering, penned from the writers of Shrek, boasts an impressive cast and a trailer showing just a glimpse of some the amazing CGI special effects that no Summer Blockbuster can do without. So, did Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean 'shiver me timbers' or did it make me want to run off the nearest plank? I am pleased to report that this film more than lives up to the preceding build-up. It looks gorgeous (helped along by the fresh faces of our disgustingly handsome hero, Orlando Bloom and his, 'bonnie lass' Keira Knightley); it has just the right mixture of romance, action and comedy and is a showcase for one of the most mesmerising and innovative performances this year (move over Errol, Mr Depp has landed.) Probably one of the most underrated and the most unconventional actors in Hollywood, Johnny Depp masters the character of Captain Jack Sparrow and creates a half-drunk, half-insane pirate, delivering the gags with almost perfect comic timing and an assortment of hilarious mannerisms. Alongside Depp, Geoffrey Rush plays the villainous Captain Barbossa, doomed to live as a cursed man because of his greed and piracy. Rush ensures that Barbossa is a genuinely creepy character whilst even managing to evoke a degree of sympathy for him as he wanders miserably through life in a desperate struggle to lift his curse.<br/><br/>A script containing every ingredient you would look for in a movie of this genre backs up these superb performances. Without ever taking itself too seriously, Pirates of the Caribbean, embraces all of the old pirate clich√©s, to produce a cracking story, exciting action sequences and enough double-crossing buccaneers to provide one of the most entertaining two and a half hours I have sat through. The CGI special effects create amazing fight scenes as Barbossa and his cursed crew exchange their human bodies for that of ghostly skeletons as they are hit by the glow of the moonlight. All praise goes to the special effects team that created these seamless transformations. Not just a fun Summer Blockbuster but also the movie that has resurrected the swashbuckling genre, Pirates of the Caribbean comes highly recommended. Yo-ho-ho, roll on the sequel!!! 9 out of 10."

"WriterDave","9","2","4","30 July 2003"," A Refreshing Piece of Old Fashioned Swashbucklery
","It's not going to be the best film you see this year, maybe not even this month or this week...but it's refreshing and entertaining all the way through thanks to some smart direction, a clever script, and a delightfully off-kilter performance from the master of such turns, Johnny Depp. Here's the reasons I liked this movie so much:<br/><br/>1. Johnny Depp is a hoot. Jack Sparrow is by far one of the strangest yet most endearing anti-heroes ever to grace the screen. You never know if he is drunk, crazy, or cleverer than you. All of Depp's quirks and mannerisms and line readings keep you constantly off guard and entertained.<br/><br/>2. Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of some of the biggest film travesties ever (""Armageddon,"" ""Pearl Harbor"") actually hired a director who can sustain a shot, control epic scenes, pace a film, and set atmosphere without tricky camera movements or overused special effects (finally a summer movie where the effects aren't wall to wall CGI and actually seem special). By delivering this after ""The Ring"" Gore Verbinksi proves he is the best for-hire/hack director working in Hollywood. He's into the old-fashioned razzle-dazzle type of film-making, you know the kind that doesn't give you a headache and has some scope and where you can actually tell what is going on in big action set pieces. He can do family films (""Mouse Hunt""), horror thrillers (""The Ring""), and now big-budget action adventures. Though he shows no signs of being an auteur or having any kind of grander scheme to his work, I can't wait to see what he tackles next.<br/><br/>3. The film has a bloated run-time (almost two and a half hours) but it's not because it takes itself too seriously or knocks you out with set piece after set piece. You see, for the first thirty to forty minutes this film actually provides exposition and develops characters. What a novel idea! I had almost thought Hollywood forgot how to do that.<br/><br/>4. Last, but certainly not least, Kiera Knightly. She's got spunk, she's hot, has a British accent, and some of the most natural acting chops of any young actress working today.<br/><br/>It made me forget that it was based on a Disney theme park ride and that Big Jerry B bankrolled the whole shebang.

","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>I had low expectations for this one. A movie based on a Disney theme park ride reeked of desperation. The trailer didn't help me either. ""You want pain? Try wearing a corset!"" Ah ha ha ehhh. My brother saw it and said it was fantastic. He wanted to see it again. This is a guy who only goes to the movie theater if the movie really excites him. The last flick he saw in the theater was ""The Two Towers"". So I went with his advice and saw it with him.<br/><br/>Upon arriving in the theater, I noticed the crowd was made up of mostly little kids. This was the first warning sign that I was at the wrong movie. Then came the coming attractions.  After seeing trailers for ""Brother Bear"" and ""Freaky Friday"", I was sweating bullets. I started envisioning a movie in which pirates were singing and dancing to ""Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum"" while families floated by on rides taking pictures. Happily, the movie surprised me.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a ton of fun. There are three reasons. One, the immense amount of sword fighting action. The movie's motto: When in doubt, add a sword fight. Two, Johnny Depp. He is hilarious as Capt. Sparrow. He was born to play a pirate. I could go for the continued adventures of Capt. Sparrow. Three, the ghoul/zombie angle for the pirates. If they were just normal pirates kidnapping a pretty girl, the movie would not have been half as cool as it was. The special effects were outstanding. Geoffrey Rush was also very good.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is one of the best movies of the summer. Well worth seeing. I had a lot of little kids babbling and having to go to the bathroom at my theater. Maybe I need to see it again too."

","A friend with whom I watched this film summed it up better than I ever could.  ""I've never seen such convincing effects look so unconvincing.""<br/><br/>
as for the meat of the movie, without Johnny Depp, we would have walked out. he saves this from being a miserable adventure flick and makes it into a tolerable adventure flick.<br/><br/>it's got lots of pretty visuals and swashbuckling action and whatnot, but it wasn't worth my $8.50.  matinee... maybe."
"KnightsSayNI","9","2","4","10 July 2003"," A Surprising Gem
","When I was first planning to view this film I must admit my expectations where not that high. After all, the title did give a cheesy feel to the whole thing. However, I must say that within 10 minutes of the film I was completely spellbound by the film, characters, and plot. The fight scenes where well done and not over dramatized, the animation of the skeletons was smoothly done, and the acting was incredible. <br/><br/>The most surprising factor was how Johnny Depp played his character Jack Sparrow. Normally I am not a Depp fan per say, I enjoy his work but I don't exactly find myself fascinated by it. This role, however, gave me a whole different view of how truly talented Depp is as an actor. Depp took on a whole different role that even varied in the way his character Sparrow carried himself and mastered it like it was nothing.<br/><br/>Bloom was also a pleasant surprise. A few minutes into the film in you completely forgot about the elf and focused on the character in front of us. After seeing Bloom in this film I can honestly say that he is not a typecast and will well be on his way to the top. Rush was excellent as usual and portrayed his role as `a captain so evil Hell spat him out' with such humanity you actually felt a bit sorry for the cursed pirate.<br/><br/>
All in all, this film is a rare gem to come from behind the Disney vaults. Along with the superb acting the writing, camera movement, plot, and timing was perfect. Not once did you feel the length of the movie setting in like `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' or like watching `The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' a third time. Humor, drama, action, and adventure where perfectly balanced out to make this film the movie of the summer."

","Well, what can I say.. Johnny Depp, looking like Alice Cooper meets the Scarlet Pimpernell meets Bob Marley and sounding like Oscar Wilde after too much absinth plays Jack Sparrow the overthrown captain of a band of cuthroats. The mutinous pirates are now led by a deliciously ruthless Captain Barbosa played to the teeth by Geoffrey Rush. They are in search of the final pieces of Cortez'zzzzzz Aztec Gold so they can lift the curse of Moctezuma and stop running around in a disheveled pirate vessel known as the Black Pearl.  All it takes is some special ingredient and the curse will be lifted and the guys can go around carousing and raping and pilaging and enjoy the whole thing rather than spend eternity as unsatisfied and perpetually ticked-off skeletal spooks.  Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith Will Turner who has a bit of pirate in him and wonders why, and Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, daughter of the Governor who knows why. <br/><br/>
All in all good squash-buckler of a film that has little to do with the ride of the same name save one scene in Tortuga which looks remarkably like the raping and pilaging that goes on in the Disney attraction. The skeletal capuchin monkey was a nice touch. makeup gets high marks, although Depp should be hung for his excessive use of eye shadow and sparkle disco glitter..come on Johnny, who are you fooling?<br/><br/>Apparently the music by Klaus Badelt, was a direct RIP OFF of Gladiator, because Klaus Badelt did the incidental music for Gladiator.  What did you think Klaus, no one would notice? So if you ignore the music stolen from another film, Pirates is good fun.  Not a keeper, but fun just the same."

","The theme is very attractive. Pirates symbolize the oldest power and freedom, unknown mystery and amazing adventure, primitive conquest, and yearning for the distance. Young and beautiful lovers and unruly captains embark on a thrilling voyage in the blue sea. The overall tone is very romantic. The curse of the black pearl is cleverly set, which makes the entrance of fine wine and delicacies become sediment, makes the beauty of the whole world unable to satisfy the desire, makes you cold and warm, can't sleep at night, makes you immortal but can't get any happiness of life. This is the most terrible curse for the greedy people. Since living is doomed to be unable to get happiness, what's the use of money, and what's the use of life ? In fact, their souls are already dead. The curse under the moonlight just makes them show their prototype."

That's the basic plot but of course there's lots more going on with Magic Medallions & Zombies & Battles & a whole lot of Fun.<br/><br/>I loved all the performances here, especially the heroic turn as Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom, i liked his character more than Captain Jack Sparrow (which everyone became obsessed with?) Now Bloom is everybit the handsome & willing fighter out to save his true love Elizabeth. Depp is silly & fun as Jack Sparrow & very bizarre but good fun & Keira Knightley is great as the quick thinking & beautiful Elizabeth but who really steals the show here in my opinion is the fantastic Geoffrey Rush as the Evil, Funny & Cunning Captain Bambosa, he's a hilarious villain with such a great voice & it's the standout performance here for me.
The supernatural Zombie pirates look Amazing on screen with truly stunning special effects that make the pirates look scary rather than comical as you might expect from a big budget Disney production, here everything looks spectacular.
The ships are so richly textured & beautifully detailed as is all the costumes & fantastic sets, all the best quality possible.<br/><br/>The Curse of the Black Pearl is truly a rip-roaring, swashbuckling fantasy adventure full of fun & magic.
An instant CLASSIC & a film that be watched over & over again."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","0","0","3 April 2020"," One heck of a ride.
","'Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003)' is a really good time. It's a swashbuckling adventure with a pitch-perfect tone and an eclectic set of memorable characters, each as important as the last. Depp's performance is a tightrope walk and he never really wobbles, portraying his 'rock star' pirate as if it were the role he was born to play. Jack Sparrow is an interesting lead because you never know what he's thinking. He double-crosses just about everyone but remains likeable because he's just so good at talking his way out of things and, eventually, some of those double-crosses turn out to be triple-crosses. He has a moral centre, even if it's well-hidden. His adversary is similarly skilled with his silver tongue. However, Hector Barbossa doesn't seem to have a modicum of moral fibre and that's what makes him such a compelling villain. The other factor in that is Rush's fantastic portrayal; he chews the scenery like it's his last meal and he's absolutely spot-on. As is the phenomenal music, which effortlessly evokes everything you could want from a story like this. The narrative takes our heroes and villains through a compelling 'cursed gold' plot and places them in several stand-out set-pieces that are sure to put a smile on your face. That final moment between Sparrow and Barbossa is just sublime. The entire film is just a blast throughout. It's suitably pulpy yet always sincere. It's also chuckle-worthy at times and genuinely suspenseful at others. It works so brilliantly because it's all character-driven, right down to the last sword stroke. It's a hugely entertaining blockbuster. Its balance between practical and digital effects is fantastic, too. 8/10"

","It's an amazing movie - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. I remember watching this movie a very long time ago, and I can't believe how much I enjoyed it. I was very impressed especially this movie in particular. It felt like some sort of classic! There have been in total five Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and they were all wonderful, but the one that holds true for many is probably the first one which nobody can forget about. It was this movie which started it all. What I really enjoyed about this movie was the start. The way the movie was introduced was breathtaking! It really got me interested, and of course, the rest of the movie. The story was wonderful and beautiful. I liked how serious the story was even though it was funny at times. Somehow, the humour just worked. There were many characters we were introduced with, and most people favourite was probably Jack Sparrow. I really liked Jack Sparrow. There's something special about him. You could tell when you see him in this movie how special he is - a wonderful pirate. Everyone supports him in his adventure. He made this movie succeed, and was so funny too. My favourite character, though, within the movie was Will Turner. I also liked Elizabeth Swann who happens to be a romantic interest for Will Turner. I always wanted these two to be together as soon as I saw them: it's a romantic relationship. A lot of people liked that. They were both attracted to one another. It was so sweet. It was hard for me to choose between Jack Sparrow and Will Turner - toss of the coin really. Will Turner reminds me of someone, and so does Elizabeth Swann. I also like the music. I think the soundtracks were wonderful to listen to. It's even nice listening to outside the movie. This was a great movie for the following movies - the sequels. Like I said, it's the story which I find interesting, but I think the first one, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" has the best of stories. It's a classic! That's why I think Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the best movie in the series."

","Much to my surprise, I loved this film. I watched it with my sister when I was twelve because she loves Johnny Depp, and I figured I could handle what a 'meh' film I thought this would be. And I loved it. A convoluted concept executed not all too well, to be sure, but that's not where this movie suceedes for me. It's Depps charismatic wit and mindless unrealistic action within the first ten minutes that has stuck with me since I was a child. The movie is wonderfully cast, wonderfully shot, and wonderfully scored, all coming together for your perfect mindless pirate film that unfortunately went nowhere after the first film. I think this movie would have been perfect if all the supernatural stuff was removed and just was Depp on the lam stealing stuff, but otherwise a great film."

","I remember watching this movie when I was very very young and I kinda remembered parts of and I kept procrastinating watching it again now because I remembered I loved it when I was young. So finally came the day I saw it and I must say even after all these years I wasn't disappointed at all.<br/><br/>It's the classic 2000s high budget legendary family friendly movie formula. All you need is to base the story on an interesting topic which in this case was pirates, have high budget likeable le actors, have action/serious sc√®nes which mostly leads to comedic ends, a good and engaging story and everything else you would expect from a high budget 2000s movie. And boom you are making money for many years to come.<br/><br/>The story is as clich√© as you would expect, and it's very enjoyable even after all these years.
Clich√© story, music, effects, amazing visual effects and the amazing Pirates vibe works really well.<br/><br/>Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it and some won't but over the years it has becomed √† legendary franchise.

","""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is one of my favorite pirate movies. I like all the series of this movie. I think one of the benefits of this movie is that all age categories can watch it. Of course, there are some parts, which can be frightening for children, however, I remember that when I was a child, approximately at 9 age, I watched this movie great enthusiasm and nothing stopped me from watching it. There is nothing that can be sad bad about this movie. All actors play perfectly in this movie, and everyone is remembered differently. Of course, my favorite character is Captain Jack, and my love for Johnny Depp started from this movie. Depp and this character are one and plays so good that you can't imagine him without this character. I think that no one could play this character better than Depp and it was horrible for me when I read an article, where the producer of this movie tells that Depp will no longer be a part of the upcoming project.
Another character that I love in this movie is Elisabeth, which is played by Kira Knightley. I like how Knightley plays her role; she makes so that we believe her. At first, we see a fragile and curious girl, which by chance falls into another world: a world full of pirates and secrets. However, then we see her growth and the way she struggles for her love. Also in other parts, we see it even more obvious. In particular, she leaves Captain Jack at the mercy of a large octopus or the part where she becomes the head of all pirates. All these changes show her strong character and also indicate how a person gradually reveals his real abilities based on the circumstances.
Overall, in my opinion, it is a worthy movie with great graphics and talented actors. I advise everyone to watch this movie and don't pay attention to the duration of the film. It is so addictive that you won't be bored."

There are generally two memorable scenes for the modern, spoiled viewer. But there are charismatic heroes in it that will be remembered by any audience forever. First of all, Jack Sparrow, who was played by Johnny Depp. I think the pirate's lineup will be like Depp's brand after a delightful trilogy. But we know that Jonia is able to play any role."

","Title - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl<br/><br/>Date Released (UK) - 19 July 2003<br/><br/>Average Rating at Time of Review - 8.0<br/><br/>Position in IMDB's Top 250 at Time of Review - #248<br/><br/>Directed By - Gore Verbinski<br/><br/>Starring - Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush & Orlando Bloom<br/><br/>Plot - Blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead.<br/><br/>I saw this film many years ago; I imagine it wasn't long after its release. I didn't remember much about it, but I must have enjoyed it as I have watched every other Pirates of the Caribbean movie upon release. 
 Over the years I have (half-heartedly) attempted to watch this film for a second time, but have never felt up to it. Until tonight.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is not a perfect film, it can barely be classed as a great film. In fact, I was surprised to find it holding a spot on the Top 250. Upon watching it, I can understand why - it is an incredibly fun film that had me entertained throughout its runtime, despite its shortcomings and made me want to come back for more. 
 More importantly, it reignited childhood fantasies of sailing and plundering the seven seas.<br/><br/>PROS:
 - The Music: This has to be mentioned. The music in this film is such a huge part of what makes it so enjoyable. It perfectly balances a sense of urgency while still being fun to listen to, enhancing any scene it accompanies.<br/><br/> - The Action: I was impressed with how well the action was handled in the film. Watching the trailer will have you believe it is made up of action scenes thrown together in the editing room, littered with quick cuts and close ups. Thankfully, this was not the case. The main point of the action is always in focus and easy to follow and makes the experience much more enjoyable. <br/><br/> - The Story: One can imagine when watching that this was never planned as only one movie. What the writers have done with this film is created a world. A world that feels loved in and offers more to explore. There is plenty of foreshadowing of things to come in this and future films of the series, whilst still managing to make an entertaining, standalone pirate adventure. <br/><br/>CONS:
 - The Acting: I know that the film doesn't take itself too seriously and it embraces that, which I can appreciate. However, barring Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, I found a lot of the acting and character interactions to be stiff and hollow with no real gravitas to the words being spoken. <br/><br/> - Character Development: Character Development is important to me, especially if I'm to be invested in these characters and their fates. This is why I was let down when none of the characters develop in any significant way over the course of the film and when they do, it feels shoe-horned in for plot purposes. <br/><br/>I find though, that both of those cons can be forgiven; as I mentioned, the film doesn't take itself seriously and doesn't ask to be. What it does do is offer a wholly entertaining, thrilling ride through a world and society long-lost to us. A world that hadn't had the greatest luck in the film industry. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed my time with these characters and this world and look forward to visiting again with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest."

Usually, movies tend to lean too far over to one side, but this one manages to be downright hilarious at times, such as when Elizabeth and Sparrow get drunk on an island and dance in circles around a fire singing 'a pirate's life for me' and also exciting and suspenseful, like during the sea battle.<br/><br/>At times, it is also kind of scary, so well done for that. 'Skeleton crew' was a very scary scene, and so was 'underwater attack' in which Barbosa's skeleton warriors march along the bottom of the sea to get at the imperial ships.<br/><br/>The musical scores are awesome, and really well done. In total, this is an amazing, very exciting and fun movie that's definitely worth watching."

"slightlymad22","10","0","0","6 March 2018"," Mixed Feelings On This Movie
","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl. <br/><br/>I have very mixed feelings on this movie. One one hand I love it, it's almost perfect entertainment and I love Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. On the other hand, I think the success of this movie and the character was a blessing and a curse (much like Smokey & The Bandit for Burt Reynolds) as it turned Depp from a popular actor, into an A List superstar!! And in the process, it ruined one of my favourite actors, who even in his worst movies, was always interesting.<br/><br/>When the TV Show 21 Jump Street was a hit, it made Depp famous and turned him into a heart throb and an instant teen idol, and he hated everything about it. He fought to get out of his contract, and when they refused, he became a prima donna. He stopped trying and was awful to work with. Once free, he then spent the next decade, avoiding star making movies, preferring roles in smaller, more artistic movies that made little money but gained him credibility, and earned nicknames like Hollywood's favourite odd ball or Hollywood's favourite outsider. <br/><br/>The last 5 years had been the most settled of Depp's life, he was living quietly in France with Vanessa Paradis and their children. Then he made this movie, so his ""kids could finally see him in a movie."" And it put Depp back right where he began. Beholden to a major studio, a product, a living embodiment of a theme ride. <br/><br/>His next two movies were already in the can, and the following two were already in place, before the studio-approved Depp of the last 12 years.<br/><br/>Now on to the movie. Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is not the main character, more of a supporting character, but he steals every scene and was deservedly nominated for his first Oscar (losing to Sean Penn in Mystic River) he is the best thing in the movie, and truthfully the movie is duller when he is not on screen. He is at his quirky best (is he permanent drunk or did he get too much sun whilst stranded on the island) and I usually smiled every time he was on screen. Imagine how boring this would have been if Depp had played the role straight. <br/><br/>It's a tad over long, the battles become a tad too repetitive considering the only casualties are the non pirates, since the pirates can't die. Even watching Depp and Geoffrey Rush engage in a totally pointless swordfight is a bit blah, as you know what's coming thanks to a reveal earlier. <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is a tad bland but is ok, likewise Kiera Knightley who looks good, but lacks the certain something that would explain why all these men are in love with her, and more importantly are willing to die for her. Geoffrey Rush Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport are all fine in their supporting roles too.<br/><br/>OK I have waffled on enough.<br/><br/>Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl became Depp's highest grossing movie, and joint best performing movie (alongside Platoon) as it grossed $305 million at the domestic box office to end 2003 as the 3rd highest grossing movie of the year."

The second is played in the pretty successful effects of the zombie pirates passing under the lighting of the moon, including this very nice underwater walk."

","This swashbuckling adventure movie, simply put, blew me away. I had seen it multiple times as a child and I liked it then. But now that I'm an adult, I love it. When I watched it when I was younger, I mainly just viewed it as a mindless action movie with pirates in it. Now I understand it a lot better, with the treasure /curse being the focal point of the movie.<br/><br/>This aspect of it drives the movie forward, while also having some fantastic action sequences inter-spliced throughout. The pacing of it was great, in a similar regard.<br/><br/>Also let's not dismiss the acting here. They brought in some heavy hitters...Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush,...and they ALL hit it out of the park. The crew of this film also did an amazing job, having good time-appropriate costumes and the effects were decent, given when it was made.<br/><br/>Overall, the first Pirates is a great way to spend two and a half hours. It might seem like a long running time, but it does not drag at all, as each minute is filled with cinematic bliss."

However, I am cautious when I see ""Disney"" on a movie. <br/><br/>This movie begins with well created context and helpful details to set the plot of the movie. The witty comments and actions of Jack Sparrow challenge the logical sensible actions of William. As the movie plays out, the plot does a good job of staying on track.<br/><br/>With that being said, the 2 stars I did not give to this movie would be for the beginning of the movie being action filled and witty and while Depp keeps the witty ideas present, in my opinion, the high point/climax of the movie felt like the slowest part.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) is the first film in the Disney Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. This franchise has been a humongous money maker for Disney. This first movie introduces us to what is probably one of the most widely known characters ever know, Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. This really is an interesting character. I'm not a big fan of Johnny Depp, but I will say that he was the correct pick for this character, I've really taken issue with how he represents characters before (Charlie and the chocolate factory), but this time I think he did a good job. His character is complicated because on one hand, he is someone we root for and someone we're amused by because of his humorous nature and personality, and then on the other hand, he's a flawed character that steals and cheats others. But it's a whole lot of fun to watch Johnny Depp plays this humorous captivating character, hence his academy award nomination. We are also introduced to Will, played by the ever handsome Orlando Bloom. Will is one of the most commendable characters you'll ever see, he's a noble charming character who everyone has no choice but to root for. And then we have Keira Knightly playing Elizabeth. She plays Blooms love interest. But what I loved about her role is that she's isn't just some female for Bloom, she is not a damsel in distress. Yes, it's great to see her and Will fall in love and to see their great romantic chemistry, but it's also awesome to see Elizabeth stand up for herself and take charge in different scenes. She played her in a very bad ass way, which makes it so much fun to watch. The plot of course revolves around pirates invading and these characters I've told you about going up against them. There's more to it than that of course but that's the basic overall plot. I really enjoy watching this now ever famous film. It deserves the positive reception it received when it came out. 8/10 for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."

","If you're ever in the mood for just a flat out entertaining flick, you can't go wrong with 'Curse of the Black Pearl"". I wasn't writing these reviews when this movie first came out, didn't even know there was such a thing as IMDb. So I'm finally getting back to it this many years later and even though I'd forgotten a lot about the story, I was blown away all over again by the outrageous antics of Captain Jack Sparrow and those transition scenes where the skeleton pirates manifest in the moonlight. In fact, the story itself might be incidental to the special effects and physical stunts that highlight the action in the film. Johnny Depp of course makes the movie with his swish-buckling (yeah, I misspelled it on purpose) approach to the character, and you couldn't ask for a more fetching lady in distress than Keira Knightley, although she managed to hold her own against most of those menacing pirates quite nicely. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush round out the rest of the principal cast, and each did a superb job. I've never gotten beyond this movie's sequel, 'Dead Man's Chest', but watching this one again inspires me to go forward and check out all the rest."

","Plot; A pirate teams with a blacksmith in an attempt to rescue a young woman from the cursed crew of his former ship.<br/><br/>Having not watched this since it originally hit DVD four... teen years ago (gulp), I was surprised by a number of things. For one, why did I wait so long to revisit it? I remember thinking it was fun (and at the time, refreshingly different), and the former certainly still holds true. Perhaps more surprising is Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. Over the years I've watched the various sequels (save for the latest one), and there was--if memory serves--a severe level of diminishing returns. But even more, I remember Depp's Sparrow being a total buffoon.¬†Seeing him here I realize that what happened was that¬†Sparrow became¬†a caricature of the character Depp created in the original. To be sure Jack Sparrow's got some quirk to him, but he's not the ever-slurring gag-a-second clown I'd pegged him to be. He's got an edge here. A swagger. And he wears it well.<br/><br/>Though it's a¬†tad too long for its own good, it still moves by a brisk pace and has a tight focus. Its enormous success spawned a ""Bigger is better"" philosophy for at least the next two sequels, and that's a shame.

","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL - 2003<br/><br/>Directed by Gore Verbinski<br/><br/>Starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ‚ÄãCapt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal in the Caribbean without a ship or crew. His timing is inopportune, however, because later that evening the town is besieged by a pirate ship. The pirates kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who's in possession of a valuable coin that is linked to a curse that has transformed the pirates into the undead. A gallant blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) in love with Elizabeth allies with Sparrow in pursuit of the pirates.<br/><br/>The movie equivalent of the phrase 'Lightning in a Bottle'. Such a fun, inventive, creative and enjoyable movie that was seriously sensational considering it was based on a ride. It is a swashbuckling adventure and a heck of a ride from beginning to end. It is just so much fun.<br/><br/>The plot for the movie is overly complicated for a movie of this calibre. But if you peel back the overly complicated layers, it is a very fun and entertaining adventure at heart. I also really like the ending. It is such a perfect way to end the movie. Inventive, entertaining and fun. That is the heart and soul of the film translated into 5 minutes.<br/><br/>‚Äã Johnny Depp was great in this film, back when he acted not 'stumbled onto set for all that $$$'. ‚ÄãCAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is a great, fun, likable character. Again, back in the golden age of 'effort'. <br/><br/>I am really not a fan of Orlando Bloom and I do not see the appeal of him as an actor. He wasn't that great in this movie and neither was the character. Turner wasn't likable, funny or entertaining. He didn't fit with the movie tonally and was just a bore to watch. Keira Knightley was good as Elizabeth Swan. I bought her performance for the most part. As far as her character goes, Swan was just a generic love interest for the first half but as she slowly becomes an empowered and strong female character, I really liked her. One thing I could really have done without was the love story between Bloom and Knightley. It wasn't even that well done and love is the LAST thing on my mind when I think about Pirates. <br/><br/>‚Äã Geoffrey Rush is incredible as Captain Hector Barbossa. You can tell he was having so much fun and relished every moment in the film.‚Äã As an antagonist, Barbossa was both threatening and funny, which blends the world of pirating and this film's tone perfectly.<br/><br/>‚Äã Other supporting roles, such as Mr Gibbs(Kevin McNally) and James Norrington(Jack Davenport) were all pretty good and they were at least interesting.<br/><br/>‚Äã The effects are pretty impressive and look decent. Not realistic but they have a fun, goofy nature to them which I think fits in tone with the overall film. The cinematography in the movie was very good and it looks very nice. The editing can sometimes get a little dodgy, especially during some fight scenes. Thankfully, it isn't that frequent and the action was still thoroughly enjoyable. Both the costume and set design were excellent. And the score for this movie is one of the most memorable scores since the year 2000.<br/><br/>The humour for this movie works very well for the most part, with Depp and Rush being clear standouts for it. ‚Äã<br/><br/>The action is, when you can see it, very fun and inventive and enjoyable to watch. Clearly a lot of effort was put into it and I applaud the actors because I think they did their own sword fighting and whatnot.<br/><br/>‚Äã The Curse of the Black Pearl is a very fun ride from beginning to end and I can highly recommend it. It is definitely worth a watch. I'll rate this film 8 'Savvys' out of 10."

","This first of the Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Curse Of The Black Pearl was a milestone in the career of star Johnny Depp. I always liked Depp since 21 Jump Street and he always chose quirky products where he did great as an actor, but the films were more often than not less than successful commercially. With this film first and foremost Depp got himself linked to a commercial success that spawned several sequels. His box office was now secure.<br/><br/>But also this is a once in a lifetime chance to do a part that calls for some of the most outrageous overacting you'll ever see. I think Johnny Depp might have been channeling Robert Newton in one of his pirate films, be it Blackbeard or Treasure Island.<br/><br/>In fact the plot is a lot like Treasure Island in the sense that Depp is looking to get back his ship the Black Pearl. It was taken over by his former First Mate Barboso played by Geoffrey Rush and the whole crew Depp included is under a really bad curse. A couple of civilians, governor's daughter Keira Knightley and blacksmith Orlando Bloom are also part of the adventure.<br/><br/>The Pirates Of The Caribbean blends both the swashbuckling adventure film and the horror genre quite nicely. I can certainly Robert Newton in the part had this been 60-70 years ago. <br/><br/>This is one film as are the rest in the series to just kick back and enjoy."

Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew.<br/><br/>The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb. This film has action, humor, romance, mystery, special effects and is so delightful that the viewer does not feel the running time of 143 minutes.

The theme of this movie comes from a ride at the Disney theme park. It is a fantasy movie because it does not happen in real life. The theme of this movie is to catch the viewers' attention by making them think it is real life. Camera angles during this movie helps that part. The angles of the camera when the movie is shot makes the scenes when the fighting takes place more real life. It gets you close and up personal. Also the lighting during the movie sets the mood. Most of the scenes are darker with less lighting making it not scary but letting the viewer know that something is going to happen like the fighting or when the moon light is out and the pirates turn into skeletons.

A film that provides basically everything you might expect in this kind of fun-filled adventure, albeit somewhat overstaying its merry welcome and deviating enormously from its Disneyland theme park ride inspiration, hardly ever does this amusing, entertaining extravaganza of a movie go wrong.

","Yo Ho, Yo Ho, a pirates life for me! The film, The Pirates of the Caribbean has a theme that is evident. The Pirates of the Caribbean shows that the central insight is the fact that not all pirates are cold hearted. They can show compassion and camaraderie. It was under the brilliant direction of Gore Verbinski (The Ring, The Mexican) that this film's theme could be so easily seen. The Pirates of the Caribbean is a visually pleasing display of a true pirate adventure. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, Edward Scissorhands) steals the show by revealing that not all pirates are cold hearted. The story begins with a gold medallion found on a boy which is taken from him to protect his identity from the British Navy that he is a pirate. The evil pirate Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush, House on Haunted Hill) and his crew are drawn to the medallion and will stop at nothing to get it back to break their curse. Johnny Depp's character has little concern about the medallion, but does want to get his ship, the Black Perl, back. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, Lord of the Rings) teams up with Jack Sparrow to fight the pirates to regain the kidnapped governor's daughter (Keira Knightley, Love Actually) regain the Black Perl and defeat the evil pirates. The lighting in this film says a lot to describe the contrast of good and evil. When the camera is on Barbosa and his crew it is very low lighting to give the audience a sense of darkness. When the camera is on Jack Sparrow and his crew the lighting changes, it is bright and gives a feeling of camaraderie. This brings us back to the theme of the film, not all pirates are cold hearted."

","I have seen this movie at least two dozen times, and I love it.  It is my favorite movie ever!  Johhny Depp does an amazing job acting the part of Captain Jack Sparrow, and the rest of the cast is great too.<br/><br/>Pirate movies have never been that popular, but this movie was AWESOME!  I became obsessed with pirates after seeing this movie, and I even bought a huge poster of Johhny Depp to hang on my bedroom door.<br/><br/>This movie was everything.  It was a hilarious action/romance with great costumes and actors and visual effects, and though the storyline was a little confusing at first, after seeing it a couple of times, I fell in love with this movie.  I bought it on DVD right after it came out, and I watch it all the time.<br/><br/>A wonderful, awesome, amazing, great, fantastic, fabulous, MUST-SEE!"

","I dragged my heels on seeing this movie, and I was sorry that I did. Johnny Depp is hysterically funny as Captain Jack Sparrow, a shipless pirate who dodges capture deftly, if not haphazardly. Supported by Orlando Bloom as a reluctant son of a pirate, the two embark upon a quest to rescue a lovely lady, and capture a ship who's crew is under an interesting curse. The action was very well executed, and the plot kept you going through the over two hour movie. A testament to it's character is that you really do not notice the time passing. Johnny Depp shows us again why he is an acting force to be reckoned with, choosing obscure and lucrative roles for our imaginations. This particular character is like none other than he has ever played. New viewers (or even returning viewers) should pay close attention to Depp's facial expressions, particularly in scenes where the focus is not on his character. Special effects usage was eye opening, and Orlando Bloom is moving right on up the ladder of his career with solid steps upon the rungs."

","In the mid-18th century, it can be difficult for a motley crew of pirates to make a name for themselves on the high seven seas. The Black Pearl is the exception. Boasting a star-studded crew, this whale of a ship has already slaughtered the US Box Office, and is set to do the same when she sails to European shores later this month. Featuring plenty of buckling swash, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is quickly becoming this years must-sea action/ adventure blockbuster. Inspired by the infamous ride of the same name at Disneyworld, Producer Jerry Brockheimer has made sure no expense has been spared to reproduce a big screen replica that keeps true to the genre of a swashbuckling pirate adventure. Do not fear though! If you've been waiting for a decent pirate film for this decade, that spares you corny accents and puns, then this could just be the film for you!<br/><br/>The film's plot is centered on the cursed, un-dead pirates of the mysterious ghost ship of legend ¬ñ the Black Pearl. She and her compatriots are on a quest. A quest to find all the Aztec gold medallions that cursed them. And it just so happens that a child Elizabeth Swann stumbles upon one around the young Will Turner's neck when he is rescued by Swann and her father, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce). Unfortunately, the medallion, which Elizabeth took to hide Will's piracy, sends out a signal to the pirates when it falls into the sea years later ¬ñ a time when Elizabeth is set to marry Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport); and a blacksmith Will Turner can only look on as his love is married (His love being Elizabeth not Norrington). Thus a hoard of gibbering, unkillable pirates; led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), follows to destroy the town of Port Royal where Swann is living, and retrieve their stolen item. <br/><br/>Thus, with her having been kidnapped by the pirates, heart-broken gentlemen Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Norrington set sail after the Black Pearl. Sounds good doesn't it?<br/><br/>Yes, but it's not perfect. The plot is riddled with holes, so it doesn't all make total sense, but like the ride it is based on, the film moves on before you have time to think too hard about anything. However, don't go to this film wanting an ideal remix of an old genre; yes Verbinski and Brockheimer have breathed new life into the mould, but rather than getting a full on swashbuckler, it's a comedy and a romance, and I feel its all the better for it.<br/><br/>The brunt of the goodness in this film is carried by Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow), who's comic portrayal of Jack Sparrow (Captain Jack Sparrow) is comparable to a drugged out rock star who clings to his half-fame like a life raft. It is a performance that could have been awful but he pitches it just perfectly and stops the film ever becoming anything less than fun. <br/><br/>Zoom In Elizabeth Swann may have the looks and the rich ¬ñ posh background, but we quickly see her develop into an unusual heroine in this film. Unlike her contemporaries, such as Maid Marion in 'Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves', Miss. Swann plays a rather more pivotal role ¬ñ moreover, a more active role. Rather than playing a 'Damsel in Distress', a convention for women in this sort of genre, she's central to the story and gets involved with her own share of the action and the fighting, daring to attack the pirates and even Barbossa, and she saves hers and others lives a plenty. So although she may have the beauty, innocence, money, clothes, and the attraction to all the men around her like the traditional stereotype, she is not a girl to be messed with - feisty, smart, brave and witty. Definitely a 'Modern girl stuck in an eighteenth century world' (Keira Knightley on Elizabeth Swann)."

","It is unusual in this day and age to find a fun movie the whole family can enjoy. The violence is what I would expect in a pirate flick, the language was extremely tame ( damn, hell) Geoffrey Rush was outstanding. I've a place in my heart for a good old fashioned bad boy. Some of his comments are hysterical you can actually BELIEVE he is pirate. The mannerisms, the faces, the chases, the ARRRRR he has it down pat. I rewatch it for his performance. Johnny Depp is delightful and warm and quite lovable for a pirate. He's eye candy anyway (from way back in the 21 Jumpstreet days). Some of the swashbuckling scenes were a little lengthy for me but the musical score is powerful and proud and carried me through. I love Geoffrey Rush"

Maybe since you kept falling asleep, you didn't get the humor and storyline of this movie like you should have. This movie was great. I had no problem remembering the plot. Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, AND Kiera Knightley were fantastic. Orlando Bloom has shown his versatility in acting by going from completely different characters and playing them excellently. Johnny Depp deserved that best actor award every bit, and I was very sad to learn that he did not receive it. He played a constantly drunken pirate, who had gone a little bit mad, and he did it very well. Kiera Knightley, whose performance in ""Bend it Like Beckham"" was also great, plays a young girl, a little too modern for her time. She stands up for herself, and is also very clever. I would also like to mention that Jack Davenport and John Rys-Davies were also very good in this movie, and they get too little recognition. Captain Barbosa, played by Geoffrey Rush, was an awesome bad guy. I absolutely loved this movie."

","Pirates of the Caribbean has lots of different effects and this is what makes it a good film. The key event is when the governor's daughter is kidnapped by a crew of dreaded pirates. Watch for Captain Jack Sparrow turning into a skeleton when he walks through the moonlight.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, the film actually has pirates in it. The director Chris Columbus has done a good job. It was an Oscar-winning film and now they are working on a sequel. <br/><br/>The film is rather long and some viewers might get bored, particularly if they like serious films. Some of the interior scenes on the video version are rather dark and difficult to see clearly. However, Pirates of the Caribbean is exciting and full of suspense, and great if you like pirates. <br/><br/>The key actors in this marvellous film are Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly.

It shows you their skeletons while they are walking under the moonlight, but when they go under the shade from the moonlight, they return to normal. Then, out from under the shade they walk, and they transform back into skeletons. Can you say, ""Awesome?""<br/><br/>*The Special Effects.* Special effects were awesome in this movie!

","I am the type of person who hates action movies so for me to tell you that this movie rocked is a big deal. It might help that I'm the biggest Johnny Depp fan though. Don't be fooled by the Disney name...it's not the same old sugary crap you expect from Disney (even though that's what's to be expected as Disney is usually geared towards children). It's got a great story and the acting is brilliant. I'm not a big Kiera Knightly fan but I think she did a good job in the film. There is alot of action so if you're into that kind of stuff then you'll love this film. I think what I liked best about this film, though, (aside from Johnny Depp) is that there's a romance story laced inside of the crude world of piracy. Orlando and Kiera's characters are in a sort of forbidden relationship and they fight for eachother through the whole movie. Johnny Depp makes you laugh, Geoffrey Rush disgusts you (good actor, gross character), and Orlando and Kiera make you sigh in jealousy. Great movie for dates because you've got the love story and the action flick all in one. I'm not gonna tell you the story, just see the movie, you won't be disappointed."

","I have to be one of the biggest fans of this movie.  I loved every minute of it.  One word of caution though, it is rated PG and I think is produced by Disney, so even though there's raggedy pirates and sword fights, there is no cursing, nudity or bloody scenes.  That certainly didn't take away from it as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp stole the show and played his part very well.  Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa) also did a fine job as did the rest of the cast.  I wasn't overly impressed with Orlando bloom, Keira Knightley, or Jack Davenport but they didn't do a poor job and certainly didn't take away from the film.  I guess you could say I liked all the pirates the best, the rest of the cast were decent fillers.<br/><br/>I loved the humor flow of this movie, when I saw it in the theaters, I must have been the only person who had ever been on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland, as I completely busted up in the first jail scene, as well as a few other scenes, whereas no one else did.  I didn't find the movie the least bit scary, but I wouldn't show it to a very young kid either as it would probably scare the pants off them.  All in all this movie had great acting, mainly by the two characters I already mentioned, a decent story, great effects and battle / fight scenes, and a good overall flow.  I own this movie and have probably seen it more than 10 times.  By far the best movie I've seen this year, with Kill Bill and ROTK being a semi close second/third.<br/><br/>I certainly hope they make a part II, and If they do, definitely keep Depp in, without him, it wouldn't have been the 10 /10 that I rated it."

","I watched this while babysitting my neighbor's kids ages 9 and 12. They liked it a lot, I thought it was okay. I got a little bored about half-way but not enough to turn it off, I wanted to see how they would wrap it all up.<br/><br/>It has some neat effects and the story line is pretty good, every kid wonders what it would be like to do something amazing. The acting was pretty good, especially from Johnny Depp he delivers an excellent performance. The beautiful Keira Knightley delivers a good but not great performance and so does eye candy Orlando Bloom. I think that this movie is a good movie for Keira Knightley's future career, she is a beautiful young actress that has a lot of potential. I thinks that she would be in many of the future ""big"" movies! I also think that Orlando Bloom would become a big actor, but I don't think that he will become bigger than Keira Knightley. Well this wasn't the greatest pirate movie ever told, but the potential for it to be above average is definitely there. I went into this movie expecting it to suck right up there with one of those crazy Lampoon type spoofs of a movie, not to mention something that was just for kids. I was totally wrong. Me being a 18 year old adult found it to be quite humorous and quite exciting in most parts. Johnny Depp, in my opinion was cast perfectly for the role. Of course I tend to be a bit biased when it comes to good old Johnny( I loved him in Edward Scissorhands). He definitely shines in all of his performances and will blossom into one of the great actors of the upcoming generation. As far as this movie goes, its all about having fun, and that's exactly what Johnny accomplished with this film... hail Jack Sparrow (Johnny). When I took my cousin out to see ""Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"", I fully expected to be bored and go away hoping that at least the children enjoyed it... boy, was I surprised! Johnny Depp played a great pirate, and Keira Knightley was a cute rich girl. I thought it was really funny and full of action, and my cousin thought it was ""really cool!"" It's a creative family flick...fun for the whole family. (Even I enjoyed it!) I think this movie will be on every kid's top ten for a while to come...as for me, I'll be waiting for a sequel. I know what you're thinking, and you're right. Keira Knightley's acting really doens't leave much to be desired, but the witty script, good lead from Johnny Depp and excellent fighting make this a must see. A great movie. I liked ""Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"". It was cool, funny, thrilling, and had a lot of action. Although I am a big fan of Keira Knightley's and was disappointed at her acting in this movie. Sure, she was great in ""The Hole"" but in this movie I found her to be a bit over-the-top. I know Keira could've done better than that. On the other hand, Johnny Depp did great playing Captain Jack Sparrow. Keira's clothes weren't really appropriate for a PG-13 movie. But I thought this movie was a little bit too intense for a PG and for little kids under the age of 7 to watch. Some of the violence was just a tiny bit intense. In one scene they show Will running his hand up Elizabeth's chest, but I don't think it was meant in a sexual way, and some woman show cleavage and look like prostitutes. But I still recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it, you should!!Pirates of the Carribean :Curse of the Black Pearl has an interesting premise even if at first I was a little cautious about it. But we must look at it from the right point of view, meaning like a kid would. Who never wished to be to be a pirate? Even today I think about it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is perfect for the role. He represents a feisty pirate captain. Orlando Bloom is also great as his tough, icy partner. The amazingly beautiful Keira Knightley however suffers from a huge lack of screen time. Her acting could also be better and we can clearly notice the girl has a huge ego. With her looks she can go far no doubt about it. But she has to be a little humble and be ready to learn. I'm not sure that is the case. With full knowledge of the power of her physical side she appears not the least interested and I would say even bored throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The story is simple and without a touch of reality to it, just like it was supposed to be. The humor however could be more efficient. Some jokes, maybe too many, fall flat. The action could also have been improved. It's not even close to spectacular. The opening scene is very attractive but then all we get is some explosions and a few swashbuckling fights. There's also some violence, but nothing too extreme.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl has some flaws. Its slow to build, some scenes fail miserably and sometimes its just too stupid.<br/><br/>
But since I'm not in its target audience. not anymore, I would recommend it because I still enjoyed it very much. It has a light, pirate atmosphere that works very well and provides an innocent fun. This was a very entertaining film for anyone of any age. It had cool action, and good special effects. Johnny Depp was good as Jack and was excellent at playing the beautiful Elizabeth Swann. When Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce) is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter.Perfect Film to take the whole family to. This was also pretty funny. Very good action/family/comedy/pirate movie.Loved this movie! Saw a free sneak preview and would pay to see it again. Johnny Depp was crazy/wonderful as usual. Funny, creative, handsome, surprising - as he always is.Orlando Bloom was like a young Errol Flynn. He was a dream in Lord of the Rings and this proves that was no fluke. He can act, he's good to look at - has a sweet personality and the physicality to carry the role. The swordplay between Bloom and Depp was terrific!Geoffrey Rush pushed the envelope at being wonderfully hammy and the rest of the cast was simply great.Beautifully visual, a bit too long, but worth the ride. And I mean Ride!<br/><br/>Really cool! 8.5/10<br/><br/>I liked the action parts and the skeleton pirates. If you think of yourself in place of the actors,it helps you get a feeling of how the actor were.<br/><br/>There is also romance at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie.Went to see this on a rainy evening on vacation with my cousin. They loved it, and my parents and I enjoyed the experience too.<br/><br/>Depp is an excellent lead - charming and likable, and the other cast members are well cast. Interesting story, good dialog, pretty decent special effects, great pace and length - what more could one ask for?<br/><br/>AND IT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER FREAKING PIRATE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!"

","warning: possible spoilers. (But probably not)<br/><br/>‚òº‚òº‚òº‚òº (Four out of Four Suns)<br/><br/>
Although this movie has been out for a while, I thought I could put i my own opinion after watching it several hundred times. With a good plot and great casting I will give this three thumbs up (if I had that many.) Pirates gives a new edge to the boring and predictable pirate movie. The special effects should definitely not be left out. I watched the ""behind the scenes"" and was amazed at how complicated it is to make the skeleton pirates and the many fight scenes that were included.<br/><br/>However, no matter how interesting the plot, the cast for Pirates is what really makes this movie great. Kierra Knightly fits her part very well and portrays it realistically. Orlando Bloom although plays second fiddle to Johnny Depp; also adds an essential ingredient. Last but certainly not least is Johnny Depp; and the sole reason that this movie is hilarious. He has a sense of humor that will keep audiences laughing the entire time. (Ladies, see this movie if only to see Depp and Bloom, I promise you won't be disappointed;) (And to see more Depp, see Secret Window, I highly suggest it.) This movie has everything it should, captivating plot, convincing special effects and great actors. Since this movie has been released in stores, I strongly suggest you check it out; a wonderful date movie! ; )"

It's a shame Hollywood took so long to realize this man's worth, but I'm glad that he's finally getting the recognition that he deserves:-) The movie itself was ok, nothing great. Saved by Depp and Geoffrey Rush(fellow aussie, thanks mate!) in their roles. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were merely adequate.

","Peg-legs, swordplay, plank walking, ships, cannons and ancient curses. Now that's what a summer movie should be. We start off in the 1700s, give or take a hundred, in an island off - where else - the Caribbean. After 30 minutes of setup and character introduction, the island is attacked by the Black Pearl which takes Elizabeth Swann -the Governor's daughter- prisoner. But this be no random pirate attack. The pirates are victims of an Aztec curse that has left them in a state of undead and need Elizabeth's medallion to break it. The roguish Cap'n Jack Sparrow, former captain of the Black Pearl, sets off after them with Will Turner, his new sidekick. That's basically the movie. Now if you're coming into this expecting an intelligent drama about the dangers of sea life, well, forget it.  Pirates is a movie whose sole purpose is to entertain, without insulting your intelligence, and entertain it does. It is one of those rare films that's good and fun, and much credit goes to Johnny Depp. One can only guess as to what compelled him to do away with the conventional Errol Flynn pirate and instead channel Keith Richards with a little PePe Le Pew. Depp is an actor who consistently rises above the script, regardless of the film's quality. The stumbling, slurred deliveries, facial expressions and goatee - things that would be out of place in another movie - only add to the performance because they fit in the context of the film. His performance is funny, eccentric, charismatic, and fully worthy of an Oscar nomination. It's time he got some recognition. Without him this would have been an average movie with a good performance from Geoffery Rush. As the mutinous first mate Barbosa, Rush also provides some humorous moments and has some good exchanges with Depp. Orlando Bloom is Will Turner, a blacksmith, who happens to be the reason for the curse. He holds his own as the movie pirate - looks, thinned mustache, ponytail - and Keira Knightley is even better as the damsel in distress. The production values - set design, costumes, cinematography -are first rate as are the special effects.  The film also benefits from a rousing score courtesy of Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer.  The movie could have spent more time in the editing room as it sometimes looses momentum. At two hours twenty minutes, it's about half hour too long. The direction is O.K. The battle scenes and sword fights could have been better choreographed. They come off flat and fail to provide any thrills. The only enjoyable one is the last one when Sparrow and Barbosa are moving in and out of the lunar beams. But these are just minor holes in an otherwise solid film. Pirates of the Caribbean is a fun swashbuckler with a good cast and should appeal to all, even if the wind occasionally goes out of its sails"

","The only reason I even gave this movie a chance was because of the IMDB '8.0' rating it had at the time. That might be just a smudge too high but not by much. When I think of pirates I think of that which I have seen in the movies...PERIOD. Most pirate movies I've seen before were pretty much the same old flat characters or pirate musicals.<br/><br/>
I recommend this movie. It was extremely entertaining. It was fun. You will like it. What more do you want?<br/><br/>Nearly every character was portrayed convincingly and interestingly. The acting did what it was supposed to do - give the viewer the idea of what the character is and does. A good script does this. This is a good script. There was a bit of 'Errol Flynn' hamminess to the action, but that's what made it fun. Lotsa plausible acrobatics. Fantastic but entirely plausible.<br/><br/>
The scenery and props were presented and the illusion was successful. This is good in a movie like this. Period pieces. I enjoyed every costume, wall, and shrub. <br/><br/>The special effects are really special. Some introduce themselves in one of the most interesting ways I have ever seen. I wanted to sing 'Moonlight Becomes You' in my best MST3000 fashion.<br/><br/>To top off those special effects you have a plot that is intriguing and a story line that pulls a few surprises. Thus, I will be watching this one again just to catch everything.<br/><br/>Now, for me, the only flaw was that it seemed too long. The pacing is real good and the cinematography is superb but after a certain point my mind couldn't absorb anymore. It may have simply been because I was up the previous night til 3:00 AM fixing a 'bug' at work for a program that isn't even mine!....>ahem< scuse my rant...er..or maybe this movie did 'have too many notes'. A second viewing should confirm or dispel this. But I will most certainly enjoy the second viewing as I did the first.<br/><br/>Good thrills. Lotsa excitement. Some definite laffs.

","I watched Pirates of the Caribbean after most of the rage about it had died down so that I could construct my own opinion about it. I had been very skeptical about the whole idea of a pirate movie because it was not a genre that I was attracted to at all. I believe that the movie was very well portrayed on screen by the actors, and the plot was very interesting. I constantly wondered what would happen next. It was not what I had expected from a pirate movie. I had expected the classic, search-for-buried-treasure-on-an-island story. This movie proved my skepticism wrong.<br/><br/>I admit, the movie did seem too lengthy, but I couldn't imagine the movie any other way than it is. Part of my interest in the movie was the multiple themes it had. It was full of action, adventure, comedy, romance, and some drama. I think that this aspect of the film either attracted members of the audience, or turned them off in confusion. The movie must be watched more than once to fully grasp its whole feel. The audience must view it with an open mind for the movie to truly come to life.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie had an array of themes also must have attracted a vast audience. The movie leaves no one wanting. The actors, especially, delivered spectacular performances, and the whole movie was made believable, and reeled me in. It is a very exciting and entertaining movie, and I believe most people would enjoy it."

","In a summer full of blockbuster sequels like the Matrix , X2, Terminator 3, etc, it's great to see a new contender enter the ring. Okay, it's not entirely original as it's supposedly based on the Disneyland theme park ride of the same name, but I'm willing to forgive them in this case. This film is one of the funniest, most exciting and entertaining films I've seen in a long time. This won't surprise you if you're a fan of Mousehunt like me. In that film director Gore Verbinski proved that he had the great ability to balance slapstick comedy with dark subject matter. Given a larger canvas, exotic locations, a huge budget and Johnny Depp he has given us a movie that proves the potential he first showed.<br/><br/>The plot follows the adventures of pirate Jack Sparrow as he attempts to track down his ship, The Black Pearl, and get his revenge on the crew that betrayed him. Meanwhile however the crew have fallen foul to an Aztec curse that has turned them into the walking dead, doomed to appear in their true form (frightening rotting corpses) when exposed to moonlight. This doesn't sound like the basis of a rollicking action comedy but believe me, it is. Johnny Depp based his pirate character on Ronnie Wood (of Rolling Stones fame), reasoning that pirates were the rock legends of their day, and results have to be seen to be believed. When you leave the cinema you will believe that Depp is the greatest actor of our generation, and if he doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for this I will lose all faith in the Academy. I wouldn't recommend this movie to younger children, as I think the scenes with the zombies could cause nightmares, but for everyone else - you must see this film!"

Too much and it will cause it too be Matrix like, to little and it doesn't fit the cinemas expectations.<br/><br/>First I didn't think Johnny Depp would fit to this movie, but today we know good actors can fit in to any movie thy want to. Acting drunk makes the whole film worth seeing, with meanings you didn't expect from a pirate. Jack Sparrow is both kind hearted and pirate, a pirate that you didn't think existed. Well it all makes the film good and might win some awards.<br/><br/>
Johnny Depp makes this movie worth the price too look at, but he can't take credit for all. Jonathan Pryce doesn't make this movie funny but he doesn't need too, it is nice to have some strictness in a movie that is solemn like this. When I read what another user had commented, I became very hungry two rewrite the review to make it all clear and no misunderstandings. He did say that it was a spoil in the movie, he sad Jack Sparrow was cursed all the time in the movie, I just have to say watch the movie again and you will se what really happened!<br/><br/>Now I'm not a movie expert, but how did thy really manage to go under water with a boat upside down and don't flout up to the surfs.

","This rollicking film version of Disney's most popular ride brings the viewer everything they expect ¬ñ sword fights, gun battles, debauchery, alley cats, the whole lot delivered with the tongue fixed very firmly in cheek.

Keira Knightley gives a feisty performance as the girl who is promised to the stuffy commodore,but loves the humble blacksmith Orlando Bloom. Of the principals, only Bloom failed to make much impression, although much of that could be due to the fact that his character is fairly `straight' and all the others are so over the top.<br/><br/>Depp's performance is so reminiscent of HMS Pinafore, that I kept expecting him to burst into song - `I am the Pirate King' ¬ñ and the non-stop hilarious action , thrills and special effects owe more to Raiders of the Lost Ark than to the pirate movies of the 40s.

Even after many of my friends saw the film and told me it was worthwhile, my hesitation continued. Finally, just the other day, I was overruled at a friend's house and had no choice but to watch it or go home. And it was cold outside! <br/><br/>Having now seen the film, I must first say: thank god for Johnny Depp. Because without his hilarious and utterly original performance as the slightly mad and infinitely colorful Captain Jack Sparrow, I probably would have hated this film. Moving like a man who has forgotten how to walk on land, with his unusual accent and flamboyant gesticulation, Captain Jack is a guy you just have to like. But every time the action moved away from him, I tended to lose interest. I don't mean to slam the rest of the cast - they were all solid. And the film's production values are also fine, with excellent special effects and cinematography. But with the exception of Depp's performance I didn't find anything truly remarkable about it, even considering its genre. The film simply belongs to him.<br/><br/>Since POTC's release, fans have been suggesting that Depp receive an Oscar nomination as Best Actor. Although I've been a fan of his for years, I couldn't imagine it - not for this (again, a movie based on a theme-park ride??), anyway - but now I understand. The Disney Corporation should be thanking their lucky stars that the man accepted the role, because without Depp, POTC would be hardly worth remembering at all, and an actor who can carry a film in such a way is a brilliant actor indeed."

Although the similarities are somewhat few and far between this is probably a good thing as it escapes the Disney marketing attempt feel.<br/><br/>The extremely well chosen cast could never be better with Johnny Depp brilliantly playing the light-hearted mostly-drunk pirate Jack Sparrow (sorry Captain Jack Sparrow). He provides most of the comedy in his one-liners, lucky escapes and defiant bragging. The romance is between the kidnapped Governors daughter Elizabeth Swann, (Kiera Knightly) and Will Turner (played wonderfully by man-of-the-moment Orlando Bloom) who comes to her rescue. The typical cursed pirate, Captain Barbossa of the titular 'Black Pearl'  (played by Geoffrey Rush) is the all round bad guy shouting traditional pirate phrases. The CG (done by Industrial Light and Magic) is literally ground breaking with cursed pirates turning from skeletal to flesh as they battle in and out of moonlight. This gives both an eerie and astonishing effect.<br/><br/>To round off there are action scenes galore with numerous sword fights and canon fire which are amazing and really keep the film up to speed.<br/><br/>THE EXTRAS No DVD is complete nowadays without extras. With a full extra disc there is quite a lot to keep one amused for hours. There are three commentaries, which really depend on what you want to get out of a commentary the first is with Gore Verbinski (director) and Johnny Depp, which is surprisingly quite dull mainly thanking various people for hard work. If you are looking for trivia then the partial commentary with Jerry Bruckheimer (producer) or commentary with scriptwriters is for you, but the one I found the best is the commentary with actors Kiera Knightly and Jack Davenport (who plays Commodore Norrington) This commentary is also partial but is the funniest. The partial commentary is something I have never come across before but is quite an advantage, as you don't have to watch the whole film again and listen to people drone on about scenes that weren't really important to them. The downfall I felt to this DVD is the interactive menus which if you just want to get the film to play means time is lost waiting for menus to load. Back to positive and the second disc holds loads of good stuff. The first I checked out was the blooper real with the actors messing up, which you don't quite often get to see. The bad thing about this is that it was only 3mins. There are 19 deleted scenes, which I didn't really feel were very interesting so it just as well they stayed deleted. There are many different featurettes on this disc. The ones I'm liking the most is the Epic at Sea, Diary of a Pirate and Fly on the set which are all on the set interviewing actors etc.  which prove very interesting and in depth. There is also `Walt Disney Wonderful World of Color' which shows a bit about the ride for all who haven't been on it. The last line is I think this is a wonderful movie and the DVD really compliments it well."

","This film is one of the best films I hve ever seen. I went to the pictures to see it five times and if I could watch it again right now, I'd be there! Each time I watched it I got more and more out of it!<br/><br/>The first time I watched it I knew that just once wouldn't do it justice. The score for this film was so good! The music just got you so involved! The camera angles and shots were perfect and caught every detail without making it boring.<br/><br/>The script was wonderful and just packed with one liners that have now become well known sayings in many households already. The fight sequences were just right, they didn't drag on and you werent left sitting there saying ""Oh the possibilities of that fight!""<br/><br/>It was also such a well done period film that you didn't feel like it was a different period at all but like you were really there. I don't think I really have to comment on the acting because everyone regardless of having seen it or not knows how excellent everyone in the film was. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were both done up and acted so well that you would not have picked them from any other time, place, or film. Well Done 10/10"

","Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best films of 2003 and is the best film of the summer.  It features all the perfect elements of a great film: romance, laughs, adventure, action, and walking skeletons. The pirate film genre has been sucsessfully brought back to life due to a great cast. <br/><br/>Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightly) is the Govener's daughter in the Caribbean who found a cursed pirate medallion.  When pirates, led by the relentless Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush), kidnap Elizabeth in order to break a deadly curse, Will Turner the blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) and the hillarious Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) set out to rescue her.  Throghout the dangers of the high seas, there are planty of laughs, thrills and chills. The pirates have a frightening secret that can only be cured from the blood of the child of Bootstrap Bill.  Soon, everyone realizes whose blood must be spilt.<br/><br/>Orlando, Geoffery, and Kiera make outstanding performances in this film but Johnny Depp is worth the video rental price alone.  He completly charmed the audience and made them laugh until tears came out of their eyes. <br/><br/>If you love a hillarious, exciting adventure, Pirates is for you.<br/><br/>5/5"

","I wasn't overly impressed with the movie itself.  The characters were interesting, the story a bit confusing, but I love everybit that Johnny Depp plays.<br/><br/>Like in previous comments about where Johnny Depp is in films, he is one of the most talented performers I have seen on film. Aside from being good looking (yes I am a guy and yes, I do think he is good looking), he is also a fantastic performer; one who brings real character to his performance and characters.<br/><br/>He is always somebody who attracts attention and doesn't need to carry a big gun and blow s**t up to do it.<br/><br/>Every role he portrays is delivered with gusto and humor, even if the scene is morbid...figure that out.<br/><br/>When Hollywood is looking for action hereos, they just have to look to Depp. (not the highest paying actor in film, but far far better than Jim Carrey)<br/><br/>I look forward to more films with Johny Depp in them and woould like to see something that he can direct/write or create.<br/><br/>I have never had the luxury to work with him, but hopefully someday I will.<br/><br/>By chance, if you do get to read this Johnny, there are several fantastic screenplays that require your presence and you can reach me to find out more about them."

","Pirates of the Caribbean has to be one of the greatest of Johnny depps movies, it follows the path of Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) and Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) as they struggle to rescue the lovely Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightly) and re-claim the black pearl, once belonging to Captain Jack Sparrow until his first mate Captain Barbosa(Rush) lead a mutiny against him and left him stranded on a desert isle with nothing but a pistol with a single bullet in it. The twist is that the captain of the black pearl (Barbosa) and all of his crew have a curse upon them and they need a gold medallion and a certain persons blood to lift the curse,both belonging to Elizabeth Swan or so they think, and so the love struck Will Turner sets out to save her accompanied by the swish and charismatic Jack Sparrow. excellent performances all round, especially the fantastic accent from Johnny Depp, savvy? 10/10 a must see."
"Mrcheeks","Null","0","0","16 November 2003"," Pirates, action and comedy. It made for a good film.
","I must start with I did expect it to be better but at the same time did not watch it with any expectations from the storyline. I was actually quite surprised by Johnny Depps performance because I sometimes feel his performances could have been better based on his previous work. Also I knew he'd be speaking with an accent which I anticipated my be very poor like the way he spoke in the 9nth Gate. It was anything but. <br/><br/>His character was by far the most likable. Orlando Bloom was decent but I think many not so well knowns could have given an equally good performance if not better. By the end of the movie they try to pretty up his character with his glued on facial hair and weaved in extensions hanging and styled which are so obviously fake and so obviously loaded with hair gel. Hollywoods desperate for sex cymbals I see. <br/><br/>Anyway the film revolves around a group of pirates that have been cursed for their greed and misdeeds by a bounty they were paid in cursed gold. Captain Jack Sparrow is out to get revenge and his ship back which the cursed pirates who committed mutiny on him now live their curse on. Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) is the son of one of these pirates that was murdered by his own shipmates and is needed to break the curse. Basically its a story of boy loves girl, girl protects boy and by doing so gets kidnapped. Everyone in the film is after the Black Pearl for one reason or another. There are some great action scenes, a good amount of humor and of course pirates. The special effects were pretty good too and added just that much more to the films plot being carried out. <br/><br/>No I wouldn't give it a ten but just for the opening scene where Johnny Depp arrives in the docks it gets a 7. It was a classic Hollywood moment where art, humor and reality meets up in a way we just love to see, and don't often anymore with most films. Worth watching more than once for sure."

","So we've all heard enough about Depp's incredible performance in Pirates.  I've seen all his films, and while I wouldn't say it is his best (I have a strong affection for Ed Wood and DeadMan), it's still the best performance by anyone in a big-budget picture so far this year.  If there was any justice in this world, Depp would get an Oscar because he created this character himself.  All he had to go on was dialogue, and out of this he brought to life the incredible insanity of Jack Sparrow.  You don't see this type of active creation much in actors nowadays. Anyway, to make this short, here's my prediction: there is no justice in this world, so Depp won't get the Oscar.  But, if he doesn't get a Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy/musical, you will know then truly that the world is coming to an end."

","I must confess, at the beginning I was not very enthusiastic about seeing this movie. I wondered ""What new thing can be told about pirates?"" not to mention that pirates movies were not precisely my main choice, due to terrible flicks such as ""Cutthroat Island"" (yuck), but then I said, if I'm going to criticize a movie I have to see it, right? OK, so I went to the movie theater with my pals, expecting to see a big waste of money, but, you know what? You can imagine, I LOVED IT! yes, I found it really amusing, but not banal, you know, everything was perfectly synchronized to work, to make laugh, even to scare. I have to say that Mr. Johnny Depp's performance is OUT OF THIS WORLD, fantastic, I'm not saying that his previous films were not superior, actually, some of them are; but I rediscovered Mr. Depp with this film, he is really a comedic actor. I can even suggest the Academy a well deserved award for him. Or for Mr. Geoffrey Rush. AMAZING! he is another great actor who doesn't take himself so seriously, giving his character a special dose of sarcasm and fun. Then, the lead couple, Orlando Bloom & Kyra Knightley (hope I wrote it right), they just do their job, I'm not saying they're bad, but their characters are not really as appealing as Depp's and Rush's roles are. But I must say She is gorgeous. Then, the delirious crew of the Black Pearl, they are simply funny! What else, oh yeah, the art direction, the costume design, the special effects, the makeup; those characteristics that can even be more important than the story of acting (Terminator 3?), but in this movie, they just combine perfectly to deliver an excellent product."

","A key moment in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" comes with our first glimpse of Johnny Depp as Captian Jack Sparrow.  He's standing proudly atop the mast of his vessel as it sails into Port Royal, hair rustling in the wind, the score thundering in full galleon-plowing-the-waves mode.  Then a couple shots later, it's revealed that Jack's ""ship"" is a battered dingy so full of leaks that it makes the last several feet into port mostly submerged.  The anticlimactic entrance sets the same tongue-in-cheek feel I remember from the Disney theme park ride which inspired the film.  It's this sense of fun that saves the movie--if Gore Verbinski had approached the material in all seriousness (a la ""Cutthroat Island""), ""Pirates"" would have been unendurable.  As it is, we've got a nice popcorn movie on our hands, where the pleasures are occasionally guilty, but pleasures nonetheless.<br/><br/>The ""Black Pearl"" of the subtitle is a pirate ship--Jack Sparrow's ship, or at least it was before his first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) led a mutiny and marooned him.  But not long afterwards, the Black Pearl's crew runs afoul of some cursed Aztec gold, which dooms them to an undead existence (as Jack himself points out, the whole mutiny business kind of worked out for him in the long run).  In a rather gruesome echo of ""Swan Lake,"" the cursed pirates appear normal until exposed to moonlight, which reveals them as decayed cadavers.  To break the curse, they need a certain medalion and a blood tribute, both of which end up involving the high-born Elizabeth (Kiera Knightley), and blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who worships her from afar.<br/><br/>Along the way, there's as many chases, escapes, ship battles, swordfights, and general swashbuckling as you'd expect in this kind of film--perhaps even more.  It's somewhat unfortunate that the best of these sequences should be the first, a duel between Jack and Will in a smithy.  But there are some nice visuals during the climax, with the undead pirates darting in and out of shafts of moonlight.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, this movie belongs to Johnny Depp.  He's made a career of playing characters who are slightly odd, but Jack Sparrow is perhaps the oddest of them all.  Looking more than slightly seedy and moving as if he's perpetually falling off-balance, Jack has the manic gleam of someone who's very brilliant and/or very crazy.  He doesn't just march to his own drummer, he's a rhythm all to himself.  That Geoffrey Rush manages to match Depp for energy speaks a lot for his talent.  These are two actors clearly enjoying themselves to the hilt, and their joy carries over to the audience.  About all the rest of the cast can do is try to keep up with them.  Bloom, who has the unenviable task of playing straight man to Depp, manages very well in the young lover role.  Looking more rugged and less ethereal than he does in the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, he establishes his candicacy as a bona-fide leading man.  I also liked the work of Jack Davenport as the Royal Navy officer who's Jack's nemisis and Will's romantic rival.  Such a character could easily have been your standard-issue unimaginative stiff, but Davenport fleshes out the part nicely.<br/><br/>The greatest weakness of ""Pirates"" is the ending, which extends the resolution out far longer than feels necessary.  But the trip there is a delightful one, delivering laughs and action in equal shares.  Drink up, me harties."

","Synopsis Spoiler! Ship-A-Hoy My Matey.  As the title states, this is a movie about pirates who are under an ancient curse. Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) runs the Black Pearl with a crew of the undead.  Because of the curse, the ship is doomed to sail the Caribbean Sea for eternity looking for the loss treasure.  The curse will be removed if they are able to put all the gold coins back into the gold chest.  Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) received one of these gold coins from his father as a child.  However, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) took the coin from Will and has it in her possession.  The pirates kidnap her and the swashbuckling action begins. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) helps in the rescue of Elizabeth and the return of his ship, the Black Pearl.  The special effects of the battle scenes and the skeletons of the dead pirates were well done.  However, the acting of Depp was the biggest drawback of the movie.  Depp played an incompetent captain, and I think he was also an incompetent actor in this part with terrible makeup.  All the bad pirates played their parts very well, however, you didn't know if Captain Jack Sparrow was a good pirate or a bad pirate.  Even though Disney made this movie, this is not a movie to take your kids. 5/10"

","Most genres suffer the effects of booms and depressions associated with audience fickleness and the current trend. Only the Action, Thriller and Drama genres retain any sense of stability. Therefore the large ¬ñ scale investment in a movie which does not have the benefit of a boom period is a risky one. ¬ëPirates Of The Caribbean' is an attempt at regenerating the pirate movie with a movie so bold that it even has a sub ¬ñ title thus indicating the intent of future development of the concept. The pay ¬ñ off could be big or it could be a major loss. The achieved success is a consequence of the producers doing their homework. If it was a gamble, it was a confident one.<br/><br/>The elements of its success are numerous, but the one's that got the attention were the story, the acting, the characters and the visual feast. No single element took centre stage and an excellent balance was struck which ensured that audience attention was not diverted by any one element being stronger or weaker at any point in the movie. Bruckenheimer's production style is well suited to a movie such as this and his experience in the production of several Hollywood blockbusters must have significantly decreased the risk factor.<br/><br/>The story was a rich one that flowed gracefully introducing new characters at opportune times and providing sufficient obstacles for our heroes to overcome. This was crucial considering the movies length, although this time length is becoming more acceptable to audiences of today who are adapting as blockbusters are now being produced with involved stories which create greater character development. This is good for moviemakers who may sometimes find it difficult to condense stories to the allotted time limit.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief was a subconscious one since the audience knew that it was watching a story which had the fantasy of a children's book. This is a natural component of stories about pirates since they conjure up an image of outlaws living outside the natural realm. Past stories captured our imagination as we were told of these barbaric beings that slipped out from under the shadows and plundered returning to their dark realm only to return to strike another hapless target. The great expanse of the ocean abound with uncharted territories and riches to plunder accentuated this quasi ¬ñ romantic image.<br/><br/>The acting on show perfectly set aside each character as an individual who added to the story in their own way. Johnny Depp gave a style to his character that would have been amusing for the younger audience including enough expected character of a pirate so as to keep it in line with the story. As defined by him, pirates would have been something akin to rock stars in their time. This interpretation would have made it easy to be contrived which would have ruined the opportunity created for an original character. This was definitely not the case as the lines were sufficiently sublime and the acting was restrained enough so as to avoid a transparent performance. Let's not forget the assistance provided by the make ¬ñ up department in the form of eyeshadow. Which self ¬ñ respecting aspirant rock star would not have black eyeshadow? Our conventional image of a pirate was not portrayed here and this task was left to the character of Jeffrey Rush.<br/><br/>This characters entrance was tantalisingly held back as the audience were given entertaining clues as to the character of Barbossa. Lines like ¬ëhe was spat out by hell' served to create an image of extreme depravity and insatiable greed. When we see him for the first time, this image is smoothly slipped into with restraint similar to that of Depp's. He is the archetypal pirate with which the audience will readily identify. We even have the characteristic ¬ëAaaaarrr'. As with the character of Depp, there is also originality although more in line with the producers' conception of the character rather than the acting adaptation of Rush. The parrot is traded in for a monkey. This is in tandem with his hyped up image of evil since the monkey looks more mischievous than a parrot. A pirate who is supposed to be the most evil of all must have the most mischievous companion of all.<br/><br/>Who also gave a good performance and was consistent throughout. She did not fall into the trap of being too fragile and thus becoming a Scream Queen. Instead she developed into a heroine as she took the battle to ¬ëThe Black Pearl'. The originality evident in the characters of Depp and Rush was not adapted here which did not bring too much disappointment since she retained enough presence in their company. Although she looked like a clone from ¬ëTitanic', she gave enough adventurous spirit and was therefore not as fragile as a ¬ërose'. Excuse the pun, it was hard to resist. The producers were right in casting someone who had a tried and tested look with the audience, but in doing so did not build on the originality as delivered by the leading men.<br/><br/>The pirate movies that I have seen in the past all seem to visually fantastic. This one does much to continue this necessary trend. The world of the pirate is something otherworldly belonging only to our imaginations until some moviemakers give us their graphic depiction of this. The sets are at times spectacular in bringing this world to life. This movie does much to satisfy one of the requirements of the big screen which is to take our senses to another level. After all, the big screen is not ordinary ¬ñ it is grand. Why use a Mako as a prowler of the deep when you can use a Hammerhead.<br/><br/>¬ëPirates Of The Caribbean' is an enjoyable movie, but it is not particularly memorable. This was probably not the ultimate aim of the producers. Audiences are looking for quick fix panaceas to their daily stress and in depth storylines do not provide this. The movie was aimed at profit ¬ñ taking in the short ¬ñ term. This means that the movie would have to be devoid of messages, but high on family amusement. This allows the producers to target the mass audience and thus make the movie more bankable. It is important to note that the story itself is not weak, it fact as previously mentioned it is a rich offering many avenues for entertainment. It does, however, fall short of the ideal for the stage that it graces. The grand stage requires a story of greater magnitude, which will entertain as well as teach for generations to come. Notwithstanding this fact, there are at present certain economic realities that the producers are paying attention to. Hopefully the future holds greater prospect for stories down the generations."

I'm a big fan of Orlando Bloom, and I went just to see his performance, but ended up liking Johnny Depp and Kiera Knightley's performances just as much. It's a perfect movie to see with the whole family, it's funny for the comedians in the family; action packed for your son; and if you have a daughter, she will love Elizabeth(Knightley) and may try to imatate her every action! Although, the skeletons mey be too scary for some younger one's, the movie's plot makes the skeletons more funny than scary. When I went to see it, I was expecting a more serious movie like Lord of the Rings, but it is far too histerical to even compare with Lord of the Rings. If you've been to the Disney attraction at Disney World, you will notice parts of the movie have parts of the ride in it, like the jailers trying to get the keys from the dog, or the one pirate sleeping with the pigs. You and your family will love this movie of the year."

","I've read the other comments of people who have seen this movie, and I agree with any superlatives given to the movie, the leading actors, the character actors, the effects, etc.  This is one film I will want to see again and again. In fact, I have seen it four times thus far and I can't wait to see it again before it leaves the theaters.  So much goes on, it is impossible to catch everything the first few times around.<br/><br/>One major contribution to the movie is the fantastic music throughout. Klaus Badelt, who wrote the music, caught the EXACT flavor of each scene with each of his pieces.  Even without the benefit of seeing the movie, his music is the epitome of pirates.<br/><br/>While I am not a movie critic, I know what I like, and it's ""Pirates."" Johnny Depp, you are sexy and a master thespian; Orlando Bloom, you are on your way; Geoffrey Rush, be my pirate any time!<br/><br/>Ho, Ho, Ho, a Pirate's Life for Me!"

","I have little reason to fault this film as it went well beyond my expectations. Ok so the original premise is a bit odd...an adaptation of a theme park ride...but the execution of the story is incredible. The story isn't hard to grasp, so all the more time to absorb the characters, scenery and those incredible sets. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is at the peak of his game. The character needs do nothing but enter the scene to shed humour on the screen. If Rolling Stone Keith Richards were a pirate this is what he'd be like I'm sure! Orlando Bloom is always nice to look at whilst Geoffrey Rush is finally getting the exposure and the parts he deserves. The movement back and forth from human to skeleton isn't bad and the detail in the two ships is excellent. I found there not to be a moment where I checked my watch through the film other than when I had to go to the loo...there was a reason for the 90 minute feature...It's a bit of fun, and fun it is. Watch it and enjoy! I wanna be a pirate when I grow up...!"

","I had serious doubt about a Disney movie based on a funride. The fact that it was a pirate movie only added to that (remember Cutthroat Island, anyone?) More or less forced to watch it, I was very pleasantly surprised. Johnny Depp delivers a performance I think even he will find hard to top. Geoffrey Rush was good as Barbosa. Keira Knightley was brilliantly cast however, playing ms.Swann with conviction and clearly with a lot of fun. Finally, Orlando Bloom. Yes, what to say of Bloom? Good, but as he showed in LOTR, he can do much better then this.<br/><br/>The movie itself was very funny, and with enough action to keep everyone's attention focused on the screen. The ladies will adore Depp and Bloom, and the fella's? Well, let's just Keira Knightley can call me anytime, however unlikely that may be.<br/><br/>Great effects mixed in with good stuntwork and absolutely superb acting, with Depp delivering an absolutely believable yet over the top Captain Jack Sparrow. I enjoyed it a lot, and can recommend it to anyone."
"fdextro","Null","0","0","27 September 2003"," Why do people fight an unkillable enemy? Answer:
","The one question that keeps popping up concerning this highly entertaining film is, why do people fight so valiantly against an unkillable enemy? Watch it again and you'll discover that no one believes in the curse.  Those dutiful soldiers think they're just attacking a bunch of rag-tag flesh and blood pirates.  When these scurvy knaves finally show themselves to be half-rotted skeletons, what are the soldiers to do?  Lay down and die?  Of course not, because if you were confronted with certain death, I'm sure you'd keep fighting in a manic (though futile) hope that somehow you'll live.  In this case, that seemingly stupid effort works because of Depp's infiltration into the curse.  Remember, Depp never bothered to lift a sword until he joined the curse, then battled away only to divert attention so the curse could be lifted, thus doing away with his mortal enemy in the most timely of fashion.  So mateys, thar is your answer."

","Pirates like Johnny are a new breed. They can singlehandedly bring a long movie to life and instill it with the fun and wit of the original screenplay. My complements to the writers'(Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert) of this fabulously fun, if not a tad long when Johnny's larger then life character (Jack Sparrow) is off the screen, movie. My expectations of PotC:TCotBP were high and low at the same time... the movie had some good actors, but was based on a funpark ride... I found that plotwise it worked just like the funpark ride itself (probably - haven't experienced it my self). Waiting for the next bit did occur quite a few times, but when the next bit came it was very fun. The screenplay and Johnny's delivery of it make this movie really worth watching - enjoy!"

","Yes, I have seen POTC in the theater 3 times. And yes, there were those certain parts I laugh at every time. It amazing to think that Disney has finally made a movie that adults aren't forced to see because their kids are giddy over it. I at first didn't comprehend the fact that it was directly related to a ride at Disneyland, and just the fact that Johnny Depp was wearing eyeliner made me countdown the days until it came out. POTC, in many ways, was a completely awesome movie. Hilariously ironic and witty, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are a great acting couple, and the movie all in all gives you mixed emotions. But there are those times when you wonder why it's rated PG-13 instead of R (we can't do that 'what was the pirate movie rated? -- ARRR' joke now, darnit!), and then you realize that it probably would be a bit better if it had more graphic details and more scenes that make you jump in it.<br/><br/>This movie was the first actually GOOD movie to come out in a while. I'm just afraid they'll try to make a sequel (like every OTHER Disney movie) and ruin the entire thing. Which, unfortunantly, they'll probably try. Sigh, the life of a pirate lover -- you're never happy with what ya got."

","This definately is one of the best films i have ever seen, and it has been the most popular film by far with many many people each week at the cinema i work at.<br/><br/>the film has a unique and engrossing story line, incorporating many myths and themes that were around at the time of the pirates. the story centres around the initial finding of a piece of aztec gold, one of a large number of pieces which make a set. it may sound basic, but there's more to it, as the treasure is cursed, so anyone who takes even one piece of the gold becomes cursed. this is where the story kicks in, as a group of pirates have spent years trying to find all the pieces to lift the curse bestowed upon them. there is so much to summise from the fantastic plot that i won't waste time, and simply say just go and see the film. it's worth it, and besides, i'm not one to give too much away. but my pitiful summary does not do justice to the spot on story.<br/><br/>the soundtrack to the film is by far the best music score i've heard in a film for a long long time, (with the exception of Moulin Rouge of course). it's lively, yet superbly classical.<br/><br/>it has been fantastic being a projectionist for this film (among others) and I have seen the people coming out of the film just buzzing with excitment, all talking about how amazing it is. It is a rarity in as much as it appeals to all ages, and whether young or old, the reaction has almost exclusively been a huge buzz of excitement after the film. it has been filling the cinema up for every showing every day for the last 5 weeks, and many showings have often received a huge round of applause from the audiences (and that is very rare for a cinema audience to applaud at the end of a movie)<br/><br/>if you haven't seen it, then you don't know what you're missing. get to your local cinema and enjoy the adventure pirate style.<br/><br/>yo ho!"

By far the best blockbuster of the summer and maybe even the year, Pirates is a return to the good old fashioned adventure films that I grew up with. It also benefits from being one of the few big films of late that doesn't have any wire assisted slow mo kung fu (hollywood - enough already!) Both exciting and funny, Pirates has some great set pieces and a truly stand out performance from Johnny Depp who is hilarious. Orlando Bloom continues to show he could be the next 'big thing', Geoffrey Rush provides great support as the villain Captain Barbossa and Keira Knightley is, well, gorgeous!

"MaxKing","Null","0","0","14 September 2003"," A good old-fashioned, new-age swashbuckler picture!
","Ah, now THIS is what I would call a nostalgic glimpse back into the films of Errol Flynn!  From the very beginning, this movie sets itself up as the ideal old-school romantic adventure movie!  I haven't seen a movie like this since the sixties, and I must say, it has been far too long!  I had to sit back and just suck it all in, like a fresh breath of salty sea air, the first time I watched it.  A delight!  That's what it was: Simply a Delight! Alright, enough with the general singing of praise, hm?  Specifically, the movie has all the elements of a movie that make it as great as a classic: Action, Character, Humor, and a Plot that's twisted into a pretzel!  In the way of the action, what can I say?  There's something irresistibly classic about a swordfight!  And the fights were handled expertly in this movie! The stunts, too, were exhilerating to behold (Especially considering how little was done with CGIs, you know!). Moving on, the characters were all wonderfully charismatic in their own way! I think everybody's favorite would be Captain Jack Sparrow, the infamous, legendary pirate, portrayed by Johnny Depp!  HE makes the movie purely enjoyable, because he is the amalgamation of the main hero and the comic relief!  Also, his humor isn't so...blandly profane, as is usually the sad case this day and age.  No, he uses the wonderful art of subtlety and sarcasm in all his dialogue, which makes his character all the more charismatic!  The other characters include Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom.  His character is an appreciable variation on the ever-winning archetype of the young romantic hero.  His character is even more interesting when you see to what level his swordsmanship is developed, having trained himself in the art while his occupation requires him to forge the blades.  He's the amalgamation of the naive romantic hero and the skilled weapons-master, as offbeat a fusion as Sparrow's.  Next, there is the leading lady, Elizabeth Swan, Keira Knightley, whose character is, situationally, the damsel in distress.  But she is by no means the damsel who awaits rescue, fighting for herself!  She is the problem solver, who conquers her challenges with ingenius solutions.  And finally, we have the villain:  Captain Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush.  His character is the delicious combination of the sinister villain, and the everyday human being!  Even as evil, vile, and diabolical as he is, there is something wonderfully REAL about his performance!  He has a sense of humor, a sense of vulnerability in certain areas, and even a spirit of personal charisma, despite his grotesque persona and lack of morals.  These characters also have intriguing relationships between themselves that make them even more enjoyable together!  Turner is in love with Swan, and both struggle with that and the difference in their classes; Jack Sparrow is a pirate and a good man, a paradox that Turner and Swan have to come to grips with; Jack Sparrow and Barbossa have a long-lived enmity; Jack Sparrow and Turner become friends (rather analogous to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker); and Swan and Barbossa have a unique relationship as they are both as high class as the other, despite their affiliations, which makes for delightfully elegant dialogue between enemies!  The characters also have their individual secrets...But it would be unfair to spoil the movie for those who have yet to sample it themselves.  As delightful as it would be to describe myself, this is one of those movies that, like a fine Itallian dish, must be sampled personally! Now then, the humor!  Oh, the humor!  Everywhere you turn, there is a small joke thrown in!  This is the defining twist that saves the movie from drowning in its own seriousness.  It is necessary to make the movie fun (especially considering the macabre nature of the essential story by itself).  Captain Jack Sparrow offers the most abundant source of laughter, with his Groucho-esque sarcastic response to anything spoken in his general direction!  Also, his very character is as much a joke as a hero! Alongside him are two pirates, and two naval soldiers, who serve as a pair of ""Abbot and Costello"" comic relief teams.  They are the fall down men, who are there for the sole sake of being taunted and ridiculed.  A funny movie needs characters like them, for after all, what good is a joke without a butt? Finally, whenever Jack and Barbossa are paired together, it is the perfect Straight-Man vs Slick-Wit routine that never disappoints!  Those two have a wonderful chemistry, and you can't help but love them together! Finally, the plot!  An elaborately twisted, wonderfully convoluted, and sheerly wonderful piece of writing that is!  I can't describe it, to be sure.  That would be spoiling it, and I have no intention of that, let me assure you.  That would be a crime!  Suffice it to say that all the characters are believeably arranged into a spider-web of connections that all tie them to a small piece of Aztec Gold and a pirate ship!  The web spirals in twisted loops, but streams unerringly towards an exciting conclusion at the center!  What makes it even more complex is that there is as much story that is revealed as history as there is on the screen in real time!  It is as twisted and convoluted piece of literature as I have ever seen! I could not find anything to complain about in this movie!  Everything was wonderful about it!  If you haven't seen this one, I assure you, you are missing a delightful experience that will remind you why you go to the movies at all!  Rarely does a movie of this high quality come around, and even more rarely does it capture one's interest for two and a half hours! But this one met and beat all my expectations of a modern movie!  This was the easily the most enjoyable film I have seen in a long, long time!"

Geoffrey Rush is amazing... quite the chameleon... enjoyed his snarly Barbosa. Orlando Bloom looks much better as a pirate than a blonde elf. Those smouldering looks he gives sweet Keira gives him some credibility in the acting stakes. His boyish earnestness is lovely to watch. Will he be a James Bond contender?

I was very surprised to find out that Disney produced this movie after some unsuccessful tries at few children's movies. This movie is for all ages and a great movie to see with your family and for those guys who have something against chick flicks this is perfect for you. I didn't understand some scenes in the movie and took the time to see it once more; personally I understood it better and wouldn't mind seeing it once more. I would give it 9/10. The only problem was it wasn't longer!"

","You know the drill: Cursed ship, only one can break the curse, his girlfriend gets kidnapped by the undead, has to team up with a pirate to save her, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>My two cents worth: I guess the first question on whether or not you should see this movie is; How do you feel about pirate movies?  If you're not sure, try this: stand in front of the movie poster.  If your reaction is anything other than, ""Pirates of the Caribbean!  Cool!"" then nothing will salvage this movie experience for you.  It doesn't matter how much you like Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>For those of us who like pirate movies, this is a dream come true.  We've got curses!  Treasure!  Pirates who have been out on that island too long! Funny one liners!  Large complex sword fights in ridiculous places! Stuffy British naval officers!  (And a plot with more holes than a latticework gazebo, but WHO CARES!  It's a PIRATE MOVIE!)<br/><br/>Recommendations: If you like this movie, I highly recommend Princess Bride (if you haven't seen it already).  The original version (1950's)of Treasure Island is also good, and 20,000 leagues under the sea (it's better than you remember!  I promise!)  If you're a pirate movie hater (or just a movie on ship lover) any of the versions of Mutiny on the Bounty will do, also recommend the book ""True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle"" (it's a Newberry award winning 'kids' book, but adults will enjoy it too)."

Best $8 I have spent on a movie in a long time. This film doesnt attempt to be a serious, straight-faced pirate movie.  It is funny, lots of action, good story, and very funny.  It pokes fun at itself by adding old pirate cliches in. Johnny Depp is a good pick to play an unusual, off-the-wall character.

","Getting lost in the sumptuousness of it all was easy to do watching the old masted schooners and the fierce hearties that sail them ballet across the screen. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is this  summer's  guilty pleasure for this old movie buff. Disney Films are still good at decorating legends and fairy tales that  delight  a child's imagination.  Even the child that  still remains in a codger brought up on Bambi and Snow White and The Alamo (Davey Crocket version), the Spanish Main etc. etc.<br/><br/>These new theaters with stadium seating are an answered prayer for old movie lovers.  (I sure do like to see old movies  in them.)  You can actually see the entire screen from almost every seat, and it is huge, and the sound!  My god, it comes from all over the place!!  And if Orlando Bloom  is  not  quite Errol Flynn, he  makes  up for  it  in earnestness and intensity.   A standout in Lord of the Rings, this young Brit has matinee idol written all over him.  (Do they still call them that?)<br/><br/>So much had been written about  Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. But I was not really  prepared for the campy swagger, one critic said he sashayed, and by gosh, he did!!  But remember his Bon Bon in that Cuban writers story. What ghoulish androgyny and eye-liner!  An Ancient Mariner cum Flying Dutchmen in Disney-color, yet.  I could not stop laughing.  And the special effects and warty skeleton mates. Straining every digital trick yet available. It was a ghastly crew!  And the real Dutchman in this patchwork fable, Captain Barbossa, is played by Geoffrey Rush, chewing the scenery and spitting out Elgin Marbles.   Also the beautiful young (18?) Keira Knightley held her own among the talent heavy males, to be saved from a boring marriage, willing for Senta-like self-sacrifice.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I loved it."

","SOME VERY SLIGHT SPOILERS IN HERE I thought it would be one of those lame pirate movies. But Pirates of the caribbean was far from it. It had all the genres in it. But if I had too pick one it would be action. Espiccaly when Bolson and Jack (Johnny depp) fight. I like it when the pirates of the black pearl go into the moonlight and become skellintons,then when they go inside become normal. POC has loads of COMEDY in it which is great. I hardly ever watch movies without comedy in them. And i'll never watch a doom and gloom movie like Titanic with no funny bits. Anyway the acting is brilliant,espiccaly Johhny depp. (whose character in the film is supposed to be based on Keith Richard). All the sword fighting scenes are unbelievable. They should make a second film of POC, and since its made so much money they,probally will! All the movies i've seen don't compare to this. out of ten i would rate this 11 out of ten."

The plot was complete (better than a themepark ride-based movie has a right to be), the sword-play was good, and the acting was just phenomenal. Although Orlando Bloom may be eye candy, I hate to admit this, but, he can't act. Keira Knightley plays the damsel-in-distress (although she does a better job of it than most other actresses would). But Johnny Depp completely steals the show! I didn't expect much when I first went to see it, but when he came on screen, I just couldn't take my eyes off him. Not only is Johnny Depp completely hot and very sexy, but he is just hilarious! When I first saw the movie, tears were coming out of my eyes because I was laughing so hard! He makes all the other characters fade away because he has such presence in every scene. Not to mention the accent. I can't believe some people have the nerve to say it was too long, because when I saw it, the time just slipped away and I couldn't believe that it was 2 hours and 23 minutes long! Kudos to the moviemakers for doing an excellent job on making the movie move along at a fast clip.<br/><br/>The ONE bad thing about the movie is that it will be a horrible wait for the DVD.

","When i first saw the trailers of the film it looked O.K. I wasn't desperate to see it, but my best mate is in love with Orlando Bloom and so i went with her. This movie is not what i expected it to be. Yes it is a bit long and some scenes could of been cut, but the reason why i didn't go to the loo in the middle of the movie was because of Johnny Depp's character, Captain Jack Sparrow. He is probably my most favorite movie character since Maximus(Gladiator-Russell Crowe)appeared on our screens in 2000. Jack Sparrow is funny, drunk,(i think)and charasmatic and steals the show. I thought i would just be staring at Orlando bloom because he is so cute, but by the end of the movie i basically fell in love with Depp and his character. Orlando(Will Turner)i thought was alright, a bit soppy but i still think he is just about his good looks and not his acting ability i hate to say. Orlando's character is very one dimensional and he really only shone when he was interacting with Johnny Depp. Keira Knightley(Elizabeth Swann)played the girl of the film, not much to do, but argue, scream a bit and fall in love. Her role was quite boring and very predictable. I expexcted a bit more from Geoffrey Rush because i think he is an incredible actor, but he did pretty good especially in his sword fighting for a man his age! But Depp is the star of this movie and no-one can take that away from him. His facial expressions and actions cracked me up everytime. This is a great fun film for all ages, its got romance,comedy,action and Johnny Depp!! In the cinema for the past 2 years, we have been dominated with comic book movies, and sequels. Finally we can see something which is different and a lot of fun!! I mean what is so interesting about a man getting angry and turning green!!!!!"

""The Hulk"" was meant to be ILM's showcase this summer - but the work here simply blows the ""Hairy Shrek"" away.<br/><br/>And as I've already mentioned, it sustains interest for nearly two and a half hours. The action sequences in the final act don't drag at all, by virtue of cross cutting between a number of interlinking story strands.<br/><br/>I can't understand why anyone would say it went on too long, because it was such a phenomenal trip.<br/><br/>In closing.

","Who would have thought that the pirate genre could be made to successfully walk the gangplank again? And who who would have imagined that producer Jerry Bruckheimer - the guy behind a succession of violent action movies like ""The Rock"" - would be the man to do it? But here we have family entertainment at its best - non-stop action, lots of humour, effective special effects and great locations (St Vincent). <br/><br/>What really makes the movie though is the clever casting.<br/><br/>
Johnny Depp gives a marvellously camp performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, the most charming rogue ever to stride the decks. Geoffrey Rush, as his rival to command the ""Black Pearl"", is even madder here than in ""Shine"". British viewers of the television series ""The Office"" will find Mackenzie Crook giving an eye-catching performance. Orlando Bloom, after his heroics in ""Lord Of The Rings"", gives us some more dash and bravery. While young and sweet Keira Knightley, following her freshness in ""Bend It Like Beckham"", obtains the big break that is likely to secure her a successful career.<br/><br/>

","Pirates of the Caribbean is by far one of the most entertaining films I have seen in a very long time. After the betrayal of Matrix Reloaded I was not prepared to enjoy this film quite as much as I actually did. Perhaps because it was not what I expected.<br/><br/>It is not actually a comedy and despite the subject matter it ironically avoids descending into absurdity (unlike the last 3 James Bond films) to get big laughs. It does however have some golden moments, the dialogue is sharp, the story is coherent and believable.<br/><br/>What is it then? It is a hard core action adventure and the strangest thing about it is how believable it actually is. I think this is because it offers something more than just great special effects and swash buckling sword fights (both of which give Gladiator and Lord of the Rings a run for their money).<br/><br/>The characters have very human and real motivations: love, greed, honour, the desire to be free. All those visceral and primitive emotions that every human heart has experienced at some time lend that essential 3rd dimension to an otherwise conventional tale of high seas adventure, cursed treasure, and, of course, Pirates. There aren't any real surprises but at least you know what is going on.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is just magical as Captain Jack Sparrow but his camp Keith Richards swagger has excellent competition in Geoffrey Rush's villainous Barbosa. Again there was the potential for things to end up being cartoonish but the performances created authentic and interesting characters. Orlando Bloom's love lorn William Turner is just lovely on so many levels. Most of the fun comes from seeing how difficult it actually is to buckle a swash. What ever that is.<br/><br/>It makes a change for the Characters and Writing to make the film instead of the effects.<br/><br/>It is difficult to find something bad to say to about the film but since no film can be perfect I would have to say the least believable thing was the 'love interest'. But it is perhaps the habit that Hollywood has of putting 21st century females into period films that made her a bit too butch for a well born lady of the time. The fact that she could actually swim is even suspicious.<br/><br/>Maybe it was just the air conditioned comfort that made it so good (it was 100 degrees outside at the time) but I am going to give Pirates of the Caribbean *3 pairs of pants.<br/><br/>1. it was almost 3 hours long. In spite of its Piratey goodness no film has any excuse to last 160 minutes.<br/><br/>2. I did not go to this film to see anything involving a woman. One could have easily done with out the wench in my opinion. The story would have been a bit different but no less interesting and probably much shorter.<br/><br/>3. they didn't have my favourite candies at the pick and mix.<br/><br/>4. the last 10 minutes or so did get a bit silly. I wont tell you what that is all about but I am sure you will agree a better ending could have been provided.<br/><br/>5. For some reason it is affiliated with Disney.<br/><br/>Ok I know that is five pairs of pants and I only gave it three but it was about PIRATES and let's face it, that Orlando Bloom is one exemplary piece of buccaneer booty. Huzzah!<br/><br/>*please note that the clareangelus Pants scale is all about how bad a film ISN'T. The fewer Pants you get the better it is!"

","I have to admit that I didn't have high hopes for Pirates of the Caribbean. Orlando Bloom speaks in a flat monotone voice, I had no idea of who Keira Knightly was, and I hadn't heard a peep out of Johnny Depp or Geoffrey Rush for ages. Besides, wasn't I too old for Disney movies anyway? After the poor special effects job I saw on Ang Lee's `The Hulk', I was wondering how the people at Disney could pull off pirate skeletons. What I expected and what I got were two very different things. 	Cursed undead pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Rush) kidnap the aristocratic Elizabeth Swann (Knightly) in hopes of removing the curse that turns them into walking skeletons by full moonlight. Her long-time admirer Will Turner (Bloom) sets out to rescue her with the help of wanted pirate Jack Sparrow (Depp). It's a conventional plot with conventional characters, and if I said any more, I'd ruin the whole story. Everybody played his or her roles very stereotypically. The person who single-handedly saved the show was Depp. Of course it looks like he's getting electric shocks to his face, and with all that makeup he might be an exotic dancer in the off-season, but Depp really got involved with his character, and it shows. He's always there to provide some hilarity to an otherwise dry movie. His dueling scenes with Bloom and Rush are easily among the best fighting sequences in the movie. (The rest of the fight scenes were pretty bad) Depp even had a handful of his teeth replaced by gold ones just to look the part. He had to take some out, or risk overacting.<br/><br/>	Although he'd reportedly like to be in a movie that doesn't involve swords, Bloom is certainly good with them. It's a long jump from a blonde archer elf to a swashbuckling blacksmith-turned-pirate, but he excels at it. All the sword handling he used as Legolas certainly hasn't gone to waste. However, the big fluffy hat with a feather in it that he used wore in the last few scenes looked terrible on him. 	Disney took a big risk on this movie. This is the first movie made by Disney to get a rating higher than PG. By getting a PG-13 rating, they risked alienating the moviegoers who thought that this movie would be more kid-friendly. The title was even changed from `Pirates of the Caribbean' to `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' in hopes that there could be a sequel. This is also the first live-action movie made by Disney in a long time.  It's obvious that Disney poured a lot of money into this project, and Disney and viewers certainly got what they paid for. 	But this movie does have its downsides. Bloom and Knightly couldn't make a less convincing couple if they had been in separate movies. The movie did stretch on just a little bit too long, and it's hard to create life-and-death situations with pirates who just can't die. Too much of the pirates' conduct is governed by a set of rules, which are more like guidelines anyway, as is pointed out several times in the movie. Captain Sparrow spends too much time in jail, and past events are hinted at too much. 	Despite the length of the movie and all the rest of its shortcomings, Pirates of the Caribbean has revived a genre I thought was long dead and buried. A genre I thought belonged only to yesteryear. 	That's all I have to say about that."

","SPOILERS INCLUDED<br/><br/>This film is brilliant! I'm an enourmous fan of films which encouraged you to think and consider parts of life. In the end of it all however, nobody can complain about this typical no brainer hollywood blockbuster. This is a brilliant film with a marvellous script, a stunning turn by Johnny Depp & amazing graphics (keep an eye out for the final fight scene).<br/><br/>Every actor in this film gives the film their all & even the slightly infuriating character played by Orlando Bloom comes out trumps in the whole scheme of things. Truth be told though, my favourite character in this entire film is the character played by Mackenzie Crook (Gareth in ""The Office""). Crook's evil pirate is excellent, casted perfectly & at times hilarious. It is unfair however to claim he is the only one to provide humour. Every single person in this film provides excellent comedy.<br/><br/>As well as excellent acting & special effects in this film, there are many other possitive things. The music is as you'd expect by now, beautiful, the way the film flows is worthy of mention as is the strange feeling at times that you are actually watching a film which was filmed at Disney Land, and for once when watching this film, it finally feels like Hollywood has learnt it's lessons and returned partly to the types of film for which people like Errol Flynn were renowned.<br/><br/>Pirates Of The Carribean is a stunning film which I recommend everyone watches. Watch once at the cinema (twice if you feel like it, but personally the only flaw with this film is the daft certificate and it's strange appeal to noisey little brats), and then over and over again at home with a beer or two.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was the best movie of the year. I had to watch this one twice because `I just couldn't resist'. There were so many wonderfully sequenced sword fights and The Black Pearl, a pirate ship, was a terror. Also some other notable ships made the movie interesting, the pride of the royal navy, The Interceptor and The Commodore were beautifully detailed and adorned with the Union Jack. The movie had everything from red coats, blue coats, pirates, ghosts, treasure and was filled with adventure and romance. Johnny Depp delivers a highly entertaining performance as the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom really shines as lowly blacksmith Will Turner and Kiera Knightly dazzles as the Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swan.

Doing a Keith Richards impression (much better than the switched mom in ""Freaky Friday""!) Johnny Depp makes the movie. As his nemesis, Geoffrey Rush chews the scenery pretty well too ... the good guys are somewhat vanilla, but as a fan of the show ""Coupling,"" the British admiral was a fun choice.

","The plot of POTC has been outlined in some of the other comments so I won't rehash that. The film itself does have some major flaws, firstly it is about thirty minutes too long and could easily have stood a little trimming. Second, Jack Davenport's performance is abysmal for what is a small but pivotal role. Geoffrey Rush does ok as do Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom but they all blown off the screen by the mighty Johnny Depp. Basing his performance on early 70s Keith Richards Depp struts around the screen and makes the film his own, he is helped by the fact that he gets most of the film's best lines but nevertheless it is difficult to imagine anyone but Depp pulling this off. It is his most demented, brilliant performance since Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas and one of the best of his career.<br/><br/>This film could easily have failed. It is a summer blockbuster based on an amusement park ride and as such normally the kind of film I wouldn't even bother to see, but, it has such a great sense of mindless fun that it proves enchanting.

","I am a huge Johnnie Depp fan.  As far back as _Edward Scissorhands_ and _Crybaby_ he was making risky career choices and carrying them off with his incredible talent.  However, although I knew I would be going to see _Pirates of the Caribbean_ the day it opened, I had my doubts.  After all, this is a movie based on a ride.  Not based on a book, not even based on a true story, based on a theme park ride!  And talented though he is, Depp has made some less than wonderful movies (_The Astronaut's Wife_ springs to mind).  But I went anyway, because it has Johnnie Depp, not to mention Legolas and the Marquis de Sade.  And the movie was wonderful.  But it clearly would not have been so without Johnnie Depp.  The other actors were fine, particularly Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom. The script was sufficiently quirky that the film probably would have been fairly entertaining despite the overlong and repetitive battle scenes and the overdone jokes between the two sailors (not to mention the overdoner jokes between the two pirates).  The special effects were good, the photography beautiful and the music excellent, but it nevertheless doesn't add up to anything more than a pretty good summer flick.  Until you add Johnny Depp. His Crazed Queen of the Spanish Main is simply brilliant, and it turns POTC into the best flick of the summer and one of the best of the year.  I hear they are already filming a sequel; I have my doubts about that too, having seen XMen 2, Matrix 2, Terminator 3...  But then, none of those films had Johnnie Depp."

","Okay, when I first saw the poster and saw the names of Gore ""I turned Ringu in to a movie with lots of loud noises because Americans can not be scared by anything remotely psychological"" Verbinski and Jerry ""Kangaroo Jack and lots of movies with big explosions"" Bruckheimer on the credits, I was sceptical (a variant spelling of skeptical, not related to a septic tank) but as it turns out the movie is pretty good. It is a fun summer popcorn movie and despite some large plot holes, turns out to be one of the better films of the summer (well of the ""popcorn"" movies).<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is Legolas without pointy ears and with a sword instead of a bow (but the girls dig him so I will not go in to copious detail about his mediocre acting, he fills the part). Keira Knightley is just hot (she would be drop dead gorgeous even without the accent but is on the top of my list with Fleur Saville and Antonia Prebble because of it) and legal (but just barely). Geoffrey Rush is lost in the character, one of the signs of a really good actor, though I have to say that he did not really add anything special that no other actor could have, a shame for such a talented guy. The rest of the cast are also excellent and the dialogue is good and tolerable even at the worst of times.<br/><br/>The special effects in the film are excellent, I only wish that all films loaded with special effects would be this good. Special Effects are there to ENHANCE the plot and the acting, not to take the place of it.<br/><br/>I am going to finish this review by raving about Johnny Depp because he really was the reason the film was so good. I literally do not think the film would have been half as good with anyone else in the role (well maybe Daniel Day-Lewis). He creates a unique and engaging character and endears himself to you, a hard task for the disowned gay son of Captain Morgan. Johnny Depp has proven once again why he is among the elite inner circle of great actors (well mine anyway, along with Ed Norton, Kenneth Branagh, Don Cheadle, Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench, Forrest Whitaker, Brian Cox, Kevin Spacey, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and probably a few I am forgetting unfortunately, my apologies to them).<br/><br/>It works best on the big screen, so go to the second run theatre and see it for two bucks for Johnny Depp if nothing else."

If he wanted to make the pirate a rock star he could have picked someone other than Richards.

","Now, I'll admit I loved PIRATES, but it is not without faults, the greatest being, IT'S TOO LONG! Will SOMEBODY tell Jerry Bruckheimer that a feature film doesn't HAVE to be over two hours and fifteen minutes long? A half hour trimmed would have tightened the plot, kept the audience jumping at the climaxes (and not for the bathroom), and increased the revenue, as another showtime could be squeezed in each day.<br/><br/>
That being said, there is a lot to like about the film. A truly good pirate movie MUST obey certain guidelines: a swashbuckling hero, an equally strong damsel, a truly dastardly villain, a great climactic duel, a romance, at least one major sea battle and city plundering scene, LOTS of pirate lore, and respect for the time frame of the film (NO lapses into 20th or 21st century jargon or technology, for the sake of plot or humor). Hollywood's last major pirate effort, CUTTHROAT ISLAND, had Gena Davis as a distaff hero, which was acceptable (Maureen O'Hara had played a swashbuckler in several 40s-50s films), and Frank Langella as the villain, which was inspired casting...but Matthew Modine was so wimpish a leading man that the romance between him and Davis looked ridiculous, and Davis evolved into a near caricature, to fill the void...and the film descended into present-day campiness, which was the kiss of death.<br/><br/>
Director Gore Verbinski, and writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert clearly did their homework for PIRATES, and admirably filled each pirate movie requirement. Two heroes swash their way through the film; Johnny Depp is the picturebook pirate, complete with outrageous attire, a braided beard, eye makeup, a drunken swagger, and the best damn' Keith Richards impersonation I've ever seen; Orlando Bloom is the heroic, Errol Flynn-like buccaneer, out to rescue his damsel, and full of lofty ideals. Eighteen-year-old Keira Knightley is the heroine, and while her acting skills are average, at best, she shows a lot of spunk (and cleavage), and positively glows, onscreen. The villain is another inspired piece of casting; Geoffrey Rush, while not as menacing as Frank Langella, has a ball as the snarling yet world-weary Pirate leader. As for the pirate crews (there are two), they are perfect; you have guys with hooks and peg legs, barbarians straight out of MOBY DICK, even a parrot and a monkey as sidekicks, all hankering for rum, riches, and victims to 'walk the plank'. That one crew is all cursed, and reveal themselves to be skeletal, decomposing corpses under the full moon only increases their nasty perfection!<br/><br/>
The film borrows heavily from THE CRIMSON PIRATE, TREASURE ISLAND, SWASHBUCKLER, Universal Pictures' 40s B-movie pirate flicks, and even a few Hammer horror features of the early 60s, but it all fits together fairly seamlessly. Still, the excessive length would be a fatal flaw, were it not for Johnny Depp's physical and verbal presense. He is the glue that holds everything together, and he is VERY much up to the task! Whenever the film starts to drag, Depp has some bit of 'business' that is hilarious, and keeps things rolling.<br/><br/>
I won't delve into the plot (cursed gold, kidnappings, a gallows scene...pretty standard pirate stuff), but I will say that you could do a LOT worse than PIRATES in this season of overblown sequels and underwhelming originals.<br/><br/>
Go to the bathroom before you go to the theater, and ENJOY!"

I loved Pirates of the Caribbean the Ride at Disneyland/world as a kid, and when I heard about this movie, I couldn't wait to see it. Opening night my whole family went, and we were absolutely enthralled.<br/><br/>The opening scene with Johnny Depp is absolutely hilarious, and he makes a wonderful pirate, as, ""That's *Captain* Jack Sparrow"". He should play a pirate more often. He is a brilliant mixture of funny, strange, and exotic all in one, and keeps on dazzling throughout the entire film. Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa makes an awesome villain, eccentric and quirky enough not to be scary, but when he and his crew turn into a bunch of skeletons, it still was chilling. Orlando Bloom is an adorable Will Turner, showing a funny side but easily acting as a rival to Depp for attention on screen (though the award would go to Depp, he was beyond amazing). I was also very impressed with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann - she was a tough heroine, didn't act like a girly screamer, and was funny as well.<br/><br/>The plot is good, the acting great in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Though rated PG-13 (one of the firsts for Disney), I would definitely call it a great family film for the older kids.

Thousands, thousands, because Johnny Depp is surprising us once again with his choices as an actor and his considerable depth of emotion and range.  Jack Sparrow is a fascinating character wholly because of Depp's willingness to seize the character and make it totally his own.  Wearing inexplicable but attractive eyeliner, swaying and gesticulating drunkenly, Depp says each line with an originality that brings the script above and beyond where we could have reasonably expected it.  Mildly amusing jokes are hilarious in his hands; an essential undercurrent of emotion and reality crackles in between his gold teeth and his swashbuckler's boots.  He makes this movie.

","Ahoy Maties! Grab your swords and board the dreaded pirate ship, the Black Pearl, and sail back in time to when you were a kid at Disneyland, going through the boat ride, `Pirates of the Caribbean.' Whatever your imagination could have conjured up, it couldn't possibly compare to the wonderment, fun and childhood excitement that the live-action film delivers today. This is, in many ways, the perfect film, because it not only does exactly what it intends, but it does so without a hint of corniness, overdone computer graphics, sappy dialog, or boring plot line.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie is just for fun, and you can enjoy it for what it is if you go into the theater with the same sense of fun that you'd have going into the ride at Disney parks. In fact, just about every scene from the robotic namesake ride (that's over 30 years old) is featured conspicuously in the film, causing giggles of nostalgia from the audience.<br/><br/>The plot is classic fairy tale formula for a Swashbucklin' Pirate story that involves pirates, fair maidens, a hero to save her, royalty, and an intricate intertwining of relationships that make things oh so juicy. Here, Johnny Depp leads the pack as Jack Sparrow, a lone pirate on the Caribbean Sea, looking for his lost ship, the Black Pearl. It'd been commandeered years earlier by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) who'd lead a mutiny against him. For Sparrow to get his ship back, he must commandeer one of his own, so he picks one from the Royal British Navy. But first, he must cross swords with a young sword maker, Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Barbossa has his own agenda: to break a curse set upon the crew after they stole ancient Aztec gold artifacts. To do this, they must return the gold, plus spill the blood from a descendant of the original captain of the Black Pearl that pirated the loot in the first place. Through misidentification, they capture Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley, who is subsequently kidnapped. In this scene, Geoffrey Rush delivers a brilliant monologue about his plight as a cursed pirate.<br/><br/>At this point, Turner and Sparrow set out as partners to find the Black Pearl: Turner wants to save the girl, and Sparrow wants to get his ship back. Over the course of the film, as secrets are revealed and events unfold, the tension and action builds to a rewarding and pleasingly climactic ending.<br/><br/>Essentially, the movie has it all: cartoony sword-fighting, skeletons drinking rum, dream-like scenery that captures the spirit of the dark, imaginary world of pirates swinging between ships, ladies having to walk the plank, and valiant heroes saving them. With the youthful target audience in mind, a more cynical viewer looking for a more intense or less `comedic' tone might be disappointed; similarly, an overly protective parent might be concerned for their youngsters' fear factor at some special effects, but these are all phantom concerns. `Pirates of the Caribbean' as a great mid-summer hit that's sure to please the whole family."

","Pirates Of the Caribbean is one of the best movies I've ever seen. There is a saying in Hollywood that goes out to Adult actors,<br/><br/>""Be careful of scenes that include children and animals, because they'll always steal the attention away from you."" <br/><br/>Well, now add Captain Jack Sparrow,(or Johnny Depp)to that saying. This movie would not have been so wonderful if anyone else had been Jack. Mr. Depp is a truly talented actor, and it shows with evertything he does. From the lines to the simple body language, he made it all his own, and you could tell that this was a fun movie to make by watching the effort in every scene. I hope the sequel is as wonderful.<br/><br/>SPOILERS------ To clear up a misunderstanding: Jack IS NOT cursed through the entire movie. Thyat's why he eats and drinks through out the film. Jack was abandoned before the pirates were cursed. If you notice, he's in the moonlight several times in the film, and he doesn't change. That's because he's not cursed. He steals the coin at the end because he knows he's going to fight Barbossa, and didn't want to die. If you notice, when he tosses Will the coin, he slits his hand so HIS BLOOD IS ALSO ON THE COIN. That's what the curse needed, blood from everyone who stole a coin. And even if he hadn't taken the coin, he still would have been cursed, because he doesn't repay the blood.<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>     The movie is quite long, but worth while and certainly entertaining. 10/10 and two thumbs up!!"

","Spoiler alert I've seen mixed reviews on the movie. Some are quick to say that it has no real direction, but i noticed some intricacies and subtleties that, although not really bringing the plot together any more (which can hardly be done at all),give the movie a subtle sort of repitition, but not in a boring way. I'm about ready to give some examples of things to look for when you go back and see it, rent it, purchase it, whatever; so if you wish for the movie's contents to be revealed only upon your viewing it, read this no more because i'm giving insight into the movie. When dealing with the captain Barbossa, it seemed that apples were focused on quite a bit. I took it as the apple was sort of a symbol of what he had to get back by breaking the curse. it was the symbol of what he could enjoy being human again. So when Jack Sparrow proposes his idea into barbossa's telescope, he's eating the nice shiny apple. It seemed to be Jack's clever way of rubbing it in and reminding him of why he's there, while also saying, ""look what i can do that you can't."" And also when barbossa is killed, the apple is there. As he dies, it rolls out of his pocket or something and shows the sort of irony about not being able to enjoy life after the curse because his death soon followed."

","Pirates of The Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Starring Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom is a must see movie this summer, and is easily the best Pirate film ever made. Despite its PG-13 rating (mostly for violence), this movie is entertaining and fun for people of all ages. Johnny Depp is tremendous in his role as Captain Jack Sparrow, and depicts this pirate character in a way that no other actor could have. He is truly remarkable. Orlando Bloom lacks the charm that Depp carries, yet he too plays his role well as Wil Turner. Keira Knightley from Bend it like Beckham also stars along with Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>While the movie is long, 146 minutes, it moves along at a good pace. The audience seemed to get a bit restless only after the movie had climaxed and continued on for another 20 minutes. While I believe the movie could have been shorter, Depp kept my attention to the very end.<br/><br/>While many movies this summer such as Bad Boys II, Hulk, and Terminator III advertise with action and violence, this movie has action, with humor and good fun on the side. The cast has already signed on for a sequel. I really liked this movie. If your looking for pure entertainment, with no thinking or worrying, go see ""Pirates"". It is a painless, sit back and relax movie. ****/5 stars."
"michael-plewa","Null","0","0","25 July 2003"," Bad trailer...But GOOD Movie!
","I remember once I had this uncanny knack for predicting the merit of a film by its trailer.  A few years ago, I was proved wrong with Legally Blonde, a delightful nugget.  Pirates of the Carribean, I'm sad to say, deeply misleads in the preview.  For one, the trailer showcases, by far, the least funny line in a film full of extremely funny lines.  The upper-class British girl smacks a Pirate saying, ""You like pain?  Try wearing a corset.""  I'm thinking, ""They put that in the preview to whet your appetite?  Just imagine how much worse it gets.""  I knew this movie would do well financially, considering the producer and the cast and the appeal of seeing Pirates swashbuckle once again, I mean, Jerry Bruckheimer couldn't lose money if he lost a leg and was in a butt-kicking contest.  So I also knew people would see this movie, a lot of people.  But that trailer nagged at me all the way in to the screening, thinking about how many not-funny one-liners we'd endure in the course of seeing all these stereotypes go against type.<br/><br/>And then Johnny Depp comes on screen.  He is proudly standing in the crow's nest of his mighty ship, and the film is immediately off to the right start in the very next shot.  I don't want to ruin it, and maybe the guys making the trailer didn't want to either.  There's something to be said for not laying your cards on the table early, like so many movies do in their marketing campaign.  It only took one cut to melt down the icy walls I had erected in my critical mind, and I was immediately sold.  This movie is by far the best example of comedy, action, and good genre film-making of the summer.  I say genre film-making because it is very in line with the classic Pirate archetypes.  Except, of course, for Johnny Depp.  His performance, sans the brilliant script he's given, would seem anachronistic, out of the realm of possibility for this era and tone of film-making.  He'd seem too hip, too funny, too above it all while wallowing in the filth.  However, Depp serves as both the audience's ambassador to the story, and the story's greatest asset.  In one of the funniest lines in the movie, Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and the first mate are discussing how Depp was betrayed and then stranded to die on a deserted island.  When Will asks how he escaped, the first mate says he tethered rope around sea turtles and made a raft. Predictably, Will asks where he got the rope, and then in a fearsome low-angle, Depp bellows, ""With human hair...from my back.""  We cut away immediately to the next scene, and the rest of the film plays much the same. When a movie has four or five truly funny lines or moments, it will milk those for all their worth.  Literally, they'll make a running gag.  But ""Pirates"" runs out of room for the old jokes with all the new jokes, making this film nearly a laugh-a-minute action comedy.  I say nearly only because of the brilliant action sequences, that are still light on their toes, but exciting too.  There are a few running jokes, the biggest being that Pirates are really despicable people, and when we think they'll outgrow their greed and become true heroes, they wallow reluctantly in their cowardice.  In one great scene, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth leads the charge to take Depp's loyal crew to rescue their beloved captain.  They aren't following.  She beckons with the reason that Depp would come back for them.  In the next cut, she's rowing alone.  ""Bloody Pirates!""  Depp, therefore, is the greatest pirate anyone's ever seen.  He plays every angle, but chooses the heroic when there's nothing better to do.  But everyone in the film has their moment of true heroism.  They don't do things that seem like the old-hat mode of turning unlikely heroes into heroes.  All the cowards in ""Pirates"" remain cowards, some endearing and some villainous, and all the heroes are truly heroic, even when they have their priorities out of whack. That's why you'll grow to like everybody, because they're all really good at what they do.<br/><br/>I will go see the sequel, and I may be disappointed, but at least I won't be disappointed until the movie's over, because the trailer will mislead the uninitiated into thinking it's another Bruckheimer explosion music video, and it is anything but."

"PlutonicLove","Null","0","0","22 July 2003"," A pleasant surprise of the highest order
","My expectations for this movie - or its score, for that matter - were not too high. In fact, let's face it: I expected it to suck very, very hard. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised, nay blown away even. I haven't had this much fun at an action/adventure film since The Mummy. From the astoundingly lush sets and costumes to the beautiful cinematography, to the satisfyingly quotable dialogue, this movie had everything the blusteringly swashbuckling connoisseur could hope for. But what really makes it such a tremendously enjoyable experience is the fantastic acting. Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow once again proves that he is one of the finest actors of our generation - boastful, swaggering and deliciously over the top he is never boring to watch. Geoffrey Rush is no less excellent as the dreadful undead pirate Captain LeChuck, who kidnaps the beautiful governor's daughter Elaine Marley (Bend it Like Beckham's Keira Knightley) to undo the curse he and his shipmates suffer from. Also great: Orlando Bloom as Elaine's childhood friend Guybrush Threepwood, a dashing (as opposed to merely runny) blacksmith turned pirate. It's all very much The Mummy meets Cutthroat Island, though done with a lot more skill and panache. My second favorite film of the year so far (after Finding Nemo). I can only hope that Wild Wild West II: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will turn out to be equally superb.<br/><br/>As for the score, Klaus Badelt (and six other composers, amongst them Jimmy Doodle and Steve Jabalabomsky) once again proves that while he may not be a very original composer, he is superb at filtering other people's work. He distilled the best of Gladiator and Muppet Treasure Island, filtered out all of the annoying Lisa Gerrard whining and cheap synthesizers, added a bit of K-19, Drop Zone and Goblin (the cue accompanying the initial appearance of the Black Pearl was quite reminiscent of their wonderful work for Argento's Suspiria) and mixed it all up, resulting in a marvelous little film music stew. It's all the MV nutrients without the fats! I might even get the CD, if only for that fabulously re-orchestrated version of the Drop Zone trailer music!<br/><br/>Satisfying? Yes. But since this is one of the finest adventure films I've seen in ages, I still cannot help but lament that Silvestri didn't write this score. Or Goldsmith. Or Shearmur. Or Debney. Or Doyle. It would have kicked Cutthroat Island, The Mummy Returns AND Sinbad into oblivion."

","I will mainly be echoing what the others have said, but I wanted to be sure and say it too, to add my vote.<br/><br/>This movie excels at ENTERTAINING.<br/><br/>Without sex, gore, potty jokes, or a single cuss word*, it is romantic, exciting, humorous, and witty. (Kind of in the tradition of Princess Bride, in the sense of it being a true FAMILY movie, only POTC is about 200% more exciting and adventurous, and a bit less cheesy).<br/><br/>The movie is 2.5 hours long, but there is not a single point at which I (or any of the friends who watched it with me) felt as though we had been there a long time or as though the plot was slowing down. It wasn't until we left the theater that we realized how long we'd been entertained!<br/><br/>The music is great- I have been searching everywhere for a soundtrack or score, with no success.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was perfect as Jack Sparrow, the pirate with a screw loose. I can't imagine anyone else in the role- when I try to, I think ""they would ruin it!"" Orlando and Kiera are not hard to look at, and each of them has moments that would make the opposite sex weak in the knees.<br/><br/>The lord of the rings movies, all our superhero movies, the star wars movies have all raised the bar to a very high level for special effects. However, the effects in this movie WERE convincing and, in addition, they were interesting! Several times, you could tell that the action was choreographed in such a way to show off the effects, and at those times, the scenes were absolutely picturesque - the type that you'd like to put up on your wall.<br/><br/>Like just about everyone else who has posted here, I immediately decided, while leaving the theater, that I will be going back to see it again, the $8 per show fee notwithstanding.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie that I will own as soon as it is available on DVD, and I will continue to recommend it to everyone I know.<br/><br/>Just see it for yourself!<br/><br/>*(The word Bejesus is used, as is the word Hell in the literal sense; that is, referring to the location Hell; I don't consider these cuss words)"

","WARNING (SPOILER IN THIS POSTING) This movie is a masterpiece that is surprisingly produced by Disney. I'm not saying that Disney produces terrible movies. I just haven't seen a Disney movie with violence like this, or a rating like this in a while. I have noticed that in the past few years, Disney has put out movies that have parts that are directed to the adult viewers. Anyway, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a movie with much promise. It takes the viewer into another time and place that seems so real. At the same time that the film came out, the video game also came out. This move was directed to help the movie, since the game has no correlation to the movie, except that you encounter the Black Pearl and the female lead role in the film narrates the game. Anyway, Depp and Bloom gave fantastic performances. Depp did really well as the witty Captain Sparrow looking to get even, while saving his own skin. Bloom fit his part very well. But Rush did extremely well as the Captain of the Black Pearl. I have yet to see him fit his character in a while. He did well in ""House on Haunted Hill."" The special effects in this film are amazing. Of course nothing too surprising from Disney. I have to admit that the fight in the cave in the end was very well done. When Rush and Depp are fighting in the cave, they jump from dark to moonlight. The effect of them turning from human to undead was one of the best special effects that I have seen in a long time. Most movies that try something like this, generally have the camera farther back so that they do not have to change the character's appearances as many times as this film did. The pirates in the film were amazing. Each one of them had their own characteristics that were obvious to the viewers. Overall, this movie is a have to see for people looking for a ride that doesn't let go."

I know that more than a few people think that the movie is overlong at 2 hours and 20 minutes.

And just think, The Lord of the Rings films are longer than this by 40-50 minutes and nobody criticizes those films on their length. I also don't think the movie would have been as good if they had cut it down. It's rated PG13 for action/adventure violence. There' no swearing except for a few minor words.

Keira Knightly does an excellent job as Elizabeth Swann.<br/><br/>One thing I really like about this movie, is the actors. They don't just act out their characters, they become their characters, and make you almost believe this story really happened; they take you into the story.<br/><br/>The climax is excellent, the actions leading up to the climax are excellent, the special effects are excellent... everything is excellent. I give this movie a 10/10. And it is definately worth every every penny spent on making it."

I have to say Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl  really surpised since I don't really go for Disney flicks, but director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have made a film full of action that anyone can enjoy. I have to say that Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa and the lovely Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann  all make the film work with their performances.

"indigo7699","Null","0","0","17 July 2003"," More than just a Disney ride turned into a movie!
","On hearing the premise of this movie, I was determined to avoid it at all costs. Then I found out who was in the cast, read some reviews, and decided to give it a go despite the risk of having to sit through a fluffy, Disnified film.<br/><br/>Granted, I love pirate movies, and the dearth of good ones lately has left me looking for a ray of hope. This movie has more than redeemed the genre.<br/><br/>
While occasionally nodding to the popular Disney ride, this film stands completely on its own. The plot, while somewhat convoluted (WHICH ship are they on now?), provided a fun backdrop to show of the story's characters. Geoffrey Rush plays an oddly likeable villian as Barbarossa, the captain of the ghost pirates of the buccaneer ship the Black Pearl. Orlando Bloom's naive Will Turner was the sweet and likeable hero (though perhaps not the brightest coin in the chest). Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swan was loveably feisty (she knows how to use a musket! You go, girl!). As Governor Swan, Jonathan Pryce keeps it light enough that we don't hate the character for being a snob--and his encounter with the arm that wouldn't die is priceless. And, last but certainly not least, Johnny Depp plays Mad Captain Jack Sparrow so convincingly he could have carried the movie himself, creating a character you're never really sure is quite sober or sane, but definitely wily and always fascinating. <br/><br/>The special effects for the movie were fairly good, especially during an underwater march of the undead pirates. The dialogue in the movie escapes being trite due to the talent of the cast, and instead comes across as familiar but funny. For you action fans, there's plenty to love: Orlando Bloom revisits his sword-fighting talent in several scenes, and Johnny Depp gets to put his athletic talents to the test while jumping and swinging from ship to ship all the way across the Spanish Main. <br/><br/>If you're willing to give this movie a chance, I highly recommend catching it before it leaves the big screen. It will still be fun on DVD, but it's worth the price of a ticket."

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a movie based upon the Walt Disney ride ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".  Though it may seem a tad different at first glance, seeing as Disney is creating a movie after the ride when it would be expected to be seen in the opposite order, this film is exceptionally well done.  If you enjoy the ride, then you will adore the movie.  Almost every scene from the ride appears, even if it is very brief, within the movie (the auction is the only one noticed to have gone missing by two of the three of my party this evening).  The song that those who have gone on the ride would recognize appears first and makes a strange yet interesting beginning.  The special effects during this film were exceptional and seamless.  Not to mention the casting... Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow was a perfect match.

","The thing that is so big about PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (other than its ten-word title and it's  2 and a half hour running time) is the fact that this is a hit. I mean, a movie about pirates, that has a lot of skeleton guys walking around. It's perfect for the little kids and its not been plunged to the horrid depths of being so stupid that adults (yes, you small minded adults) will even like it. Kiera Knightly is hott (for the guys), Orlando Bloom is a heart-throb for the girls, and Johnny Depp wears heavy mascara. How can this movie fail?<br/><br/>Well, there are so many changes in the plot, so many twists and turns-- this is a direct result of the writer not knowing what to do and not knowing where he was going with the script. Nevertheless, the film does have a sort of creepy, moody feel to it that helps it become nostalgic and just kind of has the words ""Box Office Smash"" written all over it. Granted, half of its audience members are probably people who are just wasting time before THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN comes out, this film still stands on its own. Director Gore Virbinski again returns, getting better all the time. His last attempt THE RING was an extreme hit but many people are getting quite bored with it now (sequel time maybe?). Hopefully Virbinski will only continue his trend of gradually getting better with each new film.<br/><br/>The graphics are well done and the film contains several moments of eerie horror and thrilling action sequences. The humor comes in bounds (again, trying to amuse the little kiddies) and Johnny Depp acts very 'action-hero', kinda like Brendan Fraser's role in THE MUMMY. He still does very well. The films stands on its own, has loads of originality and is a hit. It won't stay that way forever though.<br/><br/>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL gets 4/5."

Seriously, without Johnny I probably would have either fallen asleep or left.  Sure, Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) did a great job leaving his elfish persona behind and performing in a role unlike what we have seen him in before, but he really did not make this movie. One performance that I did enjoy, although I wasn't totally blown away, was the performance by Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann).  Her character seemed to mesh well with Orlando's character.  Plus, Orlando and Keira seemed like they really enjoyed their roles and had fun. Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa) did absolutely nothing for me, and the character the Governor (Jonathan Price) was not up to par with the other actors indeed. All in all, the storyline is pretty awesome.  Unrealistic most of the time, it still is fun.  I had fun watching this movie, even though towards the end I wish it would have just ended sooner.  I was tired.  Who can blame me?

","Let's face it, any movie based on an amusement park ride that people only go on to get out of the blistering heat is not going to be as deep as Citizen Kane. Do not bother with the holes in the plotline, as there are more of those than a trainload of Swiss cheese, but rather focus on the fact that the digital engineers at Disney were able to study the Errol Flynn movies and recreate them using the latest in imaging techniques. The result is a mindbending display of scenery and swordfights all acted out with a cast of quality performers, who seem to be plucked right from the pages of what we perceive to be accurate history. It plays right to the imagination, and I loved it. Johnny Depp steals the show as the swishbuckling androgenous pirate, and the supporting cast was selected with an eye on keeping the right mix of wisdom, youth, characterization, and sex appeal. Especially loved the scene of the drunken revelers on the island of Tortuga, as it was a living snapshot of the theme park ride."

","I guess many may find it strange that I would be disappointed in a movie like this.  But I love a good swashbuckler, and this film would seem to be a great opportunity to make just that.  But it is not one, its just, in a word, WEIRD.  ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a very strange movie.  That doesn't have to be a bad thing, but this film just doesn't have the spirit of the old fashioned pirate films, or, despite the many references to it, the ride it was based on.<br/><br/>What was I expecting?  I guess a film that was at least in the tradition of ""The Mask of Zorro,"" or if we want to dip into the serial age, Errol Flynn's ""Captain Blood"" or ""Robin Hood.""  People might claim that the cliches of these films are old and uninteresting, and that the other attempts to imitate them did not go over well (many will site ""Cutthroat Island."")  But I don't think it would have been that hard for the producers of this film to come up with something that had a traditional, fun, engaging, and original storyline.  ""Zorro,"" ""The Three Musketeers,"" and Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood"" arguably held their audiences and entertained them, without the absence of this rousing spirit.  Some might even claim that ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy has swashbuckler-pirate film influences.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has a bizarre plot and even stranger characters. I still can't really explain what this film was about--not what one would expect from a straight-pirate movie.  The plot involves pirates who are ""undead.""  I have no problem with that--in fact, the movie would have been great if it had been influenced by ""Army of Darkness.""  The undead skeletons of this movie wearily drag their feet along, argue with each other, and act miserable.  Other than a few monologues on how it really sucks to be dead, I never really got the feeling that these pirates were really that bad-off. After all, they can't be ""killed"" this way (which somewhat makes the sword-fights irrelevant.)  An even bigger mystery to me was why these pirates needed to be STOPPED from lifting their curse.  I'm sure it was right there in the script (I believe it had something to do with the safety of those whose blood was needed to lift it) but this never really added any urgency to the plot.<br/><br/>The bottom line seems to be that nobody is ever having much fun on the screen; even Johnny Depp, for all of his eccentricities, never seems to be enjoying himself.  Orlando Bloom expressed delight in counting his number of kills and in sliding down the smooth stones of a castle, shooting arrows in ""The Two Towers,"" yet he never does anything like that here.  On a level that is rather un-PC, I'm sure that in many ways it would have been a blast to have been a pirate!  Nobody seems to believe that in this movie.  The pirates on the ride sure did--they drank, they sang, they raped and pillaged, and burned villages to the ground.  The pirates in this movie just lumber, whine and argue with each other.  They do some plundering but never seem too thrilled about it.  Where's all the drunken debauchery?   This movie needed more of that.  It also needed the partying band of skeletons from ""Army of Darkness,"" a campy and fearful villain (Jeffrey Rush could have still played the part), and a hero in the tradition of the films I have mentioned above.  <br/><br/>There are some positives.  The props and ships are impressive, the special effects and cinematography are quite good, and there was much thought put into the elaborate (although strangely isolated) set pieces.  I guess I am glad that this movie is doing well, in that it may bring back the genre. But ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" probably doesn't deserve to be the movie to do that.  Grade: C"

","Peg-legs, swordplay, plank walking, ships, cannons and ancient curses.  Now that's what a summer movie should be.  We start off in the 1700s, give or take a hundred, in an island off - where else - the Caribbean.  After 30 minutes of setup and character introduction, the island is attacked by the Black Pearl and Elizabeth Swann, the Governor's daughter, is taken prisoner. But this is not a random pirate attack.  The pirates are victims of an Aztec curse that has left them in a state of undead and need Elizabeth's medallion to break it.  The roguish Cap'n Jack Sparrow, former captain of the Black Pearl, sets off after them with Will Turner, his new sidekick. That's basically the movie.  Now if you're coming into this expecting an intelligent drama about the dangers of sea life, well, forget it.  Go see Master and Commander instead.  Pirates is a movie whose sole purpose is to entertain - without insulting your intelligence - and that's what it does. It is one of those rare films that's both good and fun, and much credit belongs to Johnny Depp.  It is a mystery as to what compelled Depp to do away with the conventional Errol Flynn pirate and instead channel Keith Richards with a little PePe Le Pew.  Depp is an actor who consistently rises above the script, regardless of the film's quality.  The stumbling, slurred deliveries, facial expressions and goatee - things that would seem out of place in another movie - only add to the performance because they fit in the context of the film.  His performance is funny, charismatic, eccentric, and fully worthy of an Oscar nomination.  About time he gets some recognition. Without him this would have been a (marginally) bad film with a good performance from Geoffery Rush.  As the mutinous first mate Barbosa, Rush also provides some humorous moments and has some good exchanges with Depp. Orlando Bloom is Will Turner, a blacksmith, who happens to be the reason for the curse.  He holds his own as the movie pirate - handsome, thinned mustache, ponytail - and Keira Knightley is equally good as the damsel in distress.  The production values - set design, costumes, cinematography - are first rate as are the special effects. The movie could have spent more time in the editing room as it sometimes looses momentum.  At two hours twenty minutes, it's about half hour too long.  The direction is decent but should have been better.  The story is well told but drags whenever Depp's not onscreen.  The battle scenes and sword fights could have been better choreographed.  They come off flat and fail to provide any thrills.  The only enjoyable one is the last one when Sparrow and Barbosa are moving in and out of the lunar beams. Pirates of the Caribbean is a fun swashbuckler with a good cast and should appeal to all, even if the wind occasionally goes out of its sails."

On the subject of dragging on, this film was very violent for a Disney movie. Now I've got nothing against violence as I'm looking forward to some upcoming violent films, but this violence was pointless and needless and LOOOOONG.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the cursed pirates turn into skeletons at midnight and are immortal (awesome) but they are just that and don't do anything special (big disappointment). When I say anything special, I'm comparing them to the warriors in The Mummy who actually had supernatural abilities. These pirates just change into skeletons and attack like you and me. Needless to say, it gets really boring after a while.<br/><br/>Forthly, Deep's portrayal of the Jack Sparrow character was odd. In a majority of the scenes, he seemed like he was on some sort of narcotics. The last and final film gripe against this film was the accents the characters used. It was sometimes hard to understand some lines due to the mumbling.<br/><br/>Anyway, the worst part of the film occured when it was over. As everyone stood up to exit, the movie received a full blown round of applause and cheers by little noisy children and their parents. Maybe I've seen too many films, but I was disappointed at this flick..."

","I have never seen better acting in ANY movie than the acting role of Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp in the movie The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Depp does an outstanding job at playing this role. The excitement through out this movie is intense and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Not only is it a good action movie, but also very funny.

"Noir187","Null","0","0","12 July 2003"," An Action-Master-Piece? I never would have thought...
","PotC caught me by surprise. The few trailers I had seen for the movie made it look interesting (pirate are neat) but hadn't done much to impress me; they marketed it as an non-stop action movie (not that those can't be entertaining). However, it's so much more than that. Johnny Depp is a highly capable actor (even when he is in some less than capable movies) who can hold the stage well. However, in this film, he utterly dominates it as Jack Sparrow (that's Captain Jack Sparrow). He really throws himself into the character's role and it works with such ease; he comes off as one of the best anti-heroes I ever seen: a swashbuckling and devilishly charming pirate whose charisma makes you root for him the entire time. If the rest of the movie had been terirble it would still be worth seeing for this man's performance. Orlando Bloom works well here (though you still want to think of him as Legolas) alongside Depp. His seriousness counters just as well as his swordplay against Depp's roguish charm. His character is well rounded and good but he comes off more as a sidekick as Depp's acting places him in the background. Geoffrey Rush is an amazing actor. If you've seen the Tailor of Panama or Quills (amongst his newer works) you'd know this. His portrayal as the cursed Captain of the Black Pearl truly reminded me of his performance as the Marquis de Sade in Quills: dark, brooding and disturbingly charismatic. He would steal the show if it were not for Depp's power. Keira Knightley works well as the damsel in distress but she's much more than that in this film. As a newcomer, she'll make a good career for herself. The CGI effects of the skeletons is magnificent. They blend in well with the scenes and, though you realize the use of CGI, it doesn't stand out in the crowd. The cinematography was well done and made the action scenes creative as well as entertaining. The choreography of such scenes was also top-notch and the swordplay was much more impressive than that in the latest Bond film. Too much good stuff can be said about this movie. It is the best movie I've seen this summer and possibly the best movie of this year that I've seen (I still need to check out Better Luck Tomorrow). All in all, Depp deserves an Oscar nod (at least) for this role. It's one of his career's best."

","I just got back from seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I am awestruck. I was just at Disneyland on Monday, so the ride this movie was based on was fresh in my mind. I liked that they worked in the bit from the ride with the imprisoned pirates trying to tempt the dog that holds the keys to their cell.<br/><br/>The performances were amazing, especially by Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp. Jack Sparrow's introduction was brilliant. Depp was perfect in every way as Sparrow, right down to his drunken swagger. The only one miscast here in my opinion was Jonathan Pryce - he will always be Elliot Carver from Tomorrow Never Dies in my mind. Everyone else was excellent.<br/><br/>The visual effects are extraordinary. They aren't overly exploited and they don't look fake, unlike some effects films (can you say Hulk?).<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski is one of the most versatile and talented directors out there. Every movie he's made (except MouseHunt) has been enjoyable and entertaining. The cinematography was totally engrossing and beautiful, but for God's sakes STOP SHOOTING MOVIES LIKE THIS IN SUPER-35!!! My parents kept asking me if the movie was unfocused because of the definition loss. SHOOT ANAMORPHIC!!!<br/><br/>Anyway....where was I.... Oh yeah, the MUSIC! The best thing about this movie was the music. Produced under the supervision of the brilliant genius Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt's score is the best I've heard on a movie this year.<br/><br/>This is one of the five best movies thus far this year, joining the ranks with the likes of The Matrix Reloaded and  Terminator 3.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl delivers on all the fun, adventure, and witty banter that people want when they go to a pirate movie - but which has been absent from movie theaters for years.  This is no Cut-Throat Island (thank God) but rather more of an Errol Flynn-style swashbuckler (sorry, I had to use the word).  Johnny Depp's character drives the story, swaying the actions of all those around him through clever - sometimes coy - manipulation of pretty much everyone.  The fact that he's a bit off kilter and unexpectedly smart means that he's always half a step ahead of the audience.  This makes for a rewarding, sometimes surprising story that keeps us engrossed.  While this isn't rocket science, there's no dumbing-down here.<br/><br/>Thoroughly recommended."

"maxcat741","Null","0","0","10 July 2003"," A Pirate's Life For Johnny
","Going in to 'Pirates', I have to admit that despite my outward enthusiasm, inwardly I was expecting a fluffy, cotton candy Disneyland movie.  I almost hesitated on seeing the flick, in fears that I would never enjoy my favorite Disneyland ride again.  However, adventure I did to the theatre, and exceedingly glad I am that I did so.  Aye, the movie was fast-paced, but not 'Moulin Rouge'-so.  It was adventurous, surprisingly well written, and the computer graphics were done very well.  The filming was consistently done well, from the acrobatic fighting sequence between Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to the magnificent shots of the dueling 'Interloper' and 'Black Pearl'.<br/><br/>However, even with a great script, excellent plot and wonderful sets to boot, the captain of this fantastic voyage was wholeheartedly Johnny Depp. Playing the cocky, charming scoundrel Capt. Jack Sparrow, Depp unleashes a side of his acting persona that not many moviegoers have ever witnessed: comedy.  Depp's varying facial expressions and swaying, seemingly-inebriated posture give him a swashbuckling charisma that captures your attention as he staggers through the picture, even in the company of Hollywood's latest teen-screen idol Orlando Bloom.  Depp's genuinely funny with great comedic timing, yet he is also blessed with having genuinely hilarious punch lines to deliver.  Reeling around in his three-corner hat, long, beaded black hair, and colorful pirate duds, Depp is a living, breathing replica of Disney's mechanical menaces.  In the movie, he is the savior.  Although Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and especially new arrival Kiera Knightley do excellent in their respective roles, Depp not only steals every scene he is in, he walks away with the entire movie in his pocket. Whenever the plot drags (and it does, at seemingly the most random of occasions), Depp swings into the picture and delivers the action with a gleeful, devilish grin. He's the lovable rogue Hollywood has been missing for years.<br/><br/>'Pirates' opens with young Elizabeth Swann meeting a shipwrecked boy named Will Turner with a mysterious pirate medallion strung around his neck. Years later, Elizabeth (played with a lot of spunk and gusto by Kiera Knightley) has grown up and is secretly in love with Will, now a blacksmith, while her father the governor wishes her to marry a British naval officer. Although a fainting spell lands Elizabeth into the deep trouble, the currently marooned Captain Jack Sparrow, pirate extraordinaire, rescues her from a watery grave.  Despite his good intentions, Jack is welcomed with cordial hostility by the British navy, and winds up (by way of Will Turner) in the cooler (Look for a familiar scene around here, accompanied by a classic line by Jack:  ""You keep waving that bone around, he's never going to come"").<br/><br/>That night, pirates overrun the port and take Elizabeth hostage. Soon enough, she realizes that she's not in the company of ordinary buccaneers, but in a crew of the living dead, hexed for taking Cortes' cursed gold. The crew's appearance is drastically changed in moonlight, but worse than that, they cannot take pleasure in food, women, or (shiver me timbers!) even rum. To break the curse, they need to return all the coins and offer the blood sacrifice of one person...the child of a former mate in the crew.  Turns out, Will's 'medallion' is really one of Cortes' gold pieces.  Turns out, it's also in Elizabeth's possession.  Now Will must team up with Jack to get back his girlfriend; at the same time, Jack tosses in with Will to get the 'Black Pearl'.  The adventure is on.<br/><br/>I hate the phrase, ""If you see one movie this summer...' but I cannot help using it in this review.  Do yourself a favor and see 'Pirates of the Caribbean', it doesn't matter if you're ten, seventeen, twenty-five, thirty-five, fifty, or ninety-nine...unless you have a heart condition. No, it's doubtful you'll be scared stiff by this flick, but you might bust an artery as fifty teen girls scream every time Orlando Bloom pokes his head onto the screen.  Or whenever Johnny Depp wobbles across the screen with cunning one-liners.  From his gleeful smirks, it's assumable that Depp had a ball making this movie.  If you dare to see it, I promise you'll leave singing, `Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.'"
"bsdryn","Null","0","0","13 July 2003"," Action, comedy, effects. Great summer fun.
","So many cool movies come out during the summer, but for some reason, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was one of the films I was most interested in. It just looked so fun and stylish and cool. The pirate theme is too underused in movies. So anyway, I got to see it on opening day, and it was as good as I had hoped. Here's a few reasons you should go see Pirates of the Caribbean, me bucko: <br/><br/>1) Johnny Deep. Ya gotta hand it to Depp for giving his character Captain Jack Sparrow such a unique personality. He fumbles into a lot of bad luck (and jail cells), but is always able to use his charm and skill to get out of it. His body language and style of speech are awesome, which makes for a very memorable character. The rest of the cast is great too, in particular Geoffrey Rush as the cruel pirate Captain Barbossa. But it's Johnny Deep who makes this movie. <br/><br/>2) Undead pirates! With all due respect to Ray Harryhausen's sword-fighting skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts, this cursed crew has to be the coolest bunch of skeletons I've seen on screen. It's an impressive effect when they move in and out of moonlight. Must have been a nightmare for ILM animators, with so much detail... bones and hair and tattered clothing. And then to stick dozens of these skeletons in fights with live actors? Wow. I actually would have enjoyed seeing more scenes with the moonlit monsters. But ye scurvy dogs who don't like too much CG stuff, will be glad to know the movie has plenty of other swashbuckling action that doesn't rely on animated effects. With a running time of around 2 hours, 20 minutes, there's enough time for a little of everything. <br/><br/>3) Comedy. Pirates of the Caribbean isn't an all out comedy, but there's a boatload of humor. Especially from Jack Sparrow and some of Barbossa's bungling crew. I was laughing quite a bit, either from actual jokes, visual gags, or just the absurd situations. It's really a witty script. The story isn't all that complicated, but I liked the way they revealed things as they go, so the plot isn't totally predictable. I hear it's the first Disney film to get a PG-13 rating... I assume because the skeletal pirate violence could give little kids nightmares. But the rest is good family fun so I think this should appeal to a wide audience. So check it out, me hearties. Yo-ho!"
"slinkster","9","0","0","10 July 2003"," 'Pirates' delivers
","Unlike most summer blockbusters, 'Pirates' lives up to its hype and delivers what it set out to. This movie was fun, fast paced and action packed without having to rely on gimmicky plot depreciating tricks or cussing. There was actually a very detail-driven story which was followed through very well from beginning to end. The movie is serious without losing sight of the comedy in many situations. The technical aspects as well are PHENOMENAL.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does not disappoint in this role of unwitting hero which seems to be tailor made for him (I'm willing to bet his coolness quotient with his kids just went up tenfold.). Geoffory Rush is positively evil as the rouge ghost captain, leaving you chilled with merely a glance from his yellowed eyes. Orlando Bloom seems equally well fitted for his role as pirate hater with a past. His swashbuckling scenes are marvelous and you can see how his stint in 'Lord of the Rings' paid off. Every character from the most minor to the large roles had an important part in the furthering of the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd this movie is well worth seeing, even just for the sheer amusement of picking out scenes from the Disney ride. Plus, you can take your kids because despite the PG-13 rating there was no bad language and very little blood (the ghosts may be a little scary for young children). I would definitely see this movie again and recommend it to others.<br/><br/>Good job, Disney!"

When I heard who was going to be in it, I couldn't be more thrilled - I don't think I've ever seen a movie with Johnny Depp in it that I didn't like and Orlando Bloom stole my heart as he portrayed my favorite Lord of the Rings charactor - Legolas. Then the first trailers, even the teaser gave me goosebumps. I began to fear, however, that it could not possibly be as good as I was hopping it to be. I am happy to say that I was delightfully wrong.<br/><br/>The story was cleaver, the acting surperb, the effects amazing and I had no idea how funny it was going to be - just the inside jokes (harkening back to the ride) alone were enough to have me rolling in the isles! At no time did this film take itself too serriously (something I am sure reviewers are going to do, a shame really).<br/><br/>In a summer full of disapointments (i.e. The Hulk, The Matrix), I am excited and releaved that this is finally out and as good as it boasted.

I don't know why he wore 10X as much makeup as Elizabeth Swann, but it suited his over the top performance.<br/><br/>Rush gave his usual great acting job.  And, the other pirates in the movie made me laugh as well.  The movie was much funnier than I was expecting.<br/><br/>Bloom seems to be the person they are pushing in this movie, maybe because of the success of the Lord of the Rings, but he sank into the background in his scenes with Depp.<br/><br/>It was well over two hours, but I don't remember thinking that it was slow. It flowed very well and kept me and my two children quite entertained. PLUS, the worst language in it was ""bloody.""  Which makes a mother happy! I don't think it was much worse than watching cartoons as far as violence goes, but the pirates might scare small children.  It didn't scare my small one, but I could see where it might.<br/><br/>It was actually the best action movie I have seen in some time.  I saw T3 three days ago and did not come away nearly as impressed with it as I did this movie.  The special effects with the pirates were incredible!  The animated people did not seem to move jerkily like I have noticed in other movies.  They seemed liquid and to move as a real person would.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about how entertained I was watching this film."

","I sat there in the movie theater and just could understand something.  How is that no matter what Johnny Depp is in he keeps bringing the awesome.  He was in top form for this picture.  It amazes me how this guy is so quiet and not media sociable and yet can pull of this cocky, funny over the top character.  He's just nuts and it is fantastic.  Orlando Bloom?  Meh, he was okay.  He took nothing away from the experience of the film but he was just a bit too righteous for me.  Geoffrey Rush is another impeccable talent.  He just knows what he needs to do to get the job done and then he adds a little spark to make his character go over in a big way.  Jonathan Pryce is always good to watch.  I love how during one of the big scenes he just sits around like a taco but then takes credit in the end.  Hysterical.  The rest of the film is just plain fun, not an Oscar contender but just a feel good, action packed adventure.  The film's plot and storytelling are told with outstanding visuals and clever dialogue, but it is carried by the subtle, yet exciting score of Klaus Badelt.  I have followed Klaus's career since his early work with Hans Zimmer.  He wrote a convincing and exciting score that keeps up with the manic pace of the film, at times driving it.  Truly a gem.  However, with all that said, it is Johnny Depp's vehicle.  He branded the film with his magnificent sense and talent.  I find one thing funny though, whenever a film does well the star is always commended and sometimes the director is left out.  Gore Verbinski pulled out a sharp, crazy spectacle that hasn't been seen in a while.  It appeals to movie fans of all ages and not many films these days do that. Kudos to him."

You got it all in one movie..comedy,action,drama,romance...and each genre is pulled off with magnificence.

Before this movie Depp was OK for me I didn't love but I didn't hate him, however after watching this movie I've grown to idolize the guy. He's ASTOUNDING as Cpt. Jack Sparrow, the eccentric good-guy pirate. He also has these really funny one liners throughout the whole movie that are worth your money just to see him act out. I BOW DOWN TO JOHHNY DEPP for without a doubt providing the best performance of the summer or if I dare say so far this year! Go JOHNNY! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!

","Johhny Depp never disappoints...sometimes his movies do, but he never does. Thankfully, neither does this movie.  OK, maybe the focus is a bit disappointing; about a third of the way through the movie you see right where the movie is headed, but once you resign yourself to the fact that it could have been better, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't go to far in the comedic direction either, although it would have been nice if the writers would have laid off just a bit on the comic relief.<br/><br/>The supporting cast do quite well, although they come up a bit dull next to Johhny Depp.  Whenever his character is offscreen, you find yourself thinking, ""Why don't they just put the camera back on him?""  Keira is more than mere eye candy; her spirit and spunk make her match up well against Johnny Depp.  You almost wish she ended up with him.  Orlando Bloom does well in his first post-Lord of the Rings film, although it seems as though he wasn't quite given enough character to really work with.  Hopefully, his next film will.  <br/><br/>All in all, the film really is one of the better Disney films to come along lately and a fabulous pirate film in its own right.  Much better than Treasure Island, but not quite as good as Disney's 80's mini-series, Return to Treasure Island (which I hope they will release on DVD)."

","Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! That's what I feel like having watched ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl""! I have to admit that I don't know any other pirate movies, but this one gives the genre the best possible name. It's mainly due to Johnny Depp's ultra-neat role as swashbuckler Jack Sparrow, but there's other things too.<br/><br/>It all begins when a little girl retrieves a medallion from a boy; she doesn't realize just how important this particular medallion is! Several years later, we see that this now grown-up girl is Elizabeth Swann (the ever gorgeous Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter. Unfortunately, that's when the pirates led by Capt. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) storm the town and take Elizabeth hostage.<br/><br/>Enter Jack Sparrow and his brave companion Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). These guys may be oddballs, but boy do they know how to fight pirates! Depp based his characterization on Keith Richards (yes, THE Keith Richards), and he plays the role to great effect. ""POTC: TCOTBP"" is a real treat from beginning to end. Gore Verbinski is proving himself to be a very interesting director, with this movie - plus ""Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Ring"" - to his credit. Now that I've seen this movie, I almost might like to try out a little swashbuckling myself. A pirate's life just might be the life for me..."

","I saw the movie for the second time and decided to write this review. I don't think it's a good idea to write one just after you saw the movie for the first time, because you can be too impressed by the movie and therefore not thinking clearly.<br/><br/>The movie is nice, very nice, and I'm sure I will see it multiple times more, but to say ¬ªit's the best movie ever¬´ is as ridiculous as the fact that all three movies of the ¬ªLord Of The Rings¬´ trilogy are in the top ten of all times on this site. A great movie, in my opinion, is the one that raises important issues and forces you to think about them and generates strong emotions together with superb acting. So, by definition, I tend to like dramas a lot. <br/><br/>I know I can't expect this kind of things in an adventure movie. So, I saw POTC just to have fun and I had a great time. It's a movie which was designed to make a lot of money and entertain the whole family (like Disney's parks), and it did its job perfectly. I can imagine it must be so magical for the kids. Jack Sparrow, brought brilliantly to life by Johnny Depp is so charming and witty. I bet there are children out there arguing at play because everyone wants to be the Captain. Bloom did all right but that's it. I'm kinda romantic guy, so I did like scenes between Orlando and Keira, but I can understand they were very pathetic for some people. She did much better in them, he was basically just staring at her.<br/><br/>The story is interesting enough, it has golden treasure, curse and pretty good twists, effects are impressive, movie is also very funny.

"rbverhoef","8","3","8","13 February 2004"," Very, very entertaining
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is one of the most entertaining films I have seen in years. It is not really great, but every single aspect is terrific and that makes sure you don't see its flaws very easily. One of the flaws is the logic, but in a film like this things are not supposed to be logical, so why bother asking that kind of questions.<br/><br/>The story, pretty standard with the usual twists, is actually quite good, or at least good enough to keep our attention. I could tell you about it but I think it would sound too silly; it kind of is. We have stories about a curse and a pirate ship called the Black Pearl with its Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), we have a pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), we have a young man named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who loves Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). She loves him too but she is about to marry Norrington (Jack Davenport). Her father is Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce), not the most unimportant person.<br/><br/>What curse there is on the Black Pearl you have to see for yourself. Neither am I going to say why the curse is there. Let me just talk about the good stuff. The visual effects are marvelous. Everything looks (and sounds) great. Locations, costumes, makeup. The sword fights and the battles between the English and the pirates are exciting, there is never a moment you are bored.<br/><br/>It is not all fighting and visual effects. In the quiet moments we have the most wonderful performance from Johnny Depp. His Jack Sparrow is one of the characters from the movies you are going to remember and the fact that he earned an Oscar nomination for this part says enough. He is so good you almost forget the other actors. Geoffrey Rush comes close to Deppp as the villain Barbossa and actors like Bloom and Knightley play their parts quite well. Unfortunately for them they are always in the shadow of the perfect Depp.<br/><br/>There are more good things that make this film entertaining, but I would have to go in detail. I think I have given you enough reasons to see this film (and believe me, Depp alone is reason enough). For a very good time 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black pearl' is as good as it gets."

I thought it was genius they could do a 143 minute film and have a plot that wasn't light and had plenty of weight to it.<br/><br/>Out of the three movies, this is my favourite.<br/><br/>It was the first film in a while to tackle pirates and cover all the key elements of pirate movies in the past- lovely locations, a love story that had the right amount of attention but wasn't the main focus of the plot, great action sequences. Then this film updated it in such a way that modern audiences wouldn't be put off watching this type of film which probably happened in the past as they just didn't know how to make a successful pirate film to appeal to their audience at the time. I thought it was an interesting idea to have the pirates cursed and that they couldn't be killed.<br/><br/>The cast was brilliant, I loved the romance between Elizabeth and Will but who I enjoyed watching the most was obviously Johnny Depp. He had a really fantastic idea about making Jack Sparrow very rock n' roll and basing him on Keith Richards. He played him just right and probably made him the first anti-hero in a while that the audience was interested in watching and rooting for.<br/><br/>The film really does have it all- stunning locations, really breathtaking.

The cast is rounded out by a large contingent of British actors (Bloom, Knightley, Pryce, Crook, Davenport) who excel in this kind of film. There are countless references to the ride throughout the film (and lots of hints of what was to come in the sequels, which is surprising as the follow ups were never planned which is unheard of for a summer blockbuster these days) There's nothing to fault with this film at all IMO. Acting, screenplay, direction, production design and FX are all superb.

Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are both excellent in their respective roles, and Geoffrey Rush plays a great villain in Barbossa.<br/><br/>But the thing besides the comedy and acting that sets this movie apart is the action.

"jburtroald95","10","2","5","17 March 2009"," Pure pirate perfection, to see this film once is worth all the gold and silver in the world!
","The idea of plucking a long-time neglected genre out of the dark, combining it with concepts introduced by a theme park ride and throwing the varied combination of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley does seem bizarre and risky. Admittedly director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer had no idea what they had created when they first released this spectacle into the theatres, and certainly weren't prepared for its instant monumental success. Though one must remember that nowadays twentieth century pirate adventure flicks are considered predictable and shallow light entertainment that really only haven't been criticised because of when they were made. Indeed, you might say that it is a miracle that this film was even accepted by today's audience and its creators were very fortunate not to be insulted over and over by thousands of cynical and terribly displeased critics. But no it definitely wasn't fortune that got this over the line and beyond, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl' differs greatly from the others in many ways. The major one being Depp's exceptional performance as the film's central character: notorious, elusive, sly and unpredictable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow. His unique portrayal turns what could have been yet another classic specimen of a famous stereotype into a character that is hilarious, charming, poignant and perplexing.<br/><br/>The other cast members are also pitch-perfect, and some of them are even better: Rush is wonderful as the cunning and horridly cruel villain; Orlando and Keira are nothing outstanding and we feel that we have seen their characters countless times before, but neverhteless they do manage to pull off the pair of heroic lovers that they play quite nicely; Jack Davenport is superb as the dutiful Commodore who greatly despises piracy; Jonathan Pryce is decent as a cowardly governor and the protective father of Keira's character; Kevin.R.McNally is excellent in the role of an old companion of Jack's; and the dynamic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg are delightful as two bumbling blundering pirate buddies under the the service of Rush's character.<br/><br/>The music is incredible, and greatly enhances the overall uplifting and exciting feel of the film. The choreography of the action sequences are outstanding, the special effects work beautifully, the costumes are very well designed as are the sets...<br/><br/>This is my equal-third favourite film, with the other two being 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. I really sincerely do mean that, no other of my reviews says this. I just hope that i have given this film the vast quantity of praise that it deserves.<br/><br/>It completely shatters the Walt Disney Company's reputation for being able to create only babyish kids cartoons and similar live action movies. Though it is still a bold and daring little company that thrives on risky endeavours, like the dazzling 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', such as this."

I especially adore Barbossa's monkey Jack (who will get more action in the third part!) But - as everyone else must admit - the real highlight of the whole trilogy is our dear Captain Jack Sparrow - played most brilliantly by Johnny Depp. I can't even say how much I love the character he created! His way to walk, to talk, to drink and to manipulate everyone else without them having the slightest clue as to what really are his motives has completely blown me away. Johnny Depp sure gave the performance of his life with this role and I'm still so very, very mad at the fact that he didn't get an Oscar for this achievement. Sure, Sean Penn is also a great actor, but the fact still remains, that without Johnny Depp we would have never gotten to know our beloved Captain Jack. No one else would have played him like this and he really created something on his own, instead of simply reading the script and doing it in the straightest way possible. And that's why he should have gotten an Oscar! - But hey, there's still hope for the third part!"

"thinker1691","8","2","5","28 December 2006"," The Celluloid Pirate
","In the eighteen century, in the West Indies of the Caribbean Sea, there roamed a magnificent seafaring group of individuals who prided themselves in not only creating an adventurous and certainly idealistic way of life, but enamored a secondary generation to emulate their deeds centuries after their demise. They became known as The Pirates of the Caribbean. Today, the Disney group is satisfying the demand of the visual interpretation of said pirates. Reflecting and certainly echoing their traditional exploits is Disney's film version of the same name. In this film, Johnny Depp, is fabulous as Captain Jack Sparrow. This individual is a small package filled with more excitement than a barrel of gunpowder. Throughout this film he consistently invites the viewer to follow him from multiple escapes, duels with sword makers, damsels in distress and British Soldiers from the port-cities and market towns, in search of a cursed ship called The Black Pearl. Strewn throughout this adventure are Depps' fellow actors which include, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom who is superb as Will Turner, Jack Davenport as Norrington and Keira Knightley, as Elizabeth Swann whom seems at times incongruous and out of place as the precursor of a modern feminist. Despite the awesome, incredible, often ideal locations and speculator scenery, studded with everything, but the essentials allowing the film lack to resolution for Sparrow or the viewer. Often we anticipate either, to be thrust into yet another hair-raising adventure or a ghost chasing episode which is setting itself up for a further sequel. Thus despite it's wondrous appeal, and Sparrow's ever changing destiny and demeanor, ( which by the way is a bit, effeminate, the film lacks adhesion to either traditional pirates or to their eventuality. In the end, it's a good film, which insists on re-creating itself again and again. ****"

","I have just watched the original Pirates of the Caribbean for the third time. The first time was in the theater in '03, and the second time was when my brother bought the DVD in '04. While the first viewing was fun, I remember the second viewing as rather pedestrian. But I'm glad I watched it again now (after having seen and enjoyed the sequel), because I wasn't bored for a second of it. The dialog is sharp and funny (at times even intelligent), the story progresses very well, and the production values are top of the line (even if '03 CGI looks dated now - but by ""production values"" I mostly mean the beautiful sets and environments).<br/><br/>I was struck by how much of the action of the sequel is prefigured in the original movie, and how some puzzling details that are explained in the sequel were never revealed in the first movie (such as the ""compass that doesn't point north"", which only in the sequel is revealed to be pointing at what the holder most desires).<br/><br/>So while I originally rated the first (and the second) movie a 7 out of 10, I will now emend that to an 8, for both movies. They're a couple of great romps, packed with action, ideas, characterization and eye candy.<br/><br/>The third movie, unfortunately, was a huge disappointment for me... :-("
"Evil_Magus","8","2","5","16 July 2006"," This is the Kind of Movie That Improves the More You Watch It.
","When I saw this movie, I was surprised ---no--- out right stunned as to the kind of movie that could be made based off of a Disney ride. This isn't some simple point ""A"" to point ""B"" plot, these characters aren't mechanical merry-men and the score isn't the work of some back-stage maestro on a keyboard. Everything about this movie was incredible and surprising, and the more I watched it the greater it seemed to become.<br/><br/>The acting of this film was outstanding, with a full and able a cast as could be wanted. The greatest was, of course, Johnny Depp's performance. He always chooses very quirky, very unique and singular, characters to play, and Captain Jack Sparrow fits Depp's natural tendencies. He's a quirky and awkward character who acts as if in a perpetual drunken and ataxic stagger. Accompanied with typically slurred words and uncomfortable body language, this would, in the hands of most other actors, be an awkward and uneven performance. But Depp pulls it off flawlessly in this striking and memorable addition to his acting repertoire.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom, fresh off of his work as The Lord of the Ring's Legolas Greenleaf, plays the blacksmith William Turner, and easily holds his own next to Depp. While his part is not nearly so... colorful... it is, nonetheless, equally memorable. He is a believable performer who has noticeably grown from his Lord of the Rings performance. He acts as the antithesis of Depp's character; a serious and emotional individual to contrast with Depp's quirky and aloof character.<br/><br/>This, personally, is my favorite performance of Kiera Knightley's, even overshadowing her Oscar-nominated performance in 2005's Pride & Prejudice. While this role is clearly not meant to showcase her talents, nor is it as necessarily deep or spotlighted as Elizabeth Bennet's, it is a clear and charming performance. She takes on a somewhat comedic supporting role and really shine in it. Her timing matches up well with her costars'; her comedic delivery leaves nothing to be desired. She's rather impressive in a role that could have become another ""damsel in distress"" awaiting rescuing in the hands of a lesser actress.<br/><br/>The remainder supporting cast all deserve mention for their talents. Geoffrey Rush shines marvelously as the villainous Captain Barbossa, Jack Davenport gives a stiff yet convincing performance as Commodore Norington and Jonathon Pryce give a light comedic performance as Governor Swan. Even David Bailie and Lee Arenberg played pleasant comedic performances as Cotten and Pintel, despite also playing the parts of decent villains.<br/><br/>The score was absolutely outstanding, a singular masterpiece all its own. Every song, every line, every measure, every note, is so striking that by simply listening to the score on its own you can tell exactly what part of the movie would be playing alongside it. It stands as one of my favorite movie scores, and Klaus Badelt has nestled himself along such greats as John Williams, Howard Shore, Danny Elfman and Elmer Bernstein. I personally preferred it to Return of the King's score (Which is really, really saying something, as that was a masterful composition), and the fact that this wasn't even NOMINATED for best score is a travesty to the history of the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Visually, it was outstanding. The special effects for the undead pirate crew were pretty impressive. But they weren't overly obtrusive; for how obvious they were, the effects were actually rather subtle still. The only part where they become a little hokey is when Kiera Knightley's launched into the air on a sort of trampoline. Other than that, the effect were flawless.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent movie; perfect for families, action fans, comedy fans and fans of any of the main actors/actresses. It is certainly deserving of all the praise it's received as well as it's position on the IMDb top 250 (currently 237). This is a surprising gem of a movie, and one that it's quite difficult to find a person who absolutely dislikes it. It's a very safe movie to recommend to everybody."
"bloodmage05","10","2","5","7 July 2006"," Best Disney movie in my opinion.
","I'll admit, I didn't know much about Johnny Depp before I saw this movie back in 2004, a year after it came out. But now hes my favorite actor. It is probably one of my favorites because of great acting from Depp, Bloom, and Knightley. I also enjoyed how there are the different scenes from the ride at Disney land/world. Cpt. Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) was by far my favorite villain of all times. I honestly cant think of any weaknesses in the movie what so ever other than the CG isn't up to date anymore. Over all I think that the entire cast deserves three flaming thumbs up(if thats possible) I highly recommend to everyone. I think I'll be Jack Sparrow this year for Halloween..."

","what makes this film so genius? is it Orlando Bloom's sword fighting skills and brilliant hat? no. Is it Kiera Knightley's comic moments with the Comodore and her incredible corset? no. Or is it Johnny Depp with a gun? HELL YEAH!!! an incredible movie well worth a watch for anyone who is still a big kid at heart.Orlando Bloom delivers a inspiring performance as our young love struck blacksmith oblivious to his pirate ancestry while Kiera Knightley and Jack Davenport give the film the light hearted comedy that keeps you laughing throughout. Onc again outstanding performances from Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush set of the tone of the movie and with it's many action scenes no-one can say this film doesn't got out with a bang. and for all females reading who can go wrong with having Johnny Depp, Jack Davenport and Orlando Bloom in the same movie.this film really is complete genius. i only have one thing left to say ""Welcome to the Caribbean love."""

","This is masterful entertainment for people of all ages. I didn't take it seriously the first time even though Depp impressed as always. He certainly did get a slew of awards and nominations, including a chance at an Oscar. He was certainly deserving of it.<br/><br/>Amazing the concept comes from a theme park. Everything is done right here. Often movies fade as time goes on, but this one moves from strength to strength and builds up to a finale the way it's supposed to be done.<br/><br/>I don't like Disney and don't understand anyone who does. So it just doesn't feel good this coming from such a financial - and even political - empire. But it's good fun all around.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, made by Zimmer collaborator Klaus Badelt, moves along just like a Zimmer production would. It keeps things going.<br/><br/>Masterful entertainment without being profound - and the lasting memory will always be Captain Jack Sparrow. That this one is in the all time top 250 at the IMDb is perhaps too much - but an 8 out of 10 is exactly appropriate: it's that well done."

","I saw the commercial for this film in the TV and I thought, Oh, I don't want to see this movie it is way to scary. But my parents got it for me at my birthday and I completely fell in love with the movie, its characters and the humor. It has the wonderful mix of action, romance and humor that only a few, too few, movies have. I have now seen it so many times that I have stopped counting. I know must of the lines by heart and I still thinks it's a brilliant movie even when I know the ending. Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor and even when he's not in focus he completely steals the picture. Keira Knightley is gorgeous and Orlando Bloom is so handsome, but Johnny is the true star in this movie you just have to see. I will recommend the commentaries on the movie, some of them are really entertaining. So see it again and again and again."
"SkienHigh","10","2","5","12 April 2006"," Best pirate film in years
","This is by far one of the best movies in my collection of DVD's. Pirates of the Caribbean is the best rendition of a traditional pirate movie plus all the special effects and budgets of our day and age. Johnny Depp was the absolute perfect character to play Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom couldn't have played the part of Will Turner any better. The casting crew did their homework and compiled and all-star team of actors and really knocked this movie out of the park. I gave this movie 10 out of 10 because there isn't any other pirate movie out there in the market to compare this one with. Better yet, I haven't seen a pirate movie at all that was worth anything except this one and I must say, I have been duly spoiled by it. I hope they come out with a sequel, because I can guarantee you that I will be one of the guys waiting outside the theater just to be the first one in."

Amazing action scenes and brilliant sets, this movie has it all. Good directing by Gore Verbinski and well done acting! This movie is recommended for all pirate lovers and other people who just like movies with loads of good actors. Johnny Depp is by far my best actor, but that does not mean that the others aren't. This movie is probably one of the best in the world and is very, very well done. The ships and battles are incredible. The ghosts are very realistic and funny (the guy with the glass eye) and a amazing sword duel to finish. Outstanding!"

He always comes through with a funny moment and provides comic relief.<br/><br/>Also, the plot line, while a bit confusing, was clever and original. There were no holes in it and the plot was tied up.<br/><br/>Also, many of the minor characters in their own way were funny.<br/><br/>Finally, I thought the ending (which I won't tell you about) was also clever.<br/><br/>Plus, you know, johnny+eyeliner=yum :-) <3"

Johnny Depp was Exceptional- no body could have played the role of Jack Sparrow better. I just smiled throughout the whole thing, because his performance was so fantastic. His wit was great and the one-liners were completely memorable.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom made excellent eye-candy, and Keira Knightley was as gorgeous as ever and played an excellent role. Geoffry Rush played his role with as much ease as Depp and really did the whole bad-guy thing well! <br/><br/>The action was fantastic- the fantasy side was enjoyable. The jokes were great, and the special effects were also A+. I could watch this over and over again, and still get the same great feeling from it. There aren't a lot of pirate films out there, but this is by far the best there is.<br/><br/>Certainly deserving of many sequels and I would definitely recommend it to buy and keep on DVD."
"teo-sun","10","2","5","9 March 2006"," Harrr...This flick delivered shivers down my salty spine!!!
","Ahoi there!!! ""Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl"" is one of the most funny, exiting, action-filled, spectacular masterpiece of this genre! One thing over all: Johnny Depp! He is simply fantastic acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow. I consider him one of the best actors of all times because he is always perfect in almost every role (thanks to Tim Burton that discovered him!). Jack Sparrow is incredible, funny and strange, the perfect buccaneer for a movie like that. Good performance from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley too. The photography, the sets, are perfect, and you can feel all the ""salty"" feeling of the Caribbeans in the whole movie. The story is good: a good mix of adventure and mystery, filled with action, explosions, and naval battles. The extra contents on the DVD shows how they have bought to life all that magic! The soundtrack is epic and it fit perfectly in the movie, thanks to Klaus Badelt, a real artist. In conclusion, this is an adventure masterpiece, incredibly entertaining for everyone who have a little pirate-child inside! HARRR..... where's my bottle of rum???"

The creators of this film were so lucky to have worked with such talented people.<br/><br/>I just thought i would say that there is one mistake, near the beginning they tie Johhny Depps hand s together with iron bar thing but when he slides down the rope he puts his hands down the bar an in real life he would not be able to do that!!!"

"flo116","10","2","5","2 February 2006"," an all around great movie
","Every time I watch this movie I enjoy it more. I see new things every time. POTC is funny and heart warming. The hero's are flawed but lovable. It has a lot of different stories going on and they are all presented in an understandable way. It is just a fun enjoyable movie and I think will be a classic Disney movie. I went to see it the first time because the Lady Washington played the Interceptor and she was built on the harbor where I live. I just was enamored with Johnny Depp whom I had only vaguely heard of before. I am so glad I went to see it I would have missed so much if I hadn't. I only saw it once on the big screen and wish I had seen it more and I will get the chance with the new ones coming out."

","Not too many could pull of a pirate movie like that. I'll be honest, when i heard there was a pirate movie coming out, I laughed. Pirates? Was the audience two-year old boys? I wouldn't have gone to see it if my friend hadn't told me how good it was.<br/><br/>The actors were phenomenal, and the script was so well written. Johnny Depp gave an outstanding perfromance as the legendary Jack Sparrow. He portrayed his character so well, a rough, take-no-crap tough man, but somewhat sweet on the inside. Kiera Knightley had a character with same same kind of personality as Jack (except not as happy-go-lucky while drunk). Orlando Bloom, oh my gosh! I never thought I could find a man with long hair sexy, but he just completely....ugh, it was great! His acting, his character, his look, all fantastic. <br/><br/>Please Hollywood, make more movies like this!"
"badgerboytc","10","2","5","29 January 2006"," Amazing absolutely Amazing
","Although when thought of a pirate movie was in the making i had my doubts whether it would be a worthwhile movie 1 to watch or 2 to even make, whether or not it was based on a Disney theme park ride or not. But how i was wrong.<br/><br/>With none stop brilliant acting throughout and a real smart dialogue with the right amount of humour to not this into a comedy genre movie was ideal. The real show stopper was off course the great Johnny Depp who up to now in my opinion has never played apoor role.The way he move and most definitely talks is perfect and in my opinion no one else could have played the character as good as he, he was seriously a joy to watch. With great help from the all star cast or Bloom, Rush and off course Knightley the film started and ended with absolute flying colours.<br/><br/>The best thing in this movie is the way that the zombie pirates of the black pearl are portrayed and in my opinion a bliss to watch. I feel that every one should watch this movie and if they don't should be cursed to being in a zombie state themselves.<br/><br/>Ps that last line was a joke."
"spotteddalmation_101","10","2","5","16 January 2006"," my favourite film ever ever
","I adore this film because it has everything, sun, sea and Johnny Depp (Orlando and Keira for those of you who don't share my passion.)I was ABSOLUTELY astounded to watch this slip by any Oscars although Depp received a few minor awards. Totally first class acting from the man as the irresistible Captain Jack Sparrow, loosely based on Keith Richards.<br/><br/>Sparrow swaggers and burbles his rum-soaked self across the Caribbean on a quest to reclaim his beloved ship the Black Pearl from his mutinous first mate Barbossa and involves young Will Turner (Orlando B) who's trying to win over Elizabeth Swan (Keira K). So follows the most exciting and funny adventure on the seven seas with some really great quotes.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this already I'm shocked and suggest you go out and buy it now (you'll want it in hard copy, trust me.) Potc2:Dead Man's Chest London release is 7th July 2006 and they are in the process of filming Potc3. Long live Captain Jack Sparrow."

","I can not think of a better person to play Jack Sparrow than Johnny Depp. The part was made for him. Keira Knightley plays the part of Elizabeth excellently and Orlando Bloom did a great job with Will Turner. There is a lot of comedy in the movie, most of it coming from Johnny Depp. There is a part near the start of the movie when Depp comes sailing into Port Royal in a sinking boat and by the time the boat gets to the platform it is just at the right height for Depp to step onto the platform from the crows nest. There is also a thing called the Pirates code that the Pirates will never break, however Captain Barbossa always finds loopholes in the code. I could never get tired of watching this movie"
"helz_belz1","10","2","5","3 January 2006"," A fantastic new age pirate film with everything!
","Set in the 17th century, a time where Pirates ruled the Caribbean, we meet Jack Sparrow (Depp) an unpredictable pirate and Will Turner (Bloom) and honest blacksmith who loves the governors daughter Elizabeth Swann (Knightly). When Miss Swann is captured by the evil Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew of treacherous pirates who plan to use Elizabeth and her necklace to lift their curse, Will seeks out Jack and the mismatched pair go after Elizabeth, the Black Pearl (Barbossa's ship), adventure and revenge together. This movie is a great movie with fun for all the family. Johnny Depp really brings the film to life with his fantastic humour and great acting. Everything fits and the special affects are great. Watch it if you enjoy action movies with humour such as the Mummy Returns."
"gluttony14","10","2","5","28 December 2005"," ""Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.""
","The first time I watched this movie was sometime during the summer of 2003. I read about it a bit, heard about it from a friend, and decided it sounded like a nice movie, so I might as well go watch it. And at first, I came out thinking it was a nice movie, nothing more. But I had watched it again later. And again. And again. And you could say the movie grew on me, because while I admit this isn't the best film ever made, it is my favorite movie.<br/><br/>So what makes this so great? It's fun. I can watch it many times over and over and never grow tired of it. Be it the incredible fight scenes, the captivating scenery, the rich and amusing dialogue, the interesting plot line, or the unbelievable acting, something about this movie never bores me and just has me watching it again and again. I have seen the Star Wars movies many times, and can find myself growing bored while watching them. I have seen the Indiana Jones films many times, and lately found myself beginning to grow a bit bored while watching them (they are still enormous fun, though). I have seen Pirates more than any of the previous films, and never once have I been bored with it. Too often I catch it on the TV, sit down to watch a favorite scene, and stick on for the rest of the movie. It simply never gets old, and it's just as fun to watch it the tenth time as it is to watch it the first time.<br/><br/>Part of the reason for it is, I suppose, that the movie doesn't really rely much on its plot to progress. Sure, it has a good, solid and interesting plot: the town of Port Royal is attacked by the cursed pirate ship, the Black Pearl, captained by the vile captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter of the governor of Port Royal, is kidnapped by the pirates due to a certain medallion she possesses and the name she gives the pirates as her own. Young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the local blacksmith who has a secret love for Elizabeth, goes to rescue her and enlists to his help captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has his own plans regarding Will, the Black Pearl and Barbossa. It is interesting to see how the plot develops, but what really holds you are the magnificent scenes that come one after another. Whether it's the amazing sword fights (such as the early fight between Will and Jack, an extremely well-choreographed and amusing clash), the naval battles (fire all cannons, arr!) or the stellar performance by Johnny Depp, each scene is as captivating as the previous.<br/><br/>I have mentioned all the good things in this movie (and yes, there are a lot of them), but the absolute best is the acting: Bloom and Knightley are good as Will and Elizabeth, each portraying their characters personalities extremely well, and you can believe that the two care about each other. Geoffrey Rush is extremely captivating as the villainous captain Barbossa. He manages to look, feel and sound like a true villain (even adding a little ""arr!"" here and there) while still having us believe that Barbossa is a human after all, with motives and feelings. You can understand why he's doing what he's doing in the movie. And as for why he's a pirate - that's what rotten scalawags such as him do. The true star of this movie, though, is Johnny Depp. Jack Sparrow is incredible - he acts a bit drunk and a bit crazy (to the extent where you hardly see the difference when he actually is drunk!), yet he is also cunning, intelligent and thoughtful. He is also amusing to no end, dishing out funny lines one after another, while maintaining to remain serious when the time calls for it. Depp's acting in this movie is truly the best I have ever seen in my opinion, and I believe to this day that he has been robbed of his rightful Oscar.<br/><br/>And finally, I can't help but mention, that simply the fact that this is a pirate movie makes it so fun. Pirates are fun, and I am really interested in pirates. This film may not give a historically accurate version of piracy (I don't recall undead pirates ever mentioned in history books) but it's still fun, and gives you everything you need when it comes to the romanticized view of pirates that's so dominant in today's modern culture.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow says at one time during the movie: ""Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate."" and this is especially true of this film. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is treasure. It's a captivating, enriching experience. You'll come out with a smile on your face, and the mood for swashbuckling. Anyone who hasn't watched it yet, hurry up and do. Anyone who has, go watch it again. It's worth it. I'd give it 11 out of 10 if only I could. ARR!!"

","Ever played Monkey Island? This film is a pirate movie in true Monkey Island style. In case you've never played that game it means lot of fun, crazy pirates, a beautiful lady and a bunch of zombie like pirates.<br/><br/>First of all the story is good. The whole love thing is simple and not original, but who cares?! It works and the setting, characters and the whole curse thing spices up the story a lot and makes it very interesting. The dialog is very nice. It's funny, but not all too funny. That keeps the focus on the story. The characters are good and they work well together creating contrasts and showing development through the film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is very good. He pulls off this whole pirate act really good and manage to take on an English accent. Orlando Bloom is nothing worse. His performance in believable and good. All together the cast is strong and preform very well. The use of English actors makes the whole thing more believable.<br/><br/>The effects are well done. In the beginning you'll see some not exactly impressive CGI, but the rest is much better. The skeletons looks good and the explosions too. The fights are well coordinated and the rhythm of the fencing in the blacksmiths workshop is really nice.<br/><br/>The music is also good. It's piraty and gets you in the mood. It builds up around the action and fits the movie very well. You don't pay attention too it, witch is a good thing. It means it fits the movie and the action and subconscious just affects your feelings like it should.<br/><br/>It's a good looking movie, meaning the cinematography is good. The composition is good and so is the lightning. No shots stood out as extraordinary, but no one stood out as bad neither. It's nice shooting with some playful shots here and there and all together good cinematography.<br/><br/>The sets and decorations also make this movie good looking. The mix of CGI and real stuff is good and the look of the costumes and the settings are believable and nice.<br/><br/>All together I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was way better than I expected. It added a lot of comedy, but still focused on the story and managed to remain serious. I would definitely recommend this movie if your looking for a high quality, cool and funny adventure movie to watch."
"Audie-T","9","2","5","5 November 2005"," A great, true swashbuckling adventure!
","This movie was everything a great pirate movie should be, and more! Instead of adding more praise and point out some flaws, which previous reviewers have already done, I will say this: Johnny Depp may be the coolest character that sweeps you away but Geoffrey Rush is actually the better pirate. <br/><br/>You will realize this during the scene where Barbosa points exactly the same out to Sparrow. The bottom line: Sparrow has a heart and cares about doing the right thing while Barbosa is one evil son of a b*** who'd sell his own mother if it would make him a profit.<br/><br/>Oh, and the true star of this movie, of course: The Pirates! I felt so sorry for them in the end. But looking at the sequel currently in production and seeing the names of supporting cast, perhaps I have nothing to worry about."
"Carrigon","4","2","5","20 July 2003"," Nice costumes and sets, so-so plot
","Well, I liked the costumes and the sets.  You could tell they spent alot of money making this movie.  The skeletons were fun.  But as far as the plot goes, half the time it just felt like this confusing mess.  And while I loved how Jonny Depp looked in this film, I didn't like the way his character was written.  I felt like I was watching Richard Simmons in a pirate costume!  I think I would have liked this movie better had it been more of a horror film instead of an adventure movie.  I think it would have worked scary.  I would have liked Depp's character to have been tougher.  I guess this movie is okay if you like pirate films, but it just wasn't what I wanted.  I would love to see it redone with alot of horror, but I know I'm dreaming.  So, see it for the costumes, but don't expect it to be a great film."

","This movie was one of the most boring movies that I have seen this year. It was slow paced the whole movie with little to no action at all.

","Nice effects but not enough to want to see this film again.   Just another action film, the storyline has been done again and again. Formula, formula, formula.

"odd_bloke","1","4","16","15 August 2005"," Poor Historical Accuracy
","Personally, I found this film to be a great disappointment. I am something of a history nut and so was disappointed by the amount of inaccuracy of the movie. For example:<br/><br/>1) Every cannonball in the movie exploded, yet they were all fired from long guns and so would just have been lumps of metal hurtling through the air.<br/><br/>2) Norrington had a huge ceremonial promotion to commodore. A commodore was not a permanent rank. It was simply a way of distinguishing between a captain who had been given /temporary/ command of a squadron and one who had not.<br/><br/>3) There were never enough sailors on any of the ships. Most ships of that era had literally hundreds of men aboard. The Black Pearl would have had at least 100 as a skeleton crew (no pun intended) and they would not have been able to use the guns or mount any sort of assault. It would have a full complement of something like 500, if not more.<br/><br/>4) All the sailors were bedecked in ridiculous uniforms. All of the sailors seemed to be wearing their dress uniforms all the time, which simply would not happen on any ship. As if this wasn't bad enough, some of those who weren't marines were wearing red, which would make them an anathema to all the other men in the ship.<br/><br/>However, action-wise, the film is very good, though Depp does begin to get on my nerves after a while."
"dbdumonteil","5","3","11","29 March 2006"," didn't deserve so much hype in the Summer 2003
","Like musicals, the pirate movie fell a little into oblivion these last years. There were endeavors to revive it but ended either in artistic failure. ""Pirates"" (1986) by Roman Polanski enters this category, a project whose preparation was long and arduous and in the end, it was a very impersonal amount and Polanski's absolute nadir of his career with the desultory ""What?"" (1972). Then, ""Cutthroat Island"" (1995) was a contender for the genre but ended in a financial fiasco. Nearly a decade later, Gore Verbinski with whom, a good majority of cine buffs had unearthed in him palpable skills in directing with the chilling ""the Ring"" (2002) and under the command of the Disney firm embarked on a new ship. Direction: the pirate island with the well-intentioned will to restore once for all the reputation of the pirate movie. Unfortunately, he didn't arrive at the end of his trip. His ship fell through. It was a profitable blockbuster for the mighty producer Jerry Bruckheimer who once again lined his pockets. Artistically, well let's be as nice as possible and it will be hard because I had relied on the director of ""the Ring"" to rejuvenate the pirate movie and to deliver a solid entertaining film. My hopes were blighted.<br/><br/>It was maybe a mistake to have entrusted him a big-budget film. He seems to have been dwarfed by Bruckheimer's omnipotence. However the latter's trademark is present in virtually each shot, each image of the venture and there's nothing wrong about it: exotic landscapes, lush scenery, lavish costumes, grand score, a whiff of epic movie, pursuits galore, naval engagements, a dash of fight and fusillades sequences and of course, perhaps the indispensable element: swashbuckler which was a specialty of French cinema in the sixties, helped by the unparalleled Jean Marais. There was everything in the same package which brought out a conducive odor to entice and charm the greatest number of viewers.<br/><br/>Alas! ""Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl"" is partly plagued by a derivative directing which can't live up to the enormous means and budget the film had at its disposal. Verbinski had been more inspired with ""the Ring"". However, one can feel a buoyant will from Verbinski to film his story. It's true, there's a perennial humor difficult to resist, fast-paced action. There were also visible efforts on the costumes and scenery. Everything to inspire a good amount to dream, liberty to the audience. But Verbinski sedately shoots Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom)'s adventure to find again Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and in the end, the whole smells the reheated. The movie also could have gained by being curtailed of about half an hour.<br/><br/>Verbinski's vehicle is also handicapped by its scenario and it's perhaps what hampers most the success of the film. ""The Ring"" had a quite strong screenplay in store but here, it's a snap, slick one. Yes, there are some neat twists to keep the audience interested until the tail end but it also encapsulates major, unacceptable drawbacks which are nonsensical in the story as a whole. So, the malicious pirates took Elizabeth hostage to help them to find a treasure which would make them human beings again (at night, they turn into living dead) but isn't it an excellent opportunity for them to reinforce and establish their power? No, instead they want to become mortal, flesh and blood men again. Then, in the first minutes of the film, after Elizabeth took Will in, she's looking at the sea and as the mist clears away, she can see a pirate ship because of the black flag. The pirate ship is close enough to enable the crew on board to see Elizabeth's ship, so why isn't there a naval engagement? It's also hard to swallow the story of Will's father and the scenarists could have found a better and less far-fetched way to make Depp and Knightley meet. The latter wears a dress with a more than fitted waist and because of this, she falls (from a high height) into the sea (you have to see the sequence to understand it and to realize how ludicrous it is). But fortunately, Depp was in the surroundings... you can guess the rest. There's also some filler in the scenario (when Depp and Knightley are on the desert island).<br/><br/>The actors partially redeem the whole. Johnny Depp plays his game well. His mix of gravity and mockery spices up the story. Geoffrey Rush also takes the lion's share about the quality of the acting. But Orlando Bloom delivers a rather wooden acting and Keira Knightley doesn't really display skills of thespian.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Carabbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl"" is plagued by a shoddy story which should have been more stringent. There are also flashy special effects and a mundane directing. To some extent, some qualities of ""the Ring"" which had contributed in cementing its stance of winner have turned into drawbacks here. Once again, there's no accounting for taste but this blockbuster isn't the guarantee of a quality entertaining movie. But the majority of the audience doesn't seem to have this problem. A sequel will reach the streets this summer. Will it be worthwhile?"

","When my family first got this out, I thought it might be okay. It. Was. Brilliant. It's an interesting plot, but, as you can probably guess, it was Johnny Depp's slightly odd, Keith Richards-based, cunning Jack Sparrow ('scuse me, sorry, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow) who steals the show with his madness and classic one-liners.<br/><br/>However, this does not mean that Depp was the only good member in the cast. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley work well together and Geoffrey Rush is his usual excellent and versatile self. Plus, the script was good. It was really nice to see a Pirate movie that's made for the modern-day audience, or even a modern pirate movie at all.<br/><br/>I recommend you watch this; it really is a work of genius."
"scottishrose","10","2","6","22 July 2006"," Unbelievable
","This is my single favourite movie in the entire world. I'm serious. Ever since I got it on DVD just a week ago, I've watched it every single day. I'm close to memorizing all the dialogue and I know every shot. As I write this, it's paused on the television in my room.<br/><br/>The reason I love this movie so much is mostly the character work. The cursed Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) instills such fear in me, and at the same time, draws a burning sense of pure pity for his plight. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), while a fine lady in all respects, is feisty and vivacious as well. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is a good friend and a fine man, modest and brave.<br/><br/>However, the character of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is by far the most excellently played character I've ever seen. You can see deeply into his personality, simply by the motions Mr Depp goes through. It is clear that Jack, while a pirate, is indeed a good man. He is honourable and stands by his word at all times. His main goal in life is simply freedom; all of his crimes were to further that goal. He also dislikes taking away the dignity of his adversaries. He would never commit mutiny or murder for that reason.<br/><br/>The one thing I even remotely disliked was Orlando Bloom's wooden acting. He seemed to be only able to deliver his lines in one tone, one personage. It was fine for the first half-hour or so, but after that I was mostly just waiting for his parts to be over and so we could get back to Jack Sparrow's screen time.<br/><br/>The score for this movie is absolutely STUNNING. It's filled with powerful strings and strong brass, and it has been soaring through my head ever since the first time I saw this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a masterpiece. By all means, I encourage you to see and purchase this amazing film. You will not regret it, I guarantee you of that."
"Polaris_DiB","8","2","6","29 October 2005"," Depp and Rush shine
","Everybody likes pirates! (Well, not the music industry, but whatever...) Johnny Depp shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, a cleverly klutzy pirate who is in search for the Black Pearl and the crew that mutinied it from him. Leader of the mutineers is Captain Barbossa, a mean dirty pirate with a curse that sends him searching for the pieces of some ancient Aztec gold... and the blood of a good pirate's son.<br/><br/>It also involves a side story about that young son (Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom) and the love of his life (Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley), but nobody cares.<br/><br/>Honestly, Johnny Depp MADE the movie. His perfect characterization of a quirky swashbuckler is both funny and memorable. His personality and charisma shines from screen to screen as he tries to figure out how to get what he wants when everybody else seems to be against him.<br/><br/>Depp by himself, though, would have made for a strained and bad movie indeed. Even a good actor with a good character can be dire and silly in a movie that doesn't compliment them. Thus we have Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa, the driven evil that compliments Depp's Sparrow well. Rush obviously had a lot of fun with the role and it's a real joy to see him, especially when working off of Depp.<br/><br/>It also has some pretty good dialog, stuff to make you laugh in between action moments. Very quotable, stuff like, ""Where's the rum?"" which is bound to stay in fanboy lingo for ages to come.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow who in the first scene is looking to steal a ship because his previous ship was stolen from him. Bloom plays a blacksmith who is in love with Knightley but she is the daughter of the Governor and is asked by a top guard to the governor if she'll marry him. Their is a lot of plot to the movie and at almost two and a half hours the movie doesn't even seem that long. Rush makes a great villain who tried to kill Depp before and Depp is looking for revenge.

"rainynight65","8","2","6","22 September 2004"," This movie did everything right
","To be honest, I didn't expect much from this movie when it came out. Everyone was talking about the SFX, noone really mentioned the story, so I didn't consider it worth watching in the theatre. However, when a friend borrowed me the DVD, I changed my mind completely.<br/><br/>Nowadays, when a movie comes out, it usually falls under at least one of these categories: a) it's made after a book (or a comic), b) it focuses on SFX rather than on storytelling, and c) it belongs to a genre which has been completely exhausted during the last couple years. Now none of these points mean that it is a bad movie, however when at least two points apply, it's mostly bound to be a flick you watch once and then forget about. It was truly refreshing to see a movie which for a change didn't apply to any of these categories.<br/><br/>Meanwhile I bought the DVD, and I catch myself watching the movie or parts of it over and over again. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' basically does everything right. It has a gripping, immersing story, a great cast and dedicated crew, great photography and a wonderful musical score. It belongs to a genre which has been nearly extinct in the last years, it has a story which strays from the usual stereotypes, and it uses SFX to make the movie better, not just to show off with latest technology.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is just brilliant in the role of Jack Sparrow, he makes you laugh over and over again. As does Geoffrey Rush, who plays Captain Barbossa. Some of the cast stay a bit pale, like Orlando Bloom, who I think can do better. The SFX blend perfectly into the movie, these skeletons are great. The music is wonderful as well, worth buying the soundtrack. The score is so catchy, I find myself humming or whistling parts of it constantly.<br/><br/>This is entertainment at its best. Not an alltime classic, it doesn't have too much of a message, but that wasn't the goal of making it anyway. Worth watching several times, since you discover new details every time. Right now it ranks pretty high in my favourite list. 8/10 stars from me for this one."
"rosscinema","6","2","6","3 August 2003"," Depp adds needed ingredient
","This easily could have been your run of the mill pirate movie but thank god Johnny Depp is not only a terrific actor but one that adds real ""Character"" to his characters. Film starts out with a young boy found adrift at sea with a gold medallion around his neck and an old ship which looks like a ghost ship is spotted. Years later the boy Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is working with a blacksmith and in love with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and she is the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) who would rather see his daughter marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport). One day at port a strange sailor shows up as his small vessel sinks and he is found out to be pirate Jack Sparrow (Depp). They want to hang him but that night the town is attacked by pirates headed by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Jack has a personal beef with him. Seems as though Jack was the Captain of the ship Black Pearl but the crew performed a mutiny and left Jack on a deserted island which he escaped from. Two of the pirates grab Elizabeth because she has Will's medallion and while questioning her she says her last name is Turner. She discovers during her kidnapping that the pirates are really the walking dead and in the moonlight they appear as rotted cadavers. They think she is related to ""Boot Strap"" Turner who was a pirate that they killed and they need the blood of his offspring to become human again. Jack and Will steal a ship and go to recruit sailors so they can save Elizabeth and Jack can reap the rewards as well. This film is directed by Gore Verbinski and along with ""Mouse Hunt"" he demonstrates a real flare for lavish sets and decorum. The sets are terrific here and the special effects are pretty good as well, especially some of the underwater shots looking up at the bottom of the ships. The big problem with this film (Besides being too long) is the script. How many times did Depp get captured by either side and then have to talk his way out? And the romance between Bloom and Knightley is just so cliche. Knightley is particularly dreary. She's a fresh pretty young face but in this film her role could have been performed by any other actress and it would have been the same. She showed much more spark and left an indelible mark in the film ""Bend It Like Beckham"". Here, she's just a forgettable pretty face. What saves this film is Depp and Rush. Thankfully these two remarkable actors add so much imagination to their roles and they give the film the added flavor it badly needed. Can you imagine this film without them? Depp has stated that he played his role in the nature of a drunken Keith Richards and with the eyeliner he wears its a joy to watch him. Rush also does a good job and with that monkey on his back he seems to be having a good time. Some of the other pirates are played on a comedic level and one that stands out is the pirate with a glass eye. The film doesn't take itself seriously and this attitude works to its advantage. This film came very close to being very routine but with the performances of Depp and Rush they together save it from being predictable and stale."

(PG-13)<br/><br/>Bloated pirate swashbuckler, superficially based on the Disney theme park attraction (because a Broadway musical about log flumes was considered too daring?), accompanied by supernatural elements that co-mingle with the usual cannon fire and swordplay. Depp is the grogged-up and swishy Jack Sparrow, former captain of the ""cursed"" ship, the Black Pearl; he reluctantly teams up with a blacksmith (Bloom) to thwart the villainous, ghostly Barbossa (Rush), who has kidnapped Bloom's lady love (Knightley). Stylish, atmospheric, intricately-designed production has plenty of action and humor, dominated by an enjoyably amusing performance from Depp, even if a little less of him would have made him more endearing. Unfortunately, the film is also fatally overlong, with at least one too many large-scale action sequences, not to mention repetitive fights that go on and on, long past the point that mild excitement transitions to tedium (overall interest dies out sometime in the middle of the broadside-bombarding sea battle...and there's still almost an hour left to go!).

"masonmorgan-92917","8","1","2","27 December 2016"," Incredibly fun and entertaining swashbuckler
","Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has become one of Disney's staples in modern cinema. It completely smashed the box office for it's year and has since held up incredibly well. This Pirates of the Caribbean entry has set the standard for swashbuckler and just adventure films in general, as well as create on the most recognizable and influential movie characters of all time, Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp's eccentric performance aside, Pirates is still an immensely entertaining adventure film with likable characters, great action and an unwavering sense of confidence. <br/><br/>This entry to the Pirates series has an energy and personality that all the other entries lack. The story moves at such a pace where we never have time to become disinterested as we advance through the adventure at a break-neck speed. We also have a cast of very likable characters that show great on screen chemistry as well as providing the majority of the films energy and personality. All this, along with the excellently choreographed action sequences, makes Curse of the Black Pearl an infinitely re-watchable and endlessly enjoyable adventure.<br/><br/>Black Pearl features a very talented cast that each excellently fit their roles. They share great on- screen chemistry and the well written dialogue they deliver make their characters even more likable. While the acting overall was pretty great and fun to watch, there is no doubt that Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow carried the movie entirely as his performance alone gave the film the majority of it's character. Captain Jack Sparrow is one of cinema's most recognizable and widely liked characters as Depp's phenomenal delivery and unique mannerism makes him perfect for the eccentric pirate. It really is hard to think of anyone else more suitable for the role. There is a broad spectrum of different characters here, but any viewer is guaranteed to find at least one to like and cheer on throughout.<br/><br/>The story, while admittedly quite silly, has a surprising amount of layers and themes varying from friendship to loyalty and honesty. This being a Disney film, it of course is going to have themes like this, but the way these messages are delivered feel natural, not just pandering to the child audience. <br/><br/>One of the things that did kind of bother me was the execution of the subject matter. Disney's try at a pirate themed franchise seems strange as pirates usually indulged in violence, booze and women, making it a difficult subject for Disney to tackle without greatly cutting down on some aspects. There is an easily noticeable sense of goofiness and censorship throughout the film's action scenes. It doesn't necessarily ruin these scenes, but it does lack a sense of tension and intensity after Disney's tweaking. It doesn't quite satisfy the want for a ""real"" pirate film with gritty and realistic action sequences, but Black Pearl is still a fun venture for anyone to enjoy.<br/><br/>Another complaint is the run-time of the film. It clocks in at about 2 1/2 hours, which wouldn't be a problem if the film has enough substance to carry itself through the longer-than-average run-time, but Curse of the Black Pearl noticeably slows after 2 hours. Despite the fast-paced action of these 2 hours, the last 30 minutes makes the entire film feel overlong as it struggles to hold my attention in this time, especially during the literally pointless fight scenes involving Captain Jack Sparrow, who literally cannot die.<br/><br/>Despite the overlong run-time and somewhat censored pirate themes, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is still a fantastically fun adventure filled with likable characters and great action choreography. Bursting with energy and wit, this entry to the Pirates series kick-started a following of copycats and wannabes, but none will ever come close to touching the personality and character Black Pearl so effortlessly pulls off."

","This movie is a must fo anyone's collection. It's clean, exciting and fun to watch. It gave me a whole new view on piracy. I mean every pirate in movies and plays before this either had a parrot, a peg-leg or an eye-patch. Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't have any of those stereotypes. Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well. Knightley's role was a bit modern(strong, take- charge feminist), but that also added to the movie, she was great. I could go on about the actors, but there wouldn't be any more room, they were marvelous! This movie is mysterious, every single time I watch it, I can barely pull myself away from the screen! THis is without a doubt, the best movie I've seen yet.(A)"
"tiskec","8","1","2","15 November 2016"," <3 Love For Pirates <3
","I absolutely love this series. I think it's one of Disney's best series of films, and Johnny Depp' s best work. Also, who doesn't like Orlando Bloom? These two make this movie into a corked up bundle of fun. All the quirky sword fighting scenes and the dialog between these two in the film is something else. You gotta love it. <br/><br/>I love the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean. The whole series makes you feel like you're inside some kind of story book, along for the adventure. The characters are easy to connect with, because they adapt to your outlook in a goofy way. It definitely gives you the proper feel of an actual pirate adventure.<br/><br/>I liked the end the best, when Johnny Depp finds out he's got the curse as well. The Pirates are all really dead. He didn't know it, but he was cursed to live forever. Once they found all the treasure in the cave, Johnny Depp fights with the captain of the Black Pearl. His whole intention are to get a new ship this whole time. Every other character's mission is so complex, but his is the simplest, and he goes about them in the simplest ways. He is also the one that succeeds the most throughout the movie. It's too funny. <br/><br/>I really like this movie a lot. It gives you a storybook experience mixed with actual piracy type motives, by pirates. If that makes sense? I would definitely recommend this Disney flick to anyone in the mood for a good adventure."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","5 November 2016"," Adventure unlike any other
","A movie doesn't have to change how we see the world. It doesn't have to be deeply philosophical and profound. It doesn't have to render us down to tears. It doesn't have to be depressing and real. If it can be, and if it can pull it off beautifully... great. But it doesn't have to in order to be a good movie.<br/><br/>Take this movie, for instance. It's based on a amusement park ride, of all things. Disney decided to do a pirate film, when the subgenre was pretty much believed to be dead, buried and the earth salted. But they did it anyway. Someone out there had a story to tell and believed in it enough to sell it to others. And in the process they made the best adventure movie I've seen so far in my life. Everything this movie does is pure entertainment. It's a kid's dream come true. Pirates rule the Caribbean sea and every scurvy sailor out there is armed to teeth with cutlasses, crappy pistols and really bad rum. Men are steel, boats are wood and the black flag sends shivers down your spine.<br/><br/>But what really elevates this above other adventure films has to be the production values. First of all, the visuals are amazing. You're transported instantly into the age of sails, and the designs hit that perfect pitch between fantastic, real and horror. Top marks for the effects team. Second are the actors. Johnny Depp is nowadays synonymous with his character Jack Sparrow, who has become THE icon of piracy, with his outrageous look, mumbling speech patterns and plans which cannot possibly work, except that they're so crazy that somehow they do. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley play the two other main parts and they fit in like gloves as well.<br/><br/>Special mention has to go to Klaus Badelt for his score. Instantly recognizable, iconic and fitting the mood of dark and threatening adventure perfectly. One of the movie soundtracks I find myself listening over and over again.<br/><br/>I get why someone doesn't like this film. It just doesn't take itself all that seriously. But the thing is, if it did, it would be a lesser movie for it. The fun is in the adventure, in the fantasy. It's escapism at its finest. And I absolutely love I it. One of my favourite movies of all time and a journey I will take again and again for the rest of my life."
"AmyJenson1995","10","1","2","29 October 2016"," Do we have a heading? Yes for greatness!
","There are movies which are giving our faith back into the movie industry. Movies which are refreshing an entire genre in a very good way and will become a new model for films to come.<br/><br/>Since it has been released in 2003, I have been a huge fan of the Pirates of The Caribbeans saga. It's epic, funny, well directed and played, the CGIs are awesomely shot, the soundtrack is epic as well. There's nothing to throw away.<br/><br/>But the real magnet to this movie is Johnny Depp aka Jack Sparrow. He is cheating, awkward, a real loon but god he's so awesome! Johnny is displaying all his talent and class throughout the movie and is really the one we will always come to mind first when we talk about Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Although it would be terribly unfair to not praise the performance of the rest of the cast as they are as awesome as Mr Depp. Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally play their part perfectly and all are bringing their part to the plot.<br/><br/>Talking about that, the story is as epic as it could be. A mix between paranormal, adventure, comedy and action, it's keeping us entertained from start to finish and never letting us get bored. Some of the scenes are really scary like the one when Elizabeth discovers the terrible curse the Black Pearl crew is suffering and try to stop.<br/><br/>Romance has not been forgotten as well. The love triangle between Will, Elizabeth and Commodore Norrington is an entire part of the story as it's the main motive running through the movie. When Elizabeth is kidnapped by Barbossa, Will is going to her rescue ready to ally with someone he despise so much at the beginning to succeed in his task. Both of them are so cute and sympathetic.<br/><br/>Another great asset is the music. It's at the image of the movie: epic and adventurous. It's a perfect match to the tempo of the movie and the genre theme. Hans Zimmer did a perfect job once again.<br/><br/>To me it deserves a 10."

"akrake-85376","9","1","2","4 October 2016"," Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Review
","If you heard a movie was coming out based on a theme park ride that would seem like a ridiculous idea, right? Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" did just that. And made it a masterpiece. Although the plot is very good, it is the actors, action and use of effects that make it innovative in itself. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp was brilliant. He is the perfect amount of strange to pull off the role of Jack Sparrow. Sparrow is stupid but also genius. One way Depp plays into this characteristic is by leaning his head in, maybe a little too close, getting in their space and in their heads with his character's sneaky, ridiculous truths. Jack Sparrow is not a good guy, but the way Depp flails his arms and wiggles his fingers makes his character funny and entertaining enough that you end up rooting for him. Depp takes ""pirate"" to the next level of entertainment.<br/><br/>As Depp is an unforgettable goofy pirate, Geoffery Rush as Captain Barbosa is a villain that people will remember. Barbosa is a bad because of the circumstance of the curse, not just for the sake of being evil. However, Rush's acting gives him more character. He gives Barbosa a harsh voice, wide eyes, sneaking smile and a creepy laugh that shows he knows what he's doing and he's not joking around about breaking the curse. By being more than just a bad guy, he demands respect from not only his crew aboard the Black Pearl, but also the audience. <br/><br/>Along with the characters, the action in the movie is also very entertaining. They have lots of cannon fires and explosions setting things on fire, like when the crew of the Black Pearl attacks the town looking for the gold coin. Along with explosions, when Will and Elizabeth's crew fights the Black Pearl, they are out of cannonballs so they began to launch things like silverware at the other ship. One fun scene is between Jack Sparrow and William Turner. It starts as a typical sword fight, but then they get launched onto the ceiling panels, where the fight gets more interesting. Additions like these are creative and something that helps make the movie memorable. By using all real people doing real stunts, they take advantage of practical effects.<br/><br/>Disney uses practical effects in much more than just fighting. They also built their sets and all of the boats. Not only is it impressive that they built boats suitable for the sea, but they also create a storm. After Jack and his crew leave Tortuga in search of the island the Black Pearl is on, they encounter a huge storm. Instead of using CGI, the scene was created by building a boat in a large pool, creating waves and using rain machines for the storm. Using practical effects instead of special effects gives the movie an authentic feel that many movies lack.<br/><br/>It was the small things in this movie that made it so extraordinary. The actors, set designers, and producers apart of this film helped make it different from the average summer blockbuster. They made it fun, exciting, and slightly strange. Not every movie has to be the same cookie cutter action/adventure movie. In a day and age with tons of movies available to us, it is important that a movie brings something new or interesting to the table to make a mark on the population."

","A thoroughly fascinating blend of action, adventure, comedy, horror & fantasy, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a brilliantly scripted, skilfully directed & cleverly narrated cinema that paints an interesting portrait of pirates mythology on the film canvas like never before and is also notable for bringing to life one of the most iconic characters of 21st century cinema.<br/><br/>The story of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl follows the quest of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow who teams up with a talented blacksmith, Will Turner, to rescue the latter's love, Elizabeth Swann, who's been taken hostage on the notorious pirate ship, Black Pearl, which is commanded by the feared Captain Barbossa and carries a crew of cursed men who were once Jack's allies.<br/><br/>Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean brims with an energetic & creative vibe which keeps the story refreshing throughout its runtime, doesn't take much time to get its main plot moving, and with its firm grip on refined storytelling ends up infusing a new life into the pirates genre. The screenplay handles its different genres with remarkable ease and also presents a fine balance between its various elements.<br/><br/>The production design team does a stellar job with its period sets & meticulously designed ships. Cinematography makes fab use of its camera to capture each sequence in fine detail, use of colour palette is quite splendid and the expertly staged camera angles & movements make its story all the more captivating. Even the Costumes are pretty much in tune with the depicted timeline, and the work in make-up department is no slouch either.<br/><br/>Editing is undoubtedly one of its strongest highlights for it never allows the viewers to settle down, keeps the adventurous tone alive & kicking all the way from start to finish, and paces its 143 minutes of story amazingly well. Visual effects is state-of-the-art stuff which blends into the narrative quite seamlessly. The background score is composed by Klaus Badelt and is an absolute delight that enhances the whole experience by a great deal with its pulsating tracks.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Pirates of the Caribbean features an awesome cast in Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley and they all manage to leave their mark, one way or another. Depp makes Jack Sparrow completely his own for it's his added inputs only which gives his character a unique look & edge over the others, and there isn't one scene where he isn't the show-stealer. Rush also impresses a lot with his crazy take on Captain Barbossa, while Bloom & Knightley deliver good performances in their given roles.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a powerhouse of action, spectacle & humour that's loaded with all the ingredients one requires to make a great blockbuster, which it is in every sense of the word. A work of ingenious craftsmanship that packs in a whole lot of fun, absolutely nails its comic timing, wonderfully balance all its aspects, delivers an entertainment worth your time & money, and is an extremely enjoyable, unforgettable & swashbuckling ride that presents Johnny Depp at the pinnacle of his talents while permanently engraving Captain Jack Sparrow into the annals of cinema & pop culture."
"William-of-Baskerville","5","1","2","12 May 2015"," With a sissy for captain, this is a travesty of pirate movies
","I thoroughly hate all the Pirates of Caribbean movies because they make a mockery of the complete genre, by the sole performance of 'Captain Jack Sparrow' as ultimate sissy captain. Which pirate in his right mind would ever accept him as his captain? He is the ultimate anti-pirate, and an insult to the spirit of all pirate movies. Without him the movie would at least have some merit, although it still would be mediocre.<br/><br/>Rather watch Cutthroat Island with Geena Davis as female captain, she has more balls than Jack. Master and Commander is in a slightly different genre, but has a real captain on the reel. Or even better, watch the Horatio Hornblower series, where we see the development of an honorable midshipman into captain, in a fantastic historic period piece.<br/><br/>Still five stars for the decent production values and a bit of a story."
"aj-to","5","1","2","17 January 2015"," Much ado about nothing
","To me, this was a disappointing movie. I anyhow wasn't that much inclined to see it, because of the popularity amongst the youngsters: that's invariably a bad token. So maybe I should rephrase my opening sentence. The movie was what I expected, but I'm always disappointed my bad expectations are so vastly responded to. This product is so obviously invented - with the help of some adequate stealing from the predecessors in the genre. To name a few examples: Jack Sparrows bearing clearly is a loan from Sandokan, the head figure of a popular pirate series in the 70's; the stern character of the commodore, rigid and uncompromising as in numerous examples before (the loosening at the end is a bland falsification); the Yankee Doodle type of the father of the heroine; and so on. The movie distinctly was made for commercial purposes, and has no historical traits whatsoever. The Zombie effect of pirates doomed to perpetual half-life is one of the many dispirited genuflections to modern taste and merely augments the mendacious value of the motion picture. I can give more instances of such unhistorical nonsense, but cannot do so without giving away the plot; so I'll avoid that error. All in all, if you like pure fantasy without any pretension of truth ‚Äì go see it, when you have nothing better to do. But don't you think things in any respect could've happened this way; life isn't a fairy-tale."

Well, someday arrived tonight and I must say, I am not impressed. Nope. Not really. Johnny Depp has some funny moments but two hours of him acting like that is too much. And Captain Jack Sparrow is barely a pirate. A leader of men? Give me a break. He's pathetic. There's some good acting from Keira Knightly and Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport, but Depp's hammyness is borderline mental and helps ruin this movie. And what's with the CGI skeleton pirates?

"johnnyboyz","5","1","2","9 August 2013"," Flailing the high seas.
","I suppose the fact that Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl depicts a sword fight between two immortals that lasts for several minutes is really the clincher that the film does not amount to much more than a bit of throwaway nonsense. The scene, wherein it is readily identified by both parties that the futility of their actions can be equated only to their skills in sword fighting in the first place, epitomises just how much director Gore Verbinski is enjoying himself and just how much his audience aren't. For many years, the notion of what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object has befuddled physicists; it may very well have to take second stage to the conundrum of what happens when two invulnerable forces do battle to the death. Do not think there is any attempt at solving such a riddle, for the director is merely pleased with the fact he's bringing all of this spectacle to life in the first place. It falls to all the usual Hollywood mistakes and annoyances: visual and oral bombardment consisting of grandeur tracking shots put to a booming score, while the completely ill-judged decision to cut back and forth from harmless comedy to scenes of a massacre represents American event-movie directing at its very worst. Like most of its ilk, it's too long and while there is some heady adventure in there at times, the film is too bad too often to actually get too excited about.<br/><br/>There is no secret in the fact the film struggles with its narrative, seemingly desiring to balance the role of protagonist between three different people but only really ending up telling the story of a doomed crew to a series of fancy edits and prolonged sword fights. Somewhere down the line, ideas either ran out or became cross contaminated; the film is quite so evidently in love with its opening act that it hardly seems to want to launch its characters into a quest, while restless audiences will merely crave the opposite. And then there is that opening act, where, for all the errs of its ways and evident mistakes later on, the film starts surprisingly well. Beginning several years before the main body of the text, the film first depicts Elizabeth Swann on board a British galleon during the colonial era spying a young boy in the water. Once aboard, she discovers his true nature in that he's a pirate ‚Äì a sworn enemy to those on board but she keeps it a secret out of feeling quite fond for him and not wanting to see him lose his life. As the years pass, Swann grows up into Keira Knightley while the boy matures into Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and they stay loosely connected; he becoming a blacksmith, she already in the rarefied circles of already being a Navy Governor's daughter.<br/><br/>As a young adult, Swann is living a suffocating life on this Jamaica-based outpost of the Empire; suffocating in every sense of the word in as much her tight fitting corset apparel is forced upon her just as much as her father's will seemingly is. Played with an ample amount of both sneer and sympathy by Jonathan Pryce, daddy sees fit to remind her that a certain Navy Commodore with a name like Norrington would make a fine suitor. Elizabeth can only wish for something more, something in the form of Turner with whom she would never stand a chance but for her peers. Enter Johnny Depp's rambling Jack Sparrow; a smooth talking, all-action although ultimately unorthodox pirate who doesn't shoot first and ask questions later since he doesn't carry a firearm and is too busy dropping a one-liner on you as he makes his daring escape anyway. Certainly, when compared to the other pirates in the jail cells, Sparrow strikes us as somewhat different; a man who risks capture if it means saving a life but is cold enough to exploit the life if it means saving his own. The initial incident launching everyone into motion arrives when Geoffrey Rush's evil Captain of the damned attacks the British fort and takes Elizabeth, something that forces the previously at-odds Sparrow and Turner into going after her by themselves.<br/><br/>Structurally, the film spends too long in the port city of Port Royal before finally launching itself on the gigantic quest encompassing nautical traversing; un-dead enemies and a whole host of fight scenes. Thirty minutes into the actual adventure, we want to go back to Jamaica; where ramshackle characters with problems; desires and feelings played out in an environment brought to screen intelligently and energetically with a rich amount of costume and mise-en-scene for the colonial era when Britain ruled the waves. The film is generally problematic, with Depp and Bloom's buddy partnership not hitting the mark and this ridiculous narrative falling in on itself when further complications arise to do with the banishing of a curse. Once enough is enough, the film begins to outstay its welcome; the score gets louder and things that might've resembled human beings in the early part have become action figures for a child's imagination during playtime. The film is far from terrible and it's made with a boyish enthusiasm, but with the money; design and, some might say, the cast quite evidently at hand, enthusiasm and good intentions are not enough."

McNally,Zoe Saldana and Jonathan Pryce. It was directed by Gore Verbinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. <br/><br/>The story follows blacksmith Will Turner and pirate Captain Jack Sparrow as they rescue the kidnapped Elizabeth Swann from the cursed crew of the Black Pearl, captained by Hector Barbossa. When Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of Governor Swann is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner, the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow. Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter.<br/><br/>In this Bruckheimer-produced high-seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural has Johnny Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. He's hilarious as he gives his loosest and looniest performance yet and it is spectacular.Entertaining, exciting, and engrossing with a genuine feel of adventure along with excellent performances, this is truly worth watching."

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","29 June 2006"," Mediocre (spoilers)
","It's a sad indictment of modern mainstream cinema when Pirates of the Caribbean becomes a smash hit. Now that's not to say it's a terrible film ¬ñ it's entirely watchable. No, it's just that it's so mediocre.<br/><br/>What hurts the film most is the casting of its hero and heroine. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are just incredibly bland. They're two actors who although not entirely incompetent (thus denying us the opportunity to laugh our arses off as we point and jeer at the screen) have no serious acting chops. But worse than that they have no charisma. There's no charm, no allure and no sex appeal. I mean, sure Knighley is easy on the eye and I'm sure girls cream themselves silly at Bloom's squinty little eyes and paedophile moustache, but they're almost entirely lifeless ¬ñ there's nothing going on behind the eyes. And Knightley's presence is made even more unwelcome by the fact that she plays a prissy, self-righteous, wholesome bore who squeals all her dialogue at a decibel level so great it explodes eardrums. Seriously, Will Turner deserves her. He can look forward to a lifetime of high-pitched nagging and refusal of sex.<br/><br/>But Knightley's worst moment (and the film's worst moment) is when she hits a pirate while uttering the following line, ""You like pain? Try wearing a corset."" You know, because men don't know pain. And because wearing a corset is far worse than having your arm lopped off with a sword; or having a leg blown to kingdom come from canon fire; or having a sweaty, leering, corpulent, well-endowed seadog make you his rear admiral with all the supplies of lubricant run dry. And that cheesy line is made even worse because it's spoken by a woman so weedy, so skinny, so under-nourished that it's debatable that she could pick up the plank she hits the pirate with without regurgitating in exhaustion the kiddie-sized bowl of muesli she gorged on for dinner. Yeah, she's an empowered woman. She's pretty, she can kick ass and she's got a waist thinner than a tube of Pringles. (The politically correct 'empowering' of women also extends to one of the ships being captained by a black woman. I know it's just a kid's film and the mores of today are shoehorned into an earlier time, but couldn't the 'empowered' women actually resemble real women and not be bland model types who either squeal like anorexic harridans or screech a 'talk to the hand' brand of sass that's more suited to Jerry Springer?) <br/><br/>But I shouldn't be too tough on Knightley. Bloom's equally culpable. Just take the way he scrunches his forehead and squints his eyes when he has to communicate thought; or when he makes a passionate speech that's about as rousing as a punch in the groin; or when he wetly communicates his love for Miss Swan. If Luke Skywalker is a limp piece of lettuce, Will Turner is a flaccid one-inch penis.<br/><br/>And exacerbating the blandness is the casting of Jack Davenport. He's meant to be the pencil-necked Poindexter that does everything by the rules, but he plays his role too well. It's like watching an invisible man. His character is totally devoid of¬Öanything.<br/><br/>But if Bloom, Knightley and Davenport are the schmoly trinity, then Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Jonathan Pryce, Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg are the quintet that makes the film worth watching (I also like the two dumb soldiers). Enough people have expounded the joys of Depp's Keith Richards-inspired performance, but Rush actually makes me laugh more anyway. There's a fantastic bit during a swordfight where he walks along shouting ""Aaaaarrrr!"" And he also does the same thing while chasing Knightley. It's a clich√©d pirate played with absolute glee. And Pryce is great, too. Admittedly he doesn't get to do much, but he makes up for everything in a moment near the end. After the British defeat the pirates he emerges from the room he's locked himself in and he proceeds to finger wag and shadow box the marauders. It just shows what a good actor is capable of; how an actor with wit and personality can make a small moment memorable.<br/><br/>But contrary to popular opinion, the film actually belongs to the duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg as a pair of knuckleheaded pirates. Every time they're on the screen the film is suddenly about a million times more fun. And I like the way the two are portrayed as something of a married couple. They finish each other's sentences and get on each other's nerves. And I also like the way the film wryly questions their sexuality. Take the scene where they have to dress up as women as they act as a decoy in a rowing boat. Crook tells his pal that he looks nice and a scuffle ensues. Funny stuff.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, though, while some of the interplay between the supporting characters is fun to watch, the action is rather uninspired. And it's not helped by the fact that all the pirates (and Johnny Depp) are immortal. Therefore you have to endure swordfights that have zero tension because there's absolutely nothing at stake. And action seems to take up the entire final third of the film. As a consequence it becomes something of a snoozer. But fortunately the photography and production design is first rate. So at least you get something nice to look at while swords clatter ad nauseam."

","I cannot help but think that this film could have been much better in more capable hands. As others have noted, it runs way too long. Roger Ebert rather astutely observed that somewhere in this 143 minute movie could be a decent 90 minute movie; perhaps he is correct, though we might never know. Gore Verbinski should re-edit this movie for a director's cut and leave out about forty-five minutes; perhaps that would help resolve at least some of its shortcomings. The acting is nothing special, which is to be expected given the way the film plays like a combination of a slapstick comedy and a children's movie. Johnny Depp is a very good, serious actor, as evidenced in ""Blow,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" ""Finding Neverland,"" etc., though I didn't really like his performance in this film. He does much as much can be expected to develop his character, though I cannot help but wonder if he (along with the rest of the cast) considered this from the onset as simply a paycheck because it appears many of the actors didn't take it seriously and merely phoned in their performances. It doesn't help that they didn't have much with which to work, either. I'm not certain why the principle leads would sign on for two more entries to this series, though money would again be the prime suspect. Action-adventure movies can be fun and entertaining without being shallow and resorting to clich√©d tactics as this movie does; the recent Harry Potter and Spider-man movies are good examples of movies that successfully combine entertainment and action with competent, intelligent scripting. Furthermore, it seems to me the makers of this movie could not decide what the target audience for this movie would be, and the result is that it appears to be intended for children, yet is entirely too long to retain their attention and contains entirely too much violence and too many gruesome effects for children. This seems to be a problematic trademark for Verbinski, whose ""Mousehunt"" (1997) seemed to be clearly intended for children, yet contained some decidedly adult humor. I cannot really recommend a movie that has me wishing it would end halfway through it, which this one did. That is not to say it is bad or that it is dull because it is undoubtedly ambitious and there are moments throughout the film, until the last frames, which show undeniable sparks of energy. Some of the scenes work well and the action is more than adequate. Also, we don't see very many pirate movies any more, so it does have that going for it, you know, which is nice. Ultimately, however, the film meanders about, loses focus and is simply not good enough to warrant a viewing. With two more movies on the way, perhaps there was enough material among this trilogy that would have warranted making 1.5 or even 2 movies from the first the one. I received the DVD as a present, watched it once and must say I am not in a hurry to sit through it again. (However, I might skip to the scenes with Keira Knightley, whose radiance is enough to lift any film)"

","I thoroughly enjoyed this very clever movie. It's a fun ride and I really did appreciate Depp's unusual character.<br/><br/>That said, this is no masterpiece. It is, rather, a very enjoyable and expertly done piece of fluff and a rather long advert for Disneyland. It's basically a lovingly rendered rehash of all the well-known clich√©s of 80 years of swashbuckler films with a bit of ""Sinbad the Sailor"" thrown in. This is like Ray Harryhausen (all hail!) would have done had he CGI tools at his disposal.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is fine entertainment and it's certainly a far better movie than the recent Star Wars efforts. But it's no masterpiece. It pales in the wake of classic swashbucklers like ""Captain Blood"" (Errol Flynn) or ""Treasure Island"" (the one with Jackie Cooper and the Disney one with Robert Newton), or even the recent ""Master and Commander"".<br/><br/>Let's put POTC in the ""fantasy"" category. Within that context I would rate it much higher than within this TOP 250 FILMS category. It is a great fantasy film.<br/><br/>As a ""spoof"" it's not in the same class as ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Young Frankenstein"" or ""Love and Death"", but it's very close and a job well done.<br/><br/>Good film.

","I have to admit that I also really enjoyed this movie a lot in 2003 when it was showing at the cinema and I also thought it was one of the best movies of this year. The strange thing is: I ve seen it again on DVD now and it - for some reason I can not explain - rather bored me. It has great actors, fantastic settings, but the story is not more than ""okay"" (it has some far-fetched useless halfhearted twists in it) and in the end one feels like having seen a teaser for Walt Disney parks ... and that s probably what the film actually is: a roller-coaster ride with some narrative lengths (it s far too long for a real exciting roller-coaster ride).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp s acting is absolutely outstanding though (selfironical overacted, rather camp without being really gay). I also believe that Depp himself would not say that it s one of the best movies he played in (hopefully not), but probably one of the best payed jobs he s done (hopefully). Without Depp the movie would probably be quite boring and ""cheap"" (in the meaning of ""cheap tricks""), with Depp it s at least well entertaining and particularly quite funny.<br/><br/>At last: this is definitely not a movie one has to see twice.

","Yes, Johnny Depp walks away with the movie or playfully struts away, to be more exact. He will get you through the first few viewings. Once Depp recedes, temporarily, into the background, you see the work of the good script by Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot(Aladdin, Shrek). The script gives us not one, but two pairs of bickering buffoons, a ghost story, a little romance, a little adventure, a lot of comedy, and a pirate treasure hunt. It is unpredictable. This movie might have failed without it's superbly game cast. Geoffrey Rush has almost as much fun as Depp with several good lines. Jack Davenport nails the deadpan British style of humor perfectly and is contrasted nicely by the foppish Pryce. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are not given much to do, but they make the most of their parts. Kevin McNally makes a fine salty dog. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Cook steal every scene they are in as a couple of silly pirate Abbott and Costello types with Agnes Burnett and Giles New as their lesser soldier counterparts. The real success of this movie is how it takes the old and makes it feel new again.<br/><br/>(monkey brings medallion to Barbossa with Jack on it's tail)Barbossa: ""Why thank ye, Jack.""

","Pirates of the Caribbean was a good movie with three story lines blended into one. There was the love story between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, Jack Sparrow's story of revenge towards his former first mate, and the Black Pearl's crew's story of wanting to be free of the curse.<br/><br/>The actors all did a wonderful job, Johnny Depp at Jack Sparrow was superb. Geoffrey Rush as the not alive but not dead Captian Barbosa was excellent. Watch his eyes in the scene where he is watching Elizabeth eat. You can see the through his eyes alone how he covets the fact that she can eat and enjoy food and he can't.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is always excellent in his films, and he does not disappoint in this film.<br/><br/>There are many links throughout the film, for instance, the two captains are linked from their entrances. Jack Sparrow is first seen from behind sailing into Port Royal on his boat, then the camera shows him from the front. Captian Barbosa is first seen from behind on his boat, then we see him from the front.<br/><br/>There are two comical Royal Navy sailors who are never apart, one short and stout with dark hair, and one skinny with blonde hair. There are two comical pirates on the Black Pearl who are never apart, one short and stout with dark hair, and one skinny with blonde hair. This sends a message that sailors are not much different whether they be legit or pirates.<br/><br/>When they open the window in Elizabeth's room, you see a peak outside. Remember that peak, it will show up in other parts of the film.<br/><br/>It's interesting that three skeletons of pirates are hanging on the way to Port Royal, the first skeleton pirates that Jack sees. Now that's what you call premonition.<br/><br/>I certainly hope that everyone stayed past the credits to see the last scene from the film where the monkey takes one piece of gold out of the chest, thus putting the curse back on again.<br/><br/>The music is mesmerizing and each section is fitting. When jack sees the dead pirates, the music changes from a rousing pirate theme to a somber theme with a male chorus humming, much more reverent. I bet a lot of people didn't catch that.<br/><br/>It's true that this film takes some attention span, those lacking that will not like it. It also requires a good grasp on vocabulary, as there are many words and phrases that some people have probably never heard.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm sure we all remember who Cortez was and what he did.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is more, but that is all I will write now."

The best thing about this movie is that it was very entertaining, and it is easily the most entertaining movie I have seen in a long time. This film has it all - humor, romance, thrills, action, mystery, and suspense. I wish I had seen it in the theater, but the DVD was great anyway.<br/><br/>As far as the plot, I honestly wasn't really expecting anything too detailed or deep. After all, this is a Disney film, and one based on a ride at a theme park. However, there are several unexpected plot twists and turns, and it's hard to know which people you're actually rooting for in the film. The characters are interesting and they do some unexpected things from time to time. The plot was much more interesting and enjoyable than I imagined it would be.<br/><br/>One thing that really impressed me was the CGI. I'm not a big fan of computer-generated graphics, and especially when they're inserted into live action films alongside human actors. But this was very well done - as well-done as any film I've seen.<br/><br/>Finally, a comment about where this movie ranks. Don't get me wrong - this is a very entertaining show, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I rate this film pretty high on my own list, but I'm surprised to see it on the IMDb Top 250 films of all time. It's a great show, but I don't think it deserves a spot among the top 250 films of all time. Nothing against this film, but I would think there would be at least 250 films made since 1940 that would be better than this one."

Aside of these criticisms, Johnny Depp is brilliant as the goofy Jack Sparrow but the rest of the cast is just plain OK. <br/><br/>The Curse of the Black Pearl seems to be a no-brainer and doesn't hold my interest any longer now.

"slimjack","8","1","2","30 May 2004"," That rare bird, a decent modern pirate movie.
","Pirate movies have fallen on hard times as of late.  There hasn't been a decent one since the mid-fifties.  Attempts to revive the genre have generated a series of expensive flops like Cutthroat Island and Roman Polanski's Pirates.  Despite the dismal track every ten years or so there is yet another attempt to get it right. With the latest, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl persistence is rewarded. Though not on a level with Captain Blood or The Crimson Pirate, Curse is still is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that successfully combines modern action with a traditional sea saga.<br/><br/>The Black Pearl is a ship with a cursed crew doomed to an undead existence until they return all the Aztec gold they unwisely pilfered. After years of ghostly plundering they manage to gather all save for the one piece currently in the possession of the beautiful Elizabeth, the Royal Governor's daughter. Can her true love, the pirate hating blacksmith Will, keep her safe from the crew's boney clutches?  Or does she need the help of the completely loony Captain Jack Sparrow?<br/><br/>Sparrow is a hilarious addition to the Hollywood Pirate tradition. He is a seadog sure to strike terror into the hearts of the fiercest scallywag though not because of his dazzling swordplay.  Johnny Depp plays Sparrow as if he has downed one too many grogs on the way to the gay pride parade. He flounces, weaves and mumbles his way about the Caribbean absolutely sure that he is the very model of a modern pirate captain. That his adversaries aren't as sure of his seafaring abilities as he is doesn't register in his hazy worldview.  Depp's Belle of the Poop Deck routine works fabulously. He gives the movie a pixilated charm but if it's an old fashioned shiver-me-timbers pirate you want there is Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa.  Rush `arrhs' it up for all he's worth and even makes you feel a little sorry for the murderous old sea dog.   <br/><br/>As Depp and Rush keep the glorious tradition of ham acting alive others in the cast are left struggling to keep up.  While Orlando Bloom seems stogy as Will the insanely beautiful Keira Knightley is in no danger of being overshadowed.  Her Elizabeth comes across as the most competent character in the movie. You get the feeling she could have sorted the plot out quicker without the blundering help of Sparrow and Will.  The rest of the cast is filled with a great assortment of character actors who fill out their colorful parts nicely.  In fact, it's safe to say it's the performers who make this movie despite the extensive special effects on display.<br/><br/>Curse suffers from the usual modern summer blockbuster problems what with frenzied editing, sloppy plotting and a leaden approach to comic timing. Complicating matters is an out of control sound design.  Background creaks, booms and clangs are blasted out of proportion and every footfall thumps like a brontosaurus tread. All this drowns out the actors so potentially funny lines are lost.  Art direction is also problematic. For example, the skeletal crew is so stuffed with detail that between the quick cuts and frenzied pace they come across as a perambulating blob.  A further drawback is the cinematography. For some reason the normally sunny Caribbean looks as bleak and cold as the North Atlantic. While all this is annoying it shouldn't stop you from seeing Curse. It's a charming movie filled with the sort of enjoyably preposterous performances you rarely see nowadays."

","Due to circumstances beyond my control, I have watched this film three times in the past six months. To be frank, it's taken me that many viewings to get to grips with the plot, and to appreciate that the main star is not in fact Johnny Depp - who seems, albeit understandably,  to have emerged as the new Valentino - but the scriptwriter. Those wonderful understated supporting performances, notably by the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of the British navy, were enabled - as was the virtuoso and richly-imagined representation of Jack Sparrow - by their witty and precisely crafted speech.  And as for Depp, are we all absolutely sure it isn't his character we've fallen in love with? After all, I don't remember anyone saying that Edward Scissorhands was the sexiest man in the world."

But, I was expecting to get a lot more laughs out of him, and I didn't. The plot was OK, but not what I call original.  Of course, the special effects with the skeleton pirates were great. That must have been a huge part of the budget.  I guess since the horrible Mummy 2 and Tomb Raider movies, audiences went crazy over this adventure type of film because it didn't suck like so many recent summer flicks.<br/><br/>Also, Rush made a good villian. But, I don't think Bloom or Knightly were outstanding. Anyone could have done those roles. I see they are already planning a sequel.  Considering how paper thin the plot was for this one, the sequel will likly be bad like Mummy 2, but make a lot of money.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  If you are into the adventure movies, then this one is for you."

Johnny Depp is superb as Capt. Jack Sparrow - utterly convincing. Yet the rest of the cast seems contrived and fail to carry any weight. They act as if this is a ""made for TV movie.""

","So many things could have gone wrong with this film. (And to hear tale from some of the commentary, many did). I mean c'mon...four writers create a script based upon a theme park ride? This could have all the charm of a film based on a video game like such classics as ""Super Mario Brothers"" and ""Street Fighter.""<br/><br/>Now to be fair I haven't seen either of those nor ever will, but neither had Johnny Depp at the helm. Much has been made about his swishbuckling here, but I dare anyone to see this and not keep his/her eye on the Sparrow. In the commentary, he and director Gore Verbinski talked about some of Depp's original ideas for the character...including a prosthetic nose. Hmmm, maybe that's where the Keith Richards' idea originated? To see the best use of a faux nose so far, see Vincent D'Onofrio in the excellent ""Salton Sea.""<br/><br/>But back to these high seas, high crime and high entertainment. Look the ride itself had to be made suitably accommodating to put a lot of different butts in seats, and so was this film. But think of all the other action/adventure blockbusters that simply went bust.<br/><br/>I recently saw ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" which despite Alan Moore's impetus wound up extremely ordinary. And we had to elect Schwarzenegger as governor just to prevent him from making any more films after ""The Rise of the Machines.""<br/><br/>So for the people who complain about the plot, to make such a popcorn movie, you have to traffic in larger-than-life myths that *need* to be familiar. Lover's need to be separated, one must promise her love to another to redeem her true love. Toss in an absent father (Bootstrap is about as dead as Luke Skywalker's dad was.) Allow there to be a chase and make sure the original chase is after the wrong goal or gal or gal's blood...and your on your way.<br/><br/>So the key here, like the ride itself is not in revolutionary twists along the way but an attention to detail as we are moved along. The pirates' code and parley, splendid spectral special effects, the tie-ins to scenes from the ride. Little bits of the dialog...""Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt""...""Welcome to the Caribbean, love""...""Impersonating a cleric of the Church of England...""I want you to know that I was rooting for you mate""...""Cotton, he says you missed a spot."" (As spoken by a mute man's parrot and translated by the first mate.)<br/><br/>This film is more than clever enough, and looks gorgeous, even on the small screen...though I and you imagined reader should have seen this on the big screen.

","Johnny Depp's withering pirate parody is probably the only reason to watch this swashbuckler update, but he's been better elsewhere and his performance is typical of the film's major problem, namely the slurred, mumbling accents that most of the cast has adopted. It makes for difficult viewing: the needlessly complicated plot is hampered by an inability to understand much of what is going on (although the basic outline is elemental to anyone who's ever seen a film of the genre); you have to strain to hear explanations for the more mystical aspects of the story. It's a very generic piece of work; the director, Gore Verbinski, doesn't seem to have the ability to create any real tension or action sequences that arouse much excitement and consistently allows the set pieces to be interrupted by long stretches of exposition (thanks to a wordy script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio that could have used a few decent jokes). Verbinski chooses to keep the focus on Depp and while Depp is always welcome whenever he's onscreen, he has trouble connecting with the rest of the cast, which, though it includes the incredibly hammy Geoffrey Rush, has nowhere near the acting bravura he has. The remainder of the cast includes Orlando Bloom (who fails to impress after `The Lord Of The Rings'), Jonathan Pryce and Keira Knightley."

","It is rather sad since this movie showed a LOT of potential in its beginning, yet soon enough it became yet another kitschy Disney movie.<br/><br/>First the good: The performance of Depp was wonderful, even if a tiny bit too ecstatic. The visuals and the sounds were, as you can expect from Disney, amazing as well and reminded me of LOTR visuals somewhat. Also, surprisingly, the movie has also quite a sophisticated story.<br/><br/>{ MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS BELOW }<br/><br/>Very quickly, though, the movie dropped very low. The scenes became repetitive and dull. I grew tired of all these sword slashings, first with men, then with shields. In fact, there is just TOO MUCH fighting in this movie. It isn't the stunning fighting of Matrix/LOTR though where you grew more excited every minute, it is more like the regular Disney fighting of, ""Aww he dropped the barrel and it dropped on the skeleton, ain't it funny folks?"". All the fighting scenes are FULL with Disney cliches like this one.<br/><br/>{ REAL SPOILERS NOW }<br/><br/>In fact, ALL the movie grows to be more and more one big cliche as it spins towards its grand finale cliche end. Starting from the silly sentences (BadGuy: ""Say good-bye!"", barrel falls on him, GoodGuy: ""Good-bye!""), continuing with even sillier sentences that I could guess ten seconds before the actors said them and ending with the super sticky, happy ""and they lived happily ever after"" end. I hoped they will broke SOME of the sweetness by letting SOMEONE die but apparently they decided to be the STEREOTYPE of cliche Disney movies.<br/><br/>Oh well, another 2 hours bit the dust."

","A BRIEF SUMMARY: Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the new island governor, is traveling by ship with her father to their new home. The come upon a ship, ransacked and burned by pirates. Suddenly, Elizabeth spots an unconscious boy, Will Turner, in the water. When Will is brought onto the ship and laid upon the deck, Elizabeth spots a gold medallion around his neck. Fearing the authorities will arrest the boy as a pirate, Elizabeth steals the medallion. Years later, when Will and Elizabeth grow up, they share an adventure involving the medallion, an unearthly pirate crew and `the curse of the Black Pearl'. `All opinions are vanity ¬Ö' including my own. Well, I guess I better prepare myself to be clobbered once again for trashing a movie `everybody loves'. `Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is most illogical movie I've seen since `Lost in Space'.  `Lost in Space' at least had three shapely women in body-hugging space suits. PCCBP has Johnny Depp. Johnny has turned in some really good performances (`Edward Scissorhands,' `Ed Wood,' `Sleepy Hollow,' and, especially, `Don Juan DeMarco') but his loose, effete `Jack Sparrow' is more `Captain Morgan' than Captain Kidd. That is, the rum is doing most of the acting. WARNING: SPOILERS Well, let's see, all the crew of the Black Pearl except Jack Sparrow, BUT INCLUDING WILL'S FATHER, have been cursed for stealing Aztec gold. As part of their curse, food turns to ashes; and, while they cannot die, in the moonlight they are clearly rotting corpses. HELLO!  If they cannot die, HOW COULD THEY KILL WILL'S FATHER? If they are really rotten corpses, WHY DIDN'T THEY DIE AS SOON AS THE CURSE WAS LIFTED? I can understand why Will wasn't cursed, BUT WHY WASN'T ELIZABETH? Oh, because she did it to save Will, THEN WHY WAS JACK SPARROW CURSED? Oh, because he was Captain of the Black Pearl; DO YOU REALLY THINK A CURSE WOULD BE SO SELECTIVE? I can understand why the Black Pearl crew became rotting corpses when they were cursed. They spent a period of time suffering from starvation and thirst, but WHY DID JACK IMMEDIATELY BECOME A ROTTING CORPSE? Oh yes, I've heard, `Forget the logic and enjoy the fun.' How much fun is there in an adventure movie where the only mortals you care about are so central to the plot you KNOW they cannot be killed? I enjoyed the production values, the music and the performances, but I never forgot this is a BAD pirate movie. If you really want to have fun watching a good pirate movie, see `The Crimson Pirate' or `Swashbuckler.' If you insist on seeing a bad pirate movie, see `Cutthroat Island'. At least it makes sense."

The skeleton crew is not very menacing at all - so why did they have to be skeletons? The movie would have worked better with another 'plot' without the curse and just focusing on actual human pirates.<br/><br/>
The plot is predictable and full of holes. The film could've ended LONG before it did. Most all the roles were cardboard cut outs. There is the handsome hero that is willing to stick his neck out for the girl especially because he isn't encumbered by any societal status. There is the rich suitor that is stuck up and walks so straight and narrowly that he is more robotic than human and thus obviously not the man for the heroine. And finally the heroine that despite living in the past is somehow endowed with all sorts of concepts of the independent modern woman."

Plenty of action and adventure along with excellent at-sea shots make this a well executed film. All in all, a great time!"
"tastyworm","9","1","2","2 February 2004"," Adventure for everyone!
","Johnny Depp stars as Captain Jack Sparrow, in this film that was created from Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean amusement at Disney World in Florida.<br/><br/>Directed by Gore Verbinski, the film tells the story of Captain Jack Sparrow, a humorous, egotistical,  unpredictable  pirate, who is attempting to catch the ¬ëBlack Pearl' ¬ñ a pirate ship `with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil, that hell itself spat him back out'. After saving the Governor's daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) from drowning, Sparrow is arrested as a pirate and taken to jail where he awaits the gallows. In search of lost Cortez gold, the Black Pearl and a motley crew of pirates (led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)) raid the town and kidnap Elizabeth. The blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), in love with Elizabeth springs Sparrow from jail in return for his help in tracking down the Black Pearl and saving Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Depp's own quirkiness brings Captain Jack Sparrow to life, continuing his tradition of portraying rather unusual roles. Bloom and Knightly play their roles wonderfully, while Rush, so versatile in his character portrayal, presents himself as an enjoyable ¬ëbad guy' to watch. Pirates of the Caribbean ¬ñ Curse of the black pearl was filmed on location around St. Vincent and the Grenadines, providing a spectacular backdrop of crystal clear blue waters and picturesque islands. The special effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic and as usual, blend into the live-action seamlessly. Merge all of this together with the wonderful musical score by Hans Zimmer (who created the music for Gladiator and numerous other films) and you have a really enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Obviously you can't have a film about cursed pirates without a little horror, and although most violence is implied and not shown in this film, this is the first Disney film ever, to be rated PG-13 in the United States, and M in Australia. This film is definitely a fun, adventurous family film, but some children under fourteen may find the occasional scene within this film disturbing."

My fears were confirmed when the Disney logo appeared at the end of the trailer. There was no way in hell I was going to see this movie. Then, people started telling me about a certain guy called Johnny Depp. Now, I have never seen a movie with Johnny Depp in it, so I wasn`t really moved when people told me that he was the best thing in this movie. Anyway, lately a friend and I decided to rent the movie just to see what it was like. I watched it and I must say, it IS a Disney pirate movie made for the kids for summer. However, it is also a very entertaining movie, in parts. I can see why it has done very well at the box offices around the world and why people keep going back to see it. If you haven`t seen this movie, the fact that it is a Disney movie should not discourage you, and the fact that it has pirates in it, well, in all fairness it is one of the best pirate movies I have seen, well worth a try, you won`t be disappointed."

It was cool to see the people turn into skeletons when they passed in and out of the moon light, but when you had a chance to really look at them it was sort of cheesy.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie is that Disney couldn't decide whether this advertisement for one of their rides (marketing brilliance by the way, no matter how disgusting it is) should be for kids or adults. In the end, it didn't fit for anyone. It was too violent for little kids with scenes of people getting killed with swords and their throats slit by daggers. It was WAY too hokey for adults. <br/><br/>Maybe it works for 13-year-olds that haven't seen the special effects in the Matrix or Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>My advice, don't get your hopes up based on what the majority is saying about this one."

","I thought the first forty-five minutes were very cleverly written, and Johnny Depp is inarguably a scene-stealer in this film.  But the cumbersome plot turns absurd, and as soon as all the characters' energies onscreen are diverted toward the task of lifting an ancient curse (culminating in a set of dreary sea battles and chases), I lost interest.  Honestly, Depp is probably what made the last half of this overly long film bearable for me.<br/><br/>I am disappointed that Disney released such a violent movie in such kid-friendly packaging.  There are a lot of callous murders of innocent townspeople here.  And to put so much work into producing a film that glamorizes pirates--a word that has little meaning outside of rape, murder, robbery, and destruction--is a questionable endeavor.  Think twice before you let your kids watch this one, unless they're already desensitized little bloodlusters."

","Pirates of the Caribbean starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, that girl, and that guy, and a monkey.<br/><br/>Now, before beginning this review, I'd like to point out that this is a Disney movie - yes, the same people who brought us Finding Nemo and Pocahontas. Indeed. So I figured it could go either way, but would probably get bad reviews and bomb at the box office. Imagine my surprise then, when I arrived at the movie theatre and the movie was sold out for the 6:25 show. Who goes to see a movie on a Wednesday night?? So I bought my ticket for the 6:55 show and sat in the theatre for forever, waiting excitedly for the film to begin. Johnny Depp is hot. Seriously. Big hottie. Especially when you add eye makeup, cool hair, a good outfit, an excellent accent and a cool hat. Plus, he was crazy. As evident in Fear and Loathing, he plays crazy pretty well. The CGI in the film was very good as well - people turning into skeletons and all. Well done. I'm not an Orlando Bloom fan really, seeing as I didn't see either of the Lord of the Rings. So I didn't know what to expect from him, but luckily his role was monstrously overshadowed by Depp. The chick in this movie, whatever her name is, wasn't as good. Her accent needed a little work, she made horrible facial expressions, and it seems as though she got all the crappy lines. The plot was classic Disney - one twist towards the end that would shock the hell out of little kids, and they spelled out the entire plot for you as it happens. Sometimes that's good, when.. say.. you're too busy drooling over Johnny Depp to pay attention.. but still. You have to take that with a grain of salt (why isn't it pepper?) because it's Disney. Okay. So overall I'd give the movie.. well.. a B+/A-.. it wasn't amazing, but it *was* hilarious, and there were good fight scenes and good cgi and it wasn't boring, and very very good Johnny Depp. I think it's one of my favorite movies for him (of course, I haven't seen him in many movies I actually like - he favors scripts that make me drowsy just hearing the titles), so that's my final answer. B+/A-. Savvy?"

Once again Johnny Depp does what he does so well by getting lost in the character of the infamous Jack Sparrow. Depp is sensational, this is why he's the best actor out there right now. Newcomer Kiera Knightley was a pretty face and very good in POTC and Orlando Bloom fit the bill proving his talent past Legolas of LOTR. And of course, Geoffey Rush was just so fun to hate as the grimy and nasty Barbossa, a superb villain, the summer's best villain. Gore Verbinski is on his way with The Ring and POTC, even though he sadly looks not to come back for the 2005 sequel to POTC.

However, one let down was the music, which features a pounding quality heard in many Bruckheimer action films.<br/><br/>The characters are brought to life with the skill of the ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Harry Potter"" movies, yet somehow the overall film seems to be just a few notches of ""The Mummy"" and ""Tomb Raider"" movies.

But again, it does entertain from start to finish and despite moments of cheesy humor, it's serious enough to satisfy those seeking a more ""real"" approach.

Thankfully, they used fictitious characters instead of tarnishing the reputations of true high sea swashbucklers such as Ed Teach (Blackbeard) and John Rackham (Calico Jack).<br/><br/>Depp pulls off a convincing character in Jack Sparrow, especially when you think he based the character on Keith Richards (mannerisms, hair and all). Rush also shines as Barbossa, while Bloom and Knightley fulfill their roles fittingly, though their performances are hardly outstanding.  This has more to do with the script than their abilities.  The cinematography and CG effects are outstanding and very convincing.<br/><br/>Another thing this film does pull off well is character development.

"gerrip-1","Null","1","2","6 December 2003"," Brief showings of skeletal appendages remain the only attribute which make this movie worth seeing.
","Contains Spoilers!!! The film talents of Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush,Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, and Jonathan Pryce combine with a script and some cameras to form a film with very little else besides brief showings of skeletal appendages to recommend it.<br/><br/>The film opens onto an 18th century British Naval Outpost in the Caribbean--named with a singular lack of originality Port Royal. Quickly we are introduced to a diverse set of characters: Governor Weatherby Swann, British official in control of the island. His adopted son of sorts, Commander Norrington, whose entire demeanor rejects such a proposal. Swann's beautiful daughter, Elizabeth, who is not only the apple of her father's eye but also that of the icy British Commander. Traveling down a class, young William Turner, an aspiring blacksmith whose lowly sights have been set on Elizabeth since the day of their acquaintance near a pirate ship 10 years earlier (represented in the first scene of the film) but who seems unable to find the words to express his devotion, despite the more than ample encouragement from the lady Elizabeth herself. And finally Captain Jack Sparrow--famed pirate just arrived in Port Royal on a wrecked ship, and whose profusion of jewelry and all other manner of piratical adornments take the conception of piratical ""loot"" to a whole other level.<br/><br/>Beginning with his name, Governor Swann (played by Jonathan Pryce) represents that unending tradition so popular in movies of a perhaps powerful (though in the end impotent) and certainly rather foppish British official who is a sort of watered down antagonist--an obstacle to our heroes, but certainly a removable one. His adopted son of sorts, Commander Norrington (Jack Davenport) is a less foppish and more threatening counterpart to Swann whose militaristic bearing and morals at least earn him a chance at respect.   Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the maverick in an otherwise snobbish world of British bureaucracy who nearly chokes wearing a corset and desires a blacksmith rather than an aristocrat to wed, and is in general a vague worry to her father--whose basic goal throughout everything is to get her married to good Commander N.-- and an upset to the Commander himself. Will Turner ( Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom), down a class, is the heart-struck yet tongue-tied young lover, who would, if only a simple way presented itself, take Elizabeth for his own. (A way, we are to assume, devoid of the obstacles Swann and Norrington and the general social expectations of 18th century England, results of near 1200 years bloodshed, treaties, and evolution.) If only a good pirate or scallywag or murderer would show up and threaten Elizabeth...well then Will would know what to do, and those three hours of fencing each day would be worth something. (Well, lucky Will...unlike the majority of cerebral fantasies this dream does come true!) And finally Captain Jack Sparrow, portrayed in a semi inebriated, moderately perverted, and certainly deranged state by Johnny Depp who should probably be given a viewing in earlier films, perhaps Chocolat, before an assumption involving the quality of his on screen performances is made. Sparrow is the foil for Swann and particularly Norrington. His constant and ludicrously unshakeable irreverence is intended to make humor of the tight and pompous British, but, with the aid of Depp's spasmodic movements suggesting either foppishness or perversion only centers the viewer's attention on Sparrow's manic behavior and gives rise to a mild detachment from what one is viewing on screen. The main characters dispensed with in all their shallowness, the plot begins with a party at Port Royal, honoring Swann's adopted son of sorts. A scene between Elizabeth and her father which serves to convinces the viewer irreparably that there is absolutely no understanding between them, a scene with ardent lover Will, Captain Jack's arrival at port on a fast sinking vessel, the party, followed by Norrington's proposal of marriage to Elizabeth...who, apparently due to the overwhelming tightness of her corset, faints and tumbles from the ramparts she has conveniently positioned herself on, into the sea below.<br/><br/>And then, heralded in by this dubious incident, the plot surges forward full force. An attack on Port Royal by pirates under the command of the evil Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush in a role which deserves fourth billing instead of second and was hopefully accepted for either the money or publicity), a kidnapping of Elizabeth by those afore mentioned--and then a stunning rescue by Master Will, guided by a slightly reluctant Jack Sparrow, which includes the illegal appropriation of the British Navy's prize ship in the region, and its navigation to a safe port by Will and Jack, where the search for Barbossa and crew will continue. (The manner in which the Navy's prize ship is attained is particularly ludicrous.)<br/><br/>Added to the plot is the revelation that Barbossa and crew are actually ghosts of sorts, suspended between the world of death and living, and that this suspension takes its evidentiary form in the transformation of the pirates from flesh to bone. Which allows the sporadic metamorphoses referred to at the beginning of the review between skeletal and human expression--represented in the timely alterations of the pirates' appendages.<br/><br/>With such a setting in mind, the plot moves forward for two more hours, and with a script formulated around constant comedy, and fight scenes which live up to about the level of Harry Potter in all their awe inspiring dimensions, the film is less than a satisfying one. At 153 minutes, a good 30 of which could have been removed from the screen entirely, one is in a semi lethargy by the final conclusion when, with the bad guys defeated, Jack escaped from the law of the British navy, Elizabeth safely returned and without challenge or doubt her love to Master Will bright as ever, and Swann resigned to his daughter's fate as a blacksmith's wife and Norrington to his as a bachelor...love triumphs. (At which point one calls desperately for the realism of movies like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, but then with metamorphosing appendages what can be real?)<br/><br/>And so we are to assume Elizabeth lives out her life happily as a blacksmith's wife, no longer with a constant supply of income or any real claims to class distinction. However, the movie does not encourage this train of thought, evident by the last exchange:<br/><br/>At the close of the film Swann says to his daughter frettingly of Will, ""But he's a blacksmith.""<br/><br/>To which she replies, with a long lustful look at him mentioned.<br/><br/>""No, he's a pirate!""<br/><br/>So, fittingly, ends a film, which is from beginning to end a shallow fantasy. Bravo!<br/><br/>2/10"

The effects were very well done and were the first in a while to really make me think ""how'd they do that?"".<br/><br/>
A film like this, though, doesn't rely on plot or depth or anything like that. It relies on a feeling of adventure and fun. And darn it all, I had fun. I had more of a good time at this film than any film I can recall in recent memory and think that Depp's performance of Jack Sparrow deserves every bit of acclaim it's received and more.<br/><br/>I'm not too keen on a Pirates 2, but if Jack Sparrow is back, I'll be there Maties!!!<br/><br/>***.5 / ****"
"Ang3lT0uCH","10","1","2","23 November 2003"," Excellent! A refreshing adventure and an extraordinary performance make an 10 grade film.
","It's a well recived movie, excpecialy today when this kind of movies has almost dissapeared and the ones that are still made are eithr for children or performed by really bad actotos and have a boring story. This one is just perfect, Jhonny Deep plays the role of a pirat excellent, adding a little humor to the plot. The same can be said about the others, that really transpute the viewer into that long gone world and leave us with a smile on our face."

","This movie quite simply forced me to enjoy myself in a theater more than I have in years.  Between Johnny Depp playing quite possibly the coolest pirate in the world, an excellent story, amazing visuals, astounding sword fighting, and roll in the aisles comedy - it is what a faithful movie going audience deserves.  I will see it again and again and I suggest you do the same."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the best movie I've ever seen! If you haven't seen it then GO SEE IT NOW!!! It's so funny and yet it still has plenty of room left over for serious parts. I enjoyed every 143 minutes of it and not only because of the cute guys in it! I mean, any movie with both Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp has got to be good but this movie has really over done itself. I can't think of even one little bad thing about it. It is simply Awesome! I'm going to go buy it on DVD as soon as it comes out and I suggest that you do too! ^_^"

"plants_pants_and_pageys_strings","10","1","2","12 November 2003"," cinematic masterpiece
","I personally enjoyed this film more than many I've seen this year.  Gore Verbenski is a wonderful director, and I must say that this type of movie was not expected from him.  Johnny Depp is a world-class actor and he did a world-class job.  He is truly gifted, able to conform to many different roles.  I give this movie three and a half mutated thumbs way, way up, and I reccomend it to anyone who calls himself a ""movie lover."""
"rosie_bubba37","10","1","2","11 November 2003"," Johnny Depp is truly amazing!
","This was a very good movie.  Johnny Depp is indescribable as Captain Jack Sparrow.  He brings humor and charm to what could have been a two-dimensional stock character.  Orlando Bloom proves that he can do more than just stand around looking pretty and shooting arrows.  His Will Turner is dashing and will set many ladies' hearts aflutter.  I, for one, look forward to seeing his future work.  Geoffrey Rush seems to be having a wonderful time as the dastardly and evil Captain Barbossa.  Keira Knightley makes a spirited Elizabeth Swann.  She is not just a damsel in distress; she gets to take part in the action quite a bit.  Jack Davenport was good as the honorable Commodore Norrington.  He seemed to really care for Elizabeth, and want her to be happy.  In another film, he probably would have been the hero, but Elizabeth had to end up with<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>
Will Turner.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are hysterical.  The two bumbling British soldiers and their pirate counterparts made me laugh every time they were on screen. I only had two issues with this movie.  It got a little too long towards the end; how many battle do you really need?  (although I'll admit I still enjoyed it immensely!)  Also, Jonathan Pryce was sorely underused.  There were many times when his role as Governor Swann could have developed into so much more, but they were never utilized.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was very exciting and fun.  A definite for multiple viewings!"
"jenhowdesh","10","1","2","11 November 2003"," Astoundingly Good
","The acting: brilliant. The action: CGI at it's finest. This is PG-13 for the skeleton crew and it's possibility of provoking nightmares in younger children. If you have kids that are 10 and up, you won't mind sharing the couch. There's no blood. All of the death and violence that you know has to be in a movie like this is so tastefully done it's almost shocking in this day of blood by the gallon. Beautifully filmed and scored, you won't want to leave your seat for anything. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish. Pirates is completely unexpected in it's eloquence and detail. Too many films take their big budgets and blow the film, while this one shows them what they should have done. To say we can't wait until Pirates 2 comes out would be an understatement. We are eagerly awaiting it's release and once you see this one, you will, too."
"JulianGerami","10","1","2","10 November 2003"," Well worth the watch!!
","This film is full of humor, action and special effects, basically what everybody loves in films. Johnny Depp displays another superb character to go with his other creations such as 'Edward Scissor-hands' and 'Sleepy Hollow'. Of course, Orlando is a young actor and has done some tremendous work for 'Lord of the Rings', i don't think this is the best we've seen him but he can only get better, and i believe he will. This flick has a great fight scene at the end between Depp and Rush and the score just makes it so energised and keeps your eyes stuck to the screen. I truly say, if you ever get the ""Oppotune-moment"", watch it."

"Alien_Angie","10","1","2","5 November 2003"," Simply amazing...one of the best films of the year...savvy?
","OK. I went to see this film full of doubts. My friend is a few years younger than me and loves Orlando Bloom since his appearance as Legolas and she liked Johnny Depp to so not surprising she saw it on opening night. After dealing with her gushing over the male leads and for a few days and constant bugging by my brother to see the film I eventually went with no expectations. I wasnt a great fan of 'Legolas' and Id only seen Johnny Depp in Sleepy Hollow which was (IMHO) rather an odd film.<br/><br/>From the second Depp appeared on screen I was hooked. Orlandos first appearance in the governors house had left me swooning but it was Johnny Depp that left me glued to the screen. Jack Sparrows introduction was amazing and had me in stitches (my condition for most of the film)<br/><br/>The performances by each of the main characters was absolutely flawless, the chemistry that played between Will, Elizabeth and Jack was sparkling. The special effects were brilliant and the story was enthralling.<br/><br/>I have to say that I left the film deeply on love with both Orlando and Johnny...but more so Jack Sparrow! Johnny Depp stole this film. His performance was faultless and as unlikely as it is he deserves an oscar for this performance - he was flawless!<br/><br/>I left the cinema with the film still fresh in my head, and went to see it the next day...and 3 times the week after. I have also already managed to obtain the film on DVD and its already been watched at home 4 times and is in danger of melting! Im even starting to pick up some of Jacks words...savvy? :-) Now thats not a good sign...LOL<br/><br/>IMHO I give this film top marks...10/10 fantastic performances from the 4 leads: Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom in particular but Geoffrey Rush and Kieira Knightley were on top form too. A must see."
"gregsrants","Null","1","2","5 November 2003"," At least I wasn't bored
","The last 20 years haven't been kind to the pirate movie genre.  Audiences have rejected such forgettable films as Pirates (Roman Polanski, 1986), The Pirate Movie (Kristy McNichol, 1982), and who can forget the one of the biggest flops in film history, Cutthroat Island (Renny Harlin) that sank an entire studio.<br/><br/>So when Jerry Bruckheimer, the production money behind such hits as The Rock, Top Gun and Black Hawk Down decided to put his name and efforts behind a big budget summer pirate film, I wondered if he finally lost his marbles, or if director Gore Verbinski had nude photos of Jerry in a dress.<br/><br/>Also working against a return of capital was the running time.  At 133 minutes, I wondered if a swashbuckling movie could hold an audience captive ¬ñ especially the target young ones ¬ñ for over two hours.<br/><br/>Well, all my thoughts and reservations meant nothing after first screening. The story is rather simple.  The movie opens at the conclusion of a pirate attack on a ship and the lone survivor by the name of Will Turner is rescued.  A gold medallion around his neck is taken by his rescuer's daughter, Elizabeth Swann, and a band of pirates lead by Geoffery Rush are out to get the medallion and return it to its original resting place, thus lifting the curse set upon them of being undead.<br/><br/>In one of the funniest entrances in movie history, Johnny Depp arrives as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and immediately his pirate ways lead him into jail.   But when Elizabeth is taken hostage upon the pirate ship the Black Pearl, the townspeople look to Jack Sparrow to rescue her and bring order back to the city.<br/><br/>It isn't long before mayhem and sword fights ensue, and it is in the final act that the film has its most incredible visual.  The cursed pirates are visible in skeleton form when exposed to moonlight, and in a swordfight between Jack and Barbossa (captain of the Black Pearl),  the two battle in and out of the moonlight beams shinning down into a cave.  The transformation of skeleton to human to skeleton again in the blink of an eye is movie magic at its best.<br/><br/>On paper, the movie had everything going against it.  Its running time of 140+ minutes.  It's director, Gore Verbinski, who had a hit last year in ¬ëThe Ring', but was still new to the fold with only 4 movie titles to his credit.  Johnny Depp in a leading role was even a gamble since he had yet to prove to be a box office juggernaut.  However, everything comes together in true Disney style.  The special effects are top rate, the story is long, but energetic, and the villain (usually the most important character in this genre) was superb.  Geoffery Rush gives us the most charismatic villain since Jack Nicholson in Batman.  <br/><br/>I should note that the supporting cast also does its best with the material. Elizabeth and Will are played with just the right amount of enthusiasm and playfulness, by Bend it Like Beckham's Keira Knightley and Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom.<br/><br/>If there was once complaint I would say that the humor doesn't come off as well as they would have expected and Johnny Depp, although tolerable, seems like he is trying too hard in his role that was a cross between Errol Flynn and Liberace.<br/><br/>But forget its small drawbacks and the history or pirate movies.  Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a good movie where everyone seems to be having fun."
"bullocks_1","10","1","2","4 November 2003"," MORE SPARROW PLEASE!!
","*minor spoilers*<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean was an absolute FANTASTIC FILM!!! I didn't expect much from a Disney film, and to be honest, I actually went to see the film because Orlando Bloom starred in it. However, Johnny Depp proved to be the best actor in the film, who played the comedic and lunatic character, Jack Sparrow, exceptionally well. Stunning performance by Orlando Bloom as the heroic blacksmith Will Turner, Geoffrey Rush as the haunting Captain Barbossa and Keira Knightly as the strong and independent Elizabeth Swann. It even created a division between 'good' pirates and 'bad' pirates. (I thought they were all ruthless?). Jack Sparrow is a well developed character who even draws sympathy from the audiences (when we're told of his crew abandoning him). He also adds in well balanced comedy, which just makes this character even more loveable. Johnny Depp definitely at his best, and he couldn't get any sexier!<br/><br/>The sword fight with the two hottest actors was one of the best scenes! who could resist watching the young blacksmith fighting with the inticing pirate, its a shame they didnt cut more of their shirts off...<br/><br/>The Special effects were fantastic, the story was witty and exciting, and although the ending was a little cheesy, it is definitely a fantastic MUST SEE film.<br/><br/>Definite thumbs up! go watch it if you haven't already! A perve at Orlando and Johnny is enough to make any girl want to see it!<br/><br/>rate 9/10"

At first when you see him you think he is not that good at being a pirate for going even with a blacksmith in a sword fight. But after a while you end up realizing that Johnny Depp  really does save this movie, with his skills at being an actor."
"krysta18","10","1","2","21 October 2003"," Go see this, Savvy?
","I see a lot of movies, and this one is the best one that has graced the silver screen for a long, long time. This is the perfect movie to go see again and again - whether you're alone, with your parents, babysitting a child, with a group of friends, or your boyfriend; There is something for everyone. The cast is incredible, but hats off definitely to Johnny Depp. I've never been one for the actors themselves; I think a movie is good based on the basic plot, storyline, and if the actors and actresses can pull off a half-decent job of making it believable. But Johnny Depp was absolutely incredible in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow! I am very, very impressed. In truth, until reading all the other comments posted about this movie, I never even realized it was a ""long"" movie; the time seems to fly by when watching it! The plot is great. Some people may feel it's a ""same old"" type of story, but there is just something about the film which gives it an edge-of-your-seat excitement and anticipation. Yes, the ""good guy"" wins, and Orlando Bloom does get the girl, but the outcome is not quite so black-and-white as all that. In fact, certain places throughout the story raise an arched eyebrow in the more detailed observer. For example, has anyone stayed through the credits to see the very very last scene at the very end of the credits? Be forewarned: you will have to dodge brooms and ignore the exasperated sighs of cleaning people as they manouever around you, and yes, the lights will be on, but stay until the last credit rolls. You will see what I mean about leaving it open for something else. I have been on the Disneyland ride, and found it a favorite. I was thus overjoyed to see scenes from the ride in the movie. My personal favorite was the scene in the prison, when the men are trying to get the ""mangy mut"" to help them escape. I loved thsi attention to detail that reminded people that yes, this is a Disney movie, in case some had forgotten amidst the skeletal ghosts and slashing swords and the figure that results from the beautiful heroine wearing her dreaded corset. There were no holes in this plot that I found. To the individual who didn't think it was mentioned why the blood of Orlando Bloom's character was neeeded, Geoffrey Rush's character explains that each of the gold coins had to be brought back together in order for the curse to be broken. In addition, each of the pirates had paid for their ""sins"" of taking the cursed treasure with their blood through time. The only pirate who had taken a gold piece, not returned it, and did not give any of his blood to ""the cause"" was the unseen character of Orlando Bloom's father. Just to clear up any misconceptions. This is an excellent movie, whether you want to see a romance, a happy ending, a plot with a few twists thrown in, an adventure, a fantasy, or anything inbetween. This movie cannot come highly enough recommended. Definitely getting 10 out of 10 rating from me, and that's only because there isn't a higher rating available."

In fact it was probably one of the best movies I have seen...ever!<br/><br/>The reasons for this are numerous: Clever casting, interesting story setting, love story meets action..the list continues. I will say that the plot is not particularly extraordinary but that just shows how well the other elements of the film contribute to its overall greatness.<br/><br/>Firstly, and most importantly, the cast was fantastic. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were hot!! Not only physically, but their acting was superb. Johnny's character (Capt. Jack Sparrow) was played with such realism, and the humor he brought to the movie made a great film an excellent film. Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightly were also remarkable.<br/><br/>The cast aside, everyone loves pirate films. The dark mystery that comes helm with the pirate way of life and the quaintness of the island settlements enriched the film with a glorious setting that is original. There have not been many films based on pirating in the Caribbean, let alone to the standard of this one.<br/><br/>The film is also one which all can enjoy. Hot guys for the girls and a gorgeous love story, but sword fighting and skeleton pirates for the guys (By the way GREAT visual effects!). It's also child friendly, a family movie.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie 4 times but am not nearly sick of it yet. The movie is not so much great because of it's story but because of its novelty. The witty humor brought by Johnny Depp and the amazing acting along with the audience it appeals to and the fantastic story setting make this movie one of my favorite EVER. I can't wait for the sequel!"

As for Orlando Bloom he is also in one of his best roles to date, although playing Legolas in LOTR catapulted him into stardom, this is without a doubt the role he shall be remembered for....at least, I believe he shall."
"rosemary-17","10","1","2","15 October 2003"," A brilliant movie that transcends normal blockbusters to become the best film of the year.(SPOILERS)
","when i went into this movie i was expecting to see an average film. i really only went for Johnny Depp who is one of the best actors of this era, never failing to give a superb performance. but on the whole i wasn't expecting to be impressed. i am delighted to say that for once i was completely and utterly wrong. from the start with Jack Sparrows (Depp) brilliantly funny entrance, to the end, the hilarious fall off the balcony, i was laughing none stop. there is no weak link in this film. the script is brilliant, mixing the right amount of plot without making it too confusing, and with so many witty gags to keep even the most unconvinced viewer amused. the direction is also spot on and the action is great. the acting is also very convincing with Orlando Bloom as Will Turner playing the Errol Flynn number, Keira Knightley doing the damsel in distress come feisty heroine routine and Geoffrey Rush hamming it up with the best of them. however, top honours go to Johnny Depp as, like always, he steals the show completely. his Keith Richards meets Pepe Le Pew character is the funniest and most inspired performance he has ever done (and that's saying a lot) and does not fail to keep you amused and excited from start to finish. his changing character from kidnapping Elizabeth, to seemingly turning against Will and then eventually becoming the hero is interrupted by scenes where he is truly playing it for comic value and does it effortlessly (his fight with Will at the beginning, being marrooned on the desert island and when he is about to be hanged at the end are among the funniest bits in a very funny film). his swaggering, drunken, hopeless yet heroic character is the best thing to come out of films in a long time and will keep you laughing long after the film is over. the only slight criticism would be that it is about 20 minutes too long, yet i cannot think which bits i would have them cut out as i loved every moment of it (and, i ask myself, can you have too much of a good thing.} overall, this film would always have been a success, but having Johnny Depp on board (no pun intended) saved the film from being just another hollywood blockbuster with no heart and turning it into something extraordinary with one of the best performances of his career, leaving the competition all out at sea."

","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is truly an adventure that is worth 4 times the price of admission. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and a young blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are after the fabled ship, The Black Pearl, after the dreadful crew lead by Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Will's main squeeze, Elizabeth Swann (played by the lovely Keira Knightley). On the way, Will learns that the Black Pearl used to belong to Jack, who lost it after Barbosa lead a mutiny against him. But, Jack is lucky, because soon after the Pearl was stolen from him, the crew had a nasty curse put upon them. Which makes them invincible, but turns them into skeletons in the moonlight. Not only that, but the crew needs the blood of a Turner (Will Turner!) to break the curse! This movie is an exciting, swashbuckling tale that doesn't fail to entertain you with eye popping battle scenes and asurbic wit. The running time is about 2 and a half hours, a bit long for a summer flick. But it doesn't bore you at all. The entire time your into the story and being dazzled by the action (and beauty of Keira Knightley). Movies like this aren't made...ever! When was the last time you saw a pirate movie? Cutthroat Island doesn't count! Anyway, this movie is one of the best of 2003 and manages to make pirates cool again.<br/><br/>RATING: **** out of ****"
"Ronin47","4","1","2","19 October 2003"," Johnny Depp is great, movie is weak (**)
","An ""adaptation"" of a ride at Disneyland seemed like kind of a flimsy idea, so I'm not entirely surprised that this overblown entry in the 2003 summer movie season isn't all that good. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, a humorously goofy pirate who walks with a constant, drunken swagger. Depp, as always, gives a fun and eccentric performance and gets some great lines in, but unfortunately he's the only thing worth remembering about this movie. The story and all the other characters are a total snooze. <br/><br/>Jack is trying to get his ship, the Black Pearl, back from a group of skeletal ghost pirates (led by a hammy Geoffrey Rush) who have kidnapped the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Winona Ryder look-alike Keira Knightley) in order to use her blood to bring them back to life. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is in love with Elizabeth, so he teams up with Sparrow. Bloom, from the ""Lord Of The Rings"" movies and Knightley, from this year's great ""Bend It Like Beckham"" are both interesting actors, but the characters they're playing might as well be cardboard cutouts. <br/><br/>There is lots of action and some twists in the story, but I found very little of it interesting. In fact, Johnny Depp's likable performance and one-liners were all that kept me awake through the ridiculous 2 hour, 15 minute running time. <br/><br/>It's directed by Gore Verbinski, and I guess it shows he can direct a big summer movie, but it completely lacks the small-scale style and effectiveness of his earlier films like last year's eerie ""The Ring"" and especially the quirky, sadly underrated ""The Mexican"".<br/><br/>
And when the army of skeletons shows up in the end, all I could think about was how much cooler it was in ""Army Of Darkness"". <br/><br/>I liked Depp's performance, but in a nutshell, the ride is better."
"tracyluvsya","10","1","2","14 October 2003"," Honestly One Of the Best Movies I've Seen In A Long Time
","If Johnny Depp does not win an award for this movie, then hell has frozen over. The superb acting, the clever comebacks, the wittiness, and, of course, the heart throbs make this the best movie of the year. I've seen the movie over 10 times, and can't wait for my 11th. If the whole cast isn't back for Pirates 2, I will be sorely disappointed."
"KatharineFanatic","10","1","2","13 October 2003"," Savvy?
","The cinematography on this film is what makes it outstanding. Whether it's Elizabeth Swann preparing to faint from a too-tight-corset on a parapet, or the tattered Black Pearl sailing in the moonlight, there's always something wondrous to gaze at on the screen. One fantastic underwater shot peruses a school of hammerheads as they drift endlessly through an underwater cove of sunken, ghostly ships. The introductory scene is also stunning, one of the most spell-casting experiences I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The Interceptor creeping through a mist-shrouded sea, the umbrella floating by, the magnificent horror of seeing a burning merchant ship, and our first glimpse of the Black Pearl as it sails into the fog. This scene alone makes the movie ticket price well worth it... and that's only the first four minutes.<br/><br/>As many profession and personal critics have observed, the film belongs to Johnny Depp's memorable performance as ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow, the single pirate able to elude the curse thanks to his crew mutinying before the gold could be spent. But the other performers shouldn't be overlooked in his hilariously likable wake. In the role of a very strong, independent heroine, Kiera Knightley manages to be both beautiful and spirited without escaping into clich√©. Orlando Bloom is more likable here than as the aloof Legolas he's become so well known for; with some excellent action scenes, he shows his unique skill with a blade as well as has the opportunity to carry off a romantic lead with a keen flair. Geoffrey Rush is at his best; being a fan of his endeavors, it was a pleasure to watch him on screen in a very different, very misunderstood role. He manages to make Barbossa both fascinating, horrible, and yet have a shred of sorrow at the end for his passing. Two extremely underrated actors, Britain's Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce, are given the respective roles of Commodore Norrington, Elizabeth's unfortunate fianc√©e, and her governor father.<br/><br/>For once, scriptwriters haven't copped out and given us an easy decision. While being slightly arrogant and something of an egotist, Norrington is also extremely likable, a perfect gentleman, and one might even go so far as to say, the most noble character by the closing credits. Davenport plays him with just the right amount of lethargic enthusiasm and irritation; his scenes with Depp, always wrought with blatant humor, are some of the film's finest moments. Pryce doesn't have a lot to work with, but the audience cannot help but chuckle over some of his humorous traits, such as fighting a skeletal hand for his magnanimous wig. The music is also first-rate, very mood-setting with a certain sense of dramatic tension even in romantic scenes. The film is well worth a PG13 rating, but is never inappropriate for younger audiences. The mild innuendo will go over children's heads (and most parents as well, for that matter -- only literature history-lovers will pick up some of the sly historical jests), the violence is all quite bloodless, and there's virtually no profanity. The pirates are properly frightening and in various stages of decay, extremely cool from a CGI perspective.<br/><br/>A movie well worth its praise, and one you simply MUST own on DVD for all its subtleties."

","I love this movie.  I have seen it twice and would gladly see it again.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is fabulous in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow.  His mannerisms, quirks, and humour bring this character to life.  Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and Keira Knightley also perform superbly in the film.<br/><br/>These performances, combined with a magnificent soundtrack, fun swordfighting scenes, and a good plot make a great movie.  That said, there were some plot elements that I didn't quite understand, but they were few and not so confusing that I couldn't enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to those who love pirate movies or movies that are fun, funny, and exciting with a bit of romance thrown in."

","What can anyone say about Pirates of the Caribbean except that it's BRILLIANT!!<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie, you set sail on a journey through the Caribbean. You can almost smell the air and feel totally absorbed into the movie.<br/><br/>The plot is good for a pirates' story with so many twists and shifts and gets you into the story step by step.<br/><br/>The set design is very good. So realistic and so rich you see that nothing is out of place, everything is where it's supposed to be.<br/><br/>The direction is excellent. The fight sequences were done in a humorous mode but with good skills.<br/><br/>The graphics is OUTSTANDING. You can look with the examining eye, you can not find a single moment of inconsistency in the graphics. It took my breath away.<br/><br/>The leads (Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport) were brilliant. They contributed positively to their roles, especially Johnny Depp. He was so funny and so in character that you couldn't imagine anyone else doing that role but him (savvy?).<br/><br/>
In Total...I think that this movie gave Disney a peak that is HARD to surpass. <br/><br/>I really doubt if anyone could do any better."

","Although this film is a rousing romp of maritime adventure, it has some problems with historical continuity.  Characters seem to randomly inhabit any century from the 16th to the 18th, roughly from the period of Edward VI to George III,  willy nilly.  The action and characters are everything they need to to be and a bit more ( you can just about smell Depp's Jack Starling.)  This film makes me appreciate all those Flynn, Power, Derek and Payne movies which managed to capture the period and flavor of bygone Romantic eras with much greater dispatch and lower budgets.  But I'm glad to see this genre again after too long an absence from our screens.  Great fun, all in all."

","Until about a month ago, The Two Towers was unique for being the only film I had ever gone to see in a cinema on more than one occasion. It's not unique any more, and to a great extent, it's also overshadowed. I've been to see this gem more often...There are a lot of high points to this movie...namely, it's what a trip to the cinema is all about, transportation to another place, if even for a couple of hours. Oh sure, Middle Earth is another place too, but it's not exactly fun, is it. I enjoy looking at it, but do I really want to walk through the cinema screen into the battle at Helm's Deep? I think not. Escapism. Sure, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush give the ultimate performances in it. But lots of things about this movie worked for me. The set design, the special effects, the weather...and tiny little details that you wouldn't miss if they weren't there, but which added to the movie big time. If I had to list a favourite movie of all time, I used to say The Princess Bride, or the first Matrix or whatever mood I am in. But I've seen this one five times now and it still is not tedious, still fresh...and it's pretty much there. I'm not surprised people loved it.

It had me from the opening sequence, to the end credits and left me wanting more.  i found the entire movie a marvel, the characters well scripted and perfectly brought to life.  above all of that though, the humour and wit brought forth by the wondeful Jack Sparrow and counterparts made the film.  the chemistry was perfect and this is definitely a movie i would indeed pay to see once again.<br/><br/>as mentioned, Johnny Depp was PERFECTLY cast as Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Sparrow that is.  He melded with this character and there is truthfully none other i could see in the role.  it was tailor made and he fit it like a glove.  it was also interestingly refreshing to see him in a role that departed from the ""Sleepy Hollow"" ""From Hell"" spectrums of the last few years.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom, an actor surrounded with much hype.  and i have to say much deserved.  He was fantastic, and a wonderful support.  Will Turners chemistry with Captain Jack is a marvel to watch and i found myself smiling an aweful lot.  and yes, i too drowned in his gorgeously long lashed eyes!<br/><br/>Kiera Knightly, the herione is one that i did not care for much.  despite her success in Bend it like Beckham, Kiera never really captivated me, but even she had me smiling and praising the casting directors for their choice. she was lovely and a wonderful foil for the otherwise all male cast.<br/><br/>there is no other rating but 5/5; 10/10 Excellent, and more inportantly a movie that EVERYONE, adult and child alike would love.  something for everyone!!!"

","This is a fun movie that reminds me of The Princess Bride for it's great fight scenes and  Johnny Depp's and Geoffrey Rush's wonderful characters. Though it's not nearly as witty  overall, it's full of great lines (most of which go to Jack Sparrow), funny references to  Disney's PotC ride, and good visuals.  The special effects are keen and not made to  scare, though young ones might be wary.  The movie can run on a bit, but I really didn't  mind (It meant more Jack Sparrow).  I've read reviews stating that Johnny Depp is channeling a drunken drag queen in this movie, and that's a good thing. There truly is  something hypnotic, sexy, and worth swooning over in the way he plays Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/> This movie also encourages kids to eat their fruits... particularly apples.<br/><br/> And if none of this has convinced you to go see this movie, then go to see the staggering amount of dental work.

His character is not one we will soon forget.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is awesome as the cursed Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom weren't bad, but I just found their characters to be boring.<br/><br/>Coming in at just under two and a half hours, some view Pirates as too long, while other, more obsessive fans, didn't want it to end.<br/><br/>So, all in all, if you want a fun, swashbuckling, good for the whole family but you actually WILL enjoy it unlike some other movies who said that too, check out Pirates.

","Overwrought, grotesque, turgid.  At the end they are fighting and fighting, Barberousse (who does not have a red beard) and Sparrow, and we ask why because neither can die.  On and on and on and on they go, while elsewhere all kinds of mayhem occurs.  This film has a mixed tone - unlike Sinbad: it tries to be a swashbuckler, but must fall into line on the current craze for realistic effects and graphic violence.  We watch brutal, winner-take-all-and-death-to-the-loser battles, as the heroes quip and prance, and just out of frame the ghouls plunge swords into the chests of soldiers we have just seen fall.  In Sinbad, no one seems to die - and that is fine by me.  Johnny Depp swishes drunkenly through his role; Orlando Bloom is appropriately dewy and earnest; the girl is luminous, fiery, resourceful - like every heroine in action films these days.  This film fell seriously in love with its main effect: the pirates turn into ghouls under the moonlight.  You want to see a great swashbuckler, invite your niece or nephew or the kid next door, and check out Sinbad."

"HunterDK","6","1","2","16 September 2003"," Highly overrated
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has been regarded as the best film this summer in the US, and many IMDb users have praised the return of the pirate genre.<br/><br/>With this in mind I went to the cinema and watched this movie, and once again I disagree with the IMDb users and possibly also a lot of critics. The story had a lot of potential with ghost pirates and stuff like that, it is a pirate movie and you can accept things like this, but the movie fails to impress me for several reasons.<br/><br/>First of all the cast was not chosen wisely. Johnny Depp is without doubt a great actor, but he is simply the wrong choice for an old pirate. He does not look old, but according to the story he should have been captain on the same ship where Geoffrey Rush was chief officer. The rest of the cast was chosen more wisely, but I never liked Orlando Bloom's character either.<br/><br/>One thing that really annoyed me was that almost every character should be funny, it was very annoying and at some points unbearable to watch. First we have some stupid English soldiers, later Johnny Depp has to be funny, and we also have to watch some funny ghost pirates all the time. Suddenly all characters have to be funny, and the ghost pirates are just comic sidekicks in this movie, they are not scary at all. The idea to make the English soldiers stupid has also been seen so many times before, and I really dislike it.<br/><br/>If that was all of it, then I maybe would not be that grumpy, but that was not all of it. The whole idea of immortal pirates was actually not good even though I accept stuff like that in this pirate adventure genre. I can ask a simple question, why do people take a fight against these immortal pirates? There is absolutely no point in doing that because the outcome has already been decided. Am I the only one who is asking these simple questions? Hopefully I am not.<br/><br/>After having criticised the movie I also have to point out some of the good sides. The movie is well done in both sound and picture. The effects are good and the ships can fascinate most people. <br/><br/>Anyway, the movie does not deserve a good rating, because the plot is too thin and all scenes have to be fun, which is a disaster in a 143 minute movie. Beautiful scenes and a few laughs however make this an acceptable picture, which should not be treated as an memorable movie of year 2003. - Rating: 6/10."

","Great to see that careful planning, structuring and audience studying pay off sometimes. The audience can at times be a strange beast, and can sink pictures in the same turf where others have been glorified. But Disney couldn't allow this movie to suffer the fate of Roman Polanski's ""Pirates"" or ""Cutthroat Island"". First major rule: stick to what you know, and always trust the school of Hollywood -  thus, create a buddy-buddy formula, add the love interest, and then create a baddie, or even better, an army of baddies to go chase the heroes. The cornerstones of the typical american blockbuster are all right there, splattered on the screen, just pick them out. Second major rule: give the audience the very thing they're looking for when in the movies - exactly those things that they're not expecting. So assume the pirate theme and adapt it to the 21st century - and then come the bombastic the special effects. These two rules are usually gold, and when you tackle a movie genre that hasn't been touched for almost ten years, it isn't difficult to give people what they want to see. But this apparent ease of thought would trap Disney, so thank God for brilliant ideas - and one brilliant actor. Johnny Depp steals the show right from his unforgettable entrance, and never thinks of allowing some space for other things to provide comic relief. And neither do the filmmakers, and the public. As Jack Sparrow, the gallery of Depp-ish weirdness is complete with a full-on, iconic buckaneer, brilliantly crossing pirate stereotype with pop culture in a performance of rare dedication and method for a summer blockbuster. The result is the most memorable character of the picture, and also the entire blockbuster season. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" could be in many ways another flop, but the producers made this movie by studying everything that made the others sink to the bottom. And also did Jerry Bruckheimer, whose ""Pearl Harbor"" left more bitterness in his mouth than memories in the entire audience. A refined sense of style, bombastic CGI skelletons and a script that only feels muddled when it seeks help in some of the chapters of the ""Hollywood book of screenwriting"", make this a winner, and one of the best popcorn-munchers of the year. Expect Peter Weir's / Russell Crowe's ""Master and Commander"", expect ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2"", and most probably seafaring adventures are back into the silver screen. Ahoy!"

Johnny Depps winning personality and talent was perfect for this movie, and Orlando Bloom's career is starting off on the right foot being in both the Lord of the Rings movies and in Pirates of the Caribbean. Kira Knightly also shows incredible talent and should be a promising actress. I'll admit the only reason I went to see the actual movie was because I'm a Depp fanatic and also a big Orlando Bloom fan, and I expected the movie to be boring, because I didn't know what it was about. But i was so wrong, it was AMAZING, and I recommend everyone see this movie. It is good for all people because it was a comedy, love, drama, action, horror, and family movie all in one amazing little package.

","This film was great fun and just might awaken more interest in the historical adventure film...a genre that has been sadly missed, but as in ""Gladiator"", when done well is big box office. However, Johnny Depp's rancid Captain Jack makes on long for the likes of Robert Newton, Anthony Quinn, and the pirate heroes of the 50's such as Flynn and Tyrone Power. The ""evil dead"" type special effects were an unnecessary distraction and the historical continuity was ludicrous.  Some characters were circa 16th and 17th century (Orlando Bloom with his Musketeer garb at the end) while the British troops were definitely late 18th century as in the American Revolution. Although I have to laud the intention the results were not entirely satisfying, but I'd like to see more attempts at this kind of film."

","As a child, Elizabeth Swann spots Will Turner floating unconscious in the water when she is at sea with her father, the British Governor.  After Will has been rescued, Elizabeth discovers and takes the coin hanging around his neck (a sign that Will is a pirate).  As an adult, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) wears this coin round her own neck and because of this, she is kidnapped by the crew of pirate ship, the Black Pearl who are cursed to sail the seas in a ghostly zombie-like state.  Only when the coin is returned to its treasure chest will this curse be lifted.  It is then up to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) with the help of pirate Jack Sparrow to rescue the Governor's daughter.<br/><br/>A good selling point of the film is its cast which includes pretty actors Bloom, Knightley and Depp (personally, I don't know what the fuss is about with Orlando Bloom ¬ñto me he is merely a younger version of Antonio Banderas).  Depp gives a likeable but over-the performance as the drunk and cockney accented Jack Sparrow and other big names include Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, the captain of the Black Pearl, and Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's Governor father.  Also, look out for Gareth of ¬ëThe Office' fame as one of the pirates!  All seem to be having fun with some acting more befitting to a pantomime than a film.  <br/><br/>The main problem I have with this film is that the pirate concept holds little interest for me (I am however, slightly amused by the obligatory ¬ëOooh Arrr's in pirate speak).  The main source of excitement is the fight sequences during which we see some good special effects of the crew of the Black Pearl appearing as a combination of skeleton and rotting flesh when exposed to direct moonlight.  However, the fighting soon becomes dull and repetitive.  Because the villains are already dead, there does not appear to be a quick resolution and as a result, the film is painfully drawn out to well over two hours in length.<br/><br/>Young children and those who are intrigued and excited by the prospect of pretty actors romping about and fighting on ships and the hoisting of the Jolly Roger will probably enjoy ¬ëPirates of the Caribbean'.  If you arrive to the cinema in a panto frame of mind, you will have a lot of fun but unfortunately the film left this viewer cold."

","Caught this film last week and have to say I didn't think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but Johnny Depp and his over the top campy performance delighted me.  It was worth seeing just because of him.  I like that Depp chooses unusual, frequently non mainstream films, I think he is a decent actor.  His facial expressions in this movie were priceless and I giggled through much of it.  My suggestion..wait for it to come to cable tv, but enjoy it when ya want to just relax and have a little fun."
"Silverzero","Null","1","2","23 August 2003"," Swashbuckling action flick is a good summer blockbuster.
","I have to admit I was hoping this film would be bad. Never really been a fan of pirate movies, and judging by the trailers, I thought this would be phoney and shallow. `Pirates of the Caribbean' has been receiving mass critical praise since the opening week and I can see why. It has that certain charm about it which is very hard to resist. The plot follows a very familiar outline, but the film comes to life in the swooping visuals and brilliant fight scenes. Essentially, `Pirates' is a B movie but a rather good one at that. While it is immensely enjoyable, is this really a five star movie? It's a big-budget large-scale blockbuster in the vein of `The Hulk' and `Terminator 3' but it hardly pushes the limits of cinema.<br/><br/>
The movie is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer- the helm behind similarly themed efforts such as `The Rock' and `Pearl Harbour'- so I can't say I'm surprised that there are so many big bangs throughout. Technical credits are top-notch all across the board. The cinematography, in particular, is a huge stand out. The CG work is good as well, but over showy in parts. Case in point is the scene in which Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa) turns into a skeleton and then drinks alcohol that we see as if we were wearing x-ray specs. While the animated work for that scene is good, the `It's-the-21st-century. -Look-what-we-can-do' effect comes across in an overtly preachy way. But this part is brief so there's no need to go into too much detail with it.<br/><br/>
And as your classic adventure movie, there are the three main characters- the hero, the significant other and the hammy villain. Also in there is a jilted lover/ hero #2, but he's perfectly relevant to the plot. Of course, the media are constantly saying `the film has everything! Action, comedy, drama, romance'- virtually 90% of all movies have all those factors. As I said, it all comes down to the action. The cheesy jokes, romantic subplots etc. are okay, but hardly what `Pirates' will be remembered for.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has the charisma and quirkiness to carry the role of Jack Sparrow. Better yet, he makes the role his own. With the offbeat swagger and cheesy one-liners, no one could have executed the role better. And the hammy villain is perfectly portrayed by Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush, who does this comic-style part just as well as the tougher ones. Keira Knightley (I hate that name) would seem like the perfect stereotype, but her character is well written and she brings life to- what could have been- a very flat performance. But Orlando Bloom seems out of place. His character has no charisma, no characteristics, no quirky one liners. And the lines are delivered without credibility. There's such thing as `playing it straight', but this is more wooden than the plank which he walks off of.<br/><br/>
And while the closing moments may go on for a bit too long, there's enough treasured moments to be able to forgive all that. And while there is no emotional core that elevates above the level of `a flashy action packed adventure-fest', you probably shouldn't expect one. So if you want an old-fashioned crowd pleaser, you won't go far wrong with `Pirates of the Caribbean'- a film which I'm almost ashamed to say that I enjoyed. My IMDb rating: 6.9/10."
"rob-236","4","1","2","18 August 2003"," Average Disney adventure
","Average action adventure Disney yarn is watchable mainly due to good performances by Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and the lovely Keira Knightley.<br/><br/>It's the tale of a pirate ship called the Black Pearl, once captained by the eccentric Depp, whose new captain ¬ñ Geoffrey Rush is looking for a pirate medallion that ends up in the hands of Knightley, the daughter a rich governor (Jonathan Pryce). Throw in Bloom as the dashing hero with a sketchy past and a major crush on Knightley, and you've got yourself a special effects ridden harmless piece of entertainment. Downsides are too many silly additional characters, who will only be of interest to very young viewers, and at 143 minutes, its far too long - they could have cut out about half an hour of footage off at least.<br/><br/>Nice to see a fairly original idea through, although I hear it is based on a computer game(?) or something (I may be wrong), instead of the countless sequels that have cluttered up the cinemas over the past year or so.<br/><br/>¬Ö..saying that, no doubt there will be a `Pirates of the Caribbean 2' through, sooner rather than later!!"

","Pirates of the Caribbean is a solid swashbuckling adventure of the type that reminds of me of better times.  In fact, it made me recall The Princess Bride, another film in a similar genre.<br/><br/>Performances are fine here, if a bit over the top on many occasions. Johnny Depp is a scene stealer: the audience is just waiting for him to reappear while the other characters get serious screen time.  The heroine is sexy, Orlando Bloom is the typical white hero, lots of funny situations.  Cliche ending, but what do you expect?  The film should have ended sooner, and some of the snappy comments were rather stupid.<br/><br/>
So, it's not a masterpiece but, all in all, a very solid piece of cinematic entertainment. My rating is 8/10."

","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is an expensive film.  It looks expensive, and was more than likely expensive to make.  It is a film about cursed pirates.  It has lots o' CGI effects (my favorite), but fails at using them in any new or interesting way.  Geoffory Rush and Johnny Depp (as a high seas Keith Richards) seem to be having a blast, but then again they are being payed a whole lot of money (see note above on film's expense).<br/><br/>The musical score, by Klaus Badelt, is carbon copy Media Ventures crap (and to think he replaced Alan Silvestri...), and probably cost a good penny in and of itself.  Let's just say that if I didn't have a girlfriend, I would have never seen this film.<br/><br/>Okay, the bad points:  On a general level I find this film disturbing. It opens the gates of hell and, upon its success, will prompt Disney to churn out colorful products that do nothing more than promote the corporate giant's theme parks (did anyone catch the trailer for THE HAUNTED MANSION, looks good...sigh...).  One can almost feel the hairy mouse-like tendrils closing on the jugular of American film.

While I was clueless as to what exactly was going on, Depp pulled off well his wake up calls and instead appeared to have a brilliant, original take on the plot twists.  Move Depp, on probation, into the ""watchable actor, sole reason for buying ticket"" column.<br/><br/>Hollywood producers accept pirate projects at their peril.  Maybe it's a challenge match for those with money to spare.  Someone today no doubt pitched a TV series based on the pirates in 'Six Days, Seven Nights'. Pirates.  Hollywood.  Fairbanks.

"bgolson","5","1","2","22 July 2003"," A waste of time.
","I just got back from watching this movie. I should first mention that I had no idea what this movie was about (beyond Pirates). All I knew about this movie was that it did great over the weekend. I don't understand where all the comments about this movie being good, and Johnny Depp acting great are coming from! First, the overacting by Johnny Depp was driving me crazy! I kept expecting to see Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy show up on screen. His character had no purpose in the movie! The nice compass he had could have been given to any other character, and the plot of the movie would not have changed a bit. The characters were so shallow, I had no strong feeling about any of them. There was nothing very interesting about the plot either. It was so simple, that reading the one sentence plot outline from imdb.com tells you everything you need to know about it. The best part of the film is the visual effects, very stunning throughout the entire film! Overall, I give this film a 5/10. If you've got nothing else to do, go see this film and watch the nice visual effects. But remember to turn your brain off before the movie starts, or you'll end up with a splitting headache by the time it ends."
"Mentat327","3","1","2","19 July 2003"," Ok over all in spite of being a Bruckheimer film
","Over all the movie ended up being ok, in spite of the fact it could have been great. But as anyone who's familiar with Jerry Bruckheimer movies knows, lots of scenes ended up being over dramatized, over humored, grossly contrived scenarios, a lot of style with very little substance, and generally for people with low intellect and attention spans.<br/><br/>But as someone else pointed out, it should at least be pretty fun for the kids. Johnny Depp's character, while over the top, was still pretty entertaining as a pirate who's got a screw loose, or one sandwich shy of a picnic (which in the movie seems to mean having effeminate mannerisms). All the other characters are mind numbingly cliched.<br/><br/>The real stars of the movie, of course, are the special effects. Spectacular transition effects done almost seamlessly. So gather of the kids and head on down to the matinee. If you're an adult, you might want to have a drink first and check your IQ at the door. Trust me; you'll have a better time."
"Pavel-8","6","1","2","17 July 2003"," Good summertainment. Pass the rum.
","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>If I were given $125 million and told to make a B-movie about pirates, ""Pirates"" would be something I wouldn't mind coming up with. The flick works because it doesn't quite take itself seriously. Had it been a straight forward movie, boredom would have set in sooner, but the tongue-in-cheek humor makes it endurable.<br/><br/>At the core of the askance goofiness is Johnny Depp, who plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate of questionable skills and methods, in a half-drunk manner that can't be taken too seriously. He embodies all things pirate, complete with cliches, sarcastic remarks, and rum. Initially his odd mannerisms threw me, as I didn't quite understand why he couldn't walk straight. But as his character was fleshed out, everything made sense; and Depp's brilliance was understood. He and his character carried the movie, in part because every time Pirates drifted towards over-the-top seriousness, a mere glance or comment from Depp put it back in its proper place. Popcorn movies don't usually supply opportunities for great performances, and maybe there wasn't one written. Depp, however, took the part to a level beyond the movie itself.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast ranged from servicable to good. Orlando Bloom finally starred in a movie without his pointy ears, and did quite well as blacksmith apprentice Will Turner. Although he didn't have much to work with in a combination role as both straight man and hero, he filled those roles admirably, proving once again that he has a stellar screen presence.<br/><br/>The striking Keira Knightley, in a slightly different role than Bend it Like Beckham, doesn't have much to do as the damsel in distress. But she presents Elizabeth as a step up from the token screamer. Her long figure and bold facial features (Natalie Portman-esque) draw attention as well. She and Bloom make quite the on-screen duo.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush leads the rest of the cast as Captain Barbossa, the requisite evil pirate and Sparrow's nemesis. He eats up his part, nearly outdoing Depp in the campiness department. Everyone else is competent, looking their parts well, but doing little more.<br/><br/>Aside from Depp's performance, the look of the movie was the highlight. The rich and colorful palette of the film enhanced the bold lifestyle embraced by such rogues. The sweeping cinematography, meant to be seen on the big screen, captured the feeling of living such a sea-bound life, providing an experience that truly felt on location.<br/><br/>Much has been made of ILM's skeletal special effects, and they deserve whatever praise they receive. Simply designing the skeletons and their smooth movements is impressive enough. But the real accomplishment is the phenomenally fluid transition of the undead from flesh to bone when moving in and out of moonlight. This movie should at least get a look when the Academy Awards come around.<br/><br/>Surprisingly for a pirate movie, the sound is quiet during the opening scenes, so quiet that the rumbling bass from the neighboring theater intruded on my screening. But once the action accelerated, the sound did as well. Fortunately it did not reach the ear-splitting levels of previous Bruckheimer fare like ""Armageddon"", plateauing at a loud but manageable volume, providing a pleasant aural experience.<br/><br/>That experience was enhanced by the score of Klaus Badelt. He is clearly a disciple of Hans Zimmer, as the music rings of Zimmer's ""Gladiator"".  It is also reminiscent of ""Mask of Zorro"". The strings and horns drove forward with the action of the movie, especially during the climactic scenes. Some may find the music over-bearing, but for a movie such as this, it is quite appropriate.<br/><br/>As much as I've raved thus far, I rate this movie only 6 out of 10 (still a thumbs up in my book) for a number of reasons. Unfortunately, ""Pirates"" has a running time (nearly 150 minutes) that matches the titular length. Trimming 20-30 minutes off, mostly at the beginning and end, would have made this film much better, limiting the lulls between action. After the humorous introduction to Sparrow, the exposition was too long. Depp portrayed the part well enough that we didn't need every single aspect of his character explicitly shown. In the last half hour, the battle scenes between the undead and the British, while visually attractive, were both too long and unnecessary. Since the pirates were immortal at that point, shouldn't they have overrun the British more quickly? They could have easily reached the ship later and just commenced the fight when the curse was lifted. The inclusion of a mandatory happy-ending epilogue was fine, but it too dragged, because the writers had to politely wrap up the love triangle.<br/><br/>
Speaking of which, the whole Elizabeth-Commodore Norrington romance angle should have been axed. Not only did it add length, it overstated the fact that Elizabeth and Turner were going to fall in love. Speaking of needless romantic angles, the ambiguous past between Sparrow and Anamaria should probably have been trimmed too. I'm guessing there was more to it in the original cut, but most of that was eliminated, leaving the small remaining parts out of place.<br/><br/>Speaking of out of place, the comedic relief pirates and soldiers, although amusing at first, quickly wore out their welcome. Characters such as theirs are usually present in Disney movies, but in a more 'adult' flick, particularly one already replete with humor, the cheap comedy only annoyingly slows down the pacing.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem with Pirates is that for all its positives, the movie still is not truly interesting. It does engage, but does not pique interest. There is just too much going on between too many people to really care about what's occurring. Don't get me wrong. It's an enjoyable film from which you will likely remember a handful of images; but outside of Captain Jack Sparrow, the depth is lacking. Maybe that will be remedied in the inevitable sequel(s)...<br/><br/>Bottom Line:  Good summertainment. 6 of 10. Pass the rum."
"WalterFrith","Null","1","2","20 July 2003"," Johnny Depp saves 'Lord of the Rings' meets 'The Mummy'
","Let's get one thing straight up front and that is that I am only comparing this film to 'Lord of the Rings' in terms of its gothic action sequences with the ghostly skeletons.  The lighting on these scenes is almost identical to some parts of 'LOTR'.  The shadowy cascade of computer special effects mimic parts of 'The Mummy' with a hero and the damsel in distress fully in hand.  <br/><br/>Other than that, Johnny Depp is absolutely outstanding.  His charasmatic and eccentric qualities save this movie and it ranks a 9 out of 10 whenever he is speaking or engaged in the important moments.  Geoffrey Rush is also quite good in his role but when the other actors are present, the film comes off as superficial.  <br/><br/>Directed like a pure popcorn summer movie, it's odd that this really isn't a family film because a lot of the dark moments of horror are definitey NOT for young children.  The film also suffers from overlength at almost two and a half hours.  The attention span of children and teenagers is being stretched at such a length.  <br/><br/>This movie is worth a look but that's about it.  It makes a good movie as an alternative plan to what you're going to do.  Our party was rained out at golf and we decided to take in this flick.  To make a special trip out to see it would have been a task and Hollywood is already full of tired stories like this and the search (if there is one by the movie industry) for originality goes on!"

Being the first Walt Disney movie (under the Disney banner) to be given a PG-13 rating, I was surprised at how violent the movie was. While it is nowhere near an 'R' rating, definately not a PG rating either. Parents, think twice before bringing the younger ones.<br/><br/>I can't think of too many complaints. Humor and action were well-balanced. I suppose some more sword-fighting would've been nice, but a minor gripe with an otherwise fantastic action-adventure. Compared to recent summer movies that weren't really all that good (Terminator 3, Matrix Reloaded, Hulk), it was nice to see another movie that, while no X2: X-Men United, manages to blow you out of the water!

Fanatical Disney fans will be thrilled at how these images, characters, and dialogue/song from the ride are subtly incorporated into the film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp creates the character of Captain Jack Sparrow as only Depp can, using his combination of charm and wit to captivate the audience to remark on his performance long after the credits have finished. He once again demonstrates that he has an impeccable knowledge of who he is as an actor and what roles he can create to great success.  Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce all contribute fantastic performances to create a solid leading cast.

As one would expect, there are numerous, yet subtle references to the Disneyland Park attraction on which the film is based and moviegoers will have fun identifying them.  Even the famous song ""Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirate's Life For Me!"" makes sporadic appearances in the film, in fact, the movie opens with it.  But it is presented in such a way that it never comes off forced or ""cheesy.""<br/><br/>While Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom are all excellent in their respective roles, it's Johnny's Depp's movie all the way.  Depp commands your attention every time he's on the screen and clearly he's having fun with it.  Very few actors could pull this feat off without going ""overboard"",  so to speak.  Only Geoffrey Rush comes dangerously close to fulfilling his destiny as a true pirate and stealing the movie away from Depp.  It is an honest pleasure to watch these two professionals on screen together.<br/><br/>Summer moviegoers, tired of film disappointments and over-hyped sequels will be delighted by this cinematic thrill-ride.  Bring your sword and your eye patch, the swashbuckler adventure is back!<br/><br/>NOTE: The PG-13 rating is for mild violence; TV show and video games contain far more graphic violence.  There is also no profanity or nudity. However, I dare the viewer to miss any of these with the well-written script!"
"Jamie_Seaton","8","2","7","24 August 2009"," why's this film rated so good ???
","as you can see I've not rated this film bad because there is a few qualities about it such as Johnny Depps acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow is quite comical and the graphics were good too. there was a lot of floors to the film too, a lot of cheesy bad acting is the worst. i just hated some things about it. its well overrated too, to be rated 8.0 on IMDb is a very lucky achievement for this.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom as Will Hunting and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swan are also among the cast and do a fairly good job. i do think Johnny Depps acting in this clouds over the other actors, he has done a very good job of this. the action and graphics have a big part to play in this almost epic feature.<br/><br/>overall this film does deserve a watch but has been well overrated.... a good thing about the film is that there isn't really anything like this film around. was a good watch.......... 6/10......... j.d Seaton"

","If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like ""Stop blowing holes in my ship,"" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox."
"godz_little_angel2009","10","2","8","16 January 2005"," It was a great pirate tale.
","I thought that Pirates of the Caribbean was a great movie. i thought Johnny Depp was great as the sexy captain Jack Sparrow. I cant wait till the 2nd part of this story comes out to see more of Johnny and Orlando. The computer graphics were great, they really made the damned crew come to life. Johnny Depp was the best man to cast as Captain Jack Sparrow, he really grabs the character and brings him to life. The action sequences in the movie were extravagant, how Orlando and Johnny danced around sword fighting and the visual effects of battle between two 18th century battle ships. This is definitely the kind of movie that brings the whole family together and has viewers asking for more."

","Pirates of the Caribbean (The Curse of the Black Pearl) is about a governor's family who find o boy in the water when they are out whit their boat. The daughter of the governor is finding that the boy wear a pirate-necklace and she take it. When the daughter (Elizabeth) is older, she gets taken by some evil pirates. She tells them her name is Elizabeth Turner. But it isn't. Turner is the name of the boy her family find in the water, some years ago. The boy, Will, doesn't know he is a pirate and now he is a friend of Elizabeth and her family. The evil pirates, think Elizabet is a pirate, because she is named Turner. They are taking her to a cave, together with the necklace and there they are going to take some of her blood and they are going to cancel a curse that rest over the evil pirates. But it doesn't work. So now they know that Elizabeth is not the right human to take blood from, she is not the daughter of the Turner (the father of Will Turner). Now they start searching after the pirate who can cancel the curse. Will Turner, who's working as a smith in the town where Elizabeth lives, meet Jack Sparrow one day. Jack is a pirate too, and they take a ship and go away to look after Elizabeth. On the ship Jack tells Will that he is a pirate too, but Will isn't believe him at first. But afterward he recognize that its true. Jack and Will goes out on a big adventure, and Will is prepared to die to find Elizabeth, and save her..<br/><br/>I think the film is a good film. You can see it in nearly every ages and its both funny and exciting. The actors is very good in acting, and of course it makes the film been better. This movie is definitely worth to see!"

","Movie Review: Pirates of Caribbean (The Curse of black Pearl) An action adventure film directed by Gore Verbinski and produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer. Wonderfully drunken performance of Johnny Depp playing a roguish, mildly insane, piratical lead named Captain Jack Sparrow. The Movie also stars Orlando Bloom as blacksmith named Will Turner and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth who is a daughter of Governor of Port Royal. The movie sails along with the ship called ""The Black Pearl"". The pirates on the Black Pearl captained by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) are cursed to sail the seas in a state between living and dead. Their cursed could be lifted only after they get the last piece of Aztec gold that every cursed pirate had. Pirates kidnap Elizabeth as she had the last piece of gold. Jack Sparrow teams up with a Will who was in love with Elizabeth to rescue her and to get his ship back from Barbossa. He then steals the ship and forms the crew to hunt down Barbossa. The energetic and entertaining sequences of action produced between the fight scenes between Royal Navy and immortal pirates is another reason to watch this amusing movie.<br/><br/>Just like the theme park ride that inspired it, the movie's greatest strengths are its atmosphere and art direction. The best thing about the direction of Gore Verbinsky is the amount of perfection he adds in every frame and in every character of his film. Supporting characters Kevin McNally, Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport had perfectly played their part. Constant pace of action, picture perfect scene, soundtrack and some excellent execution of dialogues can be seen throughout the movie. It is a film that prides itself on lively detail and top-grade craftsmanship, but doesn't take itself too seriously. Audiences aren't persuaded into feeling that they should be having fun but they simply are having fun because the movie is too."

","Since my family clan has Lore for Piracy, I feel obliged to write this review ... Ha-ha-ha, you got this - it's a joke! My family name is so awkward that wherever I go, they asked me whether I'm a Barbarian or maybe coming from Barbary Coast. Funny thing I didn't changed it for Anglo-Saxon and retained my Armenian denomination. Otherwise, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (2003) is a swell movie but nothing special within the ""Swashbuckler"" genre. I repeat ""Swashbuckler"" here, because if we make search with a topical word and we get avalanche of information. Predominantly, from Wikipedia and other sources you get idea for sword and chivalry adventure where an archetype is difficult to choose out of multitude of heroes, from various lands and different historical ages.<br/><br/>Now, where are we - Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew. I presume every kid is aware that this is fantasy movie, not based on real persons or events. It gathers the fame of another Indiana Jones franchise; albeit, Archeology here is substituted with Piracy but no specific location or time is pin-pointed. Seemingly, this was originally a Video Game that was adapted for Big Screen. And since I don't want to look stupid (I am too old for Video Games or any other Sport), let me proceed thus. Johnny Depp cashed this Movie marvelously. He is exactly my age but looks some 10-15 years younger. He retained his acrobatic physical shape that we remember as early as ""Benny and Joon"" (1993). I wish him luck. So much so for the other cast and director Gore Verbinski.<br/><br/>I want to comment something on Piracy Lore. That task came not to be so easy. Else, there are lot of facts in Internet but you don't have gold on tip of your tongue. As mentioned, I have huge library but things are scattered here and there. Most of my knowledge came from fiction literature - a genre known as adventure novel. Those marvelous assets in my library were gathered carefully and painstakingly, some 40 years from time. Many of those people in Antiquary Business which I collaborated with are now dead or mentally dysfunctional. But their ancestors continued the Job willy-nilly: here a book nicely illustrated, there a cover with colorful picture. We didn't have computers nor graphic design was available. We were self-made men, product of Technology Age that was at brink of Revolution. You don't have to be President to realize this. Plus, young lions were always around ready to devour, ain't they!<br/><br/>Yet, I didn't get to my point and never will. Piracy is Neverland, heroes are like Peter Pan never growing old and living in their dream. Neverland is fantasy world seldom explored. Read the novels from Scottish writer J. M. Barrie and you will find Neverland. It is a world more fantastic than Alice's Wonderland. Have lot of fun ...<br/><br/>P.S. If you want more, you can get access at http://www.roman-daventures.com/.

","This is one of those movies I'll rate higher than I really should because it's pure nostalgia for me. I was in kindergarten when it came out, and this film was responsible for an extended pirate phase. Hell, I still want to be a pirate. The aesthetic in this movie is a powerful thing, and the character who embodies that aesthetic is, of course, Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>Oh, Jack Sparrow. I never had a crush on you, but you were and are #goals - a seaborne Mick Jagger swaggering down-ship with a bottle of rum, radiating a good-humored nihilism that even my child-self knew to envy. There's a surprising amount beneath the surface with Sparrow, but ultimately, he captures and complicates the conflict between fantasy and reality that defines this genre. All the other characters are pure period drama or pure fantasy. Sparrow quite literally walks the line between real and myth, and because of it he's the essence of a swashbuckler. The whole Will/Elizabeth story - okay, that's most of the story - that I could do without, and I think I speak for most people when I say Sparrow makes the movie. But boy, does he make it something."

Will frees Sparrow to pursue her.<br/><br/>The movie is bombastic, chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it, this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it, this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess. In a film overstuffed with CGI, big sets and wild characters, Depp has a neon sign flashing over him in one of the most original performance ever in movie history."

","As I go back and watch Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, I find the viewing experience just as much fun as the first time I saw the film in theaters. I also find the film more and more ridiculous.<br/><br/>When I first saw the film I was 13 years old, and I was just starting to realize that I wanted to be in the filmmaking business. Where films like American Beauty, Signs, and the films of Kevin Smith and Mel Brooks, really influenced me in the types of stories I wanted to tell, the original Pirates of the Caribbean really influenced the type of colorful characters I wanted to explore with my stories. In particular, and I'm sure to no surprise, Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow dazzled me (for the record, and for no particular reason, the other performance that significantly effected me in my life was Heath Ledger's as The Joker). I can remember imitating him for a long time, something that caused much frustration for my parents I'm sure. And also probably contributed to my unpopularity in high school. But I didn't care, I loved the film and the performance, and it once again helped solidify my certainty in wanting to write movies for a living (now that I think about it, this might have been the aspect that frustrated my parents the most.)<br/><br/>At some points the movie has a complicated plot and can also be quite long. By listening to the commentary of the film, the director even mentions at one point, that at that particular moment in the film (when Captain Sparrow and Elizabeth are stranded on the beach) the audience has all the information they need to end the story. Yet the film will continue for another 40 minutes. The film is flawed, as with ALL films I think. But with the eclectic characters, the overall plot of pirates and treasure, and the fact that it is just a fun ride, what's there not to love about this film?<br/><br/>When I look back now, I have the same feelings I would image a grown up viewer of films like E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, or Raiders of the Lost Ark might feel. When you go back and watch the movies from your own childhood you are aware of the dated effects and sometimes unbelievable sequences, but you also are reminded of the magical feelings that you felt upon first viewing those images. Now, I do not mean to compare E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, or Raiders of the Lost Ark to POTC, but the feelings for me are similar. Classics are in a way defined by the generation in which they were released. Huge amounts of people saw E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, and Raiders, and some have now deemed them classics of their time. And if you don't want to call POTC a classic of a more recent generation that's fine, for the record I'm not particularly calling it that. But I do think that this movie, whether we like it or not, will be around for a long time. And well deserved."
"spacemandc","3","1","3","17 February 2012"," What a HUGE disappointment!
","Despite the phenomenal popularity of the (thus far) four installments of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean (POC)"" cinematic franchise, I've found it to be a monumental disappointment. Being such a fan of the original Disneyland ride ever since it first debuted back in 1967 (I once got off the ride and got right back in line for it seven times in a row¬Ö), I can't tell you how eager and excited I was to run out and see the first POC installment, ""Curse of the Black Pearl,"" way back in 2003 especially since it starred one of my favorite cinematic actors, Johnny Depp. Oh how tragic to experience my initial eagerness and excitement quickly fade into bitter disappointment and frustration! What was immediately apparent to me was the almost complete disconnect between the vision and experience created by the ride and the vision now being projected up on the big screen. With all of its extravagant cinematography and special effects and over-the-top and even ridiculous characterizations of characters who never appeared in the ride, the film just didn't have the same creepy excitement and fantasy-world fun generated by the ride.<br/><br/>And these serious deficiencies have persisted throughout all three of the sequels. In particular, Johnny Depp's character of Jack Sparrow is just too fey, effete and just plain silly, Orlando Bloom (whom I despise) is too much of what he always is in every movie he's in ‚Äì an inconsequential ""pretty boy"" that inspires absolutely no excitement or interest and Keira Knightly, a ""pretty bit of fluff"" who was ""force fed"" into the POC cinematic franchise purely out of political correctness, i.e., ""we (the writers and producers of the POC films) must make sure that the world of the pirate which has been traditionally portrayed as all male is properly ""updated"" in our productions to be politically correct in including at least one woman main character..."" Yes, there are the historical accounts of at least two very prominent women pirates, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, but I'm sure they didn't look or act anything like Keira Knightley's character ‚Äì and she certainly was never even hinted at in the original Disneyland ride¬Ö As a result, she is completely out of place and really detracts and distracts from the plot lines of all of the POC installments. She doesn't even work successfully as a ""love interest"" for Orlando Bloom or Johnny Depp as Olivia de Havilland did with Errol Flynn in ""Captain Blood"" or Maureen O'Hara did with EF and Anthony Quinn in ""Against All Flags"" since her (Knightley's) character suffers the confused split personality of being that of a butch female swashbuckler (completely unbelievable and stupid!) and a sexy feminine dish (much more likely)....<br/><br/>Out of a real dedication to my affection for the original ride, despite my bitter disappointment with the first installment, I've forced myself to see every one of the sequels hoping against hope that ""things would get better,"" i.e. the films would get closer to the look and spirit of the ride ‚Äì and that Orlando Bloom and/or Keira Knightley would be killed off or otherwise just disappear! Praise be to Providence that this actually did come to pass in the third sequel ‚Äì BUT it's too little too late and I'm still left with the feeling of a lover who has watched the ""perfect woman of his dreams"" become the ""the nightmare hag from hell¬Ö"""

Somehow, Disney's accursed homogenizing hand could not stultify this film's pure adrenalin bumrush.<br/><br/>Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow, who rocketed out of left field with his mascara on overdrive and his personality on sideways; he alone imbues this movie with its unique charm. For some reason, his aggressive effeteness lends an authenticity to the swashbuckling that none of the other ""Halloween pirate"" performances can. His drunken, insouciant braggadocio drives the film like a 1st rate Ship-of-the-line, beating to windward, guns blazing (and I do mean 'blazing').<br/><br/>Matter of fact, there were secret talks held with the Oxford English Dictionary on whether to replace Anthony Hopkins's picture with Depp's, next to the meaning of the word ""fey."" Filmed in the Caribbean (St. Vincent and the Windward Islands of the Grenadines), PIRATES somehow avoids looking anything like the Caribbean. Must be that homogenizing Disney touch.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is aye-me-hearties Captain Barbossa who stole Sparrow's ship, the Black Pearl, which Sparrow spends the whole movie trying to steal back.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is Elizabeth Swann, daughter to the Governor (Jonathan Pryce), betrothed to a stoic British Commodore (Jack Davenport), but in love with Jack's girlfriend, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom).<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski frames Knightley's opening shot from an angle that makes her look busty, rather than her sad reality of being flatter than the Earth Before Columbus.<br/><br/>Her pancake ironing board pecs are probably the reason that with all the kidnapping she undergoes by pirates, not one of them thinks to drag her into the hold and rape her - they must think she's a skinny boy. And since none of them are Catholic priests, she's not considered sexual property.<br/><br/>It looks very eerie cinematically, but with all those holes in the sails, how does the Black Pearl ever sail? Oh, that's right, she's supernatural. Then why does she ""sail"" at all? Why engage in a ""chase"" to ""catch up"" to the Commodore's ship? Why not just appear alongside in one fell swoop? <br/><br/>For once, the work of four writers looks justified (Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, Jay Wolpert) with the wealth of ideas on screen. Bold, brash, criminal adventure, involving Aztec blood amulets, hidden treasure, lots of yo-ho-ho barrels of rum, double-crosses and triple-crosses (Sparrow: ""Me? I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly"") and fencing the likes of which we haven't seen since Basil Rathbone and Errol Flynn (which does get tiresome when everyone is fencing for no reason, i.e. if you can't kill each other by fencing - due to being supernatural beings - why bother?) <br/><br/>Bouncy-bouncy music by Hans Zimmer, moving us like the shifting deck of a schooner: coy, ominous, frolicsome, and rope-swinging-across-chasms epic, transporting us out into the salty breeze and briny seas - or at least to a water tank in San Francisco.<br/><br/>I'm sure the PIRATES movie has made the Disney ride infinitely more popular - though no less boring.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."
"mullaryn","10","1","3","2 February 2009"," Something to remember when you're into your second century.
","The theme of pirates is a very common one in movie-making. There hasn't been a high enough level of mathematics invented yet to number the pirate cartoons made. Several of the 'immortal' classics such as 'Treasure Island' are about pirates. And of course, Hollywood has it's share in the pirate stories: 'Cutthroat Island' (I don't know why it flopped), 'Treasure Island', and variants have all graced or disgraced our screens for decades. And then this...<br/><br/>I truly think that pirate movies aren't going to get better than POTC. The plot is original, surprising, and impossibly dynamic, the humor fresh and unforced, the filming absolutely stunning, and the acting thorough and enjoyable. Watching Jack Sparrow (by the way, the entire image of Jack Sparrow was left up to Johnny Depp. I can't imagine how it could've turned out better) clamber, sway, and in extreme cases fall through trembling holds, cages, and rigging was something that I know I will look back upon in about twenty years with just as much relish as I do now. The brilliant dynamic created by the sarcastic, irreverent Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and the uber-eccentric, hilarious, infinitely scheming Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is something that cannot accurately be described by anyone on this earth. Add to that some semi-peripheral roles that only enhance the humor and action, and you get a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The sets were filmed on location using real ships (well... 2/3 real ships), real ocean, real islands, and a specially constructed real fort, giving this movie an authenticity that serves to endear it even more.<br/><br/>There is something in this movie that will appeal to anyone: action lovers, wisecracks, the romantic souls, those that like to tickle their nerves with semi-scary images, the thinkers, ANYONE. Should you watch this movie? Of course! And bring the kids along too... the skeletons and such, they're not even really scary. The whole movie is almost like a story, in fact. A very fast-paced, engrossing, exciting, and profound story."
"sahierge","10","1","3","6 December 2008"," Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) is without a doubt the best pirate movie I have ever seen. The tale begins when Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) discovered a pirate medallion around the neck of a young boy who washes up from a wrecked merchant ship. She has no idea that it is really a missing piece of Cortez's cursed Aztec gold, stolen by the crew of the Black Pearl. The pirate crew, commanded by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) needs the last piece and the ""blood to be repaid"" to lift the curse set on them when they removed the gold. In attempts to gain back this cursed treasure, the crew runs into the captive, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who was marooned by Barbossa and left for dead. Once Elizabeth was taken capture by the cursed crewmen of the Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) sets free Jack Sparrow to help him locate the Black Pearl and rescue her. <br/><br/>The cast is perfectly chosen and interacts with each other as if they had been working together on this film over many years. Johnny Depp plays a selfish pirate who is constantly calculating ways to manipulate others into helping him gain what he desires. His phenomenal acting was not only cohesive to piracy, but also added a comedic aspect to the film. He added a sense of comic relief to a typical adventure film by use of sarcasm, wordplay, and gesturing to make the scene humorous rather than somber. My particular favorite quote that depicts his wordplay is, ""Me, I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly, it's the honest ones you have to watch out for because you never know when they're going to do something incredibly stupid."" He uses the wordplay to, it seems, confuse the other character into believing him to be truthful. After viewing the film, I was utterly convinced that the cast is a medley of pirates all working for or against each other to gain what each of them secretly desired. It is the audience's task to figure out which of the characters can be trusted and which ones have dishonorable ulterior motives. <br/><br/>In terms of cinematography, the film utilizes the aspects of lighting to highlight the effects of the curse on the pirates and to show the authenticity of the time period. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush's character, states, ""The moonlight shows us for what we really are. We are not among the living' and so we cannot die, but neither are we dead."" Lighting is a very important aspect of the entire movie because it shows the effect of the curse in action. The crewmen were forbidden to remove the gold from the chest, but they did so regardless of the warning and became cursed by the heathen Gods. Throughout the rest of the movie, the lighting is either candle light or natural lighting because of the setting. During the night scenes, there is emphasis on moonlight, when the pirate crew is shown, or there is use of candle light indoors. Whichever the case may be, lighting plays a very important role in the film. <br/><br/>The costume designs for each character were carefully chosen and created to match each and every role. Some characters even wore colored contacts to make their eyes appear yellow or discolored, which shows how their life at sea has affected their appearances. Each pirate was made up to look unkempt and terrifying to show how pirates would not have the same luxuries as the upper classes. Elizabeth's character was cleaner in appearance and wore a more elaborate dress than those of the pirates.<br/><br/>This film is full of symbolism and historical backgrounds such as the Black Pearl and the formation of the East India Trading Company. The East India Trading Company was against piracy and all for taxing shipping ports to gain profit from anyone sailing the seas. The Black Pearl, according to Captain Jack Sparrow, symbolizes freedom and his ability to sail the seas without feeling confined to any order or law. A ship has many different parts, but when they are as a whole, they form a liberating method of transportation, which actually becomes a way of life. Piracy becomes more of a culture than a history of rebellious sailors. <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the most accurate depiction of historical piracy that has ever been shown in any film. It shows the nature of piracy at its finest and at its worst while adding a mythological twist to it. The cast, costumes, lighting, symbols and plot all come together to create this fantastic movie about pirates and fighting for that in which they believe. I highly recommend seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."
"DavidSim240183","6","1","3","15 September 2008"," Pirates of the Caribbean a classic?...Yo Ho Ho!
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was the surprise success story of 2003. Pirate films have not fared too well on screen over the past 30 years or so. It was a film that took its inspiration from a theme park ride (which is pretty crass self-promotion if you really think about it). And the star was Johnny Depp, an actor who, up until that point had avoided big-budget extravaganzas in favour of edgier material. In spite of the odds stacked against it, it made a splash at the box-office and was quickly hailed as a modern classic.<br/><br/>I've always felt the Pirates of the Caribbean films are rather overrated. Pt 1 has an easy appeal and is not an unlikable film. But its not quite the barnstorming swashbuckler that people make it out to be. The sequels only upped the scale and wound up being capsized by it. Still, at least Pt 1 is straightforward. Its no classic, but at least you can keep track of the story. Something that could not be said for the sequels.<br/><br/>I think with POTC, Disney were trying to make a pirate equivalent of The Princess Bride. An adventure story on the one hand, with a whole level of knowing humour on the other. Where it takes all the expected clich√©s and wittily subverts them. When this is done right, you can produce a very entertaining experience. TPB is the undisputed champion in the field. And the same was done with Westerns in the excellent and very underrated TV series The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.<br/><br/>But POTC is not on they're level. It feels amusing more than it feels funny. And its also much too long. Clocking in at just over two hours, it lacks the snappy pace and perfect running times of the above examples. Something that only got worse as the sequels went on. Still, Pt 1 does have its moments. The jokey tone of the film is established as soon as we get our first glimpse of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Its a very funny scene. Jack is standing on the crow's nest of his ship, purposefully looking out to sea. Then the camera pulls back to reveal that's all that's left of it. And just as the ship is about to go under, Jack casually steps off onto the dock of the nearest port. Its a scene that makes you think this is going to do for the pirate genre what The Princess Bride did for fairy tales. Its all the more disappointing then that the best gag in the film comes right at the beginning.<br/><br/>Nothing else in the movie quite matches the hilarity of that scene. It so perfectly captures the balance between straight-faced adventuring and tongue-in-cheek humour. But nowhere else in POTC does it achieve the same level of success. Gore Verbinski directs it all with high-octane energy, throwing in everything you'd expect. Swordfights, battles, romance.<br/><br/>But the plot has a thinness that the film never really escapes from. I think the problem may be that since its genesis is in a theme park ride, the writers have had to construct a scenario while working within very narrow margins. Certainly it never opens itself out to the possibilities or sharp deconstructions that come with the genre. Not like William Goldman and Rob Reiner's treatment of The Princess Bride.<br/><br/>Where the film is more successful is in its casting. And Pirates of the Caribbean has a fine one. Johnny Depp expectedly rises to the occasion, putting his own unique stamp on the part. There has never been a pirate like Captain Jack Sparrow. And there never will be again. Depp's inspiration for the part was Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones because he thought pirates were the rock stars of the high seas. With a Keith Richards slur, a drunken swagger, and a fey flailing of his hands, Depp cuts and thrusts away with the entire movie.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom, in his first role away from The Lord of the Rings does just fine as Will Turner, the simple blacksmith out to rescue his lady love. Equally up to the action and dramatic scenes, this young man is one of Hollywood's rising stars. The exquisitely radiant Keira Knightley is wonderful as the spirited Elizabeth Swann. She brings a refreshing injection of modernity to the old clich√© of the damsel in distress. And you mustn't miss Geoffrey Rush as the vile Captain Barbossa. He throws himself into the part with real theatrical gusto. A villain you just love to hate.<br/><br/>Aside from Johnny Depp's performance, what makes POTC rather unique among the genre is the inclusion of a fantastical element. Barbossa's crew of pirates are under a curse, and are really the undead. Like the pirate genre has been crossbred with The Evil Dead. Gives a whole new meaning to skeleton crew! Its never quite as scary as it should be (this is a Disney film after all), but its a nice spark of originality in an otherwise very traditional movie. The CGI effects are really excellent here, even if such effects do seem somewhat out of place in a pirate movie.<br/><br/>The script thrusts and parries its way to a surprisingly low-key ending. What should have been an epic battle at the end feels disappointingly lacklustre. And sadly, I'm afraid that is much of the problem with Pirates of the Caribbean. It never really goes for it with full wind in its sails. Its a pleasant film when its on, but it never wittily deconstructs itself like you imagine the writers intended. Its better then its sequels, but where it should have been a grand, high seas adventure, it sadly never gets out of the harbour."
"suzy-60","9","1","3","30 May 2007"," The movie that revived the swashbuckler!
","Somewhere inside this movie is a rather pedestrian summer swashbuckler about two strait-laced earnest lovers fighting for happiness. But with a bunch of talented screenwriters and the movie's real star, Johnny Depp in a now-legendary performance as lovable scoundrel Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie became something else. We had the strait-laced lovers, properly yearning from a distance. Then--wow--Captain Jack, and then BOOM! The Undead! Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa putting in a performance almost as wonderful as Depp's, purring his way through the delightful, witty dialogue. Jack Davenport putting in an oddly sympathetic performance as the requisite Navy stuffed-shirt (who became a full-blown heartthrob in the sequel). Kiera Knightley in the role that made her famous as the Governor's pretty young daughter, and Orlando Bloom, who hadn't yet learned how to act yet was fine as the earnest, smitten, puppyish, chivalrous, thoroughly decent and rather square Will Turner.<br/><br/>Like all movies, this has a few problems, from Bloom's stiff acting to the end battle, which goes on repetitively for about ten minutes too long; but Captain Jack and Barbossa are always somewhere ready to save the day. The subsequent sequels (which I love) can never be exactly the same as this one; Captain Jack wasn't as astonishing the second time around and Elizabeth became rapidly more clich√©d as an action chick. The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie has become bigger and yet more legendary in the light of its sequels; and while the ""Good or not?"" argument will go on for many years concerning them, this first movie will always have a place in every heart that secretly enjoys a pirate tale."
"Hancock_the_Superb","7","1","3","18 February 2007"," Excellent, if overlong, action film driven by Depp and Rush
","In Bermuda circa 1700, Port Royal comes under attack from a gang of vicious pirates led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). During the attack, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the feisty young daughter of the Governor (Jonathan Pryce), is kidnapped by the pirates. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith (and pirate's son) who is in love with Elizabeth, enlists the help of shifty pirate ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), whose ship, ""The Black Pearl"", had been lost to Barbossa during a mutiny. However, Barbossa's men are no longer mere pirates - instead, they have been transformed into undead zombie pirates who need the blood of Will (or, so they think, Elizabeth) to break the curse.<br/><br/>The main reason why ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was so popular is simple. Take away Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, the action, the effects, everything - even Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush - and consider the simple fact that no one expected this film to be any good. It was based on a Disney theme park ride (a formula that had been unsuccessful before, see ""The Country Bears"") and had, to be frank, a ridiculous plot. This movie seemed likely to die a quick death at the box office, get torn apart by critics, and be forgotten. However, the film went on to be an astonishing box-office hit and pop culture phenomenon. In the aftermath of the mediocre sequel it's easy to forget how refreshing the movie seemed when it first came out - full of rousing action, great special effects, stirring music, a wonderfully written script, and of course brilliantly over-the-top performances by Depp and Rush.<br/><br/>Really, this movie does not bear in-depth analysis. There aren't any themes running through it; it's just a fun, unpretentious action film. Or at least it tries to be; the movie is about twenty minutes too long, with a climax that drags on forever (and seems arbitrary in light of the sequel). But that's a fairly minor complaint, when the 120 minutes before it were so entertaining.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is a wonderfully entertaining character. In the second movie, he will have worn out his welcome (at least for this reviewer), but here he's amazing. Campy, drunken, profane, and ceaselessly witty, it's easy to see why Jack has become such a immensely popular character. While ostensibly based on Keith Richards, Jack reminds me at least of Eli Wallach's Tuco from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" - a lovable, double-crossing rogue who is turns likable and hate-able. Depp gives simply a marvelous performance, and transforms a character who, on paper, was likely not much into something wonderful.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush, one of my favorite living actors, is a perfect counterpart as Barbossa. Rush, who can be a restrained and subtle performer (""Shine"", ""Elizabeth""), goes way over-the-top here. But in a film like this - and especially with someone like Depp's Sparrow as your rival - over-the-top is the only way to go, and Rush executes his role with relish. Barbossa is a surprisingly sympathetic character; one feels for his anguish at the curse, even though he is ostensibly a villain, and Rush should get credit for being able to convey this as well.<br/><br/>The histrionic sparring of the two above actors does, unfortunately, overshadow most of the supporting cast. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are just not good actors, I'm sorry to say, but they are able to handle their parts with admirable aplomb - even though they are blown off the screen by Depp and Rush. Jack Davenport, as Elizabeth's suitor Norrington, and Jonathan Pryce, as Governor Swann, give good, restrained performances that relegate them to the background. Among the rest of the supporting cast, Kevin McNalty as Gibbs, the sailor-turned-pirate and Jack's chief sidekick, is most memorable, bringing dignity and humor to his smallish role.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well-done, and the special effects, while not realistic, are frighteningly convincing (unlike the ridiculously overdone effects in ""Dead Man's Chest""). Elizabeth's discovery of just what Barbossa's pirates are is effectively done - it seems over-the-top but it works, helped immeasurably by Rush. The action scenes - particularly the climactic sword-fight between Jack and Barbossa - sometimes go on for too long, but most of them are so enthralling that you won't notice. The film doesn't lack for humor either, mostly through Sparrow's character.<br/><br/>Though a bit too long and contrived, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a fun, fun action movie that is worth watching again and again. It's easy to see why it was such a successful film, and this one (if not the sequels) will certainly be watched for years to come.<br/><br/>7/10"
"b-mclean6","7","1","3","19 January 2007"," Depp saves the day
","Pirates of the Caribbean is a nice 100-minute movie with an extra hour of inane plot twists thrown in - who edited this thing? Johnny Depp's performance is the one thing that makes this movie enjoyable throughout. Without Depp, Pirates is just another bad summer block-buster movie with too little plot and too much special effects trying to cover it up. I'm a bit amazed that the Oscars saw fit to nominate his performance - one of the boldest, riskiest acting jobs ever allowed in a summer release. I know all the accolades went to Sean Penn's overdone performance in Mystic River. But, I'd give the nod to Depp for single-handedly pulling this movie into the enjoyable category.<br/><br/>Afterword: Pirates II has come out, and the first hour is abysmal. Depp seems bored, and there's even less of a story than in Crrse of the Black Pearl. Barely worth renting."

Capitan Lechuck it's the perfect pirate and it's a ghost, and Guybrush was an awkward teenager whose sole ambition in life was to be a pirate.<br/><br/>I don't know, perhaps it's only my imagination, but I found very similarities."

I have seen this movie multiple times and can't get enough of it. The part that was my favorite was when Elizabeth Swan was trying to hide from two pirates and soon hides in a closet, and they find her and she demands parlay. Pirates of the Caribbean does move somewhat slow and is a bit over two hours. But it is worth the time watching, and when i went to the movies to see it I knew I wouldn't be wasting money on a ticket. I would call this a family movie, so watch this while you relax with your familey."

","I love pirate movies. I love Erroll Flynn type Pirate movies. This was a disappointment to me. I thought that Johnny Dep was a poor choice for the main character. I like Johnny Dep, but the portrayal of a pirate is a reach.... not at all believable. He seemed to soft to be a pirate, not rugged enough. There were some good scenes, but not the ones with Johnny Dep. If you are going to watch this movie don't expect a classic Pirate Movie, you will be disappointed. I have no real desire to see part two any time soon. I don't think the characters were developed enough and it felt like the movie is probably catering to the kids and not to adults. It had no historical value either and seemed to be done on a limited budget. Just not as good as all the hype."
"rparham","7","1","3","27 June 2006"," Go sailing with these Pirates
","At first announcement, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl sounded like a really bad idea to me. It was one of three films announced that would be adaptations (for lack of a better word) of rides or shows at Disneyland. The first was The Country Bears, which I skipped and the third was The Haunted Mansion, which was none too impressive. Pirates of the Caribbean had probably the best cast, headlined by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, and was produced by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I was still skeptical, but Pirates of the Caribbean proved to be better than it's pedigree would suggest. It is an entertaining, enjoyable romp, albeit a little overlong.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean focuses on young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith's apprentice who has a thing for, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) the daughter of the Governor of the British Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce). Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), a notorious pirate, arrives at Port Royal in search of the Black Pearl, a pirate ship he had previously been Captain of but had been deposed by a uprising led by the ship's first mate, Barbossa (Rush). Sparrow is captured by the local militia when the Pearl attacks the colony and makes off with Elizabeth. Sparrow strikes a deal with Will to help him track down the Pearl and save Elizabeth, but the crew of the Black Pearl are not exactly what they seem: they have stolen and spent Aztec gold, which came complete with a curse that has turned them into the walking dead, a fate they are attempting to reverse and Elizabeth has the last piece of gold they need.<br/><br/>Considering there is a dearth of good, old fashioned swashbuckling films in Hollywood today, Pirates of the Caribbean actually manages to be somewhat unique in the current entertainment climate. It, for the most part, lives up to the visual style you would expect from a pirate film, complete with elaborate sailing ships, down and dirty crew members, plenty of swordfights and cannon battles, not to mention the obligatory walking of the plank. However, director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot don't just deliver a standard pirate film, but one with a nice streak of comedy to it. Most of the humor is derived from the lead of Jack Sparrow. As portrayed by Depp, the master of cinematic eccentricity, Sparrow is a rather unusual pirate. Yes, he is self-serving and double-crossing, but he is also played with such a humorous air and a light touch by Depp as to become endearing. He also ensures that we aren't just looking at an actor using the role of a pirate to provide the usual moustache twirling. Jack isn't a hero, but he's not a villain either.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is an attractive enough film, no expense was spared in creating an environment that fits the material and when the action sequences kick in, they are engaging enough. However, this kind of film is still somewhat fluffy entertainment, not exactly the deepest of material, and Pirates of the Caribbean manages to overstay it's welcome a bit. The film runs 143 minutes, and eventually, it starts to feel like it. It never grinds to a complete halt, but it has no less than three points where it would seem to be reaching a conclusion and yet manages to keep going. This is the kind of film that needs to clock in well under two hours, not run two and half.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast acquits themselves well. Rush turns in a decent performance as the villainous Barbossa, Bloom is appropriately fresh-faced and yet defiant enough as Will and Keira Knightley manages to blend her good looks with fire as Elizabeth. The film also boasts some nice visual effects when the Black Pearl crew is exposed to moonlight, when they are revealed as walking skeletons.<br/><br/>All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean is a good, fun movie that is more than worth checking out, just don't be surprised if you start checking your watch a little late into the film."

Klaus Badelt's score is amazing. If you don't already own the CD for this movie, buy it. Though not quite a prodigy of Hans Zimmer, they often work together, and I know his style has been compared to Zimmers, but Badelt's style goes beyond Zimmer's in originality, and freshness, and the result is one of the best scores of all time, in my opinion. I do have to say, however, that I am disappointed to learn that Badelt will not be reprising his role as composer in the upcoming Pirate's films, and that sadly Zimmer has ousted him for that spot. I do not believe he will be able to do them justice."

","though it has been a long time since the release but i have already seen it for the seventh time. i think the movie was great and very entertaining. i also liked johnny dept in the movie. he was looking very cool and sexy as always.Orlando bloom and Rush was good.but i didn't like the acting of knightley, it was the only thing i didn't like. the story was basically good but i had to concentrate very hard to understand every single aspect of the movie. but the reason i rated the movie 10 out of 10 i because i thought that everybody's acting was good, and it was done according to the situation (the acting is supposed to be good when you have great actors like Rush and Depp).the whole set and settings was done accordingly. but the biggest applause goes to the pirates who did a wonderful job. they really looked like real pirates though i haven't seen one.the animation was very good though a little shaky. if i write too much, i might tell you guys the whole story. but fortunately i am not gonna. see ya."

","This was the best movie I have ever seen. The way they take the shots were wonderful. The way the actors just played each roll was like they were meant for the roll when the script was made. The first encounter of Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) and Johnny Depp (Captin Jack Sparrow) was brilliant how they had a conversation while one was fighting for his life against a pirate and the other was fighting to get out of the blacksmith shop and also to save his own life. I highly recommend this for anyone. I don't usually like action movies. After I watched this I fell in love with Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp so of course I had to watch Troy and Secret Window which I also enjoyed. I LOVE ORLANDO AND JOHNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","This movie is really an action-packed one. Johnny Depp plays the infamous Jack Sparrow, a pirate-gone-mad and is about the help Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to rescue the damsel in distress, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from the cursed Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his group of also-cursed pirates. Jack also wants to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl, from Barbossa's hands. It seems simple enough, but when you put it all together, plus CGI and a group of good actors, you'll get a surprise at this! It might sound like any other boring pirate movie where they try to pillage and plunder and save the girl and stuff, but it's not.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp really puts his heart into playing Jack Sparrow and is really good at the bad-yet-has-a-heart kinda character. His acting is what makes the audience laugh and leave the theatre content to have seen Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl. Orlando Bloom's acting was a little off but he's young and is up and coming. I personally preferred him playing Legolas in LOTR. Keira Knightley is also another with off-putting acting, but at that time, she was only a rising star, so you can't blame. Geoffrey Rush was well, a cursed pirate so there's not much to say about him. Just that he's good with his roles.<br/><br/>Overall, I think what impressed me most was the CGI and the storyline, because the acting was a little bleak. I would've given it a ten but I figured maybe it could use a bit of work. So it's a 9/10"

","What can be better than seeing a movie with Johnny Depp wearing makeup? NOTHING! Seriously, what a story. The first time seeing this movie, I felt it was too good to only receive the maximum of 3 out of 4 stars, and I still don't see why. First of all, the acting leaves you wishing you were in the shoes of a pirate yourself, whether you are on the good side or the bad. Personally, this was the performance of Johnny Depp's career, though he's had many, none were as recognizable or as fun to imitate as Captain Jack Sparrow. The cast is superb, the action is endless, and the comedy is more than funny. I feel this movie deserved to at least win ONE Academy Award. As for my nine out of ten rating, I've learned to accept the fact that 4 stars is the most and I've made a balance. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" leaves you dying to see the second."
"Samundsasha","10","1","3","27 May 2005"," It's a sensational swashbuckling success, savvy?
","Nowadays when I see the ""Walt Disney"" mark at the top of a film I think to myself, ""Oh no, another rubbishy soppy story with an ending like ones on Barney the Dinosaur."" You cannot deny it, Disney is letting us down. Or was letting us down UNTIL the launch of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".<br/><br/>You see, POTC is nothing like the usual Disney do-gooder rubbish that everybody finds incredibly tiring and sickening. It is comedy from the start. And, thankfully, the soppy lines are kept to a minimum. And you know what? They are TWENTY TIMES more effective than when they are thrown at you all the time. For instance, when Will (Bloom) and Elizabeth (Knightley) kiss at the end, its for the first time in the whole film and it makes it so sweet that everybody is wiping their eyes at the perfect love story.<br/><br/>The casting is superb as well and I'm not just talking about the big actors (Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, Kiera Knightley, Geoffrey Rush), the less well-known actors are top-notch. Who can forget the showdown between Jack Davenport's ""Commodore Norrington"" and Depp's ""CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow""? Or strange antics of Giles New and Angus Barnett's ""Murtogg"" and ""Mullroy"". And the extras do their job perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is well acted and extremely well directed. The Jerry Bruckheimer effects will wow you and the comedy will have you quoting the script for weeks to come.<br/><br/>A must-see for all the family! P.S. The extras on the DVD especially the Blooper Reel and the commentaries are a great source of entertainment."

In this day and age where cgi is so frequent that we've become a bit demystified to it , the films CG zombie pirates look fantastic.They so look real Its incredible .<br/><br/>My only gripe with potc is the surprising lack of black people in the movie.I mean, its called pirates of the Caribbean, not the pirates of europe ,you know? the Caribbean is and was made up of black people and i think that it was wrong to avoid that.<br/><br/>Apart from that flaw though , the film is an effortlessly fun and entertaining adventure.Who would of thought that id give a positive review to a movie based on a disneyland ride , eh ?"
"hersheyguy2112","10","1","3","24 February 2005"," A pirate schemes to regain his ship by helping a young man rescue his love from pirates.
","Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent movie. It shies away from the excessive violence, sex, and profanity so common in today's films to present a funny and exciting adventure about pirates. It is not a highly realistic story, but that is what gives it so much charm.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow leads the ideal pirate life, stealing and swindling instead of murdering. As a character, he is laid back and scarcely ever seems serious. He also has a seemingly never-ending supply of great lines. Jack's resourcefulness and wit are his greatest assets, and the ego he totes around is comical as well.<br/><br/>William Turner, blacksmith's apprentice, balances out the light-hearted Jack. Will is intense, focused, and dedicated. He has goals and he goes for them. Jack and Will are an amusing pair throughout the movie, especially when Will's intensity and seriousness are shot through by one of Jack's witty retorts.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Swan, the beauty of the picture, is by no means helpless. She is fearless and resourceful, witty and intelligent. Elizabeth seems to be more of a happy medium between Jack and Will, and complements the others quite well.<br/><br/>The effects are great, and this prevents the movie from taking a cheesy turn. While the accursed pirates may be a bit much for some of the younger kids, it is still a great family movie as it is clean and enjoyable for both kids and adults. It has action and adventure, with an exotic aura to it. The fight scenes, especially the sword duels, are well done.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie earns a 10 out of 10."

Choosing Johnny Depp for this role made the character perfect. I believe he's the most hilarious person you might ever see & his performance as Jack Sparrow was the most flawless & the most powerful work.<br/><br/>I've seen it so many times I can quote practically the whole movie start to finish & it never gets boring, mostly because Johnny Depp is so tremendous.It 'is' a family/kids movie & it is 'not' too scary, but you would enjoy it anyway, & if you wouldn't, i wouldn't argue, wouldn't call you stupid & would respect your opinion.

","The Black Pearl, a non-catchable ship, is legend to be ""crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil, that Hell itself spat him back out"".

Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp) and Will Turner(Bloom) go on a hunt to catch the Black Pearl in order to save Will's love interest, Elizabeth Swann(Knightley), whom the crew of the Pearl believe is the cure of their immortal curse. This movie is rather interesting. Even though Depp and Bloom are eye-candy, you can't help but love the movie. The special effects are fairly good.

"frogger612","9","1","3","28 November 2004"," 9/10 [with explanation]
","My rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Before the featured presentation of LotR: The Two Towers came on the screen, a preview for Pirates of the Caribbean aired. My first thought was 'Uggh.' I forgot about it for a few months, then read a few critics' reviews, which praised a movie so different from what the preview hinted at. I got interested, and decided to see what people were raving about. Then the next day, I went and saw it again...<br/><br/>Fun and adventurous, 'Pirates' was not at all what I expected from a pirate movie, yet it was exactly what a pirate movie should be: swashbuckling fun and adventure, a bit of violence, treasure, etc. Twisting humor, romance, violence, adventure, and fantasy into a fast and involving plot, the film keeps the audience's interest the entire film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp [CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow] carries the movie, complete with brilliantly ridiculous attire and movements reminiscent of Keith Richards. Depp adds most of the humor to 'Pirates' with memorable one-liners and speeches. Keira Knightley [Elizabeth Swann] played her part quite well, too. This was the first film of hers I'd seen and judged her performance as excellent, fitting into all the facets of her character. Orlando Bloom [Will Turner] was watched even closer by me, since I had recently seen his debut in the LotR trilogy. He acted up to par and accented Depp's character. Geoffrey Rush [Captain Barbossa] played the evil and clever 'bad guy' and brought the cunning ship captain to life.<br/><br/>One last aspect of this film captivated me-- the score. I can nearly hum the entire musical score from listening to the soundtrack too many times. The music is exciting and enthralling, pulling you into the action scenes and softening the deep tones for the romantic ones. In fact, that's one of the only times I've waited through the credits, just to here that final rendition of 'He's a Pirate'. Be sure to pay attention to the music--it will make your viewing that much more exciting.<br/><br/>All in all, 'Pirates' is a well-wrapped package of entertainment and adventure that will keep you spell-bound 'til the end. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!<br/><br/>--"
"selene_666","10","1","3","17 September 2004"," So many great aspects, you should see it many times.
","The first time I saw Pirates, like most other teenage girls, I went for Orlando Bloom. The second time I went for Johnny Depp's outrageous character Jack Sparrow and for the incredibly complex plot twists. The third time was for the rest of the characters. The most intriguing of these characters is Commodor Norrington. He is in a position, especially given that this is a Disney movie, for the audience to despise him: he is not evil, but he is the competing love interest for Orlando's girl. Yet Norrington is selfless, perceptive, and a strong leader. Unlike anyone else in this movie, he is everything he claims to be. I won't describe the plot twists here, but I will say that all of it was unpredictable and brilliant. The staging and the music impressed me as well, from Sparrow's majestic appearance, to the treasure cavern, to the heartstopping final gunshot."
"wildkitty","10","1","3","13 September 2004"," Absolutely great
","I expected this to be a drippy movie but then I broke down and rented it, now I own it. I laughed through it and was stunned at how similar Orlando Bloom looks like Errol Flynn in it. I loved the tongue-in-cheek humor. This movie is great and I hope there could be a couple of more sequels to it with the Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp and some of the others. I have some great story lines for sequels to this movie. This was humorous and was a great spoof on pirate movies. I have a full collection of Errol Flynn movies and this gets to sit with them as one of my favorites. Errol Flynn would have loved this movie as a man who was supposed to have had a fantastic sense of humor. The costuming, ships, and the special effects of changing them from men to skeletons was a very cleverly done."
"colonel_green","10","1","3","25 August 2004"," An epic adventure; my favourite film of 2003.
","The first time I saw ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" in theatres, in the summer of 2003, I knew that it was the first of many viewings.  I ended up seeing it four times in theatres, and I then acquired the DVD.  PotC is a truly great action-adventure film, perhaps the best pirate movie ever made (although that genre hasn't faired well of late). Johnny Depp does an iconic turn as Jack Sparrow, the bizarre anti-hero that captured the audience's imagination, and earned Depp an Oscar nomination (he should have won, if you asked me).  Sparrow is a truly unique creation, and he overshadows everything else in the film.  Doing his best to match Depp in scenery chewing is Geoffrey Rush, playing another of his memorable villains, Captain Barbossa.  Somewhat more subdued are Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, and the stunningly beautiful Keira Knightley (in the role that put her on the map).  Knightley is just about the only woman in the production, but she is a great screen presence; hopefully she will have a long career ahead of her. My favourite scene is the dinner scene onboard the Black Pearl, where Elizabeth sits down with Barbossa and he gives her food to eat; unable to enjoy the food himself, Barbossa draws an absurd amount of enjoyment from watching her eat and drink; he then follows it up with an excellent monologue, one of the most memorable film speeches I've ever seen. I give ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a 10/10."
"drsampath000","9","1","3","10 July 2004"," Not your ordinary pirate movie
","When one sees the cover of this, they might think, oh another bad pirate movie. But In pirates, the acting was good, the actors were good-looking, though Keira Knightley looks MUCH better with her hair down, the swordplay was realistic, the storyline was good, no plot holes. Disney went out of the PG section, which is good. This movie could be appreciated by all age groups, children will like the swordplay, older people will like the story. Don't get turned off because it is a Disney movie, it isn't too childish like too many of them are. They will be very successful if they step over the PG line more. I give it 9/10. Just hope the sequel doesn't mess up like too many sequels do."

Sometimes other Depp characters come across funny but I think that is his own little ""edge"" when acting. He has fun and it's contagious. Anyway, this time the character charmed us into loving him. <br/><br/>How can you not love this goofy pirate? <br/><br/>The film itself was done beautifully. The stunts and special effects were brilliant. Yes, it was a lot of fun, but then I always loved that ride at Disneyland best anyway... I guess I'm biased."
"hm25332","9","1","3","10 June 2004"," Almost shipwrecked...
","True to the tagline, I was blown out of the water by this film; for two reasons. I was more than a little afraid that ""Pirates"" would steer the same course as ""Cutthroat Island"". Which ended in a major shipwrecking, as I recall. <br/><br/>The good part is the actors are giving everything they got. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are playing the eye catchers (blame the scriptwriters) and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are clearly amusing themselves, which works contagious on the audience. In fact, Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow kinda reminds me of Mick Jagger. Same accent, same moves. <br/><br/>The story is the bad part of this film. In short: it drags too long. We could have done without an hour at least. The special effect are quite good and the sword fights are nice, but it takes the actors (especially Depp and Rush) to keep the boat from running on the rocks."

I could just imagine the swashbuckling hero battling the pirates and saving the fair maiden.  And sure enough, Disney delivered. I loved this movie.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this movie was: an actor.  Johnny Depp.  The man is a master.  Even with his slurred speech, matted hair, and half black/half gold teeth, I was amazed at how sexy a character can become when Johnny Depp is bringing him to life.  I have seen this film four times now, and every time I sit impatiently until Johnny first appears on his sinking ship.  Then I am glued to the screen for the rest of the film.  Now I'm not saying that the rest of the cast wasn't good.  Kiera Knightly was absolutely beautiful, and Orlando Bloom is as cute as he was in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  But I was just completely captivated by Johnny Depp in this film.  I can't think of any other actor that could have filled the shoes of Captain Jack Sparrow with such life and zeal.  So bravo, Johnny!  I can't wait for the sequel.<br/><br/>

However I was happy that at the end Will Turner tried to help Jack Sparrow escape. Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) is awesome in this movie. Although he looks really old in real life he is really great in the Pirates of the Caribbean. Jack Sparrow is really great and hilarious in this movie.

His role and acting were superb in the film. Definitely the best performance of the year. Orlando Bloom, while his performance was not as good as Depp's, was still a great supporting actor, and has the potential to become a bigger star with his upcoming films. Kiera Knightly puts forth a strong supporting role, and does perfectly in the sole female role (not counting Anamaria's). And Geoffrey Rush is one of the best villains I have seen on screen in a long time (with the exception of Gollum).

And I've not even got onto the delightful support actors and the jaw-dropping special effects!<br/><br/>Above all though, there is a strong story and script, with a perfect balance of humour, action and romance.<br/><br/>And the DVD is great too - very highly recommended - 10/10."
"kristian_t_r","10","1","3","17 April 2004"," Without a doubt, the best pirate movie of all time!
","This an absolutely excellent movie. It has humor and great action and is entertaining from the very beginning to the end. Johnny Depp's acting is fantastic. Some might say that they missed more of walking the plank in this movie. Well, then just remember that walking the plank is actually a quite made up story, very much brought to life by movie's like disneys Peter Pan. When the pirates actually managed to take a prisoner the did a lot more awful things then walking the plank. Torturing the people they managed to capture was the way the pirates entertained themselves. All in all this is just a geniously made movie, and deserves a 10 on the vote ranking."
"freakyfundevil","10","1","3","15 April 2004"," skill and talent made it wonderfull
","It was on of the best movies i saw in 2003. It was way beyond my imagination when i first saw the poster. Johnny Depp was to stunning for words and so were the others . I think Johnny Depp really deserves an award for his great acting skills.I loved the way the bad people were on the deck of the ship and were scaring Elizabeth Swann. My favorite line of the film was ""Not all treasures silver and gold mate ....."" and "" me I am dishonest............................"" both said by the very talented Jack sparrow that is Johnny Depp. The fighting was cool  and awsome . My family had a great time watching it especially my bro and me and i would really say this film is worth a watch. I really loved it, east or west Pirates of the Caribbean is the best."
"kadi1329","10","1","3","13 April 2004"," A swashbuckling joy for every fan of classic film
","It just goes to show, this movie was created to promote a ride, but it has turned out to be one of the best movies of 2003. Set around 1700, a ship of cursed pirates scour the oceans for a piece of Aztec gold to lift the curse. Their search leads them to Port Royal, a port town, home to the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Knightly) and her secret, blacksmith admirer, Will Turner (Bloom). The pirates, lead by the evil, Captain Barbossa (Rush), kidnap Elizabeth in an attempt to break the curse but when Turner finds out, he tries to save her by seeking assistance of the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp). The plot is pretty mediocre- the true sparkle of the film is Depp and the wonderful script. Johnny Depp's flamboyant Keith Richards impersonation is fabulous as Sparrow- probably his best role yet. Orlando Bloom is cringe-worthy as 'nerdy' Turner and portrays the character brilliantly- as does Keira Knightly who brings the feminine energy to the rather over masculine film. This is a film that could have easily sunk like the ships in it but it is ridiculously well casted and brilliantly directed. The script is Oscar-worthy, which could be down to Johnny Depp who made many adjustments to his lines. Full of charming, fun characters, convincing special effects, energetic action sequences and an array delightful accents, this film will transport you to sun, sea, sand and a swashbuckling masterpiece."
"jdkraus","10","1","3","17 April 2004"," Johnny Depp turned an OK film into a masterpiece swasbuckler!
","Johnny Depp brought the film ALIVE!!! I thought this film was a typical advenure shooting banging up, cutting up swas buckler. Ifn't wasn't for Johnny Depp, this film would not have done half as good. He should have won the best Actor award for this film, but had to lose to Sean Penn, because it was a Clint Eastwood film, and it was a drama. This film would fit well for all ages both kids and parents. However, the skeleton pirates look freaky like the dead in The Lord of the Rings Part III. This film should have also won best Make-up art for Johnny Depp. The only problem with this film was some corny bits, and some parts that should have been added. This film was an out of an ordinary swas buckler than Treasure Island or any other film. The action sequences were descent, the humor was non-stoppable from Johnny Depp, Orlando bloom was the real good guy hero, Geoffrey Rush was he hateful, and slow thinking villain, and the girl was a real hotty and cuty! this film is an honesty triumph over The Lord of the Rings Part III! It is ranked among the top five best movies of the year!"
"bekelleher","10","1","3","11 April 2004"," 2 words: Johnny Depp
","This movie is just plain, old-fashioned fun.  And Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush are the core of this film.  Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, try as they might are completely overrun by these two shining stars.  And we come back to Johnny Depp, he was nominated for an oscar for his role in this film and after seeing it you will understand why.  Johnny's traditional affinity for quirky roles is evident in this character of Jack Sparrow.  The eccentric, slightly drunk, incredibly dashing and mischievous Pirate Captain.  His fellow pirate in the movie and once friend, now rival Captain Barbossa is played to perfection by Geoffery Rush.  Rush also opts to not to play his character straight and it is to his credit.  I adore Rush, his comical character in ""Shakespeare in Love"" brings back fond memories.  The two pirates steal the show and Johnny the hearts of all the girls in the audience (provided that you like a lot of black eyeliner and dreadlocks on a man.)<br/><br/>The other characters pull off slightly dry and less intriguing roles with enough stuffing to hold the film together but not do much for it.  The film is wonderful to watch though.  It has an enticing and rather odd story line and how wonderful it is to watch Pirates sail the seven seas.  This is a movie that Hollywood has been dying to make for years and in it they have created a fun ride and a blockbuster."

It was a movie that balanced good acting (Johnny Depp was awesome, and Orlando Bloom was surprising), good action (any fan of fighting and war and adventure should see this), and sheer knee-slapping humor! Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) provided many one-liners and spur-of-the-moment quips that made me laugh my butt off....The skeletal pirates were well-done and the score was very fitting. I can't think of any flaws right off the bat, except that Tim Curry could've been a great addition! The movie is a tad on the longer side, but you won't notice, because you'll be so busy laughing and crying to the bumbling, dimwitted antics of the worst pirate you've ever heard of....but you HAVE heard of him!<br/><br/>I highly suggest this movie....10/10!"

","An intriguing pirate movie.  Johnny Depp's character (Cap. Jack Swallow) is exceptionally well fleshed-out and Johnny Depp plays it ""to the hilt."" The other characters in the movie are also well done and the plot line is complex enough to be interesting, but not too complicated as to be hard to follow.  The special effects are also impressive--it's easy to get ""lost at sea"" in this movie.  The movie succeeds in making pirates look clever and attractive, while the traditional British navy types leave something to be desired.  All-in-all, this is an enjoyable flick, but one that I wouldn't want my young grandsons to watch, as I don't think they would be able to follow the plot!"

","I thought this movie was great.  I loved all the twists and turns in the end.  It was a great feel good kind of movie.  It broke free of the usual Disney style.  But it did have exceptionell special effects.  And an extremely hot actor Johnny Depp,who plays Captain Jack Sparrow.  A drunken, rum lovin, tanned, hot, intelligent pirate.  Johnny Depp is definatly what made this movie so great.  NO other actor casted could have played the role of Jack Sparow as good as Depp.  I think his preformance was incredible. I loved him as Jack Sparow and as  his role as Mort Rainey in his latest movie ""Secret Window"".  All in all I believe that this movie deserves 10 out of 10 because of Johnny Depp the best looking actor in the entire world, oh, yes, plus the fact that the plot was intriging and so very interesting."

","I thoroughly enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean.  My Main reason I liked it is because it pulled me in.  The scenery, the characters and the story has made me want to find out more about pirates and the Caribbean.  Granted, I know this movie is not factual, but it has sparked my imagination.  It would had not have turned out the same if Johnny Depp portrayed his character any different.  This alone added so much to the movie.  All the characters were done well.  I just can't say enough about Pirates of the Caribbean.  It is definitely a movie I have watched over and over on a daily basis and still cannot get enough.  There is only one other movie I can say that about. It is a GREAT MOVIE!!"

","This is my favorite Disney movie ever.  I've watched it nearly one hundred times and haven't gotten sick of it yet.  Possibly because Johnny Depp is so hot that it's impossible to get tired of watching it.  Also, I have never seen a movie with so many twists and turns in the plot.  The plot was extremely well thought out.  I am interested though to see if the second Pirates of the Caribean movie can match up to the first.  I give this movie an 11 out of 10 because Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow was just so beleiveable and incredible.  No one,I mean no one could have played Jack Sparrow as good as Depp did.( he was made for that role)  He is just such an accomplished actor that has a natural talent in acting.  Johnny won the screen actors guild award for this movie  and was nominated for a golden globe and an oscar.  Although he lost out to Bill Murry and Sean Penn he will always be number one in my heart.  Because of this movie I became an even bigger fan of Disney and gained more respect for Disney.  I await the release of the sequil!!!"

","It's great to see a pirate movie again, especially SUCH a good one.  I love the old pirate movies (Captain Blood, one about Jean Lafette(sp)).  But they went out of fashion with fluff movies like Cutthroat Island.  Pirates is a comedy and has ghosts but it's got something that makes all that ok.  And I don't mean just cute stars either, but Orlando and johnny aren't hard on the eyes!  Also, Disney seems to have done some research since making Pocahontas, the ship in that cartoon was rigged so badly that a blind folded 5 year old could have done better. Hopefully the sequel will be well-thought out and not just an attempt to make money off the name."

"BriannaBee","9","1","3","3 March 2004"," Better than expected
","I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie because, quite honestly, I really did not expect to enjoy it at all.  Although not a classic piece of filmmaking, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played.  The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil.  Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.  This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie.  Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them.  Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long. That said, the movie is still surprisingly good and very entertaining."

His Captain Jack Sparrow is a surprisingly effective blend of Errol Flynn and Bugs Bunny that keeps the story moving with wit and adventure.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is strong, too and the story is well written. Geoffrey Rush is delightfully villainous as Barbarossa.  Kiera Knightley is the perfect heroine.  Orlando Bloom stands out as well.  The story has enough tension and excitement to keep you on edge to the end.<br/><br/>It's great to have good acting and a wonderful story in a family movie that can really be enjoyed by all ages.

","This was the most fun movie of 2003. The story was original and above average, a pleasant surprise for a story based loosely on a theme park entertainment. The ghost ship and crew was a nice touch, but the show remained essentially an old fashioned adventure story, enhanced by a really good production to make everything seem believable. It had a good pace and special effects, but the strongest thing in its favor was the really good acting. Johnny Depp put in a great performance to make his character amusingly eccentric and likable, but there were other fine cast members, such as Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom, not to mention some really knavish pirates."

What a SUPER film, and Depp is perfect  as Jack Sparrow. Everyone is wonderful, but the film belongs (as I wish the Best Actor Oscar would, but I don't trust Hollywood) to Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The combination of humour, action, romance, and ghostly pirates is quite a mix, and the plot moves along at a fine speed.<br/><br/>I really can't fault this film; it is SO good!"
"slash3r66","10","1","3","25 February 2004"," Depp deserves the Oscar
","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is one of my favorite films of 2003.  Johnny Depp deserves an oscar for the starring role, and owns the film from the time he hits the screen.  Great job all around, the film looks cool, and the special effects are flawless.<br/><br/>
Admittedly, when I first heard about PIRATES, the idea of a motion picture based on a Disney theme park ride seemed just plain asinine.  When I saw the trailer it seemed like it may work, but I wasn't totally convinced just yet. But when I saw the film in the theater, I was completely blown away. Now, having watched it again on DVD, it still holds up as one of the best of 2003.<br/><br/>
Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow is incredible.  He says that much of the persona was inspired by Keith Richards, either way it's an outstanding performance all through the film.  The mannerisms, gait, look, everything totally works.  Geoffrey Rush turns in a fine performance as Sparrow's nemesis Capt. Barbossa, and clearly loves this role.  The rest of the cast is totally solid, and there are also references to the Disney ride, which totally work in the context of the film.<br/><br/>
This movie is visually stunning, and the effects look flawless.  I actually preferred the look of the undead pirates in this film to the somewhat similar treatment that the army of the dead had in RETURN OF THE KING.<br/><br/>
If you have not seen PIRATES, by all means check it out.  It's a great popcorn movie that entertains without being condescending.  Cool to see Depp get the Oscar nom, and it would be even cooler to see him win.  Now that he's won the SAG award, it will be interesting to see what the Academy has to say."
"allanradman","10","1","3","28 February 2004"," Fantastic Voyage!
","A true classic!  The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle.  He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead.  He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself.  The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez.  With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after.  Well, not exactly like that but almost.  This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film.  Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie."

","I saw the previews for this movie in the theatres, but thought that watching it would probably lower my IQ somehow. When I heard that it was a summer hit, I scoffed thinking ""it figures."" But after a friend told me it's not that stupid and Johnny Depp gives a good performance, I rented it. I'm glad I did, since it's really fun, but not mind numbingly preposterous. Depp is stunning. Captain Jack just oozes charisma, and I eagerly awaited his return when he wasn't onscreen. I had no idea what this film was about, so the little twist was a complete shocker and quiet scary! I think Johnny Depp deserves the Oscar for his performance. Granted, the other guys gave powerful performances and what not. But Depp did too, and he took a lot of risks in his! None of the other nominees stole every scene of their respective movies. Also, their character portrayals were easily dictated by the script. But Depp created someone refreshing and new. The only thing I could say is that this movie is waaay too long. Three hours? And the fight scene in the cave had a few to many 'twists.' It didn't really need them. Oh well. It's still good over all. I'm glad that they are making a sequel."

","Arrr matey, it's about time these landlubbers made a good old-fashioned pirate movie! I for one felt the need for this kind of action and in my opinion, this movie is brilliant. Just the breath of fresh air you need after the usual gore fest in movies today. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a great achievement, successful in being both fun and thrilling at the same time. It's the kind of movie that you either love or hate, but for a fan of the genre, it's a true blessing and a must see. I haven't been so excited about a movie in a long time and I believe that we need more movies like it, because it appeals a lot to the kid inside everyone. We've all imagined ourselves sailing the seven seas, sword fighting with anyone that comes in our way. ""The curse of the Black Pearl"" really fires up your imagination and the special effects add to the great feeling of reality the movie gives you, as it takes you into a world long forgotten. Johnny Depp surprises with his role as a pirate captain and is probably one of the last actors you would expect to play such a part. Nevertheless, his performance is outstanding and I can't remember him being so witty in any other role he's played. In conclusion this is a movie you can really enjoy and something the movie industry forgot about, that certain something that makes the seventh art so great: a fun adventure. You'll feel like you're 12 again! I certainly hope there will be a sequel."
"Rocking DH","10","1","3","16 February 2004"," For those hard to hear lines....
","Re: The comment from the individual that could not understand the British accents and/or some lines with overlying sound effects.<br/><br/>I recently explored the DVD at great length, and was fascinated with the English captioned lines for the hearing impaired.  While not perfectly transcribed, they do help one understand lines that were yelled or screamed over cannon fire, wave sounds, etc.  For example, I heard Geoffrey Rush say, ""They're clubhauling"".  Had not heard this term in the movie theater.  The captioned edition really did fill in some details in the script."
"Rocking DH","10","1","3","16 February 2004"," Reminded me of Saturday AM matinees.
","I did not rush out and see this film.  I mean, it is based on a theme ride at Disneyland/World.  Ah, but that was my mistake.  I kept hearing good things about it and finally did see it.  I immediately found the sound track and also purchased the 2-disc DVD set when it was released. Johnny Depp has produced a masterful characterization in CAPT. Jack Sparrow, borrowing perhaps a bit from the barge gypsy in ""Chocolat"".<br/><br/>But Depp truly hones and defines the swash and the buckle in Jack Sparrow. I realize the film was released in Summer 2003 to probably help build concessions at the Disney Parks, and the Caribbean, islands, ships, and pirates are perhaps more conducive to summer movie audiences. But perhaps a slightly later release date might have helped the film garner more Oscar nominations.  I regret that the music and the costumes have not been nominated.  I am pleased that the Academy did single out Johnny Depp for a Best Actor nomination.  I realize his chances of winning are as great a long shot as Seabiscuit's were in his career, but I, for one, hope Mr. Depp wins. Captain Jack has a thrilling physical introduction in the film and his energy just goes on and on.  He has a single purpose and he keeps to it, manipulating the winds, waves, and folk that come his way.  Beautifully written and acted.  It is not often that a choice role combines with a commercially successful film to push an actor up into star range, but Captain Jack Sparrow has certainly done this for Mr. Depp. Mr.Bloom, Mr. Rush and Ms. Knightley are good support. Quite a romp with great swordsmanship. A really good crew assembled.  ""Yo ho!"""

","I saw this movie 4 times in the theater, and since I didn't have a DVD player when it was released for the home, I bought the VHS tape. Only to buy the DVD when I got a player for Christmas. I have not regretted any of the money I spent on this movie.<br/><br/>Yes, I feel Johnny Depp has been robbed of both the Golden Globe award, and the BAFTA, for Best Actor. No one else could have played this character with as much swish and buckle. Hopefully the Academy of Motion Pictures will find it in their hearts to be just and do the right thing.<br/><br/>The special effects were so well blended with the CGI. Seamless and smooth, the skeleton crew and swordfight between Jack and Barbossa awed and amazed me.<br/><br/>The script was witty and smart, never playing down to the audience and making us feel like idiots. These writers deserved to be nominated too.<br/><br/>And while I did notice some minor continuity faults for the most part, most of this stuff made sense through and through.<br/><br/>This is a movie worth seeing on the big screen at $9 a pop and worth buying at $25 a video. A must see, must own. And truly one of this summer's highlights."
"FizzyApple","10","1","3","10 February 2004"," I defintely suggest this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly great movie.
","This is the best movie I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot! Absolutely brilliant screenplay and acting, I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Johnny Depp creates an original personality for his character, Jack Sparrow, a pirate looking for revenge after the mutiny 10 years ago from his first mate, Captain Barbossa.  Geoffrey Rush gives Barbossa an amazing character, full of wickedness but also just that touch of pity and laughter.  When the pirates of the Black Pearl, Jack's old ship, attack Port Royal, they take the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), with them onto the ship.  Keira has definitely launched her career with this role as she displayed some wonderful acting.  Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, is determined to rescue her and teams up with Jack. Orlando has done it again - made a great movie even better.  But only Jack knows that a curse has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever.<br/><br/>I just absolutely adore this movie; it has everything - adventure, comedy, romance, action, you name it.  Not to mention impeccable casting, wonderful costume and makeup, astonishing props and scenes, and amazing music.

","I didn't expect this movie to be so funny before I got into the cinema. Johnny Depp's performance was marvellous. He made me laugh all the way from the beginning till the end. The script was nicely written and there are so many memorable quotes that still make me laugh whenever I read them. People are surprised of the 2004 Oscar nomination for Depp but not me. I think he deserves it and it's been such a long wait for such a talented actor like him. Of course I hope he wins but with strong contenders like Bill Murray and co.... okay, I still hope he wins. I'm glad they're planning to make a sequel but I hope the script is equally great as the original one. Can't wait til the sequel's out!"

","Having been disappointed many times by big blockbuster movies that, er, don't really hit the spot, I anticipated PoTC to be another movie to enjoy a bit then forget. It was, after all, branded as a goody-goody Disney movie with a bunch of heartthrobs casted in it. Big deal. How much can an undead pirate ensemble hold our attention and keep us in our seats?<br/><br/>Well.<br/><br/>Directed by 'The Ring' man Verbinski, produced by big time Bruckheimer, scripted by the writers of Shrek, and casted with eccentrics like the long-lost Depp, PoTC was a project that called upon an unusual combination of dedicated adventurers and artists who unabashedly engineered the movie to the extreme, purely for the audience's enjoyment. I mean, Johnny Depp with real gold teeth and eyeliner, and Geoffrey Rush with a pesky monkey on his shoulder?<br/><br/>And it's not just the big guys who did all the magic--watch out for those supporting characters and little details in the set that would keep you smiling.<br/><br/>Oh. And, I'm not the only one who has been surprised--and impressed. PoTC garnered FIVE Oscar nominations today, including a Best Actor nomination for Depp's, shall we say, savvy performance that won't be easy to forget. Trust the Academy on this.<br/><br/>And why was PoTC so great? Because the people behind the movie simply delivered their all, man. PoTC is romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and horror, all in one package, perfect for the cynical, the innocent, and those in between."

It proves that with an excellent director and an even more excellent cast, one can make a movie that keeps one on the edge of their seat. This film may start out unusual but once the burning ship scene appears, the movie is a non-stop roller coaster ride. It might slow down, but only to allow you to catch your breath for the next swash buckling scene. I truly hope that the sequel is as good. There is the possibility of Barbossa returning under the curse of Cortez. The end of the closing title shows the monkey pulling a medallion from the chest of Cortez and turning cursed. Drop the medallion on Barbossa and guess who is back. There is the possibility."

And a great part of it is that the actors maintain great character and bring humor into the story. Johnny Depp is without a doubt at his best in this film, and most definetly delivers an award-winning portrayal as the adventurous, swave, and disillusioned Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley, along with others, light the screen also. However, in the end it is Depp who bedazzles the viewer. A great movie to rent and watch with others.

"kwongers","10","1","3","19 January 2004"," my favorite movie of 2003 - entertaining, lovely
","Undoubtedly one of the most entertaining, fun, rousing, and exciting adventure-movies of the year, `Pirates' is far better than you think it is. Basically, it is about a pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who teams with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to rescue a maiden Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and seize back `The Black Pearl,' now captained by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).  The exact plot is rather difficult to explain but not difficult to understand.  Even though it is based on a Disneyland ride and produced by Jerry `Kaboom!' Bruckheimer, `Pirates' succeeds because it's so full of charm, humor, wit, and absolutely terrific ensemble acting. <br/><br/>
Almost every single existing review of this movie commends Johnny Depp for his funny, original, and wacky take on Captain Jack Sparrow.  And that commendation is well deserved; Depp looks like he's having a lot of fun and he's inviting the audience to share it.  His numerous and hilarious facial expressions are worth the price of admission alone!  (He truly is one of the most talented and under-appreciated actors of today√Ç‚Ä¶he is totally awesome; I can't say enough good things about him.)  Because Depp steals every single scene he is in, many critics haven't left room to write about a number of other really terrific performances in the movie.  Geoffrey Rush is funny, over-the-top, and pitch-perfect as Captain Barbossa.  There is one scene where Rush shines more radiantly than anyone else on the cast: when he is forcing Elizabeth and Captain Jack to walk the plank, Rush har-har-hars and swishes his sword and also has the funniest facial expressions.  I also enjoyed the performance of Jack Davenport, as Commodore Norrington; he provided the perfect counterpart of the craziness of Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa.  `Pirates' is clearly focused on character acting, which the director and screenwriters have obviously held to be of more importance than explosions and cannons and skewering of people (although there is lots of that too).  <br/><br/>To comment (to PRAISE, actually) on a few other things, I think the screenwriters did a fine job of mixing wit and humor into almost every single line of this movie.  Captain Jack and Barbossa clearly have the best lines and I can't remember a time where I laughed more in a movie.  Also, the violence is tame and rather harmless; I appreciated that.  There is nothing too graphic.  The visual imagery is absolutely superb and the set design is fantastic; the costumes (especially the pirates costumes) were genuine-looking and looked really well on the actors.  It's total eye-candy. And lastly, I can't say enough good things about the music.  Klaus Bedelt's score is heroic, bold, and entirely memorable.  The music accompanied the movie perfectly but still sounds perfectly marvelous even without the movie. <br/><br/>Everyone involved in the `Pirates' production ought to be incredibly proud for bringing such a magnificent adventure to the big screen.  I can't wait until the sequel!  `Pirates' is definitely my favorite movie of 2003."
"travisimo","10","1","3","18 January 2004"," An E-Ticket Movie
","After working on an internship at Disney World and becoming a devoted Disney fan, I was absolutely psyched for the Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  The only other movies that matched my excitement for Pirates were the new Star Wars movies, and let me tell you, Pirates did not disappoint!  I dragged my parents to see it during the first weekend and was a bit saddened when the experience was over.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to Christmas, and my ever-observant parents give me the DVD.  I watch it again, and it's just as good as before, if not better!  My only complaint from the first time I saw it was that the movie was a little long, but watching a second time, I was never bored or was never looking at my watch.<br/><br/>Every minute is jam packed full of action, humor, and excitement.  As so many people have noted, Johnny Depp absolutely steals the show.  I was a bit iffy when I first heard he was cast because of movies like From Hell and The Ninth Gate, but he has created one of the most memorable characters of all time.  His performance in this movie will be appreciated and enjoyed by people for years and years to come.<br/><br/>Along with Mr. Depp, the acting ensemble in this movie is quite good. Geoffrey Rush uses his Oscar clout in a great role as the evil Captain Barbossa.  His stature in this movie results in a very fun and formidable villain.  Orlando Bloom also does a good job as sort of a naive citizen who becomes a brave hero for the love of his life.  Which brings me to Keira Knightley who is just so H-O-T you can't take your eyes off her.  I think she is definitely going to have a very prestigious movie career as already indicated in the successful Love Actually.<br/><br/>So without making this review way too long, you can tell that I love this movie.  It's definitely one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  The special effects are great.  The story is smart and involving.  The acting and direction are phenomenal.  And most importantly, this movie is just fun, a main ingredient that most movies should strive for.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)"
"drobedeau","10","1","3","5 January 2004"," This is what movies should be like!!!
","Watching this movie was the most pleasant surprise that I've had in a movie theatre since I was dating... this movie reminded me so much of years gone by when movie making was based on great stories as well as great character development and excellent acting...these days, movie makers rely so much on special effects to cover the incredible shortcomings of modern day storytelling and talent... Mr. Depp and the others were perfect for their roles... and, even though the special effects were spectacular, they didn't seem to be the reason for the movie... other motion pictures of late seem to be made just because some guy sitting at his computer can do something amazing and have it look fairly real, to which they then build a story around... the effects in Pirates simply added to the movie... and the references to the Pirates amusement ride made the whole experience even more fun... I wish that more movies were like this one but, alas, after seeing the latest movie trailers, I'm saddened by the lack of talent that hits the silver screen"
"dsimpsons1","Null","1","3","4 January 2004"," Awesome!
","This movie was awesome!  I loved the old fashioned look of it all, the action, and the effects, but Johnny Depp made the movie.  It looked like he had a lot of fun in his role of Captain Jack Sparrow.  The effects were top notch and deserve the Oscar for FX.  It's been so long since a pirate movie has been entertaining and worth paying $8.50 for."

","Pirates of the Caribbean was, in fact, much better than I expected it to be. I was dragged to see it by some friends, and I have thanked them many times for making me come. Johnny Depp is awesome as Captain Jack Sparrow; in my opinion he steals the show. This is definitely a fun, swashbuckling adventure, which is exactly what Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer wanted. The DVD is one of the best of the year, as noted by myself along with various newspapers and magazines. The writing, especially for Captain Jack Sparrow's part, was clever. Citizen Kane it's not, but definitely one of my favorite movies of the year and probably one of my favorites ever!"
"djecatepec","9","1","3","12 January 2004"," Could have been better
","This is, as so many have already noted, a great pirate movie, in fact one of the best ever. But it could have been better, I think. I'm not exactly sure just how, but somehow. Perhaps because it was produced by Disney. It seemed to have some of that usual Disney ""insipidness"" that tends to take the edge off of otherwise excellent movies. Some kind of pandering to an unseen and irrelevant ""political correctness"". I don't know exactly. It is  great for kids, my 10 year old just loved every second, and when you have kids, that counts for everything. I personally enjoyed it, but I wouldn't sit through it again. (Unlike ""Return of the King,"" which I could sit through another 17 times, I'm sure!)"

"eamon-hennedy","10","1","3","6 January 2004"," BEST FILM ABOUT PIRATES...EVER!!!
","That's right. This is the best film about pirates and the high seas. Everything here works, this is the most perfect summer slice of blockbuster escapism that has emerged in a long time. High brow critics may bulk, but this is not meant to be a film that is all about characterization and emotion, it's meant to be fun, fun and fun and we get a lot of it.<br/><br/>
First of all, Johnny Depp is great. The surprising thing about it is, he seems well suited to being in a blockbuster film, more so that I thought before, and even more surprising is that his role as Jack Sparrow isn't the type that is taking advantage of his movie star good looks. Here is has dirty teeth, rag tag long hair and is playing basically a crook, but a lovable one of course. His performance is perfect, from his mannerisms, the slurred speech and the Keith Richards like accent, he should definitely be a favorite for the Golden Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy. The rest of the cast are well filled out too, with Orlando Bloom magnificent as the straight man Will Turner, Kiera Knightly is very lovely as the damsel in distress and finally Geoffrey Rush is great as the evil villain with a nice sideline in comedy.<br/><br/>The script is surprisingly witty here, but coming from the writers of Shrek, this isn't surprising. It's not high art, but the script is a wonderful adventure laced with magnificent humor. Gore Verbinski as director handled the material rather well, which is a surprise. As the director of The Ring and Mousehunt, I wasn't sure if he were the right choice to be doing this film, especially considering that it is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, but alas, I wouldn't be surprised after this effort if Verbinski joins Michael Bay and Tony Scott in the esteemed list of Bruckheimer directors.<br/><br/>Of course the special effects are brilliant also. The sequences involving the dastardly crew of the Black Pearl turning into skeletons (the CGI monkey is terrifically well realized) are amongst some of the best special effects of 2003, while the shot of all the pirates of the Black Pearl walking on the ocean floor is spine tingling.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fantastic film and ranks as one of the best blockbusters to have emerged from this decade so far."

"dandelion-1","10","1","3","1 January 2004"," Jack Sparrow, chameleon extrordinaire.
","I enjoyed the film in the theatre and the DVD  adds yet another layer to that enjoyment.<br/><br/>The background information reveals that the producer, director, writers, and actors were relatively relaxed, but thoroughly dedicated to creating a very entertaining story.  They were doubtless intimidated by the recent theatrical failures of the pirate genre, and that only spurred their dedication.  To our benefit.  <br/><br/>But the leading man and the writers were not completely trusted.<br/><br/>The deleted scenes are quite telling.  A number  of them illustrate Sparrow's more sober and somber and ruthless characteristics and reveal him to be an even more ambivalent character...perhaps more than the makers of the film could credit the audience with accepting....but what a fascinating character he is.  Hopefully, the sequels will allow Depp to fully inhabit this chameleon. I look forward to the possibilities."
"HarvSurf","10","1","3","23 December 2003"," Madness that way lies, matey, aharr Jim lad etc.
","This is the kind of movie we should be telling Hollywood to make.<br/><br/>Yes, it has big names in it. But they're also proper actors, not celebrity gurners (Willis) or a famous ass with celebrity baggage (J.Lo). Putting real actors at the heart of a daft summer flick like this results in the creation of uniquely appealing characters like Capn' Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Yes, it's got a huge budget and superb special effects. But they're there to serve the story and blend seamlessly with the action - not to replace story or character. (Are you listening, Wachowskis? Anyone care to greenlight LXG II? Thought not.)<br/><br/>Proof that there's life in the House of Mouse yet... Good gags, good characters, a few nasty shocks for the kiddies, and no bloody Phil Collins songs. Uncle Walt would be proud."
"ladywriter56","10","1","3","22 December 2003"," Worth seeing over and over!
","Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that has something for everyone - adventure, humor, romance, action, drama, even a bit of the supernatural. And all in just the right doses so that one doesn't overpower any of the others. The writing is wonderful - clever and articulate - and brought alive by a first rate cast. Keira Knightly was only 17 when this was filmed and her acting skills bring to mind Lauren Bacall at the same age. I must say, too, that POTC made a Johnny Depp fan out of me - it really does show what an amazing talent he possesses. Johnny Depp IS Captain Jack Sparrow, having stepped right into the persona of a pirate who is more comfortable on sea than on land. Ruthless in his quest to retrieve his beloved ship and stay ""afloat"", as it were, he keeps us guessing as to what really lies in his heart, what makes him tick. Half the fun of the movie - most of it really - comes from watching to see what he will do and say next. Yes, it's a long movie, but I really couldn't find a boring part in the whole thing - and I saw it six times when it was in the theatres! See it - you won't be disappointed."

Pirates should have just been  more on Captain Jack Sparrow and less on the sickly love birds. It doesn't add much to the story.<br/><br/>All in all, wonderful effects, brilliant dialogue... good movie. It is Disney. What a change."

This movie was an adventure.  One that you could go on again and again and again.  Every aspect of the movie was extremely entertaining. As soon as Johnny Depp enters, you know that there's gonna be a hell of a performance. And there was.  That guy can play anything and I really wouldn't mind if he played a pirate for the rest of his life!  His ability to put on almost any accent for any role is absolutely amazing.  He doesn't slip up even for a second. Orlando Bloom looked really good, Keira Knightley looked really pretty and this role suited her well. Geoffrey Rush was amazing, as always.

"xbabe82517","10","1","3","25 December 2003"," Excellent film, excellent performance by Johnny Depp.
","I didn't see this film at the cinema, but I really wish I had because it has instantly become one of my favourite movies of all time. I bought the DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie, and I've been to both Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland Florida and loved the Pirates ride at both of them. Having been on the ride, it's quite easy to spot many things in the movie that pay tribute to the ride, especially in the town scenes. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I definitely didn't expect to laugh so much! This movie has such a wonderful combination of excellent acting, astounding special effects, and dry humour. What I usually find with movies that contain a lot of special effects is that they rely largely on them to get ratings. That may work for some but not for me, and this movie impressed me so much because despite the effects being absolutely amazing - I can't fault them - they don't overshadow the characters. All the actors were brilliant, but Johnny Depp really surprised me because Jack Sparrow is unlike any character he's ever played before, yet he played it so fantastically. I just thought he had so much charm and wit, yet you can still see the genuine human emotions and can really feel for him when **SPOILER! SPOILER!** he is once again stranded on the desert island. There is also excellent chemistry between the lead characters, especially Jack Sparrow (Depp) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) even though **SPOILER! SPOILER!** Elizabeth is romantically involved with the other male lead character, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). I think this movie would have been successful without Johnny Depp, but his performance is exceptional and I personally think he made it what it is. His facial expressions, mannerisms and quirky comments are just hilarious and fascinating to watch. In my opinion, Depp should have an award for this performance. This is my favourite Disney film of all time, absolutely fantastic in every way. 10 out of 10!"
"FrauSeipi","10","1","3","22 December 2003"," I hated films about pirates - until that movie appeared
","Why hasn`t anybody chosen Johnny Depp for the role of a pirate before?? I hated pirate films until that movie came into the cinemas. Johnny plays Jack Sparrow brilliantly and I think Orlando Bloom is the best looking actor at the moment. I loved him in ""Lord of the Rings"" but I love him now as Will Turner. I hope there will be much more films with him in a leading role, he is an upcoming star!! I hope that there will be a second part and I don`t hate pirates anymore..."

"uds3","10","1","3","12 September 2003"," The ride's good.....the film's better!
","As has been correctly stated in piecemeal form, Bruckheimer simply got it all right with this one. He went back to basics, hired the best in the business and came up with pure escapist entertainment that works on every level. THE ROCK with an eye patch! Didn't hurt his cause either, that Johnny Depp handed in this once-in-a-career performance as Master Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow - part cockney, part Gilbert Grape, all Rock-Star - the most endearing rogue this side of the Jolly Roger! Geoffrey Rush's turn as Barbossa, a supernatural `Captain Hook' gone feral and swapping his parrot for an occasionally digitised monkey-with-attitude is given arguably his best role since Helfgott!  Bloom also does just that.Erroll Flynn coming along nicely! Meanwhile, the painfully corsetted Miss Knightley balances the film's romantic interest, Elizabeth Swann, beautifully - somewhere between Ripley and GI Jane.Toss in a truly great script that bridges the gulf so well between pirate chatter and teenage attention-span and you're looking at a seriously brilliant off the wall two and whatever hours of cornball whimsy that wouldn't put a harmful psychological dent in a five year old's psyche.<br/><br/>Depp  drops one-liners that are funny as all hell (`Stop putting holes in my ship'). The  production work, costuming, action sequences and set-design are cutting edge. What we have here is a multi-dimensional `lost-boys' loose in a candy shop. It's a buddy movie, a romantic comedy, an actioner and always at its heart,  tasteful family-orientated entertainment. Bruckheimer has tossed everyone's juvenile pirate fantasies into a blender and poured out this tribute to childhood memory and screen decency.<br/><br/>Great ending also that does justice to what preceded it.  Reminded me very much of another rollickingly good-time action-fest from Sam Raimi that co-incidentally was also top heavy with some seriously aggro skeletal miscreants - ARMY OF DARKNESS.  `Hail to the King  baby!'"
"jilla1","5","1","3","13 September 2003"," Huh?

Okay, the sets, costumes and cinematography were great, Johnny Depp was interesting (if confusing),and the action scenes were there but for some reason this movie never touched me.

"Coventry","7","1","3","9 September 2003"," A giant, thrilling roller coaster-ride, indeed
","To be totally honest...I didn't join the hype and the worldwide enthusiasm when this movie was first announced. I was actually worried when I saw the names of Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer listed together on one movie-poster ! I always looked at Johnny Depp as he is Hollywood's last ""rebel"" and seeing him in a big budget production ( like the average Bruckheimer film is) would mean we've lost him too. By ""rebel"" I mean that he chooses the roles he really WANTS to play. For himself or for his Hollywood friends ( like Tim Burton for example ) So, in that way, I'm glad to admit I was wrong. Johnny kept his own personal style and personality in this movie. The big money and the huge hype surely hasn't changed his way of film-making. <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is indeed on of the most enjoyable films coming from the last few years and a must see to everyone who likes an original and well made movie. But I wouldn't go so far to call it a masterpiece already. I even saw they've included this film in the list of ""250 best movies ever"" here on this website...That may be a bit soon, I guess. I prefer to await its status within a few years whether to include it or not.<br/><br/>But hey, no complaints from me neither... I saw it 3 times so far and loved every single viewing. Making a good movie about pirates is some sort of achievement to itself, actually. This topic seemed to be ""cursed"" to itself ( oh, sweet irony ) because the last attempts of telling a story about pirates all resulted in complete failures. Cuttroat Island by director Renny Harlin was a complete disaster and it messed up the career of Geena Davis. Even the brilliant director Roman Polanski didn't succeed in making an interesting movie about pirates when he tried it, back in 1986. Upcoming talent Gore Verbinski ( his version of the Ring was quite good as well) did succeed and I find this to be quite remarkable...especially when you consider the basic idea behind this film is a roller coaster-ride from Disney Wold.<br/><br/>Yes, Johnny Depp is great in it. I said it already and he got lots of praising all over the world for his role, so I think it's not necessary to mention him again. We all know Geoffrey Rush is an overtalented actor and Orlando Bloom is well on his way to build up a great career as well ( not many actors his age can say they starred in 4 of the biggest box office hits of all time, even though 3 of them are part of a trilogy ). I didn't know Keira Knightly yet but she looks cute. In general, I think we can say the acting is flawless. There are also enough fascinating plot twists and funny moments in Pirates of the Caribbean thus it's certainly recommended !! I'd already recommend it if it were  for the used language alone !! I love expressions like "" Ye'd be lost to Davey Jones' Locker"" and several other, typical sayings. But if you really think there's absolutely nothing negative to say about this film, I suggest you stop reading now because I do have a few minor comments on it. First of all there the CGI, I complain about this matter on most modern films, but that's because it bugs me so much. I'm still convinced it's possible to create a visual stunning film without the overuse of computer effects but this movie didn't try to do so. Maybe it's for the best, otherwise many (younger) fans wouldn't have liked it. And I do think this motion picture is a bit like its title...too long. I'm not saying it becomes boring but 145 minutes is a bit long to tell the story in my opinion. Furthermore...no remarks. Off you go...watch this film !!!"
"Neon_Saint","3","1","3","31 August 2003"," How can this be? This is like a bad dream. A Jerry Bruckheimer film on IMDB:s top 250 list?
","The first swordfight can sum up the whole movie. They jump on a board, one guy flies up in the air, he lands on the board again and the other one goes up. And the brain-dead audience laughs, they actually laugh - it's a sin against anyone who considers film an art form.<br/><br/>In the words of Tyler Durden, `Murder, crime, poverty-these thing don't concern me.' And his right, it should not concern us as much as Pirates of the Caribbean. Because crime and poverty is things a fraction of mankind have to deal with daily. Stupidity on the other hand is something that affects everyone living today. What should concern us is that a majority of mankind's new favourite movie is on an intellectual level of Teletubbies.<br/><br/>To actually criticize Pirates of the Caribbean through pointing out the lack of character development, the fact that every character and every scene is a clich√É¬© or the all-around dreadfulness of the script, is pointless. No one that can formulate an intelligent answer can deny it.<br/><br/>I would instead like to share with you an epiphany I have had pondering this movie. The question I asked myself was why people have so different experiences watching the same movie? The answer is simply that the child enjoying Teletubbies have a different level of understanding than the adult.<br/><br/>The same answer applies to why some people think movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean and A Knights Tale are `brilliant'. And thinks Citizen Kane and A Clockwork Orange are the worst movies ever made.<br/><br/>This doesn't seem like such a catastrophe, we are all different, we accept that and get along anyway. But it is a catastrophe to quality filmmaking, because money-grubbing filmmakers without a sense for art will use the same pre-build Hollywood-scripts and recycle the same garbage for generations.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's also a catastrophe for human intelligence. Not that a bad movie magically would drain the viewers IQ but it will in another way deprive the viewer from knowledge. Everything is a choice and through seeing a Jerry Bruckheimer flick instead of a Stanley Kubrick film the viewer loses an intellectual experience.<br/><br/>How the loss of quality art would affect the democratic system in the long run, which only chance of working at all is if the average voter has a reasonably high level of understanding, is not that hard to imagine."

"smartstrigz","9","1","3","10 July 2003"," Depp saves this unbearably long film
","If I had to tell you whether or not to see this movie in one sentence, I would say this:  Go see this movie purely because Johnny Depp is in it.<br/><br/>I know that that is what virtually everyone has been saying, but there is so much truth in it.  As my subject line says, the movie was decent.  It had action, a good plot, and good actors.  The script was not too awe inspiring, there were few (but very clever) funny lines, and the special effects were not as good as we've seen in other recent movies.  On top of that, the movie drags on for what seems like close to four hours (it actually runs about 2 and a half).  The movie drags on and on, and after a long day of work and other activities I was tempted to go home and get some sleep because it seemed like the movie would just never end.  However, one thing kept me watching: Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>He is absolutely brilliant in this film.  He stands heads and shoulders above everyone else in the cast.  His take on the role was completely original and the few funny moments that there are seem to always be led by onto the screen by him.  You just don't ever know how he's going to react to things next, and you never know exactly whats going through his mind.  From the minute he came sailing onto the screen you could tell that he would command this film, and indeed he did.  Even the ever rising Orlando Bloom (who I had a serious hard time not looking at him and thinking 'Legolas') was barely noticable when next to Depp.  <br/><br/>Besides Depp, the movie also scores points for its score.  It's not always something you think about when reviewing a movie, but the music in this film really fit perfectly with the action/adventure theme and gets you into the battle scenes.  <br/><br/>Overall, its an entertaining movie but one that will keep you checking your watch almost constantly.  The pace can be slow, and the lines cheesy, but its saving grace is Depp's astounding performance.  If for no other reason, go see it just to see Depp."
"Agent10","7","1","3","10 July 2003"," Certainly a fun movie to watch
","Johnny Depp saved this movie. There, that's all you need to know. POC was a pretty good film overall, with excellent production design worthy of any spectacular epic film. But it was one character that made this whole movie worth watching, Mr. Depp. I have to say, that without Depp, this movie would be tanking worse than Charlie's Angels 2 with an anvil attached to its foot. The eccentricities of his character Jack Sparrow provides such an energy to the film, you can't help not saying a good word about it. Every one of the characters were fairly hollow and boring, but Depp's portrayal of Sparrow provided a nexus for all of the other characters to feed off of. To say the least, this film was fairly entertaining, even if Orlando Bloom seemed completely out of his element. This is one of he few times I will say a movie was good mostly for its entertainment value. Rarely do pirate movies grace the landscape of overly expensive action movies and remakes, but this movie really hit the spot. Go to enjoy this film, because you might be surprised."

"Leofwine_draca","3","1","4","12 October 2016"," Massively overrated
","Generally I dislike pirate movies, especially Hollywood ones. In fact the majority of historical adventures made after the '60s aren't usually worth watching. But this film caused a big fuss in the cinema, everybody applauded Johnny Depp's performance, and it even featured cursed pirates who turn into skeletons in the moonlight. Sounded a bit like JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. So I watched it. I guess I should have been forewarned, knowing this was a Disney movie, but I went ahead with best intentions hoping to enjoy the whole thing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I didn't. This film is a mess. From the moment you first see Johnny Depp you realise what a misfire this is, a popcorn, brainless piece of trash specially geared towards teenage girls. It's a film where the female audience watches only because the ""hunky"" Orlando Bloom is in it. Sorry, girls; although he's pretty (although far too feminine) he can't act for peanuts. I want to see this guy get his teeth into some real material, like when Brad Pitt tore people's throats out in KALIFORNIA. Maybe then I'll respect him. For now he's just a wooden statue, torn loose after his part in LORD OF THE RINGS and already becoming typecast as a handsome but empty action vessel.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with the scenery or the special effects though. The skeleton pirates are great CGI creations but appear far too little. Plus this is a two hour film where nothing happens to further the slim plot for an hour or so. Try hard to stifle the yawns. The story is non-existent, the dialogue atrocious and even worse, clich√©d. It's all so predictable these days. The film is played as a comedy, but the jokes are lame and tired. In fact I hated them. The only mildly amusing thing is Mackenzie Crook's wooden eye. As for the action, it sucks. One of the first things you see is Depp sliding down a rope, that was tired when Kevin Costner did it back in WATERWORLD, now its just sad. The sword fight between Depp and Bloom is pathetic, no excitement or skill whatsoever. The action at the finale is also particularly bad and unappealing, with a bunch of characters you want to see die, a load of stupid sets, and more rubbish acting than you can shake a stick at.<br/><br/>Depp is atrocious ‚Äì how desperately did he need the money for this one? Usually Depp makes great choices in some great films. I loved him in FROM HELL and ED WOOD. Here, he acts so over-the-top and stoned all the time, it quickly becomes boring. This isn't acting, it's over-acting, and a disgraceful performance. You're not funny, Depp, so move your backside and make some good films again. Supposedly 'hot' Keira Knightley is also bland, looking like a million other young girls, pretty but nothing to distinguish her. As for the good actors: Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce are given absolutely NOTHING to work with, just standing around and looking good. Geoffrey Rush is also uninvolving as the chief villain, who does nothing very villainous, doesn't even kill anybody I don't think. Rush is poor here. Go back to making proper films! Definitely worth a miss, this one. Total rubbish from beginning to end with only a few good special effects to make it even a little worthwhile. Don't see it. Unless you're a teenage girl. With a crush on a made-up Johnny Depp. And Orlando Sodding Bloom."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the story of how Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) work together to rescue Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from the undead pirates that sail on the Black Pearl. Elizabeth is taken from her home when a group of pirates invades the town. She is taken to Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) after she invokes the right of parley. She wears a pirate's medallion that is linked to the curse placed on the crew of the Black Pearl after they stole the Aztec treasure. The medallion is the final piece of treasure, and they only need her blood to break the curse. However, she has taken this medallion from Will when he was a young boy, and it is his blood that they need. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl shows that protecting those you love gives you the courage to overcome the things that can cause one to be frightened. Nothing can stop a person from trying to protect someone they love. Will Turner is in love with Elizabeth and finds a way to rescue her from the pirates that took her. He was unable to get help from the Navy and the man that wishes to marry Elizabeth, so he breaks Jack out of the cell he was held in, and they work together to find the pirates and Elizabeth. I believe the central insight of the film is doing what has to be done for those you love. This theme is shown throughout the movie as Will finds Elizabeth and tells Barbossa that he is the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner and offers to trade his life for the release of Elizabeth. She returns the love of Will and makes a plan to burn all of the rum on the island she and Jack are stranded on. Her father and Commodore Norrington see the fire and rescue them. Elizabeth convinces them to look for Will. She realizes that she is in love with Will, and her father sees this as well. Throughout the film, the motif was used that showed Will had a love interest in Elizabeth. He would always call her Ms. Swann even though every time she told him to call her Elizabeth. Jack also pointed out that Will already had a love interest, and that was why he practiced so much with the swords that he made. The lighting used when Will and Elizabeth are together is also brighter and shows more connection between the two. The love that grew between Will and Elizabeth lead to them being able to save each other from the undead pirates that were looking for the last golden medallion. They were able to overcome the difficult obstacles that the pirates put in front of them and were able to use their love and passion to get others along the way to help them."

Johnny Depp is proof of point of someone who has absolutely no ability to act whatsoever due to having had no lessons in how to act and is the complete opposite of fully trained and yet he keeps getting work in front of someone who is fully trained! The rest of the cast did rather well with the dreadful script, the storyline was almost non-existent, and didn't do anything remotely new. If half of The scenes where buckles were swashed and cut the rest shorter there still would have been far more than enough swash buckling to suit everyone that went to see the film. At over two hours long half an hour could have been taken out and it still would have been far too long! Johnny Depp's English accent was....well....let's just say it was obvious that it was an American trying to speak in and with an English accent, unlike Kevin Costner when he did Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves! <br/><br/>There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING good about this generic pirate film. It had two story lines in it both of them having been told and shown countless times in far better ways numerous times before I wouldn't be at all surprised. OK so I Told a lie when I said there was absolutely nothing good about the film, as there was on thing good about it, the closing/end credits! Once they come on it means, thankfully, this extremely boring, exceedingly tedious film that has been stre-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-tched to as long as it can be can now be switched off!"
"Ziya90","6","1","4","16 February 2010"," A good, but overrated movie which was improved on all counts in the sequel
","The Curse of the Black Pearl was almost loved by many critics and according to some of them, it was a masterpiece. Then, why? You know, critics don't like such kind of movies, the movies which they call blockbusters, they underestimate such kind of movies and don't give high ratings. Even the sequel can be an example. As I see, they did not like the second movie as many people did not. Firstly, I want to say that I don't categorize movies as blockbuster and non blockbuster. What I am trying to say is that Curse of the Black Pearl has nothing different or unusual that would make even critics appreciated, instead, it was engrossing, entertaining, but a so so movie. Just another adventure movie. I slightly enjoyed it, it was entertaining, but mildly entertaining, so I cannot say a lot of fun here. I had expected much more by trailer. I think that I can tell my thoughts more clear above The King Arthur. Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie. I was entertained by The King Arthur, but just by some scenes, it was not uninteresting, it was engrossing, but no more than that. I had rented it, watched, was entertained, then gave it back. It was a so so movie, it was not a new Gladiator, it was not a new Excalibur. This first movie, Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie, if you ask me. It is an engrossing pirate movie with ghosts who look like flesh and blood, but turn into ghost by moonlight. Cool! As for Johnny Depp, one of my all time favorite actors, Jack Sparrow is remarkable, interesting, but he cannot even touch Jack Sparrow in Dead Man's Chest. In the sequel, this character is much more interesting, eccentric, colorful and funny. However, his performance in all The Pirates of the Caribbean movies is outstanding, especially in the second movie! Jack Sparrow hides a secret, it is unfolded at the last part, but it ruins the character, it kills the humor of the character. I was just disappointed, but not so important. Before the sequel was released, I had been sure that the second movie would surpass the first movie by far on all counts and I was not mistaken about it."
"freemantle_uk","7","1","4","13 April 2009"," The Pirate Blockbluster
","Unlike a lot of people, I thought the Pirates of the Caribbean series was okay, entertaining in place, but not great. Pirate films have a history of being flops, from Roman Polanski's Pirates to the biggest Blockbuster failure Cutthroat Island. Pirates of the Caribbean also has a filmy source material, a ride at Disneyworld (and the Florida version isn't that good). So the signs weren't good. However, the film is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer who has made a large number of blockbusters, had writers who were involved in successful films like Aladdin, the Mask of Zorro, Antz, Shrek and Colleratal, and staring Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>POTC is set in the 17th Century, set in the Caribbean (surprise surprise). Sailing from England to Port Royal, Jamaica, the young Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and her father, the Governor of the island (Jonathan Pryce) find a young boy, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) floating in the ocean. The film fast-forwards to when Elizabeth and Will are young adults, Elizabeth still the daughter of the governor and Will is a blacksmith. Will is in love with Elizabeth but doesn't do anything about it. However their world is rocked when Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) shows up. He saves Elizabeth from drowning before getting arrested by the British authorities. That night Port Royal is attacked by pirates from the Black Pearl, with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) leading them. Elizabeth is kidnapped and Jack and Will have to chase to save her.<br/><br/>Now the film is hokum, but that's acceptable. It is meant for a family entertainment. It also adds supernatural elements and it felt similar to the Mummy, even have similar action scenes. This film in the series has the simplest plot and has many humorous elements. The action is top-draw, mixing live-action and CGI, the whole series is known for it special effects and had an excellent score. The acting is hit and miss. Johnny Depp is entertaining as the drunken, distruthful Jack Sparrow. This is Johnny Depp's first blockbuster, in the past often rejecting big budget movies to work on smaller projects. Depp is a brilliant actor. Geoffrey Rush is an actor who added gravitas to project and makes an excellent villain; the films allows him to have some fun. Johnathan Pryce was underused in the film, but still made his character a good but indifferent being. Keira Knightley was okay, I don't mind her, she is very easy on the eye. Orlando Bloom is a bit wet and he has been type-casted since Lord of the Rings (he has been in Troy and Kingdom of Heaven). The film is too long and the story is not the best. It is filled with pirate clich√©s. Gore Verbinski is more comfortable with the action scenes then character development. Most of the humours comes from Jack Sparrow and often slapstick.<br/><br/>Basically the film is entertaining enough, 3 out of 5."
"nicholls_les","9","1","4","12 March 2009"," Great film, shame about the sequels
","This is a great film, full of action, romance and humour. I loved it and couldn't wait for the sequels ( I lived to wish I had missed them ) Johnny Depp creates one of movies great characters in jack Sparrow who really steals this film. All the supporting actors are good, even the smaller parts and the film seems much shorter than its 2 and a half hours. This film was so good that the awful, over special effected sequels have ruined what could have been a great series of films. The sequels should have concentrated more on Jack Sparrow and his humour instead of ridiculous and unbelievable characters that appeared in them. ( Davey Jones to name just one stupid invention )"
"aura772","10","1","4","16 July 2008"," Brilliant!
","I've seen this movie three or four times by now. I have enjoyed it every single time like it was the first. I watched it again today and it still amazes me.<br/><br/>The cast is incredible, Depp, Bloom and Knightley make a really entertaining team. Watching this film again, it made me realize that Orlando Bloom does have acting skills and he probably has a great career ahead of him. Keira Knightley was beautiful and delivers a good performance in The Curse of the Black Pearl. She was made to act and to shine, I cannot believe she was only seventeen in this movie, the age I am now. I believe she is a really good role model as well.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp... His name says everything. He's an amazing actor, always part of the best movies of the genre and one of the best entertainers of this millennium, probably. It's not his looks or his muscular body, or his youth (I was making a joke) that impresses us - it's the facial expressions and the body language. Jack Sparrow is a really good character and young kids, specially boys, everywhere will want Jack Sparrow backpacks and Jack Sparrow lunch boxes. But not only kids enjoy this movie, adults do too, Sparrow is also a complex character.<br/><br/>But those tree are not the only ones that impress, the rest of them are good also. Jack Davenport's Norrington and Jonathan Pryce's Governor Weatherby Swann are a good contrast to Will and Jack. Both amusing and amazing. Barbossa makes a nice villain in this film and Geoffrey Rush acted pretty good alongside Depp and the main cast.<br/><br/>The special effects are good, modern, it almost makes you forget you're just watching a movie. The story is relatively simple, the humor is really good, sometimes I wonder if this is a pirates parody movie, but then I realize that they're trying to create that perfect feeling that comes into your mind when you are thinking about pirates and adventure.<br/><br/>I don't know what more I can say since I'm not an expert. If you haven't seen this movie then what are you waiting for? Everybody has seen it!"

","One of the best live action Disney films of all time. Pirates of the Caribbean revived a dead movie genre with spectacular glory. Full of comedy, action, great story and character development and amazing CGI, it deserves to be in the film hall of fame, if there is one. The story revolves around the cursed treasure of Cortez, placed in a large chest on Isla De Muetre, an island that can only be found by those who know where it is. Anyway, a crew of pirates take the coins and become cursed skeletons. They need all the coins to free themselves of the curse, so they kidnap Keira Knightley from Port Royal to complete their goal. Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, teams up with swank pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to save her from Captain Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl. Hilarity, action and old-fashioned pirating follows with an amazing final battle. I give the film 9/10."

So, obviously I would like this, but, besides that, this movie has romance, action, adventure, a witty rum-obsessed captain (Jack), a brave hero (Will), and a not so distressed damsel (Elizabeth). There are also bad guys of course (Captain Barbosa), the undead skeleton pirates that Jack, Will, and Elizabeth have to defeat.Overall this film is a wonderful pirate movie that I love, but I wouldn't recommend watching the other two, although they somewhat summed up the story, they were not as good as the first one, which above all, has to be the best out of the three. <br/><br/>So, as I said, it is a great movie that I give 10 out of 10."

And supposedly, Elizabeth's blood can lift the curse as she beholds a medallion, one of 882.

Will and Elizabeth are in love.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow, played by the wonderful Johnny Depp, is along for the ride, in hopes for fetching back his beloved Black Pearl, who was stolen from him by Captain Barbossa.

","What a wonderful pirate movie! I loved every bit of it. This is a real treat for Disney fans. The performances was incredible and realistic, there are some superb actors and actresses in this movie, such as Johnny Depp, who plays the mighty yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow he will certainly blow the audience away with his action, humour and look!! Also the heroic and handsome Orlando Bloom, who plays Will Turner, he proves that he can shine no matter what with his personality and talents. As for Keira Knightley (who plays the beautiful governor's daughter in this movie)proved that she can play a grown up girl who is stuck in the 18th Century very well and probably her fans think so too. And Geoffrey Rush, who plays the evil and cunning Captain Barbossa, did very well and you can feel his emotions inside you and he can have you right at the edge of your seat. I think all of the actors and actresses did brilliantly in this movie and not to mention the makers of this movie, they have done an absolutely amazing job to produce such a enjoyable gripping pirate movie.<br/><br/>I loved the special effects in this movie - it made the movie more realistic than ever. Also I loved the idea of the plot, the mighty and charming Captain Jack Sparrow is back, this time the evil Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) stole Jack's ship, The Black Pearl. And later it attacks Port Royal and two pirates kidnapped the beautiful governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) saw Elizabeth get kidnapped and in an attempt to rescue her he joined forces with Jack. But a cursed treasure doomed Barbossa and his band of cursed men to live as undead forever and Will dosen't know that...<br/><br/>This is a perfect pirate movie mixed with humour, horror, mystery, adventure, love and sword fighting action."

","Jhonny Depp adds to his list of already enigmatic characters played probably the one he is most famous for playing - Captin Jack Sparrow , during the 2 hours of curse of the Black Pearl it was hard to think of anybody else who could pull it off as well as he did. The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of those summer time movies which you have to be in the mood to view and many years later finally... that mood had arrived for me. On the whole I was not left disappointed as it kept me hooked through its swash- buckling antics and I can see how the angles were curbed to keep this a good family film. The plot was fairly straight forward with our anti-hero pirate trying to recover his ship back whilst taking revenge on a group of super natural foes along with the entire naval fleet and the meeting a few characters along the way . The special affects were very good , not to mention the stunts and the sword play all brilliant although its never really taken to the level I had hoped for but hey again this is a family film!!! Jhonny Depp was the man who kept me in my seat , whether it be the action or the catchy one liners he makes it very apparent why he is one of the most versatile actors to have emerged onto the big screen. Orlando Bloom although I am not a fan of his he pulled his weight through out the film very well indeed UNLIKE in Troy where he was nothing short of an annoying pep-squeak and I really enjoyed Keira Knightley's performance through out the film (not just eye candy)and every body made full use of the scenery to the brilliant make-up and costumes really made it worth while. Too conclude The Curse of The Black Pearl is one of those films which are worth a check at on summer's day with your family or worth a rental if your looking for a bit of light action/fantasy I mean I may just be a little too old for Pirates now days and the action was not taken to the level I had hoped for but instead it was saved by brilliant performances all round. <br/><br/>THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL: 8.1 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>'You best start believing in ghost stories Miss Turner, after all your in one!' - Captin Barbossa (played by Geoffery Rush.)"

Geoffrey Rush boosts the wonder of storybook pirates to a level not seen since the original ""Treasure Island"". The Brit officers are great foils for Depp and the pirate crew is all that one could hope for. Great lines sprinkled throughout. Rush's response to the Lady's demand on pirate ethics is classic. ""..it was more of a guideline than a rule"". The old adage -always leave them laughing- was transgressed for me as the film went a tad long.

Little do they know, Barbossa along with his large crew, are under an ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither live, nor die.

This movie is a must-buy. The casting, acting, direction and cinematography/choreography were all almost flawless. The special effects were well-done. Disney's getting better at the CGIs. (Hooray.) You'll love it for the plot. It's safe to root for the underdog again. You'll love it for the characters. How sweet the attraction between the main characters. Great family movie. Pop a large bowl of popcorn, grab your drinks, and have fun. Much better than the ride at Disney.

Good vs. bad, love and the funniest pirate you probably ever is going to see.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp as (Captain) Jack Sparrow is not your everyday pirate, and some will probably still wonder what is he doing? Johnny does a great job and get every part of Jack to work so well. It makes me want more of that character. Orlando Bloom as Will is I my opinion good as well. Who else could be a little bad boy and still have some nerd-style over him? Keira Knighty as Elizabeth challenges the god girl question. Can you really be a god girl, like you have been your whole life in a pirate-world? Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is more dominated than the others characters, without make the other characters look small. That's a god balance between them all.

Some times you have to expect the unexpected, a twist in the plot right in the final scene. Why directors include such easter eggs? Maybe they expect that a film-goer like you should see the entire movie, his whole piece of art.

Johnny Depp never really caught my attention before this, but, since now, I have been waiting anxiously to see him reprise his role as captain Jack Sparrow.

But, luckily, this didn't detract from the movie too much.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean had a very original story line. Packed with witty, funny lines and very clever dialog, it never ceases to entertain. While I found some lines a little bit hard to understand, I thought it was very well done.<br/><br/>Last, the special effects were really amazing. When the pirates turned into their ghostly form, I found the skeleton effects incredibly real looking.

","In the fog at sea, a small boy, Will floats on a scrap plank. Picked up by the British Navy commanded by Governor Swann and Norrington, Will is taken into care by Elizabeth, Governor Swan's daughter. Elizabeth discovers that Will is a pirate carrying a gold trinket, yet keeps this secret. Eight years later, Norrinton is soon to be announced as Commodore Norrinton and reveal his love for Elizabeth. Will is a black smiths apprentice, with a hidden love for Elizabeth. Arriving at Port Royal on a sinking ship, pirate Captain Jack Sparrow is looking to commandeer a ship to continue his travels. When a phantom ship, the Black Pearl comes into port, commanded by Captain Barbossa, Jack, Will and Elizabeth become entangled in the Black Pearls cursed crew and their goal to lift the curse.<br/><br/>Strangely based upon a theme park ride at the Disney theme park, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an exciting adventure. For a long time, pirate movies have been a disappointing venture; its hard to say when a good pirate movie was. The genre was close to be non-existent. Director Gore Verbinski and screen writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have brought to pirate film into a new age and revitalised a very dwindling genre.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has all the standard elements of a pirate film; savvy characters, treasure, boat caught in thunderous storm, people walking the plank, but its the induction of the supernatural element that elevates Pirates of the Caribbean from just a standard pirate film. The cursed pirates turning into skeletons in the moonlight spins the whole notion of the genre. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have brought a real authentic element; the lingo and dialog, the pirate code, adds more realism and authenticity.<br/><br/>Really making Pirates of the Caribbean all the better is the character driving force it holds. The character are detailed and fleshed out; they are all so unique. The life of the film rests upon Johnny Depp, bringing his most memorable and best performance of his career; he is the most versatile actor of this age in cinema. Johnny as the miscreant Jack Sparrow, with all his blas√© idiosyncrasies, are impossible to turn away. Orlando Bloom at time over plays, with his love lorn looks, yet does a great act. As the beautiful damsel Elizabeth, Keira Knightley is wonderful. Making for an ultimate pirate, Geoffrey Rush is just flawless. He makes Barbossa so charismatic, with some tongue in cheek wit.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one swash buckling adventure and one of the best pirate films in such a very long time."
"PirateEvenstar","10","1","4","28 May 2006"," A little something for everybody...
","I did not want to start this comment off by saying that this is my favorite film. But it is. Yes, I know that period films may not be everyone's cup of tea, and Disney films aren't for everybody. But Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl offers so many unique things to such a wide array of viewers, that it makes it darn near impossible to see it as a typical ""Disney ride"" film. For one thing, you've got Johnny Depp. Oh, the many faces of Mr. Depp. To me, Johnny Depp can do no wrong. That's because there is NO wrong for him. He puts himself everywhere, in every part possible, every complex acting gig he can squeeze himself into. He's not afraid to be out there or wacky and crazy...Which is EXACTLY what the character of Jack Sparrow is. Yes, he presents most of the comedy and witty one-liners. But he's more than just the comic relief. He adds an unexpected depth to the story, and beckons viewers to take a closer look at him. As do all of the characters. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley presents a tame young lady on the verge of adulthood, who, when captured by the cursed pirates, unleashes a fierce fighter from deep within, very unlike any young women of her time. She grew up wanting to meet a pirate, and once she did, her life was thrown in a completely different direction. As an audience, we are expected to follow her journey, and we are also presented with an underlying theme of ""there's more to this than there seems"", and even characters like Knightley's Elizabeth Swann and Bloom's Will Turner offer prime examples of this theme. <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom's acting is often described on the POTC boards as ""wooden"" and ""lacking"", but I say no to all of it. His acting is exactly what the character calls for. Will Turner is supposed to be sure of himself and over-confident in the beginning, and throughout the movie he grows mentally and physically to be able to support and back up his confidence. As Orlando Bloom once described, it's like Will is wearing a corset in the beginning (mentally, of course), tight and restraining. But through the period of the film, it slowly unlaces and he can be himself more. <br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa is evil enough, and even to his character there are layers. There is method to his madness. He is angry because he is living in misery and the same discontented state he has been in because of the curse. He harbors a lust for what he cannot have and a desire towards how he wishes he could live. There is depth behind the harsh, seemingly-cruel exterior.<br/><br/>I think, in this sense, the plot and characters are held in a corset at the beginning, each piece held in firmly in it's place. But as the ""corset"" loosens, the pieces fall away, and come together how they want to be. Maybe not how they're meant to be, but how or where they have longed to be.<br/><br/>This movie has more than comedy and a bunch of swashbuckling pirates and action. Yes, it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, so you can expect some definite action on a grand scale, but the movie isn't just action. It's romance (between Will and Elizabeth), longing (from Barbossa and the crew), freedom (Jack's knowledge of it because of his ship), fighting (for what you truly believe in and where you are meant to be), and so much more. This is a film I believe everyone could enjoy. I mean, yeah, even if you hate it...You could always sit and make fun of it for the full 143 minutes. If you don't find yourself actually intrigued at some point, that is."

","Did someone actually get something right out there? Swashbuckling at its best. Excellent cast. Depp was as usual extraordinary in the role and it as a whole hit everything the current movie genres are missing. Good Story, good costumes, Great fun, even Keira Knightly couldn't spoil it if you ignored her acting and let her just look pretty. <br/><br/>Please lets not ruin this great story with a sequel of epic nastiness that taints the good name.

","I wasn't a real big fan of movies until my friend let me borrow this cause he didn't have a DVD player at the time. Wow was it good I mean everything seemed perfect all the pieces were in the puzzle were put into the right place the music the acting the directing the scenery it was gorgeous and loads of fun Pirates of the Carribbean was without questioning the best movie of 2003 (this and LOTR 3).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was the best choice for Jack Spareow being the reluctant and funny hero along with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley providing the movies romance also did great along side the legendary Depp. Geoffrey Rush whom I didn't know of till the release of this movie was a terrific villain.<br/><br/>The action was great awesome sword duels explosions at sea and the terrific element of fantasy makes this film an ultimate adventurous experience! The music was of perfect orchestration for this film. All this and with Gore Verbinski's slick directing it's so hard not to like this film. Can't wait till the second!"
"x_pri_x","10","1","4","16 May 2006"," One of the best movies i've ever seen!
","This movie is one of the best ones i have ever seen, in my top five along with movies like Shakespeare in love, sleepless in Seattle and ladder 49. Not only was Johnny Depp absolutely brilliant as Jack Sparrow, but he was irresistibly hot as well! The plot seemed unbelievable and slightly cartoony on first sight, but when it was transformed into a movie it developed into one of the most entertaining and engaging stories of the year, even my lifetime! Johnny Depp was hilarious as the eccentric Jack Sparrow, and i am looking forward A LOT to the second and third movies not only to watch two more wonderful plots unfold, but i can't wait to see Captain Jack Sparrow's cheeky smile again...and i can't wait to see him run like a chicken who lost control of his wings again either. The plot of this movie is complemented further by the compositions of Klaus Badelt, one of the first things i noticed while i was sitting in the cinema. The original score that the rest of the music was based upon was pure musical genius! Basically, Pirates of the Caribbean is Brilliant!"
"showgirl626","9","1","4","1 May 2006"," I love this movie! And Johnny, je t'aime beaucoup!
","Great action flick. I was quite surprised that Disney was behind this, and that they gave Depp such free reign. He is a marvelous actor, though, I love just about everything he's done.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Orlando Bloom have some more lines than he did in the LotR trilogy. And Geoffrey Rush...ah, Geoffrey...I love just about everything you do as well (Quills, though? What were you thinking?). Mr. Rush did such a great job, overshadowed only by Depp. What a great character he created in Captain Jack Sparrow. But he's created so many great characters.<br/><br/>Johnny? When are you going to team up with Morgan Freeman to do something? Now THAT would be a movie. But this one was great too. Pirates of the Caribbean? Two enthusiastic thumbs up, and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"ARTaylor","10","1","4","22 April 2006"," How Movies Should Be Made
","This is one of the most fantastic movies I have ever seen. Brilliantly done. This will be one movie that will be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>The story works. I ride the Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland all the time. It's so refreshing to see that they just didn't copy the ride story like Haunted Mansion did. It's original and doesn't feel like you're just going on the ride. They used parts of the ride but only when it fit into the story. They could have perfectly well made this story without the ride at all and it still would be good. The scene where Jack is in the prison and the others are trying to get the dog to come over is hilarious, if you've been on the ride. But it's not like the whole movie revolves around that dog. Just one of the subtle touches that people love.<br/><br/>I could go on forever on the acting. Every character is perfectly cast. But the two that I must point out is Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. While every single actor and actress does a good job, these two stand above the rest. Barbossa is no nonsense and completely threatening. A villain worthy of the ranks among Darth Vader, Sauron, and Hans Gruber. Jack Sparrow is . . . well he's different. Completely unique. Like none you've ever seen before. Depp plays him almost like Christopher Walken would. He does goofy things with all seriousness. He steals just about every scene he's in. And when those two characters meet it's like when Batman and Superman meet. Two great characters, great on their own and even better together. I just love the way they play off each other.<br/><br/>The CGI also terrific. It's not over the top like some movies tend to get. When they need CGI they use it but don't use it everywhere. Just the right amount. The most incredible scene is the Barbossa-Sparrow fight. The two go in and out of the moonlight, both turning into skeletons, and yet the CGI doesn't take away from the fight itself. The CGI use is so great you'd have to go through the movie frame by frame just to get it all. The CGI is just used to enhance the already good story.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is outstanding. The music never overwhelms the movie. It fits in perfectly. It's also a great soundtrack to listen to on it's own. It's one of my favorite CDs.<br/><br/>Now, no movie is without it's flaws. The rules for the curse seem to change. Like how exactly did Bootstrap Bill get out of the curse? Why does Barbossa die when he's shot before Will drops the coin? It seems that a movie of this size should have had such an important part of the story a little more defined. But unless you really stop and think about it or are just picky like that who cares. Also the last fight scene seems a little tacked on. They just had this huge climatic battle and then they decided to add just one more. It sort of seems like a pistol shot after a cannon blast. It is nice to see Will and Jack working together but after the previous fight it seems to drag the movie on longer than it needs to be. But the movie works anyways.<br/><br/>A great movie for everyone to enjoy. Go out and rent this, then go and buy it. You'll love it. A movie you'll never regret seeing."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of the greatest movies of all time! Johnny Depp gives his best performance in this humorous movie that was inspired by a Disneyland ride, though I didn't really see anything in common, except perhaps the treasure and ""dead men tell no tails"" bit. <br/><br/>*** Spoilers ahead***<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings trilogy) plays William Turner, a blacksmith/ future pirate. Although he says he never will be a pirate, he does some things that prove he is a good pirate. WARNING!

It is very nice to see a Disney film that is for older audiences. A very refreshing change for Disney. Disney has been very successful with this movie and I think the sequels that they are making for this film will be very successful as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, i'll talk about the movie now. This movie was a pleasure to watch. It had everything that makes a movie good. Humor, action, and violence. The action sequences in this film were very enjoyable to watch. My whole family watched this movie together and we all loved it! That's saying a lot because usually my parents hate these kinds of movies.

That is probably what makes this film so good there isn't just one genre there's several.

Jack sparrow is one incredible character hes always funny but serious its to hard to describe he has the most hilarious facial expressions all the time and is never scared but always 3 steps in front of everyone else.I have a friend who had never seen it because she said the previews scared her but i begged her into watching it and now thats all she talks about she bought the cereal she has a countdown for the second and shes just about as obsessed as i am my dance troupe has made our production dance pirates thats how incredibly awesome everything in this movie is!!!!! <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie you are missing something incredible !

","The music to this movie is very beautiful and greatly added to its success. It is both majestic and somber, but also exhilarating and intense. I was so impressed with the film score that I bought the soundtrack CD. The music is by fellow German Klaus Badelt a friend and contemporary of the excellent film composer Hans Zimmmer (Gladiator)....with numerous musical influences or references to Motzart and Beethoven and others throughout. I also hear the inspiration of another great pirate movie film composer named Eric Korngold who wrote the music to Captain Blood and many others that starred Errol Flynn. I only buy a film score if I feel that the music can stand on its own minus the film. Not all film scores can do this, but the movie music of the top film composers like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith do hold up quite well on their musical merits.I want our High School band director to do a corps-style marching show based on the music to Pirates of the Caibbean"
"ducatilvr27","9","1","4","14 December 2005"," Pirates Scores Big Booty at the Box Office!
","Inspired by Disneyland's classic ride, Pirates of the Caribbean is a film of lovable characters, an eerie underscore, and action-packed plot. The story runs a bit long and becomes slightly tedious to watch towards the end, yet a typical Disney happy-ending saves the day just in time for the viewers to walk away pleased with the movie and secretly wishing they were pirates themselves. <br/><br/>The film possesses all the classic characters and scenarios of a romantic Disney adventure, including the young, fate-seeking hero, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the comedic relief and clown, witty Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the uptight straight man, Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), and the ruthless villain, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Of course, let us not forget the leading lady, young miss Keira Knightley, playing the governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann.<br/><br/>Situated in the British, Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Swann wishes to live the life of a pirate and not a governor's daughter, while her admirer, the impoverished blacksmith, Will Turner, wishes to deny his own pirate roots. Once mischievous Sparrow enters the town with his agenda of rounding up a crew, stealing a British naval ship and retrieving his rights as captain of the Black Pearl pirate ship, havoc ensues. <br/><br/>The entrance of the damned Black Pearl's crew into Port Royal is quickly summoned by the last missing piece of treasure, which calls them when Swann falls into the water with it (a gold coin) wrapped around her neck. The pirates sac the town, stealing Swann and headed to return the treasure and break their curse. The chase is on, once Turner springs Sparrow from jail, for the ship and its desired possessions. And that's just the first 20 minutes of this event-filled 2 hour and 23 minute movie. The hero's luck runs out, but just when all hope is lost, Sparrow devises a plan to save his ship, get Will his girl and escape the grips of both the cursed pirates and dim-witted British navy. <br/><br/>Filled with an excellent cast and first-rate special effects, Pirates makes it easy to truthfully accept the unbelievably fantastical events of the film including sword fights, pirate ships on the open seas, cannon warfare, and caves of treasure. Director Gore Verbinski brings out the best of his actors, who enable the sometimes-cheesy script to flow smoothly and as convincing dialogue. Depp's typical ability to create a quirky and enchanting character is again fulfilled in his drunken pirate role. He brings out the character's bad luck but determined nature, making him the admirable good/bad guy. Depp's humorous line delivery and outstanding timing nicely accompany his scruff appearance, adorned with eyeliner, a bead-embellished wig, and braided goatee. <br/><br/>Rush also performs his role of the evil pirate convincingly and with his usual gifted acting talent. Bloom slips nicely into his usual typecast role as the love-driven romantic young lad, and his opposite, then seventeen-year-old, British actress, Knightley brings the adventurous, bold, and beautiful identity of Swann to life. <br/><br/>Though none of these characters exist in the Disney adventure ride, there are two similar scene's that lovers of the ride will recognize, one being the stop at pirate infested Tortuga Island. The storyline does become a bit boring and redundant, as the minutes turn to hours, creating the feeling of d√©j√† vu. Yet, the scheming scoundrel Jack Sparrow saves the day, and the audience's attention only to sacrifice himself to capture by the Royal Navy. Don't worry, though, it all ends well as a good Disney movie should. <br/><br/>Along with watching an action-packed, historical fantasy and obtaining some great new words to add to daily jargon, such as 'savvy' 'parlay' 'commandeer' and 'ecumenically,' I somehow feel more complete. And just when that sense of completeness fades, the sequel, promised by the title's saga specificity The Curse of the Black Pearl, will probably be in theatres."

"Antagonisten","8","1","4","15 February 2005"," Surprisingly entertaining
","A movie based on a ""ride from Disneyland"" or something like that. That was the first i ever heard about this movie. Not the best premise for a movie you might say. But i was very pleasantly surprised i must say.<br/><br/>The governors daughter gets kidnapped by pirates. Her love-interest and the famous captain Jack Sparrow both set out looking for her. Her love wants her, Sparrow wants the pirate ship.<br/><br/>Many have tried to live up to the matin√©-classics of old. Or not just them maybe, also more modern classics like the Indiana Jones-movies. But it seems the essence of the adventure-film is hard to capture, considering how many have failed. And the pirate genre especially seems to be treacherous ground. Just think about such catastrophes as ""Cutthroat Island"". Here though the tradition of adventure, and fun for the whole family, is picked up in an admirable way.<br/><br/>There are several elements that make this such a great experience. The acting is solid, especially from Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp who both seem to have a lot of fun here. Orlando Bloom is his rather stiff and bland self, even though it's less evident here than in most cases. Also this movie is very playful. It makes jokes at the genres expense, at almost everyones expense. And foremost it doesn't take itself very seriously. There is quite a bit of violence in the movie (it involves pirates after all), but it's all quite mild and it never disturbs the experience.<br/><br/>When it comes to family fun this is one of the best i've seen. Not that i'm a fan of the ""family"" genre, but still. And the older viewers can always stare at Keira Knightley, and maybe dream that we too could fence, sail and rescue ladies like her... Rating is 8/10 and very recommended!"

"Doylenf","Null","1","4","12 February 2004"," Piracy on the high seas never looked so good (on DVD)...
","Borrowing traditional elements from films like CAPTAIN BLOOD and THE SEA HAWK and many other '40 tales of piracy on the high seas, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN goes further than all the other pirate tales by adding strong bits of fantasy that give new meaning to the phrase ""a skeleton crew"".<br/><br/>
You'll see what I mean when you watch the moonlight scenes where the cursed pirates become shadows of their former selves--effects that are guaranteed to cop a nomination for the Best Special Effects Oscar. So too are the gorgeously detailed sets and costumes (all of which have an air of accuracy), as well as the make-up wizardry involved in turning these actors into reasonably convincing 17th Century pirates.<br/><br/>Standout among the performers, of course, is the central role as played by JOHNNY DEPP as the rogue pirate who teams with ORLANDO BLOOM (who looks like a young Errol Flynn here), a man with pirate blood himself. Their combined efforts to rescue a damsel in distress (nicely played by KEIRA KNIGHTLEY) and search for hidden treasure in a cave while fighting off the villain (GEOFFREY RUSH) is all done in almost comic book style and flair. Everyone seems cast to perfection.<br/><br/>Artistically, it's a stunning film to watch, especially on DVD where the images are richly detailed and the mammoth production costs are clearly evident in every frame. Beautifully photographed and with a busy background score that is reminiscent of the kind of rousing music that Erich Wolfgang Korngold composed for the swashbucklers of the past.<br/><br/>Summing up: A jolly good show!! A fun ride all the way.<br/><br/>Only drawback: its length. Could have been trimmed by at least twenty minutes of running time."
"Elswet","9","1","4","31 December 2003"," Striking visuals, adventurous story, amazing execution.
","After years of enjoyable viewing of 21 Jump Street, some of us did not need this movie to appreciate Johnny Depp's talents and abilities as an actor. But for the rest of the world, this was the springboard for Depp's movie career.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a hauntingly beautiful child singing of pirates on the misty bow of a ship. She is cautioned not to bring pirates down on them, by singing of them. Just after, a small boy is found floating on a piece of wreckage, and the young girl child immediately identifies him as a pirate, and hides his true nature/identity from her father the Governor and the captain of the ship upon which they sail.<br/><br/>You then fade to the same little girl as a grown woman (Keira Knightly), dreaming of the day when she first found her William (Orlando Bloom) adrift in the sea. She's hidden his treasure in a secret compartment beneath one of the drawers in her bedside cabinet, and obviously treasures it, as she does him.<br/><br/>The remainder of the movie, she attempts to find herself, discover whom she really is, and please her father at the same time. No easy task of ANY daughter.<br/><br/>William has since become an apprentice to the blacksmith of the small seaside village in which they reside. He has learned his lessons so well, in fact, that his master sleeps in a peaceful but drunken slumber all the day while Will masters the work sent to their forge.<br/><br/>These two are obviously in love, but Will knows his place, and refuses to be familiar with her in any way, in the presence of her father the Governor. Not quite the way to woo the lady's heart, there, Will.<br/><br/>Enters now, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), in a sinking water-filled schooner. He himself bears no small resemblance to a bilge-rat, as he rides the main mast of the sinking ship right up to the harbor of the same village in which Elizabeth and William reside; Port Royal.<br/><br/>His shenanigans will not be tolerated, as he soon learns, and he quickly finds himself in irons.<br/><br/>We discover that Captain Jack Sparrow was once the captain of the Black Pearl; the most feared pirate's ship to sail the Caribbean Sea. This ship is rumored to have black sails, be crewed by the damned, and captained by an evil darker than any other.<br/><br/>There has been some criticism of the vocabulary used by the pirates, but in reality, they did have quite the vocabulary. They had to trade in many different ports, using many different languages fluently in order to prevent themselves from being taken advantage of. These men were mostly self-educated, learning the hard way. And while most could not read and write, true enough, they could and would bargain with anyone which could uplift their situation.<br/><br/>They sought fame and riches. Having been heard of was akin to the gunslingers of the US Western days having wanted posters of themselves jealously secreted away within their own saddlebags. They lived by a strict code of ethics, and experienced a very unstable lifestyle; feasting one day, while enduring famine the next.<br/><br/>Also, the ""mascara"" some critics have criticized, was usually Kohl, used commonly by sea-farers of the time to block the sun out of their eyes, much like football players use black stick, today. It does create a rather dramatic look, but was a common technique used in the days of such men as these.<br/><br/>This story, while not wholly original, borrowed from every pirate movie I've ever seen, but uplifted and upgraded those old tales. It was extremely well told, convincingly executed, and brilliantly portrayed by Depp and Bloom. I've acquired a new respect for both of their work, of late, actually. And while this does not possess the epic qualities of some other recent productions, Bloom's talents were just as well exercised here as they were in his most recent success.<br/><br/>As for the wardrobe of the pirates, they were in the Caribbean; an exotic place, populated by people of colorful cultures. Their dress, while basically British, was properly colored by the islands in which they prowled.<br/><br/>Reportedly, having modeled his Jack Sparrow character closely after Keith Richards, Depp's flawless Cockney accent was quite believable and near perfect. He worked very hard on that portion of his character, as was obvious by his beautiful and colorfully wide use of the Cockney hyperbole. ""All by me onsie,"" meaning all by myself, and so on.<br/><br/>There was one element with which I had some qualms, however. That of the undead army. Having recently seen LotR: RotK, I could not help but compare the undead armies to one another, and found that this one was a tiny bit lacking. Their movements were sometimes choppy, hesitant, clumsy and not surreal as was Jackson's. These lacked the graceful, floating ghostly quality that was exhibited in Jackson's masterpiece. They ~looked~ real enough, but their movements were awkward and clumsy.<br/><br/>Other than that, I was completely delighted with this endeavor, and cannot wait to see the next installment of this franchise. I hope it is a long-running one.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" takes you on an adventure full with sword fights, explosions, bottles of rum and much humor.<br/><br/>This certainly is the most fun movie of the year (yet). It's an awesome ""feel good"" movie. The movie has a very high entertainment value, not only because of the fun story itself but also and mainly because of Johnny Depp. It has been said many times before and it will be said many times again but Depp is fantastic in this movie! His character introduction is priceless! But let's also not forget the perfectly casted Geoffrey Rush who also seemed to have lot's of fun making this movie.<br/><br/>The story is one big adventure and it has all the typical pirate adventure elements in it. Added to that there are the cursed ghost pirates and the British marine with as a result an even bigger adventure story. The movie is full with crazy and fun characters and there is some great dialog and much much comedy. In other words, how could you not like this movie?<br/><br/>The musical score is awesome, even though you can hear it was done in an hurry. The music uses lot's of elements from previous Media Venture scores such as ""Gladiator"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" but it just suits the movie very well and gives it an extra cool feeling.<br/><br/>Visually the movie looks simply amazing. The costumes are great and so are the sets. But even better are the special effects, the way the cursed pirates (and monkey) in the moonlight look is amazing.<br/><br/>The fights are cool, however I feel that it could have used some more wide shots instead of quick fast cuts. The final fight is amazing mainly because of the special effects where the characters change from their cursed look into their normal human look and back again time after time every time when they step into the moonlight.<br/><br/>No Oscar material, just great fun for everyone to watch over and over again! Also very recommendable if you like the ""Monkey Island"" games.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"stamper","8","1","4","14 August 2003"," Entertaining yet slightly shallow and formulatic summer blockbuster that only surprises in the acting department
","Pirates of the Caribbean is your traditional summer blockbuster: it has good special effects, a lot of action, a few pretty faces and not too much of a story. But that is not all. It was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which usually means that it is very high on the entertaining side and nothing more. Pirates of the Carribean fits that profile almost exactly. It is entertaining (although slightly longish when the cave is visited for the second time), that's for sure, but the makers of this film have succeeded in doing something that I had not yet seen in a summer flick of this magnitude (or maybe I have simply forgotten). They have chosen a cast, that was so superb on the one side, that it almost all of the other actors became mere puppets. Yes folks, I am talking about Johnny Depp. He is just amazing as Jack Sparrow. It is not that he is amazingly funny or something, but he just manages to surprise you over and over again. Then there is the accent and of course not to forget that strange way of movement he has throughout the film. Jack Sparrow might be quirky but he is not ¬ëin your face' quirky and that is something I also liked about that character. Johnny Depp ruled as Jack Sparrow and outshone all but one of his co-stars who became mere puppets in the ¬ëJack Sparrow Show'. The exception was (of course) Geoffrey Rush, who was very solid and did a good Job as Captain Barbossa. The rest of the cast, well I've said it and I'm not sorry for telling the truth: you acted decent, but in the presence of Mr.Depp you faded into the background.<br/><br/>
Concluding this review I'd have to say that the acting was the only surprising thing in this film. There are some typical one-liners which either fall flat or which I just do not consider funny (SPOILERS AHEAD), like when the pirate in the cave says: `I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!' (SPOILERS END). This sort of thing simply does not do it for me. Also I thought that I, as a viewer, was not ¬ëinvolved' deeply enough in the love between Elizabeth and William. Jack Sparrow was just too overwhelming and I feel that the film could have actually done without about everything but Jack Sparrow, without losing it's appeal. This is well made, light-hearted summer entertainment though and not some film you are supposed to think about. Worth watching once, maybe even twice (for seeing Jack Sparrow again most likely), but then it should be left alone.<br/><br/>

","""From producer Jerry Bruckheimer comes 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl', the thrilling high-seas adventure with a mysterious twist. The roguish yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) idyllic pirate life capsizes after his nemesis, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), steals his ship, the 'Black Pearl', and later attacks the town of Port Royal, kidnapping the governor's beautiful daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley).<br/><br/>""In a gallant attempt to rescue her and recapture the 'Black Pearl', Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) joins forces with Jack. What Will doesn't know is that a cursed treasure has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever as the undead,"" according to the DVD sleeve description.<br/><br/>This first ""PG-13""-rated Disney film unexpectedly became the first of a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" feature franchise based on one of the company's amusement park rides. It's Disney off the Jerry Bruckheimer production line (so, plan accordingly), and is eye-pleasingly well-produced. The screenplay, by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, is quite a nice modernization of the classic ""pirate"" story.<br/><br/>The film's greatest strength is Mr. Depp's slosh-buckling, swish-buckling, swaggering, and staggering ""Jack Sparrow"".<br/><br/>Depp's characterization cuts through the screen with uncommon, original charm. This part made critics strut up and take notice, with Depp being rewarded with several ""Best Actor"" awards and nominations. This was also the film which vaulted Depp into the Quigley ""Box Office"" Top 10 stars list (#6, with a bullet). Actually, it conformed something already a reality among moviegoers - Depp in the cast made a film worth considering, and Depp as the star made a film worth shelling out the bucks to see.<br/><br/>******** The Curse of the Black Pearl (6/28/03) Jerry Bruckheimer : Gore Verbinski ~ Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush"

","Okay, so I just finished watching this first Pirates of the Caribbean movie on ABC which means that there might have been some edits for either content or time constraints in the three hour slot. Nevertheless, I was a little entertained by some of the fight sequences and many of the lines and attitude of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character. I'm not completely sure he deserved the Oscar nomination for it but hey, he finally got the public recognition as a result so it's all good. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush are also adequate here so this movie was a little enjoyable to me though I couldn't completely connect the disparate sequences that seemed to meander throughout.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>The evil pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps the daughter (Keira Knightley) of a Caribbean governor and heads off but the woman's admirer (Orlando Bloom) asks Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to help him track them down. He reluctantly agrees because he wants revenge against Barbossa who led a mutiny against him years earlier. The first paragraph in Roger Ebert's review perfectly sums up my feelings on this movie because he makes it clear that there's a nice 90-minute ""B"" movie trapped inside an incredibly long and drawn out 142-minutes. Seriously, 142-minutes for a pirate movie? I know this movie has a large group of fans and I know it made hundreds of millions of dollars throughout the world but there are so many great things here that I can't help but feel that they're all wasted simply because someone didn't know how to shout cut and then leave stuff on the cutting room floor. We'll start off with all the good stuff and one can't help but be visually entertained by everything going on. I really loved the look of the sets, the pirate ships, the costumes and of course the dead pirates look terrific as well. I'm not a fan of CGI but I thought they did a pretty good job mixing up the make-up with the special effects and the visual look of the pirates is incredibly good and quite realistic as well. Another major plus is that you can't help but feel as if you're really in the 17th Century. I thought the filmmakers did a terrific job with all the outfits and this here helped add some creditability to the movie. The action scenes are all incredibly well-staged including a terrific bit where the under-maned Sparrow boat must go up against Barbossa's using any item that they can. Another terrific battle happens at the very end but with a summer Blockbuster you expect the action to be good. Then we have the nice performances by Rush, Bloom, Knightley and various other supporting players. I thought Knightley was incredibly good coming off quite sexual as well as being believable in the toughness of the character. Then there's Johnny Depp who picked up an Oscar-nomination for his performance. I can't say I'd call it that great but there's no question that Depp makes the role all his own and even manages to make the performance original, which isn't all that easy to do with a pirate. I really loved the tough of Keith Richards that he threw into the performance and I think any fan of The Stones will enjoy it. However, most of this is wasted because everything just gets dragged out so long that after a while you can't help but feel as if you're got some great eye candy but nothing that tastes overly good. Edit out thirty-minutes and I'd say you'd have a much more entertaining film."

","Very good action epic from the Caribbean.<br/><br/>After seeing the preview I was expecting a ""lets make a movie for the sake of it"" mentality with lots of special effects. I was somewhat surprised when I actually found it to be quite an entertaining and easy to watch film.<br/><br/>I was also very impressed with the effects, but especially the skeletal effects (believable without being gory). <br/><br/>Johnny Depp's grasp of ""Jack Sparrow"" is to be commended however I feel he was let down by the lacking and somewhat forced performances of two other characters. It is for this reason alone I give this movie an 8 instead of the elusive 10.<br/><br/>Interesting story with interesting characters, whats not to like?"
"prodigy-25","10","1","8","18 December 2007"," Highly... underrated (yes, still - despite 8.0 average!)
","I find this movie brilliant, a true work of art. And the same applies to sequels as well. Unfortunately many people are totally unable to see past their stereotypes (or are just plain dumb), which is the sole reason for so many negative or subtly negative reviews. 'Oh, it's Disney? Based on a ride? 5/10 then', 'Not written/directed by someone famous? 5/10', 'I can't get what it's about... hmm... 5/10 for J.D.' And so on, and so on.<br/><br/>In fact, ""Pirates"" is a movie with meaning, not only with much action. There are many action scenes, sure. But it's also highly symbolic (whether it was intended or not). I'll give just a couple of examples:<br/><br/>***SPOILERS BELOW*** <br/><br/>Jack's arrival to Port Royal on the mast of a sinking boat. Can anyone say something like this never happened to him in real life, even if it wasn't that spectacular? Then Jack has to bribe a customs officer so that his name isn't mentioned in records and right after that he steals a small money-pouch. There're people walking around but the theft seems to go unnoticed. This isn't illogical as it may seem. Or at least it's not any more illogical than our society where all people steal from each other in more or less obvious ways and everyone pretends to notice nothing.<br/><br/>Likewise, Jack's ship - Black Pearl - is a metaphor of freedom. (When it's first mentioned there's funny guards' conversation about 'is it real or not' and 'can any ship with black sails be the Pearl'. The Pearl is elusive, 'nigh uncatchable'. It hardly brought Jack anything but trouble, not to mention the price he had to pay for getting it. Yet he settles for no other ship.) I could mention more of such interesting ideas (for eyes to see that can), but don't want to spoil too much.<br/><br/>Still people choose not to think. Indeed, why to make your brain work when you can easily criticize, that Will is a smith's apprentice instead. (Actually to anyone familiar with mythology it does make sense that a young hero is a smith's apprentice. And yes, I know why people are against something that actually does make sense. But that's off-topic here.) <br/><br/>Bottomline: I loved pretty much everything about this movie and its sequels. 10/10 from the heart."

","I never thought I would ever be a fan of Johnny Depp ever, but after this I absolutely adore him and his career as a pirate that I've completely fallen in love with. It is directed by Gore Verbinski and the first film in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. In fact, according to the initial idea, the main characters were Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swan. However, a very colorful character like Captain Jack Sparrow could not go unnoticed by the audience and was elevated to one of the main roles along with Orlando Bloom.
The film tells us about a pirate named Jack Sparrow. Once his team launched a riot and threw him alone on a remote island with a gun and only one machine gun. Jack continues to keep this bullet in order to achieve revenge. Another storyline tells us about the girl Elizabeth, the daughter of the governor, and about secretly in love with her smith Will Turner. However, I will not speak further, I will say only one thing - the plot is interesting, well thought out and will not let you get bored.
One of the reasons without which the Pirates would probably not have had such success was humor. When watching for the first time, there were many moments where I laughed, but even now they can cause a smile. There were a lot of cool phrases in the film, which often came from Jack. The one-eyed pirate with his bald friend also had a lot of fun, as we later find out their name is Pintel and Rajetti.
If it is true comedy you are after and you love action spectaculars,this film is definitely for you."

","Let us quickly review the actors in this film, Depp, Knightley, Bloom, Price and Rush; all of which have done much better work in previous films. In this film, however, a silly pirate movie about zombies that has no logic, science or sex, so must be attached somehow to the Disney fantasy world, is , at best, mediocre eye candy. Depp plays a bisexual pirate with effeminate traits, but serious sexual dysfunction; most likely caused by his alcoholism. Knightly was almost convincing, until she didn't have sex with Depp after an all night orgy of everything else. Bloom is still stuck in his Lord of the Rings Personna, and is the weakest actor in this group, Pryce has to play the ""father"" role, and basically gets a hand job (which he eventually defeats) in this film, and Rush seems to have the best time of all, having fun playing a despicable pirate in charge of a literally skeleton crew. The film is sometimes funny in the beginning, bogs down in the middle, and is about a half hour or more too long. Strictly for children and teens high on cheap beer."

","13 July 2003. Though a bit violent for small children and a bit long in some places, Pirates has tidbits for all movie goers, old and young, male and female. There is the romance, there are the fight scenes, there are the ghost/horror elements, there are the cute comedy bits that all make up for a rather fun, entertaining film for everyone. Johnny Depp almost steals the show with his anti-hero antics. The movie ultimately stands up to honest scrutiny for all characters for the most part by the end, though perhaps Barbossa could have been even a more complex character making the movie even more dramatic and riveting. The climax avoids the usual melt-down to action and blustery fury, using instead a more moderate and superior ending device. Overall, Pirates rates eight stars out of ten."

The visuals are worth mentioning as well.<br/><br/>This is the first installment. The story revolves around how the crew of Black pearl along with the vessel is cursed and will they get rid of curse.<br/><br/>This is the highest rated installment on IMDb, may be because it's the first one. For me better comes with some of the other installments.<br/><br/>The character of Jack portrays a witty, selfish person but righteous as a hidden quality. It wins heart of the audience in general.

","As a kid I've loved pirates and adored pirate-movies, as growing up I do not even know how many times I saw the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, how often I quarreled about it.
Man, this was my favorite movie.<br/><br/>When the fourth Film was released, I wanted to watch the first one to get rid of the bad taste and the terrible memory of all the other movies. I took her on a weekend time, put myself in the right mood, had a big plate of pancakes on my table and saw, after a long time, the ""Pirates of the Caribbean 1"" again in the atmospheric light with my freshly purchased boxes and the best sound...<br/><br/>And Now:
The plot is relatively complicated tolled for such a simple pirate adventure, all locations look quite chic so I think it's a shame how much time on the water or on ships spend. The special effects are pretty cool, I like the eerie atmosphere and the actors manage to convey it correctly, making you feel like you're part of it. Even the costumes and make-up contribute to the impression that I do not see actors but I really see these characters. I think Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were born for these roles.
I'm sooo happy to see again Disney movie with action and sword fight instead of musical numbers.<br/><br/>But:
This movie was just below my expectations. It was not so exciting, not so cool, not so funny, not so thoughtful and not as creative as I thought or remembered.<br/><br/>And to my astonishment, the movie is not nearly as good... as I thought.
The movie was still good but, maybe I had lower demands as a kid, maybe the movie is still good but my taste and expectations are now too high, maybe the movie was never good was never that good to begin with and as a kid I tolerated it more or anything else happened so I can say today this movie is just OK."

","Today, few people can remember going into the local multiplex on a warm summer afternoon and being treated to something completely original. In the 1970s and 80s, pioneers like Spielberg and Lucas were creating modern myths, putting stories and images on screen that would be seared into the collective consciousness forever. Jaws, Star Wars, E.T, Indiana Jones, and even Jurassic Park, were more than just quality entertainment. There was a magic to those films that I thought had gone extinct by the time the 21st century rolled around. Then, in the summer of 2003, came Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. Yes, it is inspired by the theme park attraction at Disneyland, but what director Gore Verbinski and his collaborators do, is use the spirit of the ride to create something truly special. With an ensemble cast featuring big stars, veteran character actors, and young up-and-comers, lavish production design, an iconic score, and a heaping spoonful of humor, Pirates of the Caribbean represents the perfect storm of summer entertainment. The Curse of the Black Pearl does not simply coast on a recognizable name. Instead, Verbinski and company dare to create something brand new. In the end, thanks in large part to Johnny Depp's audacious lead performance, Pirates of the Caribbean brings magic back to the movies.<br/><br/>The titular curse of the Black Pearl is the driving force behind the story of Pirates of the Caribbean. The Black Pearl's ruthless captain, Barbossa, played with scenery chewing gusto by Geoffrey Rush, and his crew are cursed by mythical Aztec Gold to live forever as the undead (In a bit of design brilliance, they're skeletal bodies can only be seen by the light of the moon). After Barbossa kidnaps the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan, played by the young beauty Keira Knightly, in order to break the curse, a young admirer of Elizabeth, a blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), enlists the help of legendary pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp in one of the most iconic performances of the decade, to help free her from the clutches of the undead crew. Now is as good a time as any to mention Johnny Depp. What he does with Jack Sparrow, with the makeup, the costume, and the unsteady, drunken, charismatic persona, is a tour de force of acting. Depp creates a pirate rockstar icon where just about everybody else would have phoned in a typical smiling Errol Flynn impression. He is simply electrifying on screen. <br/><br/>The story of Pirates of the Caribbean is appropriately old-fashioned. Writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio take care to include just about every pirate trope there is into the script. Sword fights, romance, sea-faring battles, and buried treasure, every classic pirate situation is here. While it might have been clich√©d in less capable hands, the story here is deliciously simple. While there is a good deal of background to what the curse is and how it can be cured, the basic structure of Curse of the Black Pearl is in the spirit of the grand pirate adventures of the Golden Age of Hollywood. It is a classic adventure yarn with good guys, bad guys, sweeping romance, and high spirited adventure.<br/><br/>Depp gets the lion's share of the credit for the success of Pirates of the Caribbean, and he does steal the show, but Gore Verbinski's direction is nearly equal to the Johnny Depp show. The pairing of the high-energy director and the classic swashbuckling material proved to be a stroke of genius on the part of Jerry Bruckheimer. Verbinski brings enough personality and humor for a dozen movies. From a purely visual standpoint, Pirates of the Caribbean is equally unique. The exotic locations, from the Bay of Port Royal to the picturesque beauty of Rumrunner's Isle, are bright, colorful, and lush. Where the production value really excels though is in how the real-life locations sync perfectly with the sets, which tastefully evoke the Disneyland attraction. In it's production design, Curse of the Black Pearl is as satisfying a visual experience as you can have in a summer blockbuster. The locations, the sets, and the dependably boundary-pushing special effects from ILM make the most of all the natural beauty of the real life Caribbean, as well as the nostalgic Disney glow of the theme park ride. <br/><br/>In my eyes, Gore Verbinski is currently one of the best action directors working, but back in 2003, his brand of swashbuckling adventure was eye-opening. It's not just that Verbinski is so adept at giving the stunts, the highlights of which are a massive battle on the high seas and a climatic sword fight in a treasure-filled cave, an enthusiastic electricity. It's that the humor mixed throughout the action is so darn effortless. The action scenes in Pirates of the Caribbean are so fun by themselves, it seems the actors can't help but have fun along with them. The mix of humor and action in Pirates of the Caribbean is simply unrivaled. Nobody buckles swash quite as entertainingly as Gore Verbinski, and Curse of the Black Pearl represents him at the very top of his game.<br/><br/>This movie is fun. Not just the type of fun where you walk out of the theater feeling placated, but the type of experience that leaves you with a big dumb grin on your face the entire time. Without Gore Verbinski or Johnny Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl would probably be a solid adventure. It's with these two, plus the rest of the eclectic cast, that Pirates of the Caribbean becomes a bona-fide classic. Depp's Jack Sparrow is an unforgettable character, an instant icon that came out of nowhere. Nobody could have predicted what Depp brought to the character, and yet he fits into Verbinski's world like a glove. These elements are what make Pirates of the Caribbean special. Summer blockbusters come and go, but Bruckheimer, Verbinski, and Depp did something I thought could never be done again, they captured that old movie magic, like a ship in a bottle.<br/><br/>94/100"

His character is fresh and ready to go in this one. Granted Orlando Bloom is a good counter balance to Depp but it is Sparrow whose the Pirate that stirs the action.<br/><br/>When this strong entry came out, it was very popular. It incorporates a few of the ride features with the action, but for the most part it goes into it's own world. Walt Disney's imagination really is the anchor for this film.<br/><br/>The PG rating holds the Pirates into a more family oriented format theme the real ones, but that is okay. We have enough real pirates keel holing our lives anyhow. This escape is a welcome refuge from them.<br/><br/>This film re-invents the role of women damsels being in attractive distress but not needing to take off their clothes to get the desired effect. The big success is the classic triangle between 2 men interested in the same damsel. That works well here too.<br/><br/>When this came out, I was surprised by the length of the film, but pleased with the results. This is the best one still in the series.

","What has now become a multi-billion-dollar franchise once started as an ambitious risk by Disney. Make a feature length film based on a ride at your theme park? That just didn't seem like something logical to do at the time. However, with a talented group of actors, a swashbuckling script, and one hell of a musical score, the first Pirates of the Caribbean is an absolute joy on all fronts. Perhaps, never really being topped in any way by its successors.<br/><br/>Starting a new franchise is bold these days, which is why Disney made the right move in hiring Johnny Depp as the charming and sometimes irreverent Captain Jack Sparrow. An even better move was not leaving the entire film up to Sparrow to lead. Complementing the zaniness of Sparrow is the elegant but fierce Elizabeth Swan and the mysterious and brave Will Turner (played by Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom respectively). All of them are great, but may not prove to be as fun if not for the incredible visual effects, makeup, and action. This felt like the first major blockbuster of the 21st century, and the rest of the series certainly ranks up there.<br/><br/>One of the best things this series, and particularly the first film, did so well is create a mythology and universe surrounding Pirates in and around the Caribbean. It happens gradually in 'Black Pearl', seemingly allowing viewers to adapt to the unknown shores of the series without feeling overwhelmed. A lot of it's fun swordplay and grim family history, but the supernatural elements play just as well. Immortally cursed pirates just begin to mark the lovable weirdness of this film.<br/><br/>Almost as well known as the characters and the film itself is the score by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer. Zimmer is always remembered as the one who created the iconic theme, but Badelt should also be credited, as should a few other unknown composers at the time who chipped in. But really, the movies would not be the same without the perfect music played over the action and adventures. <br/><br/>This film is lengthy and does feature an annoyingly pesky English Navy who won't go away, but Geoffrey Rush's turn as Captain Barbosa and an equally (if not more) memorable turn from Depp as Sparrow makes the first film the best in the series. As fun as the action and over-the- top humor and adventure are, the thing you can always come back to in these films are the characters. The movies never quite captured the same entertainment as 'Black Pearl' did, but that wasn't for lack of trying.<br/><br/>+Action & adventure are unmatched<br/><br/>+Score<br/><br/>+Memorable characters<br/><br/>+Set up the mythology well<br/><br/>-Lengthy<br/><br/>8.8/10"

","Arguably one of Disney's greatest films to ever be released, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl captures pure adventure, romance, and horror into one tightly knit film. With a love for this film from the first viewing, Curse of the Black Pearl was one of the first films that I grew to love, and continue to love to this day. Curse of the Black Pearl is one of Disney's most ambitious films. Seeming to go darker than they ever had before, this film pushed the boundaries of what Disney could get away with. It's really surprising to see that this is a Disney film, since it does have its moment where it gets frightening, especially for a younger audience. The scenes involving the Pearl's crew showing the effects of the curse really are frighteningly realistic, which could easily scare little kids. The violence also is surprising, since there are many deaths throughout the film. This really started to push the dark side of Disney, but still kept a spirit of adventure. While Curse of the Black Pearl has its dark moments, there are so many moments throughout the film that leave you breathless. The scene that most stands out is where the crew of the Black Pearl go for their walk underwater, it's a completely unforgettable scene in an unforgettable film. With some surprisingly beautiful cinematography, this film not only is highly entertaining, but it really is a stunning film to watch. It's an effort that really ended up paying off in the end to create a beautiful film about pirates, that happens to be a Disney film. Curse of the Black Pearl is a perfect beginning to a franchise. It's the best film of the series by far, as well as the most memorable. This film is one that really started getting me interested in watching film for fun, since it was one that was so much fun to watch. It's amazing to see Disney produce an epic film like this, which they have tried to do with films like John Carter and Prince of Persia, which sadly didn't live up to the expectations, but this film certainly exceeds expectations. Simply put, it's one of Disney's best films to date."

","Since Dead Men Tell No Tales is coming this May, I decided to re-watch this introduction to the franchise after reading about how the directors want to bring back the style of the first one. I have to say, after 14 years this movie still kicks ass.<br/><br/>You know deep in your heart that's it's a Disney movie but from that opening scene and the arrival of Jack Sparrow (Captain Jack Sparrow), you are in for an awesome +2 hour ride (irony) through this fantastic dark world created by Gore Verbinski and the crew.<br/><br/>What can I say about cast? Depp owns Jack Sparrow, with his own twist on Keith Richards (seems funny that the character won't die just like Richards). Geoffrey Rush nails his role as Barbossa, the mutinous first mate who took over the Black Pearl (seems odd that he's a privateer now). Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley play serious Disney characters (one is an unconventional girl who is interested in pirates, while the other is an underdog trying to prove his Worth).<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a blast to watch and is probably one of the few blockbuster movies from Disney that you can enjoy over and over again. My only problem now is, that those Norwegians don't make a rip-off of this one for Dead Men Tell No Tales (or Salazar's Revenge as it's called in some territories)."

","The only way the crew of the Black Pearl can lift the curse upon them is to return a golden Aztec coin to its treasure chest. But that coin is currently hanging around the lovely neck of British Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann Year after year, lazy poster quotes try to convince audiences that the latest blockbuster movie is ""a roller-coaster ride"". Pirates Of The Caribbean does, in actual fact, have its roots in a theme park attraction ‚Äî a slow-moving boat trip past richly detailed tableaux of lusty buccaneers and skeletons who breathed their last grasping for forbidden treasure; not the most likely base material to turn into cinema gold. But producer Jerry Bruckheimer proves yet again that he's a big-screen alchemist where sheer entertainment is concerned. Pirates Of The Caribbean is, without a doubt, the best blockbuster of the summer.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski steers his ship through choppy commercial waters by keeping the romance, adventure and comedy on an even keel. If there's the slightest niggle to be had, it's probably that the swashbuckling sequences don't really lay down a challenge to the Zorros or Robin Hoods. But such cares are swept aside by a rollicking tale of pirate lore, with cursed treasure, secret identities and enough acts of betrayal and loyalty to keep the final showdown as sparky as the firecrackers in Blackbeard's whiskers.<br/><br/>It's also very funny. Shrek writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio spice up the pirate genre as gamely as they did fairy tales; but on the comedy map it's Johnny Depp's inspired turn as Captain Jack Sparrow that really marks the spot. Depp, arguing that pirates were the rock stars of their day, models his entire performance on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones: it's there in every slurred vowel and every drug-fried wiggle of the head. There's an endearing dignity to Sparrow's hunger for fame. ""You are, without doubt, the worst pirate I've heard of,"" says one British officer. ""Yes,"" replies Jack, ""but you have heard of me."" Gloriously over-the-top, this performance is pitched only as high as the film's fun factor itself. In terms of physical precision and verbal delivery, it's a masterclass in comedy acting."

","""Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male,"" a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.<br/><br/>With hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!)

Finally, they can help her and manage to kill Barbbosa. And, Jack starts to sail again. I like this movie's worldview and special effects. The plot is good as well."
"filipemanuelneto","8","0","3","13 April 2016"," One of the best pirate movies ever.
","This film is set in Jamaica during the mid-eighteenth century, when the island was controlled by the British. In this atmosphere of danger, the mastery of the seas is disputed by the Royal Navy and the ferocious buccaneers of the Caribbean. The young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a swords-maker, lives peacefully in Port Royal and secretly loves Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), daughter of Governor Swan (Jonathan Pryce), whom he owes his life. Everything changes after the city was attacked by the pirates of the ""Black Pearl"", a ship on which hang stories of frightening curses. The girl is abducted and Will ends up coming out looking for her, accompanied by Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a permanently drunk and clumsy pirate, who will do with him the most unlikely pair. Directed by Gore Verbinsky has screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and other collaborators.<br/><br/>This film was a pleasant surprise to many people, as the pirates movies were normally associated with ticketing failures and had such a strong stigma that virtually disappeared from movies for years. So, this movie not only re-popularized the theme but also returned to pirates movies some respect. Let us begin by the actors: Bloom and Keira Knightley didn't surprised me much because they are used to play the good guy roles, they are comfortable with it and they have great talent doing it, not to mention that, even then, Keira showed great interest in historical or period productions. Who truly stole the show were the major antagonists: Geoffrey Rush (who made the villain, Barbossa), is an consecrated, experienced and respected actor, with an unquestionable quality and an excellent diction, but he outdid himself in this film. He looks like a figure jumped out of an adventures book, like ""The Treasure Island"". On the other hand, Johnny Depp played the perfect antihero, capable of the worst wrongdoings or to demonstrate feelings of great nobility. This two characters, thought outside the box, fit perfectly in the two views that we have concerning pirates: the romanticized view represented by Barbossa and a more historically accurate perception, immortalized by a drunk and sly Sparrow, who enters and jumps of any awkward situation without worrying too much about it. The scenarios are excellent and computerized animation and the special effects team were up to the challenge. I must refer particularly the vessels used, by the accuracy of the reconstruction and these beauty (although I don't believe that any pirate has ever used ships as large and heavy as those). The costumes and characterization were also impeccable and the plot was invented in an original way, trying to escape a bit of the theme ""pirates running for a treasure"" emptied of attractiveness, crossing it with some more interesting sub-plots.<br/><br/>This film is well worth the price paid for the DVD or movie ticket. Besides having established and popularized Depp and the pirates movies, it entertains the public very well, holding our attention until the end."
"CinematicInceptions","8","0","2","9 April 2016"," Definitely the best done of the series. Pretty entertaining if you don't see it too often.
","Although this series has spiraled downward in quality, this first installment was a good place to start. It introduces all of the themes that drive the sequels, even though there is a relatively small connection between this and Dead Man's Chest. The most prominent theme is whether all laws can be considered just which we see with both Norrington's use and abuse of his military position to hunt pirates, and the ambiguity of the pirate code. Less prominent is the theme of selfishness. Jack is easily the most selfish character, but seems to do this for show as a deception. As we learn later, Jack's compass is actually run by people's desires. Even here, the plot is driven by each character's desires and how they cause conflict. And these conflicts are only resolved by selflessness as with Will sacrificing his life for Elizabeth, Elizabeth allowing Norrington to marry her to save Will, the crew abandoning the code to save Jack, and Norrington's actions at the very end. Those aren't great examples, but much more concrete resolutions through selflessness come later in the series.<br/><br/>The characters are very well done, both major and minor. All are given attention, personality, and motives in the case of the main characters. The fact that a character with as little screen time as Governor Swann has motives and contributes to others' motives says something. Each character's exposition is pretty much spot-on and fits the situation naturally without involving any dull or implausible ""information dumps"" about the current situation. Any information dumps come well after we have met and have a sense of each character. It helps that the characters are very likable from Jack Sparrow's witticisms and quirks, Will's blunders and passions, Barbossa's dramatic tones, Elizabeth's ability to excercise whatever power she has over her enemies, and the various eccentricities of each crew. In addition to that, there is no true protagonist, but everyone plays the villain at some point with the exception of Will and Elizabeth. But despite that, there is a degree of sympathy that you can have for each character including Barbossa and Norrington.<br/><br/>The plot gets a bit complicated, and it's definitely worth it to stop midway through and run through the story so far with the help of a friend or some other spoiler-free source of information. The most confusing thing about my first viewing was how the curse worked, but once I made sense of it I appreciated the movie more. Even when there aren't action scenes, the story moves along at a decent pace and remains entertaining and interesting. Of course, some of this loses it's effect if you know the story too well, so I recommend that you wait a couple years before re-watching it.<br/><br/>In light of modern spfx, some of the visuals are a little laughable, but are still pretty good for the time. The acting was pretty good for an action movie, with Johnny Depp stealing the show as Jack. There is a lot of action with the fast-paced sword duels, sea battles, and the sacking of Port Royal. The choreography is pretty good, and all of the action is exciting and fun rather than brutal. The script was really well done, easily the best of the series, both in it's dialogue and scene structure. Gore Verbinski did a pretty good job directing too.<br/><br/>As it's a Disney movie it's geared a little bit for kids, but not too strongly. I certainly enjoyed it more when I was about 12 or 13, but it's still pretty fun to watch now. The PG-13 rating is warranted but it's well on the mild side. I would recommend buying it at some point if you enjoy it and haven't already, especially since you can probably get it used for less than $5. There's potential for it to be annoying, especially if you're looking for flaws and can understand the story. But on the whole there aren't any glaring mistakes. So definitely rent it if you enjoy fun, exciting, and thematic movies. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."
"kdavies-69347","8","0","2","2 March 2016"," A Comparative Look at the Series - Part 1: The Black Pearl
","I wanted to go back and watch the series as a whole, and comparatively speaking 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' is by far the best in the series. <br/><br/>When compared to the other films in the series, this one shines brightest. The plot is quite simplistic when compared to the other 'Pirates' films, but it doesn't get muddled in its own story. It's a love story at its heart, between a privileged daughter of a Governor of one of the many Caribbean islands (Keira Knightley), and an orphaned apprentice of the local Blacksmith (Orlando Bloom). There is a sense of history between them goes back to childhood, and is a very strong bond between both, which becomes the main driving force behind the events in Part 1. The pirates have a real sense of danger about them, and are just as dangerous and evil looking when they are in or out of their ghoulish form. and I think most will be surprised at the level of violence (off screen that is) which this movie contains. <br/><br/>The first entry into the series introduces us to the most pivotal character in the series; Captain Jack Sparrow, and is by far one of Johnny Depp's best creations. A perfect blend of heroism, ineptitude, and just a hint of madness. He brought such a unique character to life, and it is very easy to believe that you need to be somewhat crazy to be a successful pirate. From the very introduction to the character to his last scene in the series, you know that there is something off about him. Every single interaction, every little quip has a real sense of improvisation, about it, as though everything that happens around him is more of a nuisance to deal with, rather than a consequence of his own actions. The remaining characters are very much real in this single minded drives. Elizabeth swan as the damsel in distress, William turner as a driven hero willing to stop at nothing to get to the women he loves, and of course Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush) who is evil to his core and willing to stop at nothing to relieve the curse upon him and his crew (but mostly for himself). <br/><br/>Although shorter than the other movies in the series, this one is by far the best, without stretching the story too thin or becoming to convoluted in plot devices. It is in many ways a cleaner and simpler story. A great film from beginning to end with just the right blend of love, adventure and magic. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Disney pulled the rug from under everyone when it produced a rated PG- 13 movie about some of the most terrifying men to ever walk the earth.

Fantastic supporting performances by Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom as well as the truly menacing Geoffrey Rush give this film an edge no one would have expected. Containing witty dialogue, masterful camera-work and visual effects, one of Hans Zimmer's finest scores (including the riveting theme ""He's a Pirate""), and a story extremely quick-paced and exciting, all capped off by Depp's career- defining performance, this film at times gives a stronger adrenaline rush than the ride it's based on."

","No amount of words will be enough to describe how fantastic this masterpiece from Disney was. Johnny Depp became my favorite actor 5 seconds after watching this movie. Though I do despise of Will Turner and his stupid girlfriend, those to were always an obstacle for Jack. I love the bond between Jack and Barbosa, their frienemies. I say I despise Will and Elizabeth because #1: Will betrayed Jack and reported to Cutler Beckette using dead bodies (cruel!). #2: Elizabeth chained Jack while faking a romantic moment and forced Jack to call her a pirate, a title way too cool to be wasted on a pathetic girl such as Elizabeth. There are so many more reasons but those are my main two and if anyone has a different opinion I totally respect that. I actually admire Will for going through so much to save Elizabeth."

","In my opinion, this film is one of the most gripping films i've ever seen. And it isn't only the own film, it's all the saga. It has a great actors like Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Jack Sparrow is an eccentric character, as Johnny Depp usually is. The film has moments of all type. There are so great moments of adventure, laughs and, more like a secondary story, so many moments of love between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. I think Will Turner is so brave, because he has a infighting between being a pirate or not, and it wants to save her although he isn't noble. She is so brave too, because she risks her life and lies to protect him."

","This is such a gem of a movie. It came out of nowhere and with little expectations, reigniting film fans' love of pirate adventures. The fact that it had no expectation contrasts with its sequels, which is why it was probably so successful. You've got the classic pirate villain (played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush ‚Äì my favourite character of the films), great CGI, and some incredibly witty scenes. Let's not forget Jonny Depp's outstanding, unforgettable and charismatic portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. It seems he was supposed to be an appealing supporting character, and yet shoved the clich√© love plot out of the way and made the film his own. Very little can be said of this film in a negative light. It was clever, witty and sharp. One of the true achievements, however, was that it wasn't too witty and sharp ‚Äì it knew its boundaries, unlike the sequels. The seriousness of the situations these characters were put in felt real. Therefore, we cared about what happened to them. Despite my eagerness for the upcoming film, I can't see it topping The Curse of the Black Pearl. In fact, I can't see any pirate film surpassing one of the landmark movies of the past decade, aside from Master and Commander. Great Stuff."

","In beginning my review on Pirates of the Caribbean I sat back to watch all of the films back to back in order. I'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley, and of course I really like the Pirates films.<br/><br/>Now in the beginning cinematically it seemed a bit as if the scene was on a stage in a green screen and it showed pretty badly, yet this is one of the very few graphical/cgi issues that really stuck out to me. Acting within The Curse of the Black Pearl for the most part was great, and of course the cast seemed to grow into their characters more and more as this film started to take shape. I do love how the story starts and unfolds as I do believe at this point this is one of my favorites within the film collection, of course until I get to check out the newest in development film.<br/><br/>The Curse of the Black Pearl is a wonderful movie, it's great for family, it's filled with action, comedy, and a beautiful tale to follow.

The Curse exposed was my favorite part of the movie the graphics were awesome."

","And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music.

But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?<br/><br/>I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.<br/><br/>Except for this year.<br/><br/>Go Jack.<br/><br/>And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge- podge of loosely- connected ""money shots"" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-beardedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, ""You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!"" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck- swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.<br/><br/>And now to the music.

They seek a medallion that can lift a curse. Directed by Gore Verbinski who previously made The Ring and The Mexican. He brings a sense of youthful enthusiasm that works.

Its power is never properly explained but they are seen as skeletons under the moonlight. Orlando Bloom plays a weapons manufacturer. Keira Knightley goes beyond damsel in distress as the Governor's daughter. She is involved in a mesmerizing sequence where she is hurled aimlessly from skeleton to skeleton when she realizes the horror that is upon her. It is obvious that she and Bloom will unite.

But it's really built around Captain Jack Sparrow, which is a problem I had with the later entries when the cast really got crowded and he was (somewhat) sidelined. But he is the real magic here, and Depp plays the character with mincing bug-eyed flair.

","This movie will always hold a special place in my heart. Way back in 2003, while on an island (San Juan Island, WA to be exact,) my then- boyfriend and I checked out the only movie theatre on the isle. Personally, I didn't want to see Pirates of the Caribbean, but it was either that or Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde since the movie theatre only had two screens. And while I saw part one of that, I was even less interested in seeing that. So, with only two screens, two choices, we opted for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>Now, this movie had been out for awhile, and everyone raved about it. Still, even with the draw of both Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, as well as the vast positive feedback, I was hesitant going in. BOY¬Öwas I wrong. This movie grabbed me from minute one and never let loose. <br/><br/>From the incredible score to the excellent special effects ‚Äì that STILL hold up today in 2015 to the fantastic characters, this proved to be an instant classic. (To clarify, 12 years later, that statement holds true.) It was extreme adventure, with plenty of action, humor and perfect blend of gray areas for the good/bad guys. <br/><br/>Now, the follow-ups, including the 2 that completed the ""trilogy"" and the stand alone feature¬ÖI implore you: DON'T WATCH THEM. I've currently seen this original 3-4x, but the subsequent ones, one time apiece and pretty much despised them. They were FAR TOO LONG and clunky. Granted, Captain Jack Sparrow is a once in a lifetime character, but he should only be enjoyed in small doses, such as this original chapter. <br/><br/>The lines were hilarious, the cast/characters great on their own and the action was exciting. The Disneyland ride happens to be my favorite exhibit at Disneyland (even before the movie,) and they took that, plus the awesome Yo-Ho! song to lengths that couldn't be achieved in lesser hands. <br/><br/>Again, avoid the sequels and buy this fantastic adventure. It seriously can be stand-alone, and should've. <br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Of all of our memories together, Justin, this always stands out. Despite not being one of the biggest events in our time together, the time we went to this small, 2-screen, island duplex, will forever be etched into my memory. Thank you for opening my mind to this film and experience."

","For all Johnny Depp lovers¬Ö this film is undoubtedly for you. For all good movie lovers¬Ö this film is for you too! Truly this film has something for everyone and is a classic. Keira Knightley plays the feisty & independent Elizabeth Swann, who should become a Disney Princess. Orlando Bloom serves as the teenage girl eye candy, but admittedly he is an OK character although Jack Sparrow (ahem, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow) steals the show with his hilarious remarks. The film has a great cast and plenty of nods to the original ride from the Disney Parks. A favorite of mine is definitely Jack the Monkey, Barbossa's immortal pet monkey who was named 'Jack' to spite the human. Personally, my favorite scene is when Jack Sparrow gets marooned with Lizzie.<br/><br/>""They'll be no living with her after this.""<br/><br/>In total, this film does not disappoint and is a fabulous tribute to Walt's vision.

","When I first heard Disney was going to make a movie out of their Pirates of the Caribbean ride, I (like many others, no doubt) thought it was a horrible idea. I mean, how many movies based on video games worked, let alone movies based on an amusement park attraction. What was next? ""Hall of Presidents: The Motion Picture""?<br/><br/>But to their credit, Disney not only turned out a good movie, but spawned a billion dollar franchise. Thanks to Johnny Depp's great (and Oscar nominated, no less) performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, great direction by Gore Verbinski, and a storyline that is both action-packed, yet whimsical and fun, Disney made an epic adventure that appealed to all ages.<br/><br/>Now Disney is finally releasing the first two films on Blu-ray disc, and they're a true delight for any owners of the high def format. The picture is stunningly sharp and colorful, and I could find nothing to complain about. Every scene...indeed, every frame...was gloriously sharp and beautiful in this 1080p transfer. The audio is equally remarkable, with both a 5.1 uncompressed track and a 5.1 Dolby Digital track sounding fantastic. Watching Pirates on Blu-ray reminded me of why I spent money on the format in the first place...nothing I've seen (including seeing the film in the theater itself) matches the experience of watching the film in this format...it's simply incredible.<br/><br/>Disney hasn't slouched on the rest of the package either, making this a 2-disc set, with the second disc containing nearly every single extra that was on the 3-Disc standard release (including all the bonuses from ""The Lost Disc"" in that set). All those features and bonuses are still shown in 480p, but Disney has included a brand-new interactive documentary on the movie disc, presenting it in 1080p as well. This new documentary, entitled ""Scoundrels of the Seas"" can be watched in its entirety or can be edited by the viewer so he or she can watch a custom-designed version. By selecting an option in the main menu, viewers can watch the film and then click on ""coins"" that pop up during the movie, indicating topics available in the documentary. If you want to find out more about that topic, click on your remote when the coin appears. If you don't want to know more, don't click. When the film is over, you'll get to see the documentary with only the topics you clicked on covered. Of course, viewers also have the option of watching the movie without the distraction of the coins, as well as designing their own custom documentary from one of the menus, or just watching the complete documentary straight through. The documentary and custom design makes use of Blu-ray's Java capabilities, so users with stand-alone players and/or PS3's will want to make sure their systems are properly updated. <br/><br/>Also on the movie disc is an interactive ""Jolly Roger"" character that will help guide you through the disc; three separate audio commentary tracks (the same three that appear on the 3-disc standard version); and a handful of 1080p trailers for your enjoyment. <br/><br/>Disc Two contains most of the 480p bonus features that were previously released on the 3-disc set, including just extras as a Making-Of documentary; a blooper reel; deleted and alternate scenes; an image gallery; and a few ""Easter Eggs"" for all you pirates out there to hunt down!<br/><br/>Just in time for the theatrical release of the third movie in the trilogy, The Curse of the Black Pearl is a reference-quality Blu-ray release that fans of the movie are just going to love. It's a must- have for Blu-ray owners, no doubt."

The end scene after the credits with the monkey was AMAZING!<br/><br/>I wish that we never had to say good bye to Elizabeth and William in the third movie. The movie was great and i highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of pirates and Johnny Depp. He was BRILLIANT in the movie. Johnny is known for being crazy and having a dark sense of humor and Captain Jack Sparrow is just up his ally. Captain Jack Sparrow is crazy, funny, and he likes his drinks. He's hilarious and a great hero."

","Blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with eccentric pirate ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead.<br/><br/>Although he has been around since the early 1980s, and has made such great films as ""Edward Scissorhands"", this is now the role Depp is best known for. And, as of now (2015) it may remain that way, as his career seems to be in idle any time he appears as any other role (though his Wolf in ""Into the Woods"" has its charms).<br/><br/>Worth pointing out is how this film has one of the finest scores ever recorded for a Hollywood movie. Even if the soundtrack existed and the screen was blank, the film would deserve credit just for the score. Not many films could claim this, but ""Pirates"" can."

","This is my first review and its a relatively easy one. POTC: Curse of the Black Pearl is a thrilling introduction to an under-appreciated franchise. The best of the franchise in my opinion with an exciting cast consisting of Johnny Depp at the helm in his now iconic role. The back and forth of Depp and the brilliant Geoffery Rush as Captian Barbosa at the center keeps you intrigued to see who ultimately wins. The supporting performances from Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom as well as smaller characters like Mr. Gibbs played by the believable Kevin McNally makes you feel like you are viewing authentic pirate situations. The visuals and cinematography help bring this film to life.Twists betrayals bar fights pistols and gunpowder fill this enthralling epic. With huge box office success five Oscar nominations including Depp's firs, there is surely no 'curse'on this satisfyingly great adventure pic."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","1","13 December 2014"," Good start to a long-lasting franchise
","The very first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie was a huge success at the box office and at awards ceremonies. It was no¬∞3 at the 2003 box office behind the final ""Lord of the Rings"" chapter and ""Finding Nemo"". Also it received 5 Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor for Depp (his first nomination ever) and also an SAG Award for him. That is also why there have been 3 sequels already, no¬∞4 is safe and number 5 looks likely too. The first one (just like 2 and 3) was directed by Gore Verbinski, who kept reuniting with Depp after his exit from the Pirates franchise. The writing team already worked together on animation classics like ""Shrek"" and ""Aladdin"". My favorite part from the script was possibly the ""saving the one shot"" storyline and the final shot was one of the highlights of the movie. I was a bit surprised the crew went according to protocol at some point as they seemed extremely loyal to Sparrow initially, but I guess it shows that you can never trust pirates. Thank God Captain Sparrow survived all these dangerous situations early on like the hail of bullets after he saved and threatened Elizabeth Swann or when he almost gets hung near the end of the film. Actually that could have been a nice ending if they hadn't done all these sequels. A bit unexpected, but somehow different.<br/><br/>I also thought Geoffrey Rush did a good job with his character (but that's a given as it's Geoffrey Rush), the main antagonist to Sparrow. His death scene near the end was pretty special. I guess they did not plan to include him in the sequels, but they were wrong. Let's see how they bring him back. Another antagonist, the commodore, I was really fond of. I almost cheered for him more than for Bloom's character (just like Sparrow). It was actually nice for a change to see the rival to be displayed in not such a bad light. I found him likable and you could even call him a hero. Knightley did a solid job too and I liked Depp as well. I'm not his biggest fan, but here he convinced me and made me laugh too. He is a very costume-oriented actor if you look at his body of work and Jack Sparrow may very well be his most memorable role. Orlando Bloom unfortunately still does nothing for me. He is all about his looks and little about being a talented actor in my opinion. This franchise started right after ""The Lord of the Rings"", so they cast him as a crowd magnet I guess. The film is mostly a family movie. Here and there, there is a bit of violence, like ghost pirates cutting throats of Navy officers, but it's all not too graphic or very fast over.<br/><br/>Another strength of the film is the music. I am a bit surprised Zimmer was completely snubbed by everybody that awards season as his soundtrack is certainly one of the most memorable from 2003 and pretty much everybody has heard the main theme."

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a grand action film loaded with memorable characters, swashbuckling and great special effects. It's sure to please audiences and leave them roaring for more pirate adventures (which have been provided in the form of 3 sequels as of 2012). Despite a few shortcomings (the curse itself for example, is not well explained) it's just a lot of fun to sit through and it's good for the whole family (assuming the children won't be too frightened by the cursed pirates and can handle the action and violence). It's got everything you could want in a story: romance, action, humour, friendship, chases, even a bit of horror thrown in too. (On Blu-ray, August 11, 2012)"

","The first movie after all these unnecessary sequels, still remains the best movie. When I first watched ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" at the age of 11, it breathed new life into pirate movies that seemed to have been absent since ""Hook"" (1991).

It's debatable who steals the show, as director Gore Verbinski creates a movie that is anything but slow and visually wonderful.<br/><br/>""Captain"" Jack Sparrow (Depp), searches for a ship and crew in order to get revenge from Captain Barbossa (Rush), and claim back his ship the legendary ""Black Pearl"". Unfortunately along his way, he also manages to involve Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and local blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Who become entangled with the villainous pirates and their quest to break an ancient curse.<br/><br/>Saying all that. I suppose I would like to jokingly shoot myself in the foot, and say what are the point of all these wonderful fight scenes if they're cursed skeletons who remain pretty much invulnerable? Regardless, the styles and influences definitely hearkens back to the Golden age of Hollywood. The choreography is swift and for as much as the CGI is wonderfully rendered, a majority of effects are practical thanks to the films impressive budget (Thank you Jerry Bruckheimer).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: One of the better live action Disney movies, and probably the best movie ever based on a theme park ride. 8/10."

","Title: Pirates of the Caribbean <br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: A group of cursed pirates are looking for pieces of Aztec gold which a woman called Elizabeth has, she gets kidnapped so a black smith has to team up with a pirate to rescue her<br/><br/>Notable Acting: This entire franchise stands on the shoulders of Johnny Depp, he is what gives this movie it's spark. No matter how great Geoffrey Rush's, Orlando Bloom's or Keira Knightley's acting was if the main character of Jack Sparrow wasn't done right, the movie would have fell on deaf ears, mainly because this movie was suppose to be about Will and Elizabeth's characters, but it was just as much about Jack and Barbossa. So everyone really needed each other to make the drama and tension work for this movie.<br/><br/>Graphics: The skeleton crew of the Black Pearl are nice effects to say the least <br/><br/>Incorrect Science: The boat scene at the beginning is impossible because you would need to have the strength of 100 men plus the weight of them to keep that boat from floating to the surface, mainly because wood floats and the air trapped in it that they are using to breath would make it float more<br/><br/>Incorrect History: Granny Smith apples were not discovered until 1868 ""Bob's your uncle"" was not used until 1890 Concertina was not invented until 1829 Trapdoor gallows weren't invented until 1800 <br/><br/>Incorrect Geography: Gunships are generally too big to sail in Jamaican waters <br/><br/>Overall Feel: This movie was one of the biggest gambles Disney had made up until this point, as Disney always liked being family friendly. They found that this movie worked they would continue milking this franchise for another 5 movies up to this point. There are a lot of science and history errors in this movie, but it is made to be an action, adventure, comedy flick. I liked this movie as it had a solid cast, decent budget, good effects. Everything you would want from a fun movie which doesn't take it's self too seriously. This movie was based on the ride of Pirates of the Caribbean, but there is little to no reference to the ride in this movie, there is more reference to the previous Disney in this movie than the ride. But the movie was made to be its own movie, so it stands by its own merits and works great."

"alindsay-al","9","0","1","30 June 2014"," The best pirate film of all time
","This film is one of those that changed the landscape for film and because of its success the pirate genre is nothing but The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The story sees the undead crew of the Black pearl attempt to lift their curse by kidnapping the governors daughter Elizabeth Swann and her possessions. So old friend Will Turner and the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow attempt to rescue her for their own needs. For starters Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow has become a legendary partnership and the performance is phenomenal and unfortunately for Depp it is so good and legendary it has consumed his acting career, but in this film he is amazing. The supporting class is great as well Keira Knightly as Elizabeth was a good choice as she is passive because of her status and also heroic and aggressive when she needs to be, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner was another great choice as he is a great foil for Sparrow and is possibly the character to connect with most. Whereas Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa is a fantastic Villain and is truly evil and a great fit and foil for Sparrow. Now the one weakness possibly in this film is that the story is quite basic and predictable as it goes but this isn't a huge detriment to the film but stops it from being a 10. The script is phenomenal especially with Jack sparrow but everybody truly gets a moment to shine. The style is also really good with the epic pirates theme song, the stylised awesome fights and the undead visuals. However, the style of some of the comedy is off a little bit but not enough to take down the overall quality of the film as this is a truly fantastic film that will be tough to better for pirate films."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","10","0","1","21 May 2014"," How Disney brought back Pirates to the modern day
","There are records of pirates that date back to very early times and there are still accounts of it today. When film began to become prevalent with audiences, there were also several films made that revolved around these individuals. The life of a pirate is one of that many seek to obtain even though most would deny it. Who wouldn't want to sail around the world's oceans plundering with your friends and having a good time provided no rules? It sounds like a lot of fun. Surprisingly, as dark as this particular career can get for some people, Disney is able to portray the fictitious world of pirates where it may not be all fun and games, but it still looks like a blast (pardon the pun). There isn't any element that feels out of place.<br/><br/>After a blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) sees his love Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) captured by a band of pirates, he calls upon the help of a unique ally, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), another pirate. The writers behind the screen are Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. These guys are 2 of the 4 writers behind Aladdin (1992) and The Mask of Zorro (1998) - which has multiple swashbuckling scenes like this one. Each character has an equal amount of development and charisma to make them likable. Johnny Depp of course is the most memorable even though his name is not in the title. The film is directed by Gore Verbinksi who didn't know it at the time but would work with Johnny Depp much more after this movie.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have good chemistry and look good together as well. The captain in charge of the pirates is Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and he too puts in a good performance as the antagonist to the story. What may be surprising to viewers is just how well the writers were able to mix the violence with comical moments. This is either due to Johnny Depp's acting and rather strange facial expressions or even lesser important characters like Barbossa's men - Ragetti and Pintel. They are definitely not appealing characters but they still portray the charm needed to enjoy what they do or say even if they aren't on the good side. Again, going back to violence, the humor makes it more fun. <br/><br/>The style of action portrayed here does involve swords, which feels similar to the Zorro series but is also different because of the settings it takes place in. How many high seas adventures are popular today? Not many. Besides swords, there's also cannon fire and shoot-outs for good measure. Adding on top of that is composer Klaus Badelt's score. Thankfully, Badelt includes themes for Jack Sparrow and the whole story itself. It's very catchy and once you've heard it, you won't forget it. I'm surprised too because although Badelt hasn't made a lot of great film scores, the one's he is remembered for is extremely good. Lastly is Dariusz Wolski's cinematography, which he gets a number of nice big views of tropical scenery although I'm sure a lot of it is CGI. There really isn't anything to not like about it.<br/><br/>The characters are likable, the action and humor mix well and the music is quite memorable. If you want to see an updated look on old fashion pirates, this is the original movie to see."

"ccmcdow","10","0","1","21 February 2014"," Fantastic Film, A Must See
","Films often draw inspiration from literature, historical events and pre existing works, and screenwriters and directors adapt books the theatre and older movies into modern films. Movies have followed this pattern for a long time and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. This being said, however, creativity and demand for original content often causes deviations in patterns, and inspiration will often be drawn from unlikely sources, once classic resources have become dry. Disney has always been creative in developing imaginary worlds and fictional story lines, in many cases adapting them into rides at their massive theme parks. Creating outstanding story lines requires innovative thinking, and in the case of pirates of the Caribbean, Disney did just that. They reversed their typical cycle of adapting rides after movies and instead drew inspiration for a movie from a ride, thus creating Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The theme park ride had been around for some time, and predated the movie by almost 36 years. The content that the ride offered could be easily adapted into a film given that it depicted a historical time period rather than a modern event. Disney easily and adeptly transformed the idea of swashbuckling pirates from a ride into a movie.<br/><br/>Simply put, Captain Jack Sparrow takes the movie and straps a jet pack to it, launching it into the ozone. Captain Jack Sparrow's character brings the storyline alive and makes for a truly engaging film. In my opinion, Johnny Depp's portrayal of Sparrow is one of the best performances in any movie and is one of my personal favorites. His eccentricity and peculiar mannerisms as Sparrow make the character incredibly interesting and dynamic. Despite seeming drunk at many times Jack is, in reality, very intelligent. Jack uses his wit to be very humorous and often borders inappropriateness. The fact that Disney produced this film is about as shocking to me as it is to hear that the writers originally thought Depp's performance was terrible when it ended up making the movie. Robert Ebert, a renowned film critic had this to say about Depp's performance, ""It can be said that his performance is original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie"" (Ebert 1). Ebert follows this statement with assurance that he is not criticizing Depp's performance but rather praising it for its originality and ingenuity. The film is actually graphic in many scenes and has very subtle yet noticeable sexual connotations and adult humor in many instances. This being said it is still able to appeal to younger audiences but might come off as scary to some younger kids. On top of Depp's outstanding the performance the film does a tremendous job balancing out how much of Jack the viewer gets by including Turner, a much more level headed and traditional character. It is also interesting how the characters all seem to be chasing something. Jack is chasing the Pearl and Barbossa. Barbossa in turn, is chasing Turner, while Turner is chasing Swann. This creates an interesting dynamic and constantly keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. The brilliant settings also help make the film great. Despite being only set in the Caribbean, each location is very unique and often exaggerated. For example the island Jack is marooned on is absolutely gorgeous with perfect blue water and white sand while the Barbossa's hideout is jet is black and grim. Another fantastic location comes with the film's depiction of Tortuga. It is shown as a drunken mosh pit of gluttony where barbaric pirates drink themselves to death and fight one another yet this is all shown in a very comedic way. The Internet Movie Database rates the movie an 8.1 out of 10 which compared to many other great films is actually very high considering the highest rating given to any movie is a 9.2. Depp's acting, the other supporting characters' essential roles and the brilliant plot as well as locales make the movie a fantastic film that will set the standard for pirate films for a very long time."

"geraldcoffey","7","0","2","4 December 2013"," Good film
","I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt's performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner's in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, 'Pirates' is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy 'Pirates'.<br/><br/>That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom's performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.<br/><br/>Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you're a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that's about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that."

","Walt Disney's beloved theme park ride comes to life in the hilariously entertaining comedy-action film, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). Pirates stars Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley with a supporting cast of Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally, and Zoe Saldana. Set in the picturesque 18th century Spanish Main (part of the New World empire), Pirates of the Caribbean delivers an exhilarating adventure that will keep the viewers coming back for more!<br/><br/>The film opens with young Will Turner (Bloom) being rescued from a ship wreck by Captain Norrington's (Davenport) crew as they are sailing from England to Port Royal. Young Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) is present and discovers a medallion on the unconscious Will. She steals it, fearing he is a pirate. Eight years later, Elizabeth, who just happens to be the governor's daughter, has become quite the beauty and has captured the attention of both Captain-soon-to-be-Commodore Norrington and the all-grown-up Will Turner. Elizabeth is secretly in love with Will, however, she is unable to profess her love due to his lowly status as a blacksmith. Elizabeth's life is further complicated by the arrival of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow who after threatening Miss Swann and crossing blades with Turner, is thrown in jail. To make matters worse, a band of pirates lead by Captain Barbossa attack Port Royal and abducts Elizabeth in search of the medallion she possesses. Desperate to rescue Elizabeth, Will enlists Jack's help, who only agrees to help in order to get back his beloved ship, The Black Pearl, stolen by Barbossa. With this unlikely pair, a damsel in distress, a villainous crew of pirates who aren't all that they appear to be and plenty of sword fighting, Pirates leads its viewers on a swashbuckling adventure with an explosive finale. <br/><br/>Gore Verbinski does a fantastic job at directing this film, engaging the audience from start to finish. With contrasting scenes of light and dark, choppy angled camera shots and breathtaking panoramas of the Caribbean islands and sea, Verbinski puts the audience at the center of the adventure. After all, Pirates is based on a theme park ride, and the movie is nothing short of exciting. For example, during the epic ship battle scene, Verbinski alternates low angle, close-up shots of the ships' bows pitching in the waves with high angle, long shots of the whole ship and its crews fighting. He also uses a plethora of close-up cannons going off and guns being fired in succession with facial expressions to convey the intensity of the situation, providing an utterly thrilling sequence of scenes that creates a vicarious experience for the audience. <br/><br/>Above all else, however, is the impeccable performance by Johnny Depp. Borrowing mannerisms from rocker Keith Richards and adding his own drunken- inspired flair, Depp is convincing as a seasoned pirate with a vendetta on a no holds barred quest. Depp reaches deep into himself to bring Captain Jack Sparrow to life, completely immersing himself into his character and capturing the audience with his bad-boy charm and devil-may-care attitude mixed with his feminine swaying walk and ""guy-liner."" Balancing Sparrow between villain and hero, Depp enchants the audience into sympathizing with Jack. Much of Depp's brilliance as Sparrow is conveyed solely through the body language of Jack. Even when he has no lines, Depp's Sparrow engages the audience through quirky facial expressions and woozy bodily movements; even when he is an observing character he keeps the attention on him. Perhaps Depp's most crowning moment comes when Sparrow is marooned on an island with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann. Depp manages to play off Jack's unrestrained interest in Miss Swann without offsetting the audience who has already invested in Will and Elizabeth's love for one another, and when Elizabeth burns all of his rum, Depp brilliantly portrays Jack's baffled rage in what may be the funniest portion of the film. Although a great movie by itself, Depp elevates the film to epic status. <br/><br/>All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a wonderfully entertaining film that is great for all ages. Classic and original all in once, Pirates of the Caribbean is not your average pirate epic, but a fresh and captivating story with traditional underscores. This film is a must see for anyone who enjoys an action packed, adventure with lovable and endearing characters and larger than life special effects."

","This movie was a great into to all of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, setting the bar high straight away, Johnny Depp was the best choice for Captain Jack Sparrow and no one else could play it better, All in All, a great movie for the whole family to watch. I would recommend this to all people who like to go slightly back in time to the age of pirates and stolen treasure. The story is also great with little surprises along the way, These little twists give extra levels to the story which may not have always have been there. THe graphics for this movie are exceptional for the day and age it was made. THe way they left it was a great way for them to continue it onto the next movie."

","Elizabeth who is a governor general's daughter has a golden medal which was had by Will. They come to love each other. One night town is attacked by Barbossa and Elizabeth is caught because his aim is the golden medal. Will asks Jack for help. They go to Elizabeth's rescue.<br/><br/>This movie is so exciting. There are a lot of thrilling scenes in this film. Everyone will be able to watch it with eager anticipation. My favorite character is Will because he is so brave and he has strong feelings for her. I was surprised to watch that Barbossa and his underlings are living corpses. My favorite scene is jack's fighting scene because he is so cool and he is good at swordplay. Lastly, I think all casts' performance is very nice and good . This movie is really worth seeing.<br/><br/>The ending is happy for everyone. This movie is so interesting.

","In 1996, the movie ""Independence Day"" by Roland Emerich proved that entertainment films, which usually come out in summer (in other words, summer movies, the ones that only serve for a good popcorn) could have a high quality in various aspects from the very story, script and performances. And Gore Verbinski and the writers of ""Shrek"" (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) with ""Pirates"" proved that once again in big! ""Pirates"" has everything that a summer movie needs to be pure entertainment, from the romantic story of the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to the beautiful daughter of the governor of Port Royal (Jonathan Pryce), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). That begins to go awry when the weird pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) appears in Port Royal and soon after him the cursed crew of the ""Black Pearl"" led by the cruel Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).<br/><br/>Like I said, from romance to comedy and action, everything that a popcorn film needs. But thanks to Verbinski, everything can go much higher and better that we expected. Since the beginning, the film presents a superb script with a good, flowing and entertaining narrative (surprising for a entertainment film), that goes from memorable phrases to intelligent humor, and the plot really takes something pretty serious without exaggerating as other films have tried and failed. But it's not just comedy that elevates the film, is the ""tone-change"" that the film has: in scenes between Elizabeth and Will the film seems to have a dramatic tone but never gets to be boring or dry; when Barbossa and his cursed crew appear everything gets dark and kind of scary. But thanks to Jack Sparrow, at all times we have a really good and funny comic relief.<br/><br/>The film also contains a superb direction of Verbinski in all scenes, giving the film also pretty adventurous moments when you see the great and vast Caribbean, and also epic moments of action that range from fun choreographed chase-sequences to epic battles between pirate's ships against another. Ah, speaking of pirates, Verbinski seems to have grabbed almost all the clich√©s of pirates and thrown in the movie: one speaker parrot on a pirate's shoulder (no, neither Sparrow or Barbossa, one seems to have something against animals and Barbossa has a annoying monkey); dirty teeth and horrible breath; the favorite drink of any pirate, rum; and the British navy with elegant gentlemen leading them against pirates, and much more! Now the performances, even Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom have a good romantic connection in their characters, their acting doesn't shine much in this movie (they shine much more in the unnecessary but great sequels that the movie had). Perhaps the reason for this is the superb Geoffrey Rush, that perfectly embodying the spirit of a Pirate since the evilness to the ""aarrgghhh"", OR the highest and memorable point of the film that is the EXCELLENT performance by Johnny Depp as the unforgettable Jack Sparrow. His performance was so weird, so fun and so good that it cost him his varied roles in films like the weird and funny guy.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" can be one of the several examples that entertainment can simultaneously be VERY fun; well written; well-acted; well directed and contain a luxurious soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, ""Pirates"" is entertainment and popcorn-flick at its best and much more! 10/10"

""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is not a flawless film; there are some plot points that don't add up. But it's very unique and makes good use with what the genre has to offer.Here -- in a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced high- seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural -- Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Curse of the Black Pearl is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's such an entertaining film, I've seen it many times and I still thoroughly enjoy it every time, the story and characters are all executed very well and we are never really sure where the next scene is headed, which is great to see in a movie, you never really know what's going to happen. My only problem is that they tended to hold back on the scary moments, just when the film starts to feel like a bit of a horror and it's sending a shiver down your spine, it would make a joke or do something to completely lighten the mood of these scenes, which I do understand because it wanted to be as kid friendly as possible, but these parts would have a much better effect had they been more thrilling. The cast are of course a major part of what makes this film so great, there is excellent chemistry between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush is unrecognizeable as his character, but the star of the show is, without a doubt, Johnny Depp, it will come as no surprise with a character as flamboyant and likable as Captain Jack Sparrow that he manages to steal every scene he's in, certainly one of the most beloved movie characters of all time, for all the right reasons. Action packed, thrilling and also quite funny, I would recommend Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. <br/><br/>Will Turner must team up with wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to save the governors daughter Elizabeth Swan from a gang of pirates that have become cursed by their ship, the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Johnny Depp"

","I have never been a massive fan of Johnny Depp in the past, but I must admit that his performance in Pirates of the Caribbean was nothing short of perfect. He really stole every scene that he was in and really helped in making this a fun and entertaining feature.<br/><br/>What's also great about Pirates of the Caribbean is that the story itself is both captivating and compelling. Basically, the Pirates of the Black Pearl led by Barbossa (brilliantly portrayed by Geoffrey Rush) kidnap the governor's daughter (Keira Knightley)after they discover that she has the missing gold piece that they need to lift the curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>Upon realising that she has been kidnapped, blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) calls upon the help of eccentric pirate Jack Sparrow (amazingly performed by Johnny Depp)to help in the mission to rescue her. Turner recruited Sparrow as he is a pirate himself and was a former ally of the Pirates of the black pearl and therefore he knows where they will be heading. A crew of pirates are hand picked to assist in the rescue - there is one scene where Sparrow asks a couple of questions to one crew member, but this crew member can't speak as his tongue got ripped out so a parrot does his talking for him. Genius!<br/><br/>POTC combines all of the elements of great film making; good acting (particularly by Rush and Depp), impressive special effects, humour - Jack Sparrow is utterly hilarious - check out the scenes where he gets slapped by several different women and the scene where he is marooned on an island with Knightley's character. These scenes are absolutely hilarious. There are also plenty of battle sequences to keep fans of action happy too and these battle scenes come fairly frequently so the film never becomes dull.<br/><br/>If you like films that have a mix of humour, action, combined with a compelling story and pretty impressive special effects then look no further."

But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth Swan.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a bona fide classic, one of my 50 favorite movies! Capt. Jack Sparrow is a hero for the ages! brought to life by the lovely Johnny Depp. Depp gives a swashbuckling original performance. Curse of the Black Pearl is high seas adventure to the very end, barrels and barrels of fun! It's good and fun for every last second! Captain Jack's character introduction is excellent, at the very beginning when he first steps onto the docks from his sinking sail ship, I love that! It reveals Jack's sloppy and resourceful being as a pirate. Depp acts brilliantly and totally brings out the best in Sparrow. He acts like a drunkard. I can imagine how much fun this role would have been for Depp. The nomination was good but he should have brought home the Oscar. Orlando Bloom's attractive as young Will Turner. Depp and Bloom alone are plenty amusement for the ladies. Keira Knightley looks amazing as Elizabeth Swann as she's wonderful. She's just too good of an actress, better than even Rush or Depp. Geoffrey Rush is great as Barbossa, a creative and fun villain. The 1st Pirates of the Caribbean is the only one worth its weight in gold. The sequels pale in comparison. Each of the Pirates of the Caribbeans are worthy for Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack character if nothing else, but the 1st Pirates is the only one that's really well-crafted. Curse of the Black Pearl has great writing, gorgeous cinematography and sharp, learned dialogue. I love the visuals of this film! Pirates is funny and is one awesome family adventure! Pirates of the Caribbean is a great tale filled with interesting characters, pretty landscapes, and extravagant sets. It's really always a good viewing, it's harmless fun, and it never grows old! It'll really lightens your spirits. Pirates of the Caribbean is stylishly artful, but also, it's really very fun!"

"zennaclare33","9","0","1","19 February 2013"," Pirates of the Caribbean: More Than a Kid's Ride
","Pirates of the Caribbean has become much more than a ride at Disney World: Gore Verbinski has transformed this children's ride into a summer blockbuster. From the eccentric character of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), to the sword fights, and of course the romance, this movie has something for every moviegoer. Verbinski has created a classic that incorporates adventure, fantasy, and romance into a film that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.<br/><br/>This tale of adventure centers around the bizarre character of Captain Jack Sparrow, who's crew, years before the plot begins, planned a mutiny against him and left him on an island to die. Ironically, the crew of the Black Pearl later became cursed, and the only way to lift the curse lies in the hands of Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley), daughter of a Governor. When the crew captures Elizabeth, her oldest friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with Captain Jack to save her. The story that ensues is full of energy and an ongoing sense of adventure that will keep you captivated through all 143 minutes.<br/><br/>The key performance of the movie belongs to Johnny Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, he brings his crazy pirate character to life. From Depp's mannerisms to his wild antics, his offbeat humor shows off his likability and diversity as an actor. Captain Jack is impossible to predict and will keep you guessing what he'll do next. His character brings a fun sense of unpredictability and comic relief to this film, making Jack Sparrow nearly impossible to dislike. <br/><br/>Now what is a summer movie without a little bit of romance? Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will (Bloom) serve as this movies love sub-plot. Their love story is a classic fairytale: a poor boy falls for a girl who is out of his league, while a wealthier, more affluent man is courting her. She is kidnapped, so the poor boy goes to save her and they fall in love. While their love story is a predictable one, it doesn't necessarily take away from the plot. Elizabeth isn't your average damsel-in-distress; she is an intelligent, independent woman who often times saves herself as well as others. While the romantic aspect of this movie is relatively foreseeable, Knightley and Bloom do a fantastic job at keeping the audience interested in this storyline with their incredible chemistry.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that is a must-see on the big screen. It's visually remarkable, from its battles set on the seas surrounding the Caribbean, to the ""living dead"" beings that are the cursed crew of the Black Pearl, this movie is so action packed that is might even make you feel sea sick watching it in the theaters (but not really). This timeless film will be loved for many years to come, and it's adventurous plot will have you on a ride for it's entirety."

","Originally published on June 11, 2003: <br/><br/>Let's face facts, Johnny Depp's record in films has been pretty good throughout his career.<br/><br/>From his early efforts, ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" and ""Benny and Joon,"" to later work in ""Don Juan DeMarco,"" ""Ed Wood"" and ""Sleepy Hollow,"" he has maintained a steady run of decent performances.<br/><br/>He has also never been nominated for an Academy Award, although his terrific work in ""Ed Wood"" did earn him a well-deserved Golden Globe nod. Oscar neglect, however, may end with his latest entry, Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl,"" which, like many of his other roles, does not disappoint.<br/><br/>And even though he is not working with his favorite director, Tim Burton (this movie is helmed by Gore Verbinski, ""The Ring""), he still does a marvelous job.<br/><br/>Based on the wildly popular ride at Disneyland, which, in turn, was inspired by an episode of the 1950s TV series, ""Davy Crockett,"" the plot has Depp as the leading man,the bumbling, mascaraed pirate captain Jack Sparrow of the ship, The Black Pearl. Marooned on a deserted island as the result of a mutiny, he thus missed out on the curse the vessel was plagued by.<br/><br/>Given a blunderbuss with one bullet (in which to end his misery), he nonetheless saves it to gain revenge against his mutinous first mate, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, Oscar-winner for ""Shine""), but there is a catch. The crew of the ship has now become part of the living dead, so it may be a bit difficult to dispatch the traitor.<br/><br/>Along to aid this cause is blacksmith William Turner (Orlando Bloom, the elf in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films), who was found adrift as a young boy wearing an Aztec medallion (part of the whole curse thing), as well as Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightly, ""Bend It Like Beckham""), the daughter of the British provincial governor (Jonathan Pryce, ""Brazil"").<br/><br/>Depp, even though a dashing handsome man, is in rare form here, not afraid to look ridiculous or take a pratfall or two, but at the same time, engages in some amazing swordplay and derring-do athletics. He also carries his British accent amazingly well, albeit he does sound a bit slurred and inebriated, much like Dudley Moore in ""Arthur."" <br/><br/>With Sparrow's motley crew of handpicked pirates chasing the Black Pearl, the Royal Navy is also in tow, searching for Elizabeth. Conclusion has all three groups battling it out in a somewhat frightening denouement.<br/><br/>Picture is also peppered with not only sharp, intelligent dialogue not usually found in a Disney film, but features some obvious scenes taken directly from the ride itself. <br/><br/>Also, the cinematography (Dariusz Wolski, ""Dark City,"" ""The Mexican""), visual effects (Joel Behrens), costumes (Rochelle Best) and makeup (Greg Cannom) are top-notch and spot-on, giving this film a feeling of complete authenticity.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a fun, wonderful adventure, not unlike the attraction from which it came, one I am proud to say is still one of my favorites. <br/><br/>Beware parents of younger children, however, there are some scary sequences and frightening characters as well as some violent scenes which give this movie a PG rating - the first ever for a Disney production."

First the Friday night I attended on this two night series was packed; you simply could not fill another person in the room. This Pirates series revolves around the adventures of Captain Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who has a good heart but a mischievous spirit and a heart of a pirate. The kind Captain Sparrow simply wants to recapture a ship so that he can lead a team of merry men on the high seas. This is the problem; he crosses paths with wily Captain Barbossa who steals his ship the Black Pearl. Unbeknown to Sparrow the Barbossa crew has a curse that can only be removed from the blood of a living decedent of a pirate. With maiden Elizabeth Swann in the mix, the British fleet gets in the mix lead by a charming Commodore Norrington all to make a fun witty old school pirate tale. At first you think that the presence of a full orchestra will be a distraction but Conductor Richard Kaufman quickly took command of the ASO and they seamless blended into the background and you are transformed to a magical journey to the high seas.

","Pirates of The Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie I had no idea what to expect as I have never really took interest in action pirate movies. It turned out to be a pretty good movie with comedy, action, and a little suspense and romance thrown in. I was beginning to take a really deep interest in this movie about 1/3 of the way through. The actors were really experienced and really got into character. If the actors didn't get into character as much as these actors did or, weren't as experienced then the movie would not be as excellent as it is. They really drew me into the movie. I felt that once I saw the first movie I had to watch the whole Pirates of The Caribbean Series because the end of each movie left me hanging and I needed to see what was going to happen next. I felt the cast did a good job in keeping the viewers hanging at the end. <br/><br/>All the main actors played their roles well so it made me feel like I actually know all the characters. Johnny Depp did an excellent job in playing the pirate; Captain Jack Sparrow. It was like he was made to be Jack Sparrow his personality and everything. The director made the right choice in casting Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. He acted the part as like I knew Jack Sparrow, like I have met him in reality when he is just a fictional character in a movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and or comedy. The actors transitioned from action, to comedy, to romance all very easily. They showed that they could play the part with ease. Yes it does take a while to get the part but, these actors made it look so easy based on how well they played their part. <br/><br/>On the other hand there were some parts where the actors could have gone deeper into the part of their scene. For example during some of the fights there could have been a little more suspense. Though some fights they did a good job in building up suspense. <br/><br/>The actors throughout the movie did a good job in keeping the viewers wondering what was going to happen next. It kept me wondering through out the whole movie. I enjoyed how they kept the suspense going too. The movie was not another clich√É¬© pirate movie either, it was something different and new. <br/><br/>In conclusion I really enjoyed the whole movie. The director and script writer did a good job in filming and putting the movie together. I enjoyed how they paced it because if they wanted to they could have shortened the whole movie. The special effects on the movie didn't make the movie look bad either, they did a good job on adding them into the movie too. ""Jack Sparrow: If you were waiting for the opportune moment, that was it."" This quote means to me that you have to take the moment whether it is a good time or bad. People think all pirate movies are the same, but they are not. After watching this movie would you consider this the same as all other pirate movies?"

","I love this movie as much as I love the sequels as well. A very great beginning, though I must admit that regarding the special effect's and action sequences , they improve later in the following sequels. Nevertheless, the film is great. The plot is twisted and catchy, the action sequences are great also, especially the battle between the two ships later in the movie, the actors are very talented, they made each of their character unique and lovable, and last but not least the score is amazing and draws perfect with the epic scenes, Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer did a perfect job.<br/><br/>An awesome movie, surely worth watching. Gore Verbinski did a fantastic job. Johnny Depp portraying the funny and a bit lumpy captain Jack is beyond amazing and hilarious the same time. Geoffrey Rush portraying the cursed and twisted captain Barbossa is surely the best performance I've seen. Orlando Bloom plays the perfect knight in shinny armor for our Keira Knightley's though lady character. And also, although they play ""small"" character's, Lee Arenberg's and Mackenzie Crook's Pintel and Raggeti are by far the most hilarious little villains in the movie.<br/><br/>This being said, like I mentioned earlier a great beginning for what will be an awesome series from that day forward. Congratulations to everyone who contributed in making of this movie."

But you could have put a bunch of unknowns in this film along with Johnny Depp and the film would still have been a hit.<br/><br/>Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, who goes along with blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) as he tries to find Elizabeth Swann, his love (Knightley). She is the daughter of the governor and has been kidnapped by the awful Captain Barbossa (Rush). Barbossa and his crew live under an old curse. They're not dead but they're not alive either. The curse can't be broken without returning all of the gold with each pirate's blood back into the chest.<br/><br/>Because of the medallion Elizabeth wears, Barbossa believes she is the one he wants. If he gets her medallion and puts her blood on it, the curse will be broken. He's in for a shock.<br/><br/>There are some great special effects, suspense, and humor in this overly long film, as well as some wonderful acting, but Johnny Depp steals the film. His hilarious Jack Sparrow, based on Keith Richard, is fantastic. He makes this a film a cut above the usual adventure film by giving such a quirky performance. As he would say, savvy?"

","Disney seemed to be going down the tubes lately, with Atlantis and Home on the Range, but this movie is a masterpiece. If it wasn't for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn't be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don't buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10"

","And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney ""adventure"" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect? And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...<br/><br/>I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen ""Pirates"" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, ""Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?"" And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?"

","Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.<br/><br/>The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.<br/><br/>The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the British fleet.<br/><br/>A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story.

","The films opening scene was fantastic. It was fun and creative and really captured the essence of the Jack Sparrow that we love. It kept going for a bit. The first 20 minutes of the movie were the most exciting and fun parts of the movie except for one scene which I feel may be second best scene in all the Pirates films.<br/><br/>The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film.<br/><br/>Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes.<br/><br/>The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it.<br/><br/>It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting.<br/><br/>Positively though it is a summer blockbuster where your brain needs to be left at home and will be enjoyed by lovers of the series. It may not stay with you but for an hour and half of the movie out of the 2+ running time you will be enjoying yourself which I guess is not too bad.<br/><br/>On initial reaction to the film I gave it a 7/10 because at the time it was enjoyable. Then I thought about it and the reason I almost fell asleep twice was not because it was late, it was because the story was boring and nothing was really happening in this lengthy piece of work. Therefore on second reaction it gets a 5/10."

","Jerry Bruckheimer created a completely new genre of movie with the Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not just a pirate movie, not just a ghost movie, and not just a comedy, but all combined into one strange tale of curse, legend, and adventure. Not to mention some romance along the way.<br/><br/>The movie also created a new character, Capt. Jack Sparrow who's not even human as the hero.<br/><br/>The story is bit convoluted and difficult to understand. Why the curse started in the first place, why Jack is cursed, where the heck Davy Jones' locker came from etc. etc. Even if you've paid attention, some of the details still remains unclear, and remains that way in the subsequent sequels.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully made, although bit creepy at times. Johnny Depp's acting adds to the mysterious mood of the movie. <br/><br/>I've watched this movie several times along with its sequels, but I still haven't figured out the whole story yet."

Johnny Depp plays a drunken pirate, and a good one at that. He deserves every one of his awards. Then we come to the score, which is AMAZING! It increased your adrenaline level and it is really unique. I have never been fascinated with pirates or anything, but this film is just awesome, and every aspect is amazing.

","The best movies often start with several strikes against them. I'm thinking of starting a list: Top Ten Movies That Should Have Sucked But So Didn't. This movie will be on it. The only reason I saw it at all was that we had a teenager girl around the house at the time it came out. Look at the facts: It's based on a Disneyland ride. The ""babe"" is a scrawny, sneering plastic surgery nightmare. There are pirates in it---the kiss of death (along with hot air balloons). Those factors would normally be enough to sink any movie, but not this one.<br/><br/>Depp is magnificent---worth the price of admission all by himself. He's created one of the most memorable and quirky characters in movie history in Captain Jack Sparrow. Rush is magnificent, too. His snarling, insouciant West-of-England salty dog is the distillation of every such pirate in every such movie since Treasure Island. (Their sword fight, by the way, is one of the best in any movie any time.) Bloom holds his own without intruding, and so does Knightley, I grudgingly admit, although I couldn't get past those swollen lips with the thigh fat squirted into them with a hypodermic needle. Why don't they just tattoo a mouth on their face and be done with it? Unless you hate fun or get creeped out by ghoulishness (and I'm not talking about Knightley this time), you will like this movie."

And then Captain Jack Sparrow arrived, in one of the best movie entrances anywhere, any time, and the film took off.<br/><br/>It had a strong story, lots of eye candy, humour, action, knockabout slapstick, excitement, swashbuckling adventure, a dramatic and memorable score, an eclectic cast on top form, terrific special effects, lots of nods to the theme park ride, a cracking script, and a fabulous central performance from Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Completely unexpectedly, it turned out to be one of the best and most entertaining family films of recent years.<br/><br/>Superb."

","The pirates who infested the Caribbean in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may, in real life, have been a murderous bunch of cut-throats, but Hollywood has generally seen them as swashbuckling heroes, as in the Burt Lancaster vehicle ""The Crimson Pirate"" from the fifties. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a modern film in the same tradition. It is said to be based on a Disneyland theme park ride, although in this context the phrase ""based on"" probably means little more than ""sharing a name with"".<br/><br/>The film is set in Jamaica during the late seventeenth century, presumably before the destruction of Port Royal in an earthquake in 1692, as part of the action takes place in that city. There is, however, little attempt at period accuracy, and some of the costumes and uniforms on display seem to date from a much later period, in some cases as late as the 1770s. There are a number of other goofs; why, for example, would anyone need a warming-pan in the tropical climate of Jamaica? The plot is a complex one, which I will not summarise in full. It centres upon the rivalry between Will Turner, a blacksmith, and pirate captain Jack Sparrow for the love of Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful daughter of the British Governor of Jamaica. Despite their rivalry, and Will's detestation of all pirates, the two men have to join forces to rescue Elizabeth who has been kidnapped by Hector Barbossa, captain of the pirate ship the Black Pearl. Barbossa and his men are under a supernatural curse, laid upon them when they stole a treasure of Aztec gold. It transpires that Jack Sparrow was once the captain of the Black Pearl, but lost his command when Barbossa, against whom he has sworn vengeance, led a mutiny against him.<br/><br/>The studio did not hold out great hopes for the film; at one time Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner even wanted to drop the production. In the event, however, it proved an unexpected success, both critically and at the box office, and has spawned three sequels to date. The fact that a major character dies towards the end of the film might suggest that the producers were not anticipating a sequel; the character in question was miraculously resurrected in time for ""Dead Man's Chest"". There are, I think, two reasons for the film's success. The first is that, despite a complicated and often nonsensical plot, the story is an entertaining one which moves along at a fast pace. The film stays true to the traditions of the pirate film with some good action sequences, including an excellent hand-to-hand duel between Will and Sparrow.<br/><br/>The second reason for the film's success is some highly inventive casting. This was the film which first made a major star of Keira Knightley. The lovely Keira had already had a big success in Britain with ""Bend It like Beckham"", but was less well-known in America or internationally. In a traditional pirate movie, Elizabeth would doubtless have been played as a helpless, fragile damsel-in-distress. Today, feminist theory frowns upon this sort of portrayal of female characters, so Elizabeth becomes feisty and determined, but Keira is able to suggest an underlying fragility and vulnerability even when her character is at her feistiest. Geoffrey Rush was rather cast against type; I had always previously regarded him as the star of serious films like ""Shine"" or ""Elizabeth"", but here he plays Barbossa as a swaggering, semi-comic pantomime villain. Orlando Bloom has a difficult task; Will is, nominally at least, the romantic lead, but he is also rather strait-laced, and at times he seems rather dull by comparison with the film's real star character, Captain Jack.<br/><br/>For it is undoubtedly Johnny Depp who steals the film. Depp is sometimes an eccentric actor, but he is hardly ever a dull one. (OK, he was dull in ""Chocolat"", but then that was a very dull film). The original intention was that Captain Jack Sparrow should be played as a straightforward swashbuckler, based upon the pirates played by the likes of Lancaster or Errol Flynn. Depp, however, subverted this intention and turned Sparrow into a sort of 17th century rock star- he claims the character was based on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones- with a slightly slurred diction and a more than slightly camp manner. To traditionalists this must have seemed like an outrageously eccentric interpretation of the role, and yet somehow it works brilliantly, contrasting nicely with the more straightforwardly masculine Will. Depp even received an Oscar nomination for ""Best Actor"", a remarkable achievement for an action-adventure summer blockbuster. He, more than anyone else, is responsible for lifting ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" well above the normal standard of such blockbusters. 7/10"

","The first installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, ""The Curse of the Balck Pearl"" is the best movie from the original trilogy. Since the creators consider ""On Stranger Tides"" a reboot, I won't mention it except for this time.<br/><br/>This film is about a blacksmith in some Caribbean island that tries to get his beloved one back from the pirates who kidnapped her. In the process he teams up with the eccentric but very likable Captain Jack Sparrow. We find out later that their stories are connected somehow to the mighty ship ""The Black Pearl"", that used to be led by Sparrow before Barbossa and the rest of the pirates took it over in a mutiny.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of this movie is the plot, is not simple as you might expect from a Disney movie about pirates, it's really original, with the correct amount of adventure, romance, action and fun. I wasn't excited about this film when it came out, but when I caught on TV years after its original release, I was blown away. At this point, I watched all the movies from this series and liked all of them, but this is far superior than the other two.<br/><br/>It has some kind of magic, I was really excited when I was watching it for the first time, it made me feel something, and that is the reason why this one is better than the other two (They were not bad, but I think that they didn't match this one). It has many positive sides, like the outfits (I don't know if they were historically accurate, but they looked great nonetheless), the breathtaking scenarios, the dialog, and obviously, the actors.<br/><br/>Every actor was great. Bloom was convincing as the reluctant pirate, Keira was charming as Elizabeth, and she is beautiful, and the rest of the cast was great also. An special mention goes to both Rush and Depp who were extremely good in their roles as Barbossa and Sparrow respectively. Even if Rush plays the bad guy, is likable as a character because he was both funny and evil, and had a strong presence on screen. I won't even try to spend words to say what everyone thinks about Sparrow, nobody could possibly play that role like Depp.<br/><br/>But not everything is perfect in this movie. One of the negative aspects I found were some ""funny"" lines that felt out of place and little forced. On the other hand, it was a bit long for my taste. There are also some mistakes in the plot, but they weren't big thankfully.<br/><br/>I recommend it to everyone because is really entertaining , it has great actors in great roles, and it was like a real adventure.

","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is a hugely entertaining, comedy-cum-action-cum-horror romp, with Johnny Depp, arguably the finest Hollywood actor of his generation, running riot as Captain Jack Sparrow, reportedly modelled on Keith Richards. In terms of how the film is constructed, the nature of his role is interesting, as there's an almost conventional story without him: a romantic lead, a beautiful, feisty heroine, a love rival and an evil villain account for most of the plot without Sparrow even getting a mention. Sparrow is more like an annoying child than anything, cropping up and getting in the way, pursuing his own ambitions and desires with childish abandon. As is often said, he really is the ""world's worst pirate"", scarcely meriting being taken seriously; but instead of just being a comic extra, he's actually the film's central character. It's hard to imagine the story working without Depp in the role, but fortunately, it doesn't have to. Sit back and smile."

""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has a little in it for everybody, great action sequences, sharp, hilarious comedy, stellar characters, a great story, and of course, Jack Sparrow, who's impossible to not adore.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who teams up with a blacksmith Will Turner as they attempt to rescue Elizabeth Swann, Will's love interest, who has been captured by a cursed crew of a pirate ship called the Black Pearl, captained by the evil Barbossa. However, Jack has ulterior motives in their mission, and from there the film takes off on one of the most exciting and enjoyable action romp of the decade.<br/><br/>The characters are all brilliantly fleshed out and interesting, and sympathetic, but the character who steals the show is Captain Jack. Johnny Depp gives the performance of a lifetime with Jack, masterfully crafting a character who is incredibly sly, charismatic, funny, and yet constantly gets himself into stupid situations. Never has a character like this been committed to film, and it's immortalized through Depp. He absolutely makes this film leap from good to great.<br/><br/>The film's special effects, while somewhat dated by today's (and the sequel films) standards, still maintain a sense of charm to them and the stunt sequences are all fabulous. The action is intense and entertaining, keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The swashbuckling never gets old, and the film is always great fun.<br/><br/>Thanks to this film, the pirate genre was redefined from silly and hokey, to what ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" gives audiences: a strong story intertwined with intense action and humor.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl When the first Pirates of the Caribbean film came out in 2003, expectations were low. Recent swashbuckling fare in the cinemas had been disappointing to say the least (Cutthroat Island anyone?) and this new Disney adventure was based on a theme park ride! Early production news was generally greeted with trepidation, rather than anticipation - which made Pirates of the Caribbean such a wonderful surprise. 2 hours of rollicking adventure that harks back to the glory days of Errol Flynn and the like, and more recently films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Such was the impact of Pirates of the Caribbean that it not only spawned a trilogy (with a fourth in the works) but completely refreshed and re-launched the family adventure, leading to enjoyable imitations such as National Treasure ‚Äì and even providing the impetus for Spielberg to finally get round to making the fourth Indiana Jones movie. Even Johnny Depp can be grateful for this juggernaut of a franchise; his outstanding show-stealing performance reinvigorated his career and thrust him into the mainstream of Hollywood, as well as landing him a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The plot (such as it is), opens with a suitably creepy nautical fog scene ‚Äì which proves somewhat deliberately disingenuous for what is to come. After a misleading tone is set, a plot develops which revolves around a band of bloodthirsty pirates searching for some treasure or other in order to free themselves from a curse, with our swashbuckling heroes in valiant pursuit, trying to save the captured damsel in distress. So far, so predictable. But what makes Pirates work is that it knows how corny it is, and rather than trying to disguise it, director Verbinski and producer Bruckheimer (who has his explosive and exaggerated fingerprints all over this yarn), turn the corny all the way up to 11. What follows is a true piece of enjoyable escapist cinema. It may not be highbrow, but it sure is entertaining, and Johnny Depp is truly a revelation as Captain Jack Sparrow. For all his previously eccentric parts in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and the like, this is the role which will forever define him ‚Äì and Depp is fine with that! The treasure is little more than a macguffin, and it is the characters ‚Äì particularly Depp's Sparrow ‚Äì not the plot, which provide the basis of what is a very entertaining film.<br/><br/>Yet while Depp does steal the show, it is not solely his film. Orlando Bloom does (barely) manage to expand his emotional range from that seen in Lord of the Rings, and Keira Knightley manages to display for the first time the contradictory qualities of feisty modern heroine and elegant damsel in distress that gave her success in Pride and Prejudice and The Duchess. Geoffrey Rush however, is the equal to Depp in scene-stealing stakes, and provides a fascinating villain to the piece.<br/><br/>All the ingredients for a fully enjoyable epic adventure are here. Exotic locations? Check. Stellar (largely British) supporting cast? Check. Swordfights and chase scenes? Check. A scene-stealing heroic lead who dishes out one-liners galore? Check. Finally, an enjoyably hokum plot with some macguffin or other at its centre? Double check. All of these elements combine wonderfully to make Pirates of the Caribbean greater than the sum of its not-inconsiderable parts."

The plot was not predicting as I would have thought, so I enjoyed it very much. It is generally not good for younger children for some violence but my 8 year old brother was thrilled with it. Of course he loves Star Wars. I was glad to see that there were movies that came out later and have been very happy with all of them. I hope that the next one coming out will be as great. The Black Pearl definitely earned its way to a family fave. I definitely recommend to any family with older children. The movie gave a happy feeling throughout the house. It is just a perfect little thing. I can't seem to find a fault in the movie. It was excellent and well put together."
"mnpollio","8","0","2","28 December 2010"," A good movie lifted to greatness by Depp
","It would seem a given that an action/adventure film based on a theme ride at Disneyland would be an underwhelming disaster. However, one would be refreshingly incorrect on that score - at least as far as this film goes. An incredibly imaginative and rousing swashbuckler directed with technical finesse by Gore Verbinski and sporting a solid screenplay. The film would have been good fun on its own merits, but it has been gifted with a tremendous lead performance by Johnny Depp as the riotous Captain Jack Sparrow - a lucky pirate rogue who manages to succeed in spite of himself. The visual effects are dazzling and the film has a spirited supporting cast. Geoffrey Rush is an intimidating villain as the cursed Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley is enchanting as the gutsy governor's daughter and secret pirate groupie accidentally caught up in the adventure. Orlando Bloom brings much of the grave beauty of a young Douglas Fairbanks to his role as the more traditional hero and provides the film much of its heart. Yet the real reason to be amazed is Depp's incredible work. Any actor can take a great role and be good in it, but only a great actor can take an iffy role and turn it into a scene-stealing delight the way that Depp does here. This is the mark of a great actor and he should have walked off with the Oscar were Oscar voters not so overly entranced with Sean Penn's tiresome Method acting from Mystic River. If the film has any weakness, it is that it sports at least one ending too many and the pacing starts to flag slightly before the credits roll, but these seem trivial compared to the achievements."

","A wonderful thrill ride through the times of the swashbuckler. Johnny Depp is marvellous as the scheming captain Jack Sparrow. His use of incoherent attitudes and forte's of paragraphs of confusion, really gave the audience a good dose of how a pirate is supposed to be. A person of the sea, no quarrels with another except if a foe cheats lies or steals, but that's a pirate for you. This film was a grand scope of true adventure, to be at sea and fighting off cut throats at every corner of the ocean. Geoffry Rush was magnificent as the double crossing Captain Barbosa. And in the middle is William Turner (orlando Bloom) a man who is love with the lovely Miss Swan (Keira Knightly). Both together are and unstoppable force for good in the face of betrayal and uncompromising dastardly deeds between heathen swine and gobs who lose their eye. This movie has every element of action, locations, humour, great sword fights, and above all true Pirates Of the Caribbean."

One should not expect much from the story however, as it was inspired by a Disney Land theme park attraction. The story is a blend of action, adventure, fantasy and humor. I imagine, humor was added to lighten up the film as a whole and provide additional entertainment value, while not frightening it's targeted young audience too much. The somewhat solid story has some convenient plot points to move things along, but there is a large cast of characters: heroes and villains, to help keep things interesting.

Will Turner, a blacksmith trying to find his childhood friend, Elizabeth Swann, a hot heroine who certainly isn't a Damsall in Distress, and Captain Jack Sparrow, a wity, crazy pirate that can get out of any situation. There are many other characters too, but they would take too long too explain. My only problem with this film is the problem everyone seems to have with the third film, it's hard to follow.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Disney ride becomes a full length theatrical hit that may be as if not more exciting than the ride. Pirates throws you right into the action and never stops.<br/><br/>We begin with a young Elizabeth Swann, daughter of Gov.Weatherbee Swann who's ship rescues a young Will Turner from a wrecked ship which was destroyed by our villains which I will mention later. Eight years fly by and Elizabeth and Will are young adults.<br/><br/>Elizabeth is set to be engaged with Beckett a side character in this who plays a more important role in the sequels to come. Jack Sparrow makes his ""grand"" entrance by sailing to Port Royale on a sinking ship, tries to commandeer a new ship, then rescues Elizabeth.<br/><br/>After his heroic attempt, it is discovered he is in fact a Pirate and is sentenced to death. That night, the villains seen earlier make their appearance in Port Royale as they are looking for cursed aztec gold which Elizabeth possesses. Believing she is the descendant to Will Turner's father who's blood was needed to undo the curse, she is taken hostage. Will breaks Captain Jack out of jail and they set foot on a journey that takes them to many places and battles. I will not spoil the rest.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the first in a trilogy of movies based on the Disney ride of the same name. This movie features pretty decent performances from its actors; Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Kiera Knightly. It features some great swashbuckling action but some of the swashbuckling scenes aren't so greatly choreographed which brings me to some flaws of the movie.<br/><br/>Captain Barbossa really isn't that menacing of a villain. He is charismatic and charming sometimes wicked even, but he's no Joker, he's no Darth Vader, by far no Hanabal Lector. Sure the scenes were Barbossa and his crew turn into undead pirates are great example of the special effects in this movie, he really isn't a menacing villain and he doesn't have much of an evil plan. This movie is just meant to be fun. It doesn't have a complex plot, its a very simple plot even, but it is just meant to be good ole brainless(well I can't call this completely brainless though) summer fun.<br/><br/>Once you see this, you will be wanting to get on this ride again, I promise you. This is definitely one of the best Disney movies in quite sometime due to the declining quality of Disney movies excluding Pixar who has yet to make a bad movie to date. I give Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, despite the flaws I mentioned(the good by far outweighs the bad here), 10 swords out of 10!

","""The only negative thing I have to say, and believe me I don't want to say it, is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the black pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son."" <br/><br/>This was mentioned by random raven in his review.<br/><br/>I would like to explain the reason why the curse can be broken only by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son. The only way to break the curse of the black pearl was to return all the medallions back to the treasure chest of Cortex AND to repay the blood of all those who had stolen the treasure. Under Captain Barbossa, the Black Pearl had been searching for the last medallion (which incidentally, Elizabeth Swann came to possess at the beginning of the movie). Captain Barbossa had killed William Turner (Senior) by strapping him to a canon and firing (hence the nickname ""Bootstrap"" Turner) BEFORE they felt the curse of the treasure. Once they realized his blood was needed to break the curse, it was too late but they were aware of his son who floated on the water on the night of the mutiny (again, the opening scene). So, since William Turner (Senior) was dead, they needed the blood of his son (Orlando Bloom) to break the curse. The blood of William Turner Sr. flows through the veins of his son WT Jr. Assuming that all the others had repaid their blood debt, the blood of WT Jr. was the last remaining to be repaid and remove the curse.<br/><br/>Hope this clears up."

This odd combination is one of the funniest screen personas ever created, adding a prideful element of egocentric status to this likable adventure. Orlando Bloom is noble as he chases the beautiful Keira Knightly, but it is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa that adds the fairy tale element as the smart and commanding villain pirate, while the silly British army, always a step behind, adds a bit of comic belief.

Furthermore, his role is a second or third tier of actors/actresses - he can't dress up like a prince from the east and steal the main characters' thunder. Lastly, betraying is a tradition in the pirates world, according to the storyline, thus his betrayal to his fellow pirates doesn't reflect any ethic values.

","I remembering being completely uninterested when I first heard of this film. Understandably, seeing as how a movie from Disney based off of a ride from their theme park didn't sound as if it'd provide the strongest foundation for a feature film. It wasn't until my girlfriend of the time convinced me to watch it that I finally agreed and I'm really glad I did. This movie was nothing close to what I was expecting, blowing away every expectation I'd set for it...it was funny, exciting, engaging, and wasn't as PC or family-friendly as your average Walt Disney film. The story follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) as he embarks on a quest to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). What Jack doesn't know is that Barbossa and his crew have since acquired a curse, giving them immortality...at a price. Honestly, the story actually appears to have stronger ties to the characters of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and William Turner (Orlando Bloom), but let's face it...the pirates are better.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have really outdone themselves with this film. They have managed to bring together some incredible elements to create a memorable film that was easily one of the best movies in 2003. The production value was incredible, with excruciating detail apparent in everything from the costume design and make-up to the beautiful set design. Throw in a cast that was top-notch (and that includes the supporting players) and you've got a great conglomeration. We all know how hilarious Depp was in his iconic role as the not-as-clueless-as-he-seems Captain Jack and he alone is worth seeing this movie at least once. Equal in every way is Geoffrey Rush as the evil Barbossa, who's performance I don't feel is getting enough attention. The movie could've focused on Depp and Barbossa without all of the other plot devices and it still would've been great based on the skill of the two alone. Keira Knightley was beautiful in her role as Elizabeth and seemed to pull her weight against the heavyweight stars; Orlando Bloom, on the other hand, didn't wow me but he also didn't weaken the film. I'd wrong not to include kudos for Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally and the rest of the great cast who brought the film to life.<br/><br/>Seeing as how the major plot device involves undead pirates, the special effects were a crucial element. For the most part, they never disappoint. There are a few moments where the CGI was a bit too apparent and it throws you back into reality for a moment but only for a moment before the characters draw you back in. Writers Ted Elliot, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert did an awesome job turning nothing (an amusement park ride) into something and Verbinski took that something and created a fun, funny and most importantly memorable summer film."

Depp depicts the Captain in a way that is outrageously funny, none more so than the first viewing as you will have never seen anything like it before. The improvisations by Depp including a fine last line are superb. Timing and sophisticated approach to the man without a plan is sweet acting at its very finest and though the sequels have diminished the protagonist (not to mention awful parodies in spoof films) he is undoubtedly different.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly (Pride and Prejudice) and Orlando Bloom (The Calcium Kid) are as poor as each other and are always in Depp's light. Geoffrey Rush (Shine) is almost as fine as Depp with a talented depiction of evil and wisdom.<br/><br/>Depp's performance aside, the best element of this 2003 picture is the story. Though for me it took a couple of watches to fully comprehend, the narrative revolves around a haunted ship known by the folks as The Black Pearl. This element of the film is a symbol of freedom and an element of mystery that gives the characters chance to look upon and hope for the best. But it's the use of Aztec gold that really gets your mind working. The puzzle of the curse that is affecting the crew is a weird and wonderful element of the narrative that raises as many questions that it doesn't answer. There are twists and turns, none more so than right at the end in a final showdown if you like.<br/><br/>The plot is mainly consistent but the political edge frequently undermines the tale of legends and pirates.<br/><br/>Based on a theme park ride, Pirates produced millions on release and wasn't long before two sequels were drawn up. These undermine this first with poor scripted and effect driven stories, but will never take the shine of this fantasy adventure, which is a mostly finely acted and frequently entertaining picture with a certain character that you won't forget in a hurry."

So what's this movie about? A pirate, Jack Sparrow, is on an adventure to take back his ship (The Black Pearl) after his nemesis Captain Barbossa stole it from him. Barbossa also kidnaps a woman named Elizabeth. Turns out, Elizabeth has a coin that Barbossa and his crew are after. Meanwhile, a man named Will Turner joins Jack in an attempt to get Elizabeth back home safely. I truly can't think of anything negative about this film (hence the 5 star rating). The first thing I have to point out in terms of what's to like about Pirates of the Caribbean is the actors/characters. I truly feel that each and every actor that was cast in this film was made for the roles they were cast for. From Elizabeth's innocent yet strong personality, to Will's tough yet lovable side, and to Jack's overall silliness, everyone will find something they like about the characters. When it comes to pirate movies, there's only so much you can do with a storyline. So, of course, this movie's storyline has to have something dealing with bad pirates as well as treasure. Although the storyline may seem typical, there's enough twists and turns to keep you watching. Aiding the twists are a generous amount of jokes and humor to keep the whole family entertained. Additionally, the setting and props and costumes are incredibly realistic. So much so that I *wish* I could be there with them. After you watch Pirates of the Caribbean-The Curse of the Black Pearl, you'll be rearing and ready to watch the sequel. I just can't get enough of this movie."
"Jasper76","8","0","5","16 September 2008"," Where's all the rum gone?
","Many many years ago, the stories of pirates died in Hollywood, the interest and freshness just left it, and the name of swashbuckling piracy gathered dust in a box on a shelf in the back of a closet. Then, in 2003, Jerry Bruckheimer found the old box, dusted it off and said to himself ""Hey I could use this!"" And use it, he did. With an all-star cast and the best crew in town, Jerry set out to do the unthinkable, resurrect the pirate name. Many people, upon seeing the footage-less teaser trailer thought the film would be so bad it would be a joke, but the director, Gore Verbinki proved them all wrong. Through jolly musical themes, a surprisingly creepy plot, a fantastic cast, and awesome bits of nothing-but-fun action, Pirates of the Caribbean successfully leaves the viewer stunned, and wanting more (which, they brought, twice). If you liked Transformers, Night at the Musiem you will probably like this movie."

","Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl is not only the best pirate movie you'll ever see, it's also one highly entertaining and enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The acting is great all around. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is so crazy and comedic, he's destined to be remembered for that role for a very long time. Orlando Bloom is very good, as well as the beautiful Keira Knightley. Geoffrey Rush is also evil and grand as Captain Barbosa.<br/><br/>The score is okay. It certainly can sweep and have some soaring romantic cues, however, it's very redundant. I only recommend it to collectors and fans.<br/><br/>The ghost pirates provide for some amazing CG sequences, and are the high points in the film -- yet, Sparrow's first couple minutes on screen is the funniest and most brilliant part of the picture.<br/><br/>The writing is very good, though there's many points in the film that could've used a rewrite or two, as thing's become confusing, silly, and improbable. Gore Verbinski's direction is nicely done, though is highly unnoticeable with all the bombast going around.<br/><br/>All in all, with some ridiculously funny characters and moments, as well as some jaw-dropping visual effects, and a cool story, The Curse of the Black Pearl is a great family film. I highly recommend it."
"Mightyzebra","8","0","5","7 August 2008"," A very good film.
","This is a fun, swashbuckling, exciting, well-acted, well-plotted, obsessive and dramatic film, good for grown-ups and teens. Before you start watching this, remember that this is not for the faint-hearted.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) are the stars of this pirate film, all with very different personalities and good acting. Captain Jack Sparrow, in this film, has been a pirate for some time - and is very good at it. He leads the film on with his daring deeds, plunders and sword-play. Will Turner's character has the most surprises. He is thought to be a humble blacksmith, but instead he turns out to be a good swordsman and later, a good pirate. Elizabeth Swan is the governor's daughter, but soon it turns out that she is captured by pirates. She is very firm, brave and is not the kind of person to give up. Though she has grown up good and posh, it seems she has a bit of pirate in her too...<br/><br/>I'll save most of the plot as a surprise for you, but be prepared for a little bit of gore (but not a great amount) and some rather scary skeletons (depending on how you see them).<br/><br/>I like this film because of the actors, the adventures, the lines from the characters, the plot and the way this was made. There are some very good graphics here which work incredibly well (sometimes a little too well).<br/><br/>I recommend this film to people who are not too scared by action and just that little bit of horror and who like funny bits in action films as well. Enjoy ""Pirates of the Caribbean""! :-)"
"vip_ebriega","8","0","3","21 June 2008"," Depp and Rush play 'Pirates'.
","My Take: A charismatic and hilarious performance by Johnny Depp is the icing of the cake in this terrific, if somewhat overrated, summer flick.<br/><br/>After all the talks, the publicity and all else in its hype, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN premiered in theaters during its release date with a bang. This is a summer movie with a hype that reaches the moon, but this one actually lives up to it. PIRATES is very long, too long in fact even for a big-budget event film, but for half of its running time, PIRATES is a good ride.<br/><br/>Special effects and action scenes galore, the real treat is Johnny Depp, delightful as the drunkenly quire Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who lost his ship, the Black Pearl, to another captain (Geoffrey Rush), who is also curse with eternal damnation when they are damned to walk the earth as undead seafarers. After the crew of the Black Pearl invade the peaceful town of Port Royale and kidnaps the Governor's Daughter Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley), childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) aids the help of Sparrow to find her and get her back. Swashbuckling action and a lot of special effects ensues.<br/><br/>In fact, so much of these action and effects occupy the entire picture, yet the film does what every summer movie does: more. So much more of the stuff that already is plenty in this film gives us too much of the bargain. Special effects after special effects do get tedious after a while. Still, for a summer movie, PIRATES kept its promise, and, here's the question: Did it live up to the hype? Sure it did. Although imperfect, legions of fans will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

","What happens when Johnny Depp plays a pirate? Genius! Not only was his character charming, funny, witty, and incredibly entertaining, but it really made the film. Besides him, POTC will take you on an adventure that I can promise you will enjoy. The feel of the film is light hearted and is at times, very funny. Many consider this to be a movie just for kids, not so. From the moment the film starts it is absolutely captivating. Defanatley worth your time. The plot will not bore you, and the film is all around, fun. As one of the makers of Pirates said, ""you can't go wrong with Geoffry Rush and Johnny Depp"", and he was right. Of course its unrealistic, and it romanticizes piracy, but its fantasy. If your a free spirited person I think this film will fit you well. It deserves to be called a classic, and though Disney has swayed toward the cheesy side of things lately, this movie isn't at all. So go out and see this movie, savvy?"

When she is kidnapped by Barbosa, he and Sparrow will work together (more or less) to defeat the evil Barbosa. This is the curious thing that surprised everybody, it has anything new, special effects are nowadays typical, it should be one senseless unknown film, but it had a great success. Why? Depp's acting as Jack Sparrow was just superb (nomination to Oscar included), he is able to make o charismatic character that all becomes easy when he is by there. Showing us one of the best character presentation in the last years, he is the one who really supports the movie. Rest of characters are correct and charismatic, but it is not SO impressive, this is the main thing of the movie, all actors make a good and catching part. In addition, the special effects are fabulous (as expected in such a expensive-to-make film), it is filled with stupid funny jokes (which you laugh because they are them) and a very confusing plot (who is friend of who??), but the result is funny and absolutely enjoyable."

First of all, for resurrecting the pirate movie ""genre"" (maybe genre is not the right word, but you get what I mean) and also for sticking to Johnnys decision to play Sparrow the way he did! It's know that the studio didn't want Johnny to play it like that. They were afraid, that Johnny's performance would destroy it at the box office ... quite the opposite happened!

","Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl is without a doubt one of the most fun rides to come along in quite some time. Starting from the Disney ride, the filmmakers have fashioned a good old fashioned pirate romp that combines action, adventure and comedy almost perfectly. Johnny Depp stars as Captain Jack Sparrow, a flamboyant pirate searching for the ship that was stolen out from under him when his crew mutinied. First off, this film belongs to Depp. His performance is s near perfect that it is almost divine. He brings such a character to Sparrow that you can't help but love him even though he is a pirate. Starring as the new captain of the titular pirate ship is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa. He is truly the evil pirate that you love to hate and if anyone comes close to Depp's performance it is Rush. Rounding out the main cast are Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. While they try, they are just not in the same league as their more esteemed co-stars. Still, Pirates is good fun and a throwback to the old days of cinema. Enjoy!"
"evanston_dad","6","0","2","29 May 2007"," YO, HO, HO and a Mixed Bag of Fun
","Midway through the third installment of Walt Disney's deliriously popular pirate franchise, a character says of Capt. Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), ""Is he making this up as he goes along?"" Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series.<br/><br/>I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because ""Pirates"" is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel.<br/><br/>That sequel, ""Dead Man's Chest,"" takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. ""Dead Man's Chest"" makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, ""At World's End,"" gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The ""Pirates"" movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival ""Star Wars"" for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass?<br/><br/>The ""Pirates"" trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America. <br/><br/>Grade: ""Curse of the Black Pearl"": B ""Dead Man's Chest"": C- ""At World's End"": A-"

After I saw this movie I wanted to see the second so badly! This is a totally stupendous movie, I most definitely want you to see this as soon as possible!!"

","I have to admit, I was hesitant to see this movie because the idea sounded a bit childish, but upon seeing the commercials, I was hooked, and even taped one during a show just because it looked interesting to me. I waited until the movie was released on DVD before watching it and I sorely regret it!! After viewing ten minutes of the film I was hooked and rented the movie that very night. I then went on to watching it again and again, even renting the movie a second time just so I could watch it more.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is brilliant as daft Captain Jack. It is obvious that he truly enjoyed the character. His acting steals the show, even though the film is based around Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Geoffrey Rush is equally hilarious and evil as the undead Barbossa. Kevin McNally is thoroughly enjoyable as the older salt Joshamee Gibbs; the superstitious, story-telling pirate that Jack Sparrow visits in Tortuga.<br/><br/>I truly believe anyone with a creative imagination will have a lot of fun with this movie. It takes you out of reality and throws you into a thrilling dreamworld with pirates, sea-faring, a love story, and hilarity."

","Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are two of the main reasons to see this film. Their note-perfect and seemingly effortless portrayals of rival pirate leaders Sparrow and Barbossa fills the screen whenever they appear. Other actors are allowed their chance to shine as well, thanks to Gore Verbinski's generous direction.<br/><br/>The action is plentiful, the laughs come like a volley of cannonballs and the special effects don't overwhelm the story. What's not to like?<br/><br/>Well, er, Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, unfortunately. Shrewish and drippy respectively, neither of the two young leads has the screen presence to create a credible romance. Knightley gets more annoying as the movie progresses and I found myself hoping that someone would kill her character with another 45 minutes to go. Bloom is fine and athletic in the action sequences, but fails to convince as soon as he stops moving and starts to open his mouth.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the energy, charm and quality of this movie outshine the damp squibs of Knightley's and Bloom's performances. 'Tis a fine film, to be sure, ah-har etc..."

","When my family first watched Pirates of the Caribbean at the theater, we weren't expecting anything great. In fact, we fervently believed that it would be terrible. The commercial looked awful and the fact that it was modeled after a Disney THEME PARK RIDE almost guaranteed a flop. Boy were we wrong.<br/><br/>*SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD, BUT NOTHING BIG*<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is an incredible movie and an amazing achievement in cinema work. It combines the best of every genre and has something for everybody. I laughed my butt of when I watched this movie during its many comedic scenes, and I nearly screamed during the skeletal attack on the British ship. The action sequences are many and excellent, such as the thrilling sword fight between Bloom and Depp and the sea battle between the Black Pearl and the Interceptor. The love affair between Bloom and Nightly wasn't the movie's best part, but it won't make you cringe like Attack of the Clones' love scenes.<br/><br/>Special effects wise, POTC is very good. The skeletons are quite disturbing and the battle scenes are extremely well done. POTC doesn't set any standard for movies, but it still looks excellent.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely stellar. Bloom and Nightly do very admirably and could easily be related to. The support actors are great, particularly the stuck-up British commodore and captain Barbossa. But Depp really makes this movie shine. He delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as captain Jack Sparrow, a hilarious, daring and enigmatic figure with a strangely feminine attitude. The fact that he didn't win an Oscar for this one is a sure sign of the coming Armageddon.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best movies in history. It will blow you out of your seat and make you laugh until you throw up and is great for the whole family.<br/><br/>15 out of 10."

Geoffrey Rush is good bringing teeth-gnashing to an utmost evil yet playful pirate. Having Depp and Rush on the screen provides most of the films energy, which is more than enough. Orlando Bloom is fine in a light part, and Keira Knightley just plain enjoys herself as Elizabeth. The cinematography and special effects are remarkable. They are all convincing and entertaining. When matched with Klaus Badelts score scenes like the first time we see the sailors in full skeletal display take on an eerily lifelike quality thats unlike anything I have ever seen before.

Johnny Depp is unsurpassable as Captain Jack Sparrow and basically makes the film.<br/><br/>The storyline is essentially a rite of passage for all three main characters - Sparrow, Will Turner (Olrando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), who work their way to a secret island burgeoning with treasure to break an Inca curse inflicted when the crew of the Black Pearl took Inca gold and spent it for their pleasure. After collecting all but one piece the crew of the Black Swan encounter Miss Swann who holds the remaining piece.<br/><br/>After all sorts of complications the inevitable conclusion occurs with the curse broken and a number of potential plot lines left open for a sequel.<br/><br/>This film stands on its own as a classic, any sequel will have a lot to stand up to."

From this movie, Disney people showed that they are still alive. In this movie, the most popular actor was the 'Jack Sparrow' as Johny Depp. His acting was as special as Charlie Chaplin. He looked like a punk rock star so everybody was fascinated by him. And secondly, The captain Barbosa was good. He might the poorest actor in this movie. He acted pretty well, but it was fainted by Jack's special acting. Besides, other parts was as good as acting. Music was enough to express about pirates' lives.

","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL ****1/2 The film is an explosion of many genres - comedy, action, adventure, horror - that does each one justice. Set decorator Larry Dias and costume designers John Bright, Liz Dann, and Penny Rose do superb work to pull off a 17th century setting where the story's players become pawns in a chess match, and combat rounds, chase sequences, and redeeming efforts set off to make an extremely likable motion picture. Equal effort was given from the director (Gore Verbinski) and the numerous screenplay-writers. Johnny Depp is incredible as Captain Jack Sparrow, a slightly ""off"" pirate who longs to regain control of his beloved ship that is in the hands of his former disciple (Geoffrey Rush). He sets out to sea with a young blacksmith to take back possession of the ship and to rescue the British governor's daughter, who is held captive on the ship. Only, they find that a haunting curse is bestowed upon its crew. It doesn't take much effort to find something you like within this film, may it be its thundering adventureline, appealing cast, witty dialogue, or visually rich setting. I recommend you try it."

I agree that Depp is spectacular as Captain Jack Sparrow, and his performance makes the movie much better, but Rush's performance as Captain Barbosa is by far the most outstanding in the movie. The movie wouldn't be nearly as good without Rush's performance. The next time you watch the movie, pay special attention to Captain Barbosa (his mannerisms, the way he delivers his lines, etc.).

I am absolutely amazed by all of the sword fights in those movies and also how amazingly believable Johnny Depp is as Captain Jack. I found it remarkable that he pretty much created that character! This movie is so amazing!! So amazing, that, in fact, I watch it every single day! I am now in love with Pirates II!

I really liked the part where Will got hit on the head by the pirate with the glass. The whole movie was really good. I cant wait to see the second.

The first movie based off a Disney ride, The Tower of Terror, was a TV movie with Steve Guttenberg. The three that followed, Mission to Mars, The Country Bears, and The Haunted Mansion, were all flops. When I heard about the Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I wasn't very excited. After seeing it however, I was blown away. The movie is a visual stunner. The special effects are awesome, and the set pieces are some of the most amazing things I've seen on film. The dialogue is witty, with a few jokes meant to go over the little ones' heads. Not only that, but they actually managed to get a great story out of it.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. I was never a fan of Orlando Bloom, but he does well in this movie. I really enjoyed Geoffry Rush as the evil Captain Barbossa. As always, Johnny Depp proves with a knockout performance that he can play any role he wants, however he wants, and it will be great.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an amazingly entertaining film, perfect for all ages.

It was about a week before July 7th, i suppose and we were all very excited and wanted to do something to celebrate, but as we were camping there wasn't much to do. So, what we did do, was pulled up a long log that was fairly thick and named it the Black Pearl. From there, we sat on the log (in the water) and paddled it out for almost 1Km. Soon it became dark and freezing cold and we weren't thinking straight.As we realized we could die (we were sooo tired and cold) we began waving at speedboats that passed. Finally, after an hour and half, a boat picked us up. And so, yes it really happened, i abandoned the Black Pearl just like Jack meant to do. I almost cried. It was very funny though. So yeah, my dad gave us hell when we got back, but it was a good laugh and we gave Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Mans Chest a life threatening expedition in its name. Hope you enjoyed."

","A movie based upon a Disney theme-park ride? The day I see that would be¬Ö well, now; Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, takes the world of swashbuckling pirates, from a theme park ride as I have stated, wraps in some humour, and produces one of the best films to grace the silver screen.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is about the rescue of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbosa, the captain of The Black Pearl. To her rescue is Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who recruits the help of the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together they set after Barbosa and his crew only to discover that they are undergoing a curse, which keeps them alive forever. From beginning to end, Pirates of the Caribbean is a roller-coaster ride of laughter. There is never a joke misplaced, and it sure makes one's views of the world of pirates, far more entertaining. Fighting sequences never detract from the comedy, as there are a couple instances of humour within battle. This humour is brought to the table, most of the time, by Depp's awesome portrayal of the ingenious, yet bizarre Jack Sparrow. All other actors bring immense life to their characters, and what you get is a film where acting is at its best. <br/><br/>However, all is not well: the length of the film is questionable, as it appears to drag on for far too long then it ought to. This is sadly due to some bad editing. There are one or two scenes which weren't required in the final cut, and almost every other scene is exposed for being a few seconds too long. While some perfect editing wouldn't cut the length of the film where one would notice, it would make for some faster pacing. Perhaps the editing division was given a little more freedom then expected, and is something which should be tightened up upon in the future.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is successful on many levels that other films are not. It's not going to be the best film of our time, but will surely go down as one of the most entertaining. Comedy is carefully placed amongst times of story development and times of battle. Many will easily be reciting their favourite parts over and over again. However, due to some lazy editing, the film seems too long, but it's not a problem to get yourself tied into a knot over."

","When I watched the movie for the first time, I really loved it right away.

","Wow... i love this film, its just amazing! The actors, effects, the stunts. The list goes on! And not to mention the to hottest pirates ever! Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom! Johnny's hotter though. No one else could have played Jack Sparrow and pulled it off but Johnny, hes just brilliant! Hes eccentric, mischievous... hes a swashbuckling pirate. And his costume! So unique and new. He is the most talented actor of our generation. All of the sets and fight scenes were superb and so well in detail and the other pirates looked like what you would imagine that pirates of that time would look like, with their teeth all dirty and nasty. This movie is outstanding and so is the second pirates... I would say Dead Mans Chest is better than this one. But this movie is hard to top!"

","It was great to see Jonny Deep back playing the sexy and mischievous character of Jack Sparrow. I did think at times the humorous lines were lacking a little enthusiasm when played, but Jonny still put them across nicely with his expressions (with those wonderful mascaraed eyes!) The introduction of sea-creatures as characters was a coup d'etat in the real sense of adventure into the unknown. It reminded me of my childhood stories when you longed for the unknown or unrealistic things to happen and wanted to travel to those far off lands... (like flying on the magic carpet with Aladdin) to the point where these adventure nearly seemed real. Then the climax at the end when Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa) entered, you new your adventures were going to continue into the next episode. An entertaining film for the whole family...without the killings, swearing and overdone explosions !!"

","It is so unfortunate this movie releases alongside LOTR. Otherwise it was bound to snatch up many many awards. Black Pearl, is in all respect a classic. A super super movie, coupled with Johnny Depp's massive skills, it is just mind blowing. Its a pity that a actor of his caliber hasn't got an Academy Award in his belt. I though expect that it wont be far away.<br/><br/>The movie brings up many legendary facts, which makes it so fascinating to watch. Instances which speak of the secret Pirates Code known to none but the pirates themselves, and curses that the pirates suffer under the consequences of trying to steal a cursed treasure and lastly treachery. The movie fills you end to end with excitement. Johnny Depp is the evergreen Captain Jack Sparrow, probably the most unfortunate pirate in history, because of his ill luck, with which he always ends up loses his ship. But no one knew about his colorful past, when he was the captain of the most feared pirate ships in history, The Black Pearl. Even lesser knows of his consequences, where he was left stranded on an unhabitated island with a pistol loaded with a single bullet. He escaped by making ropes with his own hair, and he comes back to take back his ship, the Black Pearl. And with some help from young Will Turner and the aristocrat daughter of the ambassador Miss Elizabeth Swann, he succeeds in killing Captain Barbossa, and evading capture by the British army.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely well done, with a superb plot, superb direction, superb screen play, and some excellent on screen performances by Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Johnny Depp. He really does deserve some special recognition. Klaus Badelt does a good job with the music, and with some pretty neat visual effects. This is just a movie which you cannot afford missing.<br/><br/>8/10 !!!"

"johnmichael-2","10","0","3","8 July 2006"," a true, memorable summer blockbuster than MUSN'T be missed!!
","Yes, Johnny Depp was amazing in this movie. He totally deserved his Acadamy Award nomination. But credit must also go to the two other costars of this movie: Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom. They also delivered amazing performances, considering that Keira Knightly was only 18 when she got the role and Orlando Bloom had just started his movie career a few years previously. The three actors, as well as pretty much every single supporting actor and actress, gave totally believable performances.<br/><br/>Also to be credited is the absolutely wonderful screenplay. It's full of foreshadowing that really binds the movie together and helps every part make perfect sense. True, there is the fact that the pirates under the curse aren't supposed to feel anything, yet they still react to hot coals being poured on their heads and stuff like that. But that can be explained away with a little imagination, and it was pretty much the only notable mistake in the movie. Otherwise, the script is very effective and full of little subplots and extra tidbits that make a movie so fun to watch a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, etc. time.<br/><br/>I am very sad that this movie didn't win any of its five Oscar nominations. I didn't quite expect Johnny Depp to win, because his nomination was so much of a surprise in itself. But the other nominations (sound, sound editing, visual effects), and makeup were totally deserved, and it makes me cry to realize that it didn't stand a chance when going up against LOTR. If it had been another year, it would have most certainly won at least a few of those awards. Oh well.<br/><br/>In closing: this movie is bound to be a classic. It has romance, adventure, scary moments, sweet moments, great visual effects, great music, and great everything-else-that-makes-a-movie-fun-to-see. DON'T MISS IT!!"

","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp channeling Keith Richards), a deposed and left for dead pirate joins blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) on the hunt for the cursed Black Pearl, Jack's former ship until his lecherous first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) wrestled it away from him and left him stranded on an island. Jack wants his ship; Will wants the jewel of his eye the lovely Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) now held captive by the scurvy Barbossa. But these mean hombres are a bit harder to crack than usually thanks to a nifty curse that turns them into the undead. Arrrr! <br/><br/>It seems that Walt Disney Company somehow had gotten their memos crossed when they sent 'Pirates' sailing into production (the ride comes AFTER the film, not before). But no matter what is cranked out by the Bruckheimer machine is a fun romp through the spray of the Caribbean. Director Verbinski (hot off success with 'The Ring') creates an action packed walk down the plank that occasionally gets a bit long in the tooth but you know the next big sequence is right around the corner. A lot of nifty effects (the dead crew of the Black Pearl for instance) round out a nicely created production and design. On the acting front while Knightley and Bloom are fine in their roles Depp (as often is the case) steals the show as the staggering Jack whose a crafty sort but more lucky than anything. Rush chews the scenery in his own right leading up to a knock-down, drag-out with Sparrow. Good fun for the family, just keep your hands in the car."
"wolfbeem","10","0","2","8 July 2006"," Should have remained a single film
","Pirates is an instant classic and will be remembered for generations to come, assuming that the poor reputation of the sequel does not overshadow its wit and brilliance. The first story is a pop-up book adventure with cartoon-like monsters and a villain whom we all have loved to hate. The film stands on its own, and Johnny Depp brings to life the lovable pirate Jack Sparrow, who exhibits questionable loyalty and hilarious wit. I hope and pray, as a serious fan of the film, that the fine reputation of this excellent film will not be soiled by the sequel, which was apparently slopped together to entertain vid-head teenage boys. Evidently, the writers did not realize that the film's appeal was in its deep and evolving character relationships, not its special effects, and making everything bigger and more revolting was not the key factor in a successful sequel. I for one, among many I'm sure, have been harshly disappointed after three years of tense anticipation for the story of lovable Jack Sparrow and his companions."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all-time favorite movies. I forgot how much I truly loved it until I watched it again to prep myself for the sequel. Here are a few reasons why it is a such a great movie: <br/><br/>1. Original - A lot should be said for original movies. One of the things which makes this movie so great is that it is an original movie. In this generation of re-makes, comics turned movies, real-life stories turned movies, it is wonderful to be able to watch an original piece of work which is different from others you may pull off the shelf.<br/><br/>2. Good mix of genres - This movie is an action movie which uses wonderful humor, and yet also has a sort of sci-fi feel to it, with dramatic undertones. This is a difficult task for movies to accomplish, and the people who worked on this movie did a wonderful job of it. I think they used appropriate amounts of humor and drama mixed with a lot of action to keep you involved at every emotional level.<br/><br/>3. Great acting - Johnny Depp is my favorite actor. He has an amazing ability to transform into his character. In this movie, he displays this ability to us yet once again. It's like you forget Johnny Depp is in the movie and you think that Capt. Jack Sparrow is a real individual. Some people I have spoken with thought he was a little over the top, but it was his extreme acting that helped make this movie such a success. When you mix in the attractive, well-acting Keira Knightley (who looks stunning in this movie) and the superb acting of Orlando Bloom (I'm becoming a big fan of his) and Geoffrey Rush, you have a melting pot of great acting.<br/><br/>4. Fun story - Sure there may be a hole or two in the story, but if you look hard enough, you'll find some in every movie. That being said, this was an amazingly fun story. I could not help but to be entertained as the story moved along. I didn't want the story to end, and thanks to the second and third movies coming out, it won't! <br/><br/>5. Clean - There are not many clean movies made anymore. It's nice to have a great movie which has no language issues or sensual scenes. This is almost impossible to find these days. This movie is proof that you can make a great, clean movie for both adults and children (if they don't get spooked easily) to enjoy.<br/><br/>I could add some more items, but these 5 should be enough to show why this was such an excellent movie. I can only hope that the second and third ones match up to the standards which the first one has set."
"Robert_duder","9","0","3","5 July 2006"," The Epic of all Pirate films...brilliant, a classic for certain
","Pirates of the Caribbean I think came as a surprise to a lot of people. Had Hollywood gone too far...basing a film on an amusement park ride??!! Slapping a 150 million dollar budget on it and putting huge stars in the mix?? Well it wasn't a mistake and Disney knocked one out of the park with this incredible swashbuckling adventure that completely invigorates the ""Pirate"" film, not that I can think of any others at the moment. Pirates is possibly one of the greatest adventure films I've ever sat through. Completely unashamed of it's 2 1/2 hour time frame and although still to this die hyped as a kids movie it's pretty brutally violent at times with freaky undead pirates and plenty of sword play and guns blazing. Director Gore Verbinski creates this entire Caribbean world with all this legend and lore and it just draws you into it's people and places and the adventure ahead of them. It is non stop adventure!! <br/><br/>On top of all this is a guaranteed cinema classic character...the one, the only Oscar Nominated performance of Captain Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp. How can you sum up Captain Jack Sparrow, he's an anti-hero...not quite a good guy, tries very hard to be a bad guy but also has a very high moral standard according to the Pirate Code. One of the great lines in the film is when they think Jack is screwing up an attempt at stealing a ship and a naval office comments ""That has to be the worst pirate I've ever seen.."" and then tides change and they realize Jack has duped them and taken off with their ship and the same officer exclaims moments later ""That has to be the best Pirate I've ever seen.."" Depp brings the character of Sparrow to life in a way I've rarely seen. Jack Sparrow is a brilliant, vibrant, fun, hilarious, tough hero with such a unique personality. If for no other reason he makes this film and Depp IS Sparrow and deserved that Oscar nod for this. Orlando Bloom is the young handsome swashbuckler/blacksmith who gets involved in this adventure over the love of a woman. Bloom plays young William Turner who doesn't realize he is the son of a famous Pirate. Bloom who I often find rather drab and low brow seems to make that work for him in many roles and this is no exception. He still manages to be subtly vibrant and him and Depp play such an incredible duo playing off each other in action scenes and comedy all at once. This is the pirate version of a buddy cop movie and Bloom and Depp are perfect together. Bloom's performance is in many ways the exact opposite of Depp's Sparrow and it works wonderfully. He is the perfect hero...handsome, in love, quiet and strong. Keira Knightley is the lovely Elizabeth Swann, daughter of the Governor and a bit of a dreamer when it comes to adventure and pirates. Secretly in love with William Turner she is being promised to another man who is a ""better match."" Knightley is terrific as Swann because she is as strong a character as any of the male leads. She holds her own against all of them and her character is feisty, strong and holds her own in battle. She does all this while still appearing lady like as to the time of the film. The absolutely phenomenal Geoffrey Rush plays Captain Barbossa, Jack Sparrow's brutally evil nemesis who has stole his ship and crew from him but has been cursed by a treasure. Barbossa is Captain Hook with a shot of evil in him. He's brutal and convincing and Rush is brilliant. Him and Depp have terrific chemistry as enemies and he is a great adversary and probably one of the best movie villains of all time.<br/><br/>The chemistry and performance between these four actors make this film as brilliant as it could be. Add into that an absolutely stunning story and script that mixes true action with laugh out loud comedy, physical stunts and special effects. Being a huge anti-fan of CGI I was a little disappointed with the hokey look of the undead Pirate Crew, I think they could have done more with good old fashion special effects. The crew looks clunky and fake when they are CGI'd out but even still it doesn't ruin the film by any means. Adults will love this just as much as kids if kids should even see it. There is plenty of the good guys specifically the English Navy who die at the hands of pirates and the pirates are pretty brutal as well and there are some really creepy scenes and I think adults will love this one!! Don't let the Disney stamp scare you away because you can't get adventure better then this one...I guarantee it...savvy?? 9/10"
"aniterz","Null","0","2","25 May 2006"," The best film I have ever seen, savvy?
","I was amazed when I first saw it, but liked it even more when I saw it for a second time. All the characters are amazing, although there some specific ones that drag your attention from the first minute they appear on-screen. I believe one of them is Jack Sparrow. He is one of the two people that make it all worth seeing the movie. He has that very different style of walking,standing, speaking, that it is almost impossible for the viewer not to be influenced from him. (Depp got his second Oscar nomination by playing Jack Sparrow in this movie). The other one memorable character is, in my opinion, Barbossa. Brilliantly played by Geoffrey Rush, he is one of the best villains that ever appeared in the silver screen. He may be blood thirsty and vile, but what he wants most is not gold and glory, like Jack, but a chance to live again. And you can easily understand that, for all he wanted through the movie was to be mortal once again, and taste that one very desired apple. And when he finally gets rid of the curse that consumed him, he is killed from Jack Sparrow, making the viewer wander whether his death was necessary, whether he actually ever was a villain. An amazing film! It IS true that it gives a more tale-ish view on pirates, with more imagination and less reality. It's not completely fictional, though, it is just a more romantic look on buccaneers. If you want to see a pirate movie with romance, action and laughter, this is the one. Pirates of the Caribbean is an one-of-a-kind PIRATE MOVIE!<br/><br/>...and clearly a MUST!"

Johnny Depp is absolutely phenomenal as he plays the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, who is an immensely funny character. Everyone else does great as well! Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom do a great job together! Pirates of the Caribbean has everything you could ask for and more, and at the end of it you feel happy and complete. Gore Verbinski did an excellent job and it moves nicely. Everything seems to be in the right place at the right time and it rolls smoothly towards the end with no real plot holes. What small errors there are you most likely won't even notice due to the fact there is always something going on, so you won't find your eyes wondering other places. I gave it a 9 of course which is pretty much the highest rating I plan on giving until the perfect movie is made, and who knows, it might just be Pirates of the Caribbean 2!

","I certainly enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp's mugging and swashbuckling. His sly expressions. The conflict with the power structure which would like to see him hanged. The special effects are quite impressive. There are two problems that kept me from giving this the ultimate rating. It is way too long. I don't know if they edited anything out of this. The thing with the ghost ship was endless. Secondly, like a video game, there were all these rules we were supposed to remember. The ones that mortals are supposed to play by and the ones the ghosts must play by. I'm starting to feel that for some films, we should be given a handbook to keep it all straight. Perhaps an in-service of some kind. When this is mostly a pirate movie, it is great fun. There are battles; there is tongue in cheek commentary. There are beautiful women who can stand up to any man; you name it. When the supernatural element enters in, it is also fun. But there's something about being forced to kill people that are already dead. Just exactly is it that you must do? Again, play by the rules. Anyway, it's a wonderful romp. It almost gets resolved in the end, and we're ready for more."

","When i first saw Pirates i was expecting a more master and commander themes. However once it started, the acting ability of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were shown from the start. I do believe that Geoffrey Rush has been forgotten for his perfect display, it was he and Depp who made the film what is still is. This movie brings a whole new dimension to pirate movies, there hasn't been one for a while and this really did set Johnny Depp onto a fligher. The acting of Kira knightly and Orlando bloom was ordinary, but they fitted perfectly into the script and had the odd descent one liner. Pirates 2 and 3 look hopeful yet i fear it could be ruined, as not every film made is capable of having sequels. The matrix was a good tell tale fact for that."

","Though we were too late to get tickets for it, my partner and I had the good fortune (and timing) to be in Anaheim when the world premiere for PIRATES was taking place. It was his umpteenth time at Disneyland, my very first, (at age 43, yet!!!) For him, it was a revelation about seeing the Magic Kingdom through adult eyes vs. the awestruck vision of a young teenager. Even more so for me, since coming to the Magic Kingdom had been virtually all I dreamed about after seeing it so many times on ""The Wonderful World of Disney."" Needless to say, though I pretty much enjoyed myself there, a lot of the more kid-friendly attractions simply left me cold, or at the very most, lukewarm. At the top of the list of things that left me less-than-impressed? Pirates-of-the-Caribbean: The Ride.<br/><br/>The goofy joy tempered with thrills and chills that I remember, seeing the ride on a show about Disneyland itself (which has been thoughtfully included on the POTC DVD extras) was totally dissipated by a sense of ghastly horror...horror at the fact that the ride hadn't changed in nearly twenty years!!! You could even see the places on some of the animatronic figures where they had simply been patched up with spit, chewing gum and chicken wire! Even after seeing the previews, which were exciting in that bombastic Jerry Bruckheimer-way, I remember thinking as I got off the ride, ""Ohmigod. Disney is gonna lose their shirts on this one."" <br/><br/>A big budget feature based on a dilapidated theme park attraction, set in a genre that had been considered dead since that disaster known as CUTTHROAT ISLAND? What chance could Disney have of possibly turning this sow's ear into a silk purse loaded with gold doubloons? Not a single one. But miracle of miracles, they pulled it off!!! <br/><br/>Every so often, Hollywood puts together a project guaranteed to be an absolute disaster. The director is anything but a veteran, the leading man is way too quirky, unpredictable or just plain difficult, the script comes from writers who are hit-and-miss at best, and the producers are known for their plot-free, bloated behemoths of sunscreen-weather blockbusters. The end result? Like a Rube Goldberg contraption, the damn thing may actually work, but that doesn't mean it will do anything or go anywhere.<br/><br/>Yet, with Gore Verbinski (THE RING, MOUSE HUNT) at the helm, Jerry Bruckheimer (BAD BOYS 2, ENEMY OF THE STATE) producing, a script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (GODZILLA) and the inscrutable Johnny Depp in the lead, PIRATES takes the disgraced and abandoned niche of pirate movies and brings it back to life with a bang and a ""yo ho ho!"" in a way not seen since the days of the original TREASURE ISLAND or CAPTAIN BLOOD.<br/><br/>Not only that, but the film still manages to give plenty of 'nudge-wink' references to the ride upon which it is based, while still entertaining you in a wildly reckless and gleeful way that all but obliterates the memory of the original experience from your senses. Should they ever redesign and revamp the ride, they now have the blueprint for it.<br/><br/>And speaking of blueprints, I'm astonished at myself for actually looking forward to the sequel, (and that's even without the famously rumored appearance of the Stones' Keith Richard as Jack Sparrow's miserable excuse for a father.) Bringing back the fresh, naive heroism of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, who could use a solid hit right about now), the feisty sexiness of Elizabeth Turner (Keira Knightley, who has become famous for that very quality in her heroines) and the murderously jovial sensibility of Geoffrey Rush's scenery-chewing Captain Barbossa is the smartest move the filmmakers could've made.<br/><br/>Let's just hope that for this series, PIRATES 2 is more like THE GODFATHER 2, and not SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL."

It was as funny and as exciting as most of my friends had avowed. ""Pirates"" is a light-hearted action filled romp, perfect for idling away an afternoon.

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is an over-the-top romp that's just plain fun. Gee, much like an amusement park ride.<br/><br/>Too bad the roster of good actors (including from British TV comedies ""The Office"" and ""Coupling"") were clearly directed to lay it all on broadly (except Jonathan Pryce who is very atypically laid-back and therefore wasted). <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom doesn't get to do too much, Geoffrey Rush has a ball being a villain, while Johnny Depp steals the show with his loopy pirate captain (I like most folks comparison of him to Keith Richards). I figure the only reason he plays it sort of drunken and crazy is to not add an unintentional romantic triangle with a very contemporarily feisty Keira Knightley.<br/><br/>For all the action, there's too many close-ups and not enough opportunity to take it all in from a broader perspective.<br/><br/>Stay through the extensive credits (and, evidently yes, they did film some of it in the Caribbean) to see a cute plot coda.<br/><br/>The music is so bombastic and continuous that it's not completely attributed to just Hans Zimmer but to a large team. <br/><br/>(originally written 7/16/2003)"

","There is only one real reason I liked this film and can be summed up in two words - Johnny Depp. He really made the film what it is - a funny action adventure. In fact, although the the main focus seems to be around Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters (and their romance which was not very believable), Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow was the real focus and what a riot he is! The visual effects was pretty good too. Other than that though, the story itself is okay (I thought Cutthroat Island had a better story and that's saying much) and the music was average (Hans Zimmer has done better - i.e. The Lion King). But still see this film because of Johnny Depp, actor extraordinaire!"

Johnny Depp takes the part of a half maddened pirate who lost his ship years ago and subsequently arrives on an Island whereupon he encounters the blacksmith who has no expression.

","My comment is to point out something that viewers may have overlooked concerning this movie. As Captain Barbosa said, anyone who removes even a single piece from the chest will be punished forever. The curse can only be lifted when all the gold coins are returned to the chest and the blood repaid. I would like to point out that when Will Turner dropped the coin with his blood on it, and the coin with Captain Jack Sparrow's blood on it, into the chest, that that is when his father died, that is, if in fact, his father was still at the bottom of the ocean. For the almost 10 years prior to that, his father was not dead. The only way they could have needed the blood of Bootstrap Bill to lift the curse, was if Bootstrap Bill removed a coin from the chest and in doing so, he would have become one of the cursed and as such he can't die. It was right after that that he was on his way down to Davey Jones locker, namely the bottom of the ocean, thanks to Captain Barbosa. I think that most people that see this movie will get the impression that he died then but he most certainly was not dead. He can't die until the curse is lifted.<br/><br/>The fact that he was not dead for the 10 years prior to his son dropping the coin in the chest makes me wonder what he was doing all that time, so I think that maybe...<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next Pirate movie to be released.<br/><br/>For years I always said that the best movie ever was ""Kelly's Heroes."" Now, it's ""Kelly's Heroes and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" that is the best movie ever."

There are several well know actor, including: Jonny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, and Geofery Rush. All of whom did a superb acting job.

","A group of mutinous pirates, led by the villainous Barbossa, have been cursed to sail the seas as ghosts until they return every last gold coin from a stolen Aztec treasure chest. Their former leader, Captain Jack Sparrow, is seeking his revenge upon Barbossa and the return of his ship, The Black Pearl. The pirates kidnap the Governor's daughter, who possesses one of the coins, and the scene is set for a heroic rescue ...<br/><br/>Here's a movie first I think - a film based on a theme-park ride - but Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script is a tremendous action-filled pirate adventure in the classic style, with plenty of sea-dogs, cutlass waving, treasure-hunting, unrequited love and general swashbuckling. There is a lot of good-natured mugging by the likable cast, but Depp steals the show as the lovable Jack Sparrow - bold and dashing but also downtrodden and dubious, with a wonderful Cockney accent and too much mascara. Verbinski balances the film beautifully, keeping the story rolling along nicely, with action, scares, comedy and romance in equal measure. There are several terrific set-pieces; the swordfight between Depp and Bloom in a smithy, a moonlight sequence where the pirates are revealed in all their ghostly glory, a great bit where Depp and Bloom steal a ship but get caught by a faster ship and boarded and then steal that ship, and a great escape-the-hangman's-noose scene at the end. There is a wonderfully rousing score by Klaus Badelt, great visual effects by John Knoll, and Jerry Bruckheimer's production is lavish. Everybody should enjoy a good pirate movie from time to time, and this one is terrific."

","Pirates. What were they thinking? They're making a film based on a attraction at Disney land. A film based on a roller-coaster!? Are they nuts? No, they're not. Say whatever you want about Bruckheimer but he knows what the audience wants to see. Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best films so far in late years. <br/><br/>Pirates is a perfect movie too watch on a rainy afternoon. Classical Sunday matine. Give me this film, some snacks, candy and a bottle of Cola and I'm satisfied for a couple of hours. It has humor and action, two very important thing nowadays, and it has a quite good story and fantastic characters. You just got to like Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp, being a brilliant actor, gives one of his best performances so far. I don't know how much of Captain Sparrow that comes from Johnny and how much of him that's in the script but ones thing for certain: He is one of the most lovable fictional characters in a long time.<br/><br/>But just because Jack is the best character this movie doesn't lack good supporting characters. Elizabeth is a cool chick and I would like to see her use a sword in the next movie. Barbossa is a very good villain and the Thomson & Tompson like pirate duo on Barbossa ship is a funny couple. Sadly enough Will Turner is a very lame character, but he became better in the sequels. <br/><br/>Just don't expect to see a realistic movie about piracy. This movie is far from realistic. Like I've said before, it is a classic Sunday matin√©e.<br/><br/>So, to wrap things up, what do I think about ""Caribbean""? Well, it's a lovely place. It's a nice vacation for a couple of hour. It has sandy beaches, great pubs and the people are wonderful. Overall, their is only one problem with ""the Caribbean"". For some reason the rome is ALWAYS GONE!"

One of the best was Pirates of the Caribbean located in Adventure Land. This swashbuckling adventure into the heart of a pirate raid and imagination. The ride depicts pirates pillaging, drinking, eating, and having what seems to be a successful raid.<br/><br/>In Gore Verbinski's epic tale of a cursed ship and its crew trying to find their lost treasure, johnny Depp stars as the worst pirate ever, Captain Jack Sparrow. He encounters Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) after escaping from an island prison and his love interest Elizabeth Swann (Neira Knightley). The three find themselves in quite the mess.<br/><br/>When the Black Pearl sails into port, all hell breaks loose. Led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), these pirates will do whatever it takes to find their treasure. After taking Elizabeth away because she has the missing piece, Will and Jack must find a crew brave enough, or dumb enough to chase the Pearl.<br/><br/>The story featuring scenes from the ride in Walt Disney World and Walt Disney Land in California, causing this film will trigger a lot of memories for fans of the ride. The film also tells a great story with action, romance, and comedy. Depp is brilliant as mumbling, sometimes heroic Jack Sparrow, getting himself nominated for an Academy Award.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the movie that is well done is the computer generated effects like when the pirates are seen in their ""true form"". This gives the movie an eye candy effect, bringing in more viewers.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is spectacular. Appealing on all levels of cinema entertainment. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a movie not to be missed. In the words of Jack Sparrow, ""Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate,"". This one is no exception."

T.V. ads have a vibe to them also, even when the stars are those who've done great work before. If it's a ""crowd pleaser"" - which ""Pirates..."" was - I should always go with the odds, and avoid it. This thing was hardly fun, hardly witty, hardly anything. It dragged and dragged...and dragged...dragged along under it's own tedious weight. Depp is a slightly gay pirate who knows lots of others with bad teeth. There are two soldiers who take the brunt of silly jokes (the Laurel & Hardy quotient). Special effects and action are required to cover a lack of story while entertaining the small mind, and required ""twists"" are there to ""surprise"" same...all this and more added up to nothing satisfying. It's a Disney (NON-Pixar) product, and couldn't be more evident in ""McPirates of the Caribbean""."

"Citizen_Cam","8","0","2","28 March 2005"," Who would have thought? It's actually good.
","You wouldn't have thought a movie based on a ride would be any good. In fact, most rational people would think it was dreadful; a horribly cynical marketing exercise. Imagine my surprise, then, at Pirates of the Caribbean. While it would be perhaps exaggerating to say it is a cinematic masterpiece and one of the great movies of our time, it is a solidly entertaining film and wins brownie points on a number of levels. Johnny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow (the Captain bit is very important to him), a pirate who has no ship. When he comes to Port Royal, the happy-go-lucky Sparrow is caught by the marines and sentenced to hang, but he escapes when the dreaded Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his crew of evil scum of the earth (scum of the sea?), attack the port and kidnap Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), the daughter of the Governor (Jonathan Pryce). Why do they kidnap her? Because she has the last piece of a cursed treasure they plundered years ago, the return of which coupled with their blood will lift the curse upon them, the curse that has turned them into walking corpses. Of course, to say more gives away the plot twists, of which there are several. As a viewer, I spent most of the time trying to figure out if Sparrow is good or bad. Whose side is this guy on? Depp‚Äôs performance is a very curious one. He speaks in no particular accent, seemingly Irish, Australian and cockney all in one, and he leaps about the screen, smiling an odd grin and making witty repartee with the others. Depp apparently copied much of his performance from Keith Richards - now that I know that I can see the resemblance (perhaps Depp has a future as a mimic?). He is a pirate, no doubt about it, in that he can never be trusted too far; but how far, of course, is one of the points of the film. The rest of the cast are good too. Orlando Bloom plays the blacksmith unwittingly caught up in Sparrow's wake, mostly to save Elizabeth from the pirates, and does a nice job of the 'young man at sea' routine. Rush, one of my favourite Australian actors, is well cast as the villainous, cursed Barbossa (his eyes and voice always make him seem like a bad guy) and Knightly is sufficient in the role of the damsel in distress, although she comes into her own several times in the film, which is good to see. Unusually for a film like this, the plot and script are actually pretty good. The twists keep coming, the story makes sense, and there's plenty for the characters to do. There are also some very good action sequences, including the Governor's battle with a severed hand (you have to see it) and the final fight between Sparrow and Barbossa. Pirates of the Caribbean is not a movie you go and see if you're into thought-provoking, meaningful and uplifting film-making. Fortunately, I'm not. I like to be entertained, and Pirates entertains nicely. It's funny, dramatic, suspenseful; what more can you ask from a film? Well, actually you can ask for a lot more, but Pirates isn't that kind of film. As it is, it earns points in all categories, and while it's not a master stroke by director Gore Verbinski, it is a solidly entertaining movie, with a yo heave ho and even, at one point, a bottle of rum. Arrrrr. And so on and so forth. Good-o-meter rating: 8/10"

By the end of it, I was wondering, ""Who is this stunning actor acting Jack Sparrow?"" I have watched some movies of Johnny Depp without being impressed by him, hence, without concerning about even his name. But this movie was elevated by none other's but Johnny Depp's acting. A movie is never complete without the team-work but someone has to be outstanding.<br/><br/>Story, as it is obvious, is entire fiction but cleverly written and well handled. Action sequences are simple (compared to lots of other action flicks), but according to the story line, hence impressive. Special effects are stunning. All actors contributed in an impressive way.

Geoffry Rush is the perfect bad guy and Orlando Bloom can add ""Will Turner"" to his list of interesting and well played characters. The best scenes in the movie would be: 1) When Jack is talking to the English guards about him sneaking aboard the ship in an attempt to steal it and 2) Where the pirates invade Elizabeth's town and take her to the ship The movie is well directed and the music is great.

"teaspoonof21grms","8","0","2","4 February 2005"," a modern star wars/indiana jones-esquire epic blockbuster with a punch!
","This is the greatest blockbuster epic ever made! It is right on the same level as the Star Wars Trilogy, Indiana Jones Chronicles, and the Spider-Man Movies. The movie follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is a blacksmith. The Black Pearl, which is a haunted ship with a cursed crew, kidnapped the beautiful Ms. Swann (Keira Knightley) in order to undo the curse that was bestowed upon them by Cortes's gold. The reason was she was the holder of a gold coin that they stole, and they needed that coin to undo the curse. Sparrow and Turner are trying to track down and recapture the Black Pearl and Elizabeth Swann. It is a well paced story that must be watched closely for their are many new details revealed along the way of the quest.<br/><br/>The set design is impeccable, and possibly the best addition to the film was Depp's incredible performance. He was flawless as Sparrow with great comical timing that made him really stand out in the dry acting submitted by all the other actors. He definitely deserved his Oscar Nomination and probably should have won (i haven't seen mystic river).<br/><br/>The only flaws were the skeleton pirates were a little lame and Orlando Bloom is possibly the worst actor ever, but he didn't ruin the film because we had Depp to look and marvel at so you forget about Bloom. Overall, this film is one of the greatest summer releases ever made and should go down as a great film in the eyes of critics and audiences. I can't wait for the sequels which will hopefully be as strong as the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Spider-Man sequels were.<br/><br/>8/10"

It is art and it is hard to say, that it is just good or bad. But shortly: this movie is family movie and story is very simple. Characters are not preciously described, but every ""holes"" are counterbalanced by Johny Depp's acting (and Rush).

","It is usually difficult for a film to successfully combine different types of genre and remain enjoyable and easy to follow. I expect it is even harder to do this when the film is developed for children's viewing. However, with this film that combination was, in my opinion, a success. Pirates of the Caribbean emerged as an excellent blend of romance, mild horror, action and adventure. Also, the comedy - provided by the wonderful Johnny Depp - makes it irresistible to watch at least once. The actors themselves give an outstanding performance, though none so outstanding as Depp himself. He plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate with only one thing on his mind. He meets Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is in love with the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightly). During their high seas adventure, we, the audience, get a chance to admire the superb special effects which help the entire movie hit us with such an impact that we will remember it for decades to come.

It is funny, exciting, ahem, er.... sexy, and adventurous escapist fun! It is not meant to be authentic or seriously considered (against the likes of Master and Commander). Rather, it is grand art of a different sort. The key element in this film that made it superior to other pirate fantasy films is the casting. I thought both Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush were magnificent! It is their endlessly entertaining, outstanding performances that made Pirates of the Caribbean into an instant classic that is very repeatedly viewable. Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Jonathan Pryce and all the rest of the cast were all great also. When I was 8 my father took me to Disneyland for the first time. Although I was apprehensive at first (seeing the talking skull and dropping down through darkness into the caverns in a boat), I ended up loving the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and wanted to ride it again and again! This movie perfectly evoked that same feeling and reaction... creepy apprehension turning into fun adventure and humor... jolly family fun.

","This movie was something really different for the movie-goer crowd. It's not everyday that you see a pirate movie. A good motto of Hollywood is do something no one's done before. That's one of the many good points of Pirates of the Caribbean. The fact that it's supposedly based on the Disney World ride is kinda lame, considering it's no much like the ride at all. A weird, deranged pirate by the name of Capt. Jack Sparrow is our hero. At first I didn't think he was reliable to the story line. Actor Johnny Depp claims he derived the character from the lead guitarist of the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards. The plot is rather confusing and has one or two holes in it, never mind that at first it's hard to follow. Once you get the gist of it though you become swept away in the story line and the characters. With the main stars Johnny Depp, Geoffry Rush, Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom it's rather hard to go wrong, regardless of prederived thoughts. Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my favoritest movies- I got pulled into the drama and I fantasied with the characters. I'm not very hard to please so I give this movie eight stars out of ten. They could have made it easier to follow and understand. Other than that..."

"curtis-8","Null","0","2","27 December 2004"," Fun, but with a distinctly modern lack of clarity
","""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is fun, but it is Johnny Depp's great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow that holds the thing together, not any skill in storytelling on the part of the filmmakers. You have to see this thing twice to understand the convoluted plot and a good four or five times to even catch on to many of the poorly presented running gags (how long did it take you to get the ""wooden"" eyeball gag? Be honest¬Ö). I'd bet my life savings that not a single person who saw this movie ""cold"" (without reading a plot summary first) understood what the f was going on until they'd discussed it with someone or seen it again. The screenplay is partly to blame, continually doling out necessary information well after we would have really cared (Oh, THAT'S why they kidnapped Keira Knightly--wish I'd known that half an hour ago). But even though the story is convoluted in a way that only contemporary movies seem to manage, the problems aren't necessarily with the script. This same screenplay could have been filmed and all the story points and gags could have been made crystal clear without changing a word. The main problem here is that we have yet another TV commercial/music video director who has been given the reins of a huge-budget flick without ever having proved he/she can actually tell a story. The director here does put some great images up on the screen, and a few very good bits of business make it as well. But fun performances, great set design, great sfx, make up, etc don't add up to a great movie if the story is incomprehensible. And it's not just the story as a whole I'm talking about, it's tiny bits of storytelling that fail, like the previously mentioned wooden eyeball joke. This director does not know how to visually emphasize the proper elements to tell a visual story. All he is capable of is making it all look either pretty, or loud (or both). And I'll give this to the director--he does get the look of a pirate movie right. SO, annoying as the directorial shortcoming are, the film still ends up being fun. But it could have been SO much better in the hands of a director more experienced in storytelling."

As a woman, he somehow managed to be so attractive in this, despite his black and gold teeth, dirty hair and fingernails and constant inebriation.

No matter how hard you try, you can not dislike him in this movie..right down to his ""eunich"" comment to Orlando's character ""Will"" while fighting in the shop. The movie has a few twists and can be a little confusing (how is it that ""Will"" survived without becoming one of the living dead, when he was wearing the stolen medallion??) but if you watch it more than once or carefully, its there for the viewer to figure out (spells prequel). Geoffrey Rush is perfect as the villain, a shame he won't be in the ""sequel"". Ms. Knightley, a spunky, beautiful newcomer, perfectly casted as the damsel in distress. This is a must see.

I've seen it 10 times in theaters and most likely over 100 times at home on DVD. I'd recommend it not just because of the incredibly sexy main character (Jack Sparrow), but because it has something for everyone. The younger kids can laugh at the slap-stick humor, the adults can laugh at the ever-present eunich references made by Depp, and the teenagers can laugh at everything and anything.

Had anyone but Johnny been casted for this role, I think it's safe to say this film wouldn't have done as well as it did. Although Depp didn't win an Oscar, I applaud him on his nomination and I look forward to seeing him in the sequels!"

","I think this is the best film ever, and I don't care what anyone else thinks!

He is a great actor and plays his part very, very well. He's so funny to watch, and Orlando is a good actor too, and Keira Knightley.

","This movie isn't too bad. Givin that it's title is based off of a Disney ride. This doesn't really way too much on the film, as the only thing which is the same is the pirates and the Caribbean. <br/><br/>the story is not too bad, it involves pirates -- which is no real surprise. I was not expecting to see anything other then pirates, and lots of ships sailing and shooting at one another. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. Johnny Depp does a great job of moving like a lizard as Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom also does well as Will Turner. Kiera Knightley is....well....Kiera Knightley. Geoffrey Rush also does very well. <br/><br/>The special effects are pretty well done. The transformations of the pirates as they go from human from to Skeleton is pretty well done. All pretty convincing when it comes right down to it. <br/><br/>I do have one real problem with the movie, when Jack is revealed as a ghost pirate. It is never revealed how he can walk in daylight. Or why he is even a ghost pirate. Maybe they were trying to leave a cliffhanger ending for the sequel, which is apparently in the works. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a pretty good movie. If you love action, you will love this movie."

","Well, I finally got around to seeing this because I continue to hear such rave reviews and decided they can't be all wrong.<br/><br/>Turns out, I was wrong: this movie bored me bored me bored me. By the time the movie was half-over, I began waiting impatiently for the smallest sighting of Johnny Depp - any scene he was in was incredible: his acting was genius, his costume was perfect, and his Captain Jack Sparrow consumed him. During his appearances, the scenes were understandable, sensible (for a quirky Pirate movie), and extremely entertaining; I laughed aloud almost every time he was on screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, if he was not involved in a scene, it was guaranteed to be confusing and boring. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were the only actors whose lines could be understood the first time listening, I felt. I saw this on DVD with the convenience of the life-saving remote control to rewind when I couldn't get it. How did theater-goers manage?? Everyone else spoke too fast! I found myself rewinding many of Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom's lines, along with a few of the pirates. What's up with that? Why the frenetic spewing of lines? Depp's and Rush's words flowed from them as though part of their being, their essence. Masters, they are.<br/><br/>The story unnecessarily twisted back and forth - trust or don't trust, honesty or dishonesty, honor or betrayal - it went from one extreme to the other like the audience was in a secret attempt by the writers to break the Guinness Record for yo-yoing. Too much work for the audience, for too little payoff, I say; it was exhausting. I am guessing that the ride in the park is similar: back and forth and back and forth, just to the point of breaking ""the fine line,"" you know, when you are just about to throw up? Now that I think of it, the actors' quality of performances yo-yoed from scene to scene as well. Up with Depp, down with Bloom. Up and down, up and down. It could have ended far sooner than it had.<br/><br/>And the special effects, while impressive programming for video games and home entertainment centers, also did nothing for me when substituting skeletons for fleshy humans in this movie. I found the graphics an answer to the laziness in not using real humans in makeup and costume. They looked incredibly costumed and made up as human pirates, why not try the same technique for the immortal pirates? I thought it was kitschy and a cop-out.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp outperformed everyone in this movie, including the writers and director. Other than Rush, the only others who performed on nearly the same level were the two goofballs trying to prevent him from docking, and later holding the flag during the execution scene.<br/><br/>6/10"

","It's hard to review such a popular, blockbuster film as Pirates. Basically, Depp's acting is terrific. So is Geoffrey Rush's. Bloom makes another appearance in a big movie, but both his and Knightley's characters are fairly shut out due to Depp. Some great dialogue; the script is absolutely hilarious. I have to admit I loved the costuming and makeup (it's unfortunate that all its Oscar nominations occurred during the year of Lord of the Rings). The music is also wonderful, fitting the adventurish theme perfectly. Although the story has a couple flaws and there is a fair bit of Hollywood predictability, the movie counters this with humour and good storytelling. All in all, the first pirate movie of its kind - modern, funny, and adventurous."

","""But where's the rum gone!""<br/><br/>All Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, who's Erroll Flynn meets Keith Richards) wants is to drink rum, swagger and regain control of the beloved ship he was cast from, The Black Pearl. Its convenient that he stumbles across Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who both may be exploited to get the Pearl back, and has a mission of his own, rescuing the princess, which Depp can go along with...<br/><br/>Rousing, hearty, swashbuckling good entertainment. If Hollywood blockbusters were always this much fun (and always had Johnny Depp to bolster them and make them tongue-in-cheek), then i'd say more power to them. Its travesties like Pearl Harbour that insult the public's sense of taste.<br/><br/>If you can overlook the lack of effort and skills from Orlando Bloom (doing his best Matthew Broderick impersonation - which is easy, just make your face as blank as possible)<br/><br/>8/10. Its a masterpiece of the order of Back to the Future and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It lost big points from me because i found Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann to be corny and cliche, and am still amazed that people consider what Orlando Bloom does ""acting."" Plus, and maybe this is my fault, but i saw it three times within the space of a month, and by the third time its appeal was waning. It seems that unlike something like Mr Bean, or something as visually beautiful as Lawrence of Arabia, it doesn't have unlimited replayability. That probably means that its not to deep. Which it isn't - its very surface entertainment - which means you can only reap so much value from it.<br/><br/>""And really bad eggs... Drink up me 'earties, yo ho!"""

","Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl, directed by Gore Verbinksi (The Ring, and more importantly creator of the Budweiser Frogs) and starring Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands) Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) Keira Knightly (Love Actually) and as the bad guy Geoffrey Rush (House on Haunted Hill) put this together with a superb cast of extras and back of actors and you have a great cast. That's exactly what Verbinski was able to do for this movie.<br/><br/>It all starts with the Governors daughter Elizabeth Swan (Knightly) as a young girl and her meeting with Will Turner (Bloom) although I thought this was a clever idea at first it did seem a little cheesy but mainly for one reason. A certain Mr Gibbs (Kevin McNally) is on the ship and shares his thoughts on Pirates, well they're not the thoughts of love let me tell you, but yet later in the movie he has become one?!?! Maybe I missed something along the lines but I don't think the drink alone will have destroyed his naval career and led him to a life that he so hated. Anyways I digress¬Ö. This is the point in which Miss Swan sees the feared and fabled ship the Black Pearl, now personally after seeing the wreckage that she saw I'd probably try to stay away from pirates but not our miss Swan, in-fact she's probably more suited to being one herself than being just the Governors daughter. Soon enter Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) and his rum induced drunken state that seems to last the whole 137 minutes that this movie lasts (not that I blame him, so long working alongside Mr Bloom and I'd probably be drinking too) Sparrow is probably one of the best thought out and acted characters I've seen in a long time really, too often you see wooden performances because actors just turn up and read the script to the camera, Johnny Depp has gone into a lot of effort to make what he thinks and what is a believable character (hence the Oscar nomination) his great escapes from Captian Norrington are although not breathtaking are cleverly thought out.<br/><br/>But what is a good pirate movie without a great villain? And that's exactly what Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew (including the Office star Mackenzie Crook) bring to the screen. This cursed band of pirates have only one thing to look for and that's the piece of amazon gold that currently resides around the neck of Elizabeth (remember the first part with Turner? Well he was wearing this gold around his neck and the lovely Miss Swan took it from him, yes that's right politicians and their families are just plain thieves) so when Elizabeth hides her last name fearing that they're just after the Governors daughter she chooses the wrong one in Turner. So the ride begins and the story is told of Will's father being a pirate on the Black Pearl who like the rest of the crew was cursed, the curse? Well whenever the moon hits them there true selves are brought to the surface. Great CGI is used for these exceptional looking crewmen which just adds to whole experience of the movie based on the Walt Disney ride, but in the whole was it worth the price of admission? Well if I'd paid when I saw it at the cinema¬Ö.yes it would have been fortunately for me I was working there at the time so I got to see Pirates not only for free but about three days before the general release. Overall I'd give this movie 9/10 just lacking in that one aspect about Mr Gibbs I'm afraid Gore, otherwise fantastic"

","When a movie has an actor whose performance really stands out, especially in some mindless action pic, it's tempting to just give him all the credit for the movie, but I was surprised to find that there is a lot more to recommend the movie than just Depp's fascinating performance.  The movie as a whole is quite amusing, the action is well handled, especially the highly entertaining sword duel between Depp and Bloom and it's really pretty imaginative for something that was created just to capitalize on the success of an amusement park ride.<br/><br/>A movie like this is clearly designed to have a great, flashy performance. Depp was hired for that role and did it beautifully, but if not Depp, the producers would have undoubtedly gone for another actor who could give an over-the-top comic performance.  You could actually have a pretty good movie if you replaced Depp with someone more generic, but the movie couldn't really work without a big performance here.<br/><br/>The producers were very fortunate to get Depp, who is a wonderful and inventive actor.  His gives Jack Sparrow a loose-limbed charm that makes you suspect he's always slightly drunk, but while a quirky pirate he still gives you that Errol-Flynn sort of swashbuckle.  I wouldn't want to in any way diminish his credit, but I just wanted to point out that the movie is consistently well-acted and stylish in its own right."

What an Oscar-worthy performance by Johnny Depp! While I was waiting for the DVD, I watched or rewatched most of Johnny's other films. This has been rewarding, because I have found that they are generally well done and interesting. And Johnny IS a great actor! These movies aren't ""blockbusters""; I suppose that's why it didn't seem like he got the recognition before Pirates. I especially enjoyed Benny and Joon, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Donnie Brasco. Johnny deserved an Oscar for Pirates because he created a unique character and brightened a day (or many days) for millions of people. I check these reviews from time to time and I can see that many other people have similar thoughts and feelings. But I am compelled to add my comments, because people still keep questioning why some of us love this movie! Number 1, Johnny, an outstanding performance by a uniquely talented man, but there are other reasons to like or love this movie. The other performances were good, too. (Orlando, Keira, Geoffrey, and dozens of others in smaller roles) The plot was not boring, had not been done before. The first time you watch it you may think it doesn't make sense. So watch the DVD a couple of times, then watch it with the writers' comments. That will help a lot. If you still think it's a weak plot...well, that's OK.

","Without a doubt this is Johnny Depp's film. As Captain Jack Sparrow he shows once again what a versatile actor he is. He bursts forth on the screen as a wily pirate character full of tricks such as distracting his adversaries with non-stop chatter.<br/><br/>His swaggering walk unsteadied by a little too much rum and his flippant manner endear him to us immediately.  He seems to fear no man, and despite his unkempt appearance has a way with the women too.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has a mammoth task.  He is on the screen most of the time.  The success of the film largely depends on his performance.  Never once does he shirk this responsibility.  Indeed he seems to enjoy every minute.<br/><br/>The battles at sea with cannonballs flying through the air bringing down masts and rigging and gouging great holes in the decks are a triumph of set design.  Wooden ships are very inflammable and lend themselves to some dramatic moments with everything aflame amid noise and confusion.  There is almost too much to watch at one sitting.  It is just as well because the story is pretty thin.<br/><br/>The film especiaslly in the sword-fighting episodes is reminiscent of some of the early serials that once excited us at the Saturday afternoon flicks. Despite clash of steel on steel not much blood is apparent among the roguish-looking pirates who all look as if they need a hot bath. The make-up is right on target, a real credit to the artists.<br/><br/>Much of the time Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa has to act with a monkey sitting on his shoulder.  An excellent little touch I thought as it added to his nasty character.  I could not take my eyes off the monkey.  He stole every scene for me.<br/><br/>If we may judge from the almost endless listing of credits, a lot of work was put into this production.  It's loud and noisy and lots of fun and will be especially appreciated by those who grew up on pirate stories, and as in all those stories it's the good that triumphs over evil in the end."

","I probably shouldn't be writing this, having only watched half the movie. It was so boring I had to either turn it off or succumb to slumber.  The only thing that captured me was Depp and his odd posture; is he supposed to be gay?  He is a somewhat magnetic presence, but is allowed to mumble his lines to the point that he seems dubbed.  The female lead, whose name escapes me, is about as interesting as a half brick. The whole thing is just too contrived.<br/><br/>Perhaps it picks up in the second half.  Despite well staged action sequences and good production values, there is something repetitious and routine about the action.  You never for a moment lose sight of the fact that you are watching a movie, a Disney movie, much the same as the TV pap I loved every Sunday night as a child: The Disney Show (or whatever name it carried at the time).<br/><br/>Anyway, since I rented this epic, I am going to try to finish it tomorrow.

The movie is based on a theme park ride at Disneyland or Disney World. I think because I don't know which one. Pirates of the Caribbean is a sweeping action-adventure story set in an era when villainous pirates scavenged the Caribbean seas. There is a curse on this gold medallion for whenever it shines that is when Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his ghostly crew awake! When the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) is captured by these ghostly buccaneers, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with an rogue pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to fight these ghostly pirates!<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING: Will and Jack attempt to recapture The Black Pearl ship, save the British navy, and relinquish a fortune in forbidden treasure thereby lifting the curse of the Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/><br/>I really liked how this movie had lots of action and funny parts! I thought Johnny Depp did a really good job has a pirate and plus he was also really funny! Orlando Bloom did a good job too! I also thought the beautiful Keira Knightley did a great job also! I think Keira Knightley is one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen especially with her looks and her sexy English accent!<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: GREAT MOVIE WITH ACTION, ADVENTURE, THRILLS AND HUMOR!"

","I was not thoroughly impressed with Pirates of the Caribbean, as I had heard several glowing word-of-mouth reviews.  I have to admit that Johnny Depp's performance was quite hilarious and was the best thing about this movie.  One complaint is that the movie is way too long.  They could have easily chopped 30-45 minutes from this film without sacrificing anything. Another complaint is the level of violence.  I am a horror fan, and certainly am not against violence in the movies. However, the impression this movie gives prior to watching is that it is a Disney-esque film.  I think the PG rating is too leniant and the given the stabbings, shootings, and blood that abound in this film, they should have raised it. 6/10"

","I was interested to watch The Pirates of the Caribbean after knowing that it had Orlando Bloom in it (I'm not a big Orlando fan but I wanted to see how he acted outside 'LOTR'). I can tell you one thing- man I laughed my head off...especially when Bloom and Depp take over the ship. 'Gentlemen, do not panic. We're taking over this ship!'. Depp was really good and had a cool costume on. Orlando was also very good...looked different from Legolas but had only a few lines. However, one thing I did like was that the Director did try to keep things looking old without anachronistic additions and everyone did speak in British accents...and not to forget...Pirate accents as well...'Aaargh'. 'You've got to start believing in nightmares...you're in one!' . It wasn't scary as I would have imagined; the skeleton scenes and all were funny and honestly they didn't deserve an oscar nomination for special effects (Matrix Reloaded did). However, the film is great to watch when you're in a mood to watch some funny acting by Depp. Great acting by Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp and yes...also Orlando Bloom. I will watch it again if I have the time. Dunno if I will be able to watch it many times though. Good movie if you want to laugh quite a bit."

","People who hated this movie must have something wrong with them...<br/><br/>The snobs who only watch ""films"" can have a ball tearing it apart, but I think it's great.<br/><br/>I'm a huge Depp fan. Seen every movie he's in- and I mean EVERY movie (not just the typical ""I've seen Edward Scissor Hands and What's Eating Gilbert Grape so I'm an expert"" thing...). I've had to search high and low for some of them, but I did. I'm a huge fan. That being said, I admit that I was very skeptical when I first heard of Pirates coming out... I smelled perhaps another 9th Gate or something. I was saddened. BUT- I do happen to love pirates in general, and I will always see a movie that he makes, so off to the show I went.<br/><br/>And I was utterly and amazingly ecstatic. It was a GREAT movie. Yeah, yeah- so it was FUN instead of heart wrenching. Sometimes that's good- certainly it doesn't mean it's BAD just because it isn't a drama... or even because it doesn't fit into a particular genre. As billions of people have aleady said, Depp steals the show. His character is ridiculous and great. The music is really wonderful. Costumes are fun. Jokes are fun, on high and low levels. I really loved the effects of the pirates in and out of the moonlight. I'm really surprised that so many people have called the plot as a down point. I think it's neither overly simplistic nor convoluded. I thought it was clever- a twist on a typical story line. After all, we're talking about pirates here- certain things HAVE to be involved (treasure, ships, swashbuckling...). And we're talking about Johnny Depp also here- so there has to be some oddness to it as well. I think perhaps people who didn't understand the plot should pay a bit more attention...<br/><br/>I'm a person who gets uncomfortable in theater seats VERY quickly, and even so I could not believe how quickly the movie flew by. I wasn't bored once- a sign that the movie is more than a stupid thrill-getter. I actually saw it multiple times in theater (I kept having to BRING people ;)), and own the DVD. I couldn't believe it was over 2 hours- it REALLY didn't feel like it. Sometimes, I think people just like to complain for the sake of complaining.<br/><br/>Definite good entertainment. Excellent on several levels. I think my only complaints would be that- 1: I felt Orlando Bloom's character was a little ""meh"". There either wasn't a lot of depth, or he was over-emphasizing what I considered unimportant attributes. 2: I wasn't thrilled with Keira Knightly, and I'm not sure why. Didn't severely dislike her performance, but it didn't blow me away, either.<br/><br/>I would have to rank it as one of my favorite movies... which also means I really hope they don't do a sequal."

There is a sense of get ready to take off for one wild ride, but the movie drowns in its own over-the-top intentions. Before it's over, it's like watching ""The Mummy"" - idiotic, paper-thin plot; constant, jangling action scenes with no core; terrible chemistry between Bloom (he makes Keanu Reeves look like William Gillette) and Knightley; and those silly skeleton special effects! And the dang thing goes on for absolute ever!<br/><br/>Depp has been much better in much better things, but Geoffrey Rush and he are the ONLY things above water here.

","If you watch it carefully, you will see that he picks up a gold piece before he begins the fight with the Captain so Sparrow cannot be killed either. Being part of the original group that was cursed, but never having held one of the gold pieces, the curse kicks in when he takes a gold piece.  You may also notice that just before he shoots the Captain, he tosses his gold piece back to Will Turner, who completes the ending of the curse.  Thus the Captain is mortal and therefore killed by Sparrows bullet. This was a very good use of the rules by which the curse is acquired and lifted.  And I thought Sparrow was a spacey kind of guy, but apparently figured it out quite nicely.  (Good writers!)<br/><br/>Neat trick, eh?"

And the moment when the heroine has her first fainting spell, because she simply can't breathe in her whalebone corset, was hilarious. But that was the only time I laughed.<br/><br/>Other than that, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was a snorefest. I would actually rate it the most boring film I have seen in the past year.

"rsyung","Null","0","1","24 February 2004"," Curse of the Curse
","I decided to watch this movie with no expectations other than enjoying a mildly amusing romp on the high seas with cutthroats, scalawags and beloved rogues. What I got instead was a jumble of noise, special effects and long, boring stretches of interminable action. I guess I'm getting too jaded for this type of thrill-ride, cartoon-like picture, and it depresses me. Johnny Depp nominated by an Academy Award? Now I think I know why he always looks so somber at the last two awards ceremonies he's attended. He's probably realized he must be in a dream and it can't possibly be true, and he is sitting there in dread of waking up.  Anyway, about the time the curse manifested itself and Captain Barbarossa's crew turned into ghosts, I began thinking about my list of household chores to do the next day. How can an audience, even those under 20, experience the vicarious thrill of impending menace from a bunch of comical skeletons dressed in tattered pirate gear who are immune to death?  Who cares to watch dueling ghosts plunging cutlasses into each other with no ill effect?  Boring. Pirate movies are by their very nature a far remove from reality, but still√Ç‚Ä¶once things became supernatural I lost all interest.  Scenes of skeleton pirates dueling with each other belong in a videogame or perhaps a Silly Symphony cartoon of the 1930s. I think future reviews on IMDb should require the viewers to post their ages since I can't believe this movie appealed to anyone over 30. And can't we have a crowd pleaser without stereotypes, and wall-to-wall noise? One has only to look at the pacing of such classic pirate movies as `The Sea Wolf' or the first two versions of `Treasure Island' or even the silent `The Black Pirate' to see how it should be done. Dialogue peppered with token British and pirate slang rang hollow and it was all just too cute. Perhaps I've lost touch with what constitutes entertainment today, but I also think what used to be solely the realm of animation  has inappropriately been conscripted into live-action just because technology and economics allow us to do it. What a tiresome exercise this was, and its only claim to immortality will be how well the special effects hold up in ten years."

","Utter rubbish - this is just a rant as there is little worth mentioning. Poor acting, directing, editing, no plot worth thinking about and the lowest production values of any film made in the last 50 years.  This is especially noticeable in the timing between the actors - surely its a case of snipping a few frames. Is Johnny Depp impersonationg David Bowie? This really is a stinker as many TV & Radio critics have bent over backwards to emphasise. There are other bad films which are almost necessarily bad due to financial limitations and  the lack of the modern technical advances (that guy in a bear suit with a fish bowl as a helmet and flying saucers on strings). They however have acheived a cult staus, this is just drivel,  this is not bad it is awful, actually bad at being bad, which I guess is mediocre or something. Don't watch it. Don't even watch it to see how bad it is.<br/><br/>

The plot was origonal, the casting was incredible (Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush), the effects were outstanding and consistent, the music was great, and best of all, the sword fighting was great and taken seriously.

","Very rarely has an actor created a character as memorable as Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.  I, admittingly, was reluctant to see this film from the previews and the glimpses of Sparrow we caught there.  He seemed too cartoony, too silly, and not like a character I'd wind up liking.  In the film itself, however, not only does it work, but Depp alone is half the reason to see Pirates.<br/><br/>That's not to downplay Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and Keira Knightley, they play their parts well and feel natural in all their roles (I especially like Barbossa's twisted sense of humor - Rush had a lot of fun as a pirate captain), and seeing Rush and Depp share a scene was interesting since both characters were incredibly well played and the two play off one another particularly well.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that walks a dangerous line of being too serious with silly material and simultaneously being too silly with serious material (if that makes sense); however, Verbinski and the cast know when to be silly, when to be serious, and how to have fun with their production.  The film knows exactly what it is and what its doing (when its doing it), making it a perfect movie to sit back, suspend disbelief, and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Obviously, it also offers plenty of references to the Disney ride and other pirate films to catch for the remotely observant viewer.<br/><br/>The film marks, Klaus Badelt's third solo Hollywood score, and thank you Hans Zimmer for inviting this talent to the states.  Though the Pirates score reminds me of a number of previous film scores, that is by no means a complaint - he's infused it with enough personal touches and introduced enough new material to make it distinctly his own.  Like the movie, it's fun and intense at the same time.<br/><br/>In short, sure the film has its share of inaccuracies and reasons not to like it . . . but Pirates has such strong points and is enough fun to watch to stop caring about such minute details.  If you can't have fun, go rent Black Hawk Down . . ."

His witty lines, funny nature and great acting abilitys are amazing, he is convincingly the one and only ""Captain Jack Sparrow."" He leaves most of the handsome heroics, dueling and all of the loving to Orlando Bloom, a major hottie, who seems to be made for acting out extremly handsome young men with a slightly Pirate nature about them in love with gorgeous woman such as Kiera Knightly, who plays Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful young governers daughter, is a great actress, and manages to look amazing in every picture ever taken of her. Geoffery Rush draws back his eyeballs and speaks in a convincingly evil tone, and when you see his equally evil crew you think ""how much makeup did these guys need to make them looking that....ugly?"" It was..in fact, two hours work every day....at least, for Jack Danport who plays a great role as Pinnel the bloodthirsty pirate. Ok, lets review.....we have Johnny-the great and unique actor with a great sense of humor, Orlando-the handsome great guy who loves to act, Kiera-a new girl in the world of film who manages to stand out from everyone else, Geoffery-a well known and great actor....plus so many many many many many many many many more!!!!!!!

After seeing the whole film I have to say that it reminded me a great deal of what you would expect in MTV videos. Johnny Depp? When he first came on screen I thought he was drunk.  He acted throughout the whole film as would be expected of a person who had about a 2.0 blood alcohol level.  His speech was always slurred and it certainly appeared to me that he chose to play his character as though he was drunk.  It got to be a little irritating.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the film and will watch it again, no doubt, and can recommend it. However, it seemed to me that they just attempted to cram too many segments than was necessary into the film in attempting to constantly perk your interest.

That's like someone doing a donut in their car and then being accused of stealing the maneuver from the original creator, Daryll Dwebster Donut. News flash: you can't get a patent on a camera trick. Maybe a camera, yes, but not a trick! If you feel like explaining yourself, e-mail me . Title the e-mail, ""tedg's reasoning on his/her PotC:CotBP review.""<br/><br/>Sorry, just felt like rambling there for a second. Now, on to the review! While I enjoy this film quite a lot, I have to question why everyone went stark raving mad over its arrival. Sure, I have no problem saying that Pirates is a very entertaining swashbuckler, but does it really need to be on a critic's Top 10 list this year? The film may be of good quality, but there are other, better movies out there which may need the acclaim. I'm not saying my opinion is definite, mind you, but just putting it out there for debate reasons.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance is excellent, I'll give him that, what with his flamboyant interpretation of the character giving the film a big spark, but everyone on the planet has discussed him to the point where anything I say will be moot. So as for the rest of the film, I give it a definite thumbs up. The plot is well developed, the characters are appealing and believable, and I liked the gradual progression to the film's big climactic ending. However, I felt at times like it was almost too long. The recent Lord of the Rings flew by pretty quickly for me, but for some reason this film seemed to drag at certain points, as in where Jack Sparrow and the female main character get stuck on an island together. This isn't a major complaint, however, and I guess it shows how Disney was allowing the film room to grow.<br/><br/>All in all I think it's a very refreshing change for Disney to release a film like this. With a PG-13 rating which comes with boatloads of action and mild-violence, Pirates gives the usually squeaky clean image of Disney a nice dark side. Hopefully the sequel won't disappoint, and Disney won't force the filmmakers to dilute the action so that more kids will come to watch. I would hate to watch a dumbed down pirate movie with a PG rating, as it would just feel wrong.<br/><br/>Cutthroat Island this ain't; a great pirate film which champions the genre back to respectability after many major flops. 3/4 stars"

","Every now and then, and truly fun and totally escapist movie enters my radar.  I really enjoyed this movie.

As much action and special effects that were going on, it was still Depp who made this movie as much fun as it was."
"one4now4","Null","0","2","26 December 2003"," This is so bad the box should be labeled with an admonitory skull-and-crossbones
","There are so many negative things I have to say about this that I don't know where to start. I am going to cut the crap and write my review simply by noting everything I hated about this and why. 1. All of the action scenes are so boring and derivative that they are about as fun as watching plants grow. If you've seen one swordfight, you've seen 'em all, unless you've seen ""Army of Darkness"", which this is a rip-off of in several ways. 2. It would help if I cared about the characters, that way there could be some suspense. Instead, every single character was created from cardboard, no matter how good the acting jobs were. I hate to break it, but revealing more of the plot does not reveal more of the characters. All of the ""character development"" is as about as effective as the attempts in an awful z-grade horror movie I saw recently called ""Evil Town"", where a bimbo and her guy exchange childhood stories for a few seconds before getting kidnapped and doing nothing else for the story other than titillation. Anyway, back to this review, and reason number three: Did I mention that this blatantly rips off ""Army of Darkness""? 4. I was amazed at what the corporate bigwigs at Disney could get away with in a boring supernatural adventure that much better horror movies got in deep trouble for. Gee, the MPAA sure aren't playing favorites are they? 5. The plot, as you can probably guess from the title, not only really offers nothing new to the fantasy genre, but is only redeemable when resorting to a fork lodged in a guy's eyeball, a bird crapping on a guy, and renegade body parts on the move separately from the bodies they once belonged to. Have scenes like these been used in better movies? Hell, yes. At the same time, those better movies have generally been the enemy of mainstream film, which explains again why this boring dreck made it out from under the axe with a casual PG-13 rating, while much better movies are faced with full-on R ratings, or even NC-17s (depending on the current political climate). Sorry to sound redundant, but I can't get enough of trashing the MPAA because I've got fine reasons for it and believe I state my case well. 6. Also, this movie is miserably predictable. Even some of the stranger stuff I could see coming a mile away. 7. Yes, this is a movie that is way too long. For me, the three-hours-max of running time felt like an eternity. Now that I've appropriately blasted this piece of garbage for all it's worth, I would like to, in all fairness, lay down what I saw as redeemable points: gross, morbid jokes and what can be taken as an interesting comment on how those who try too hard to not conform end up conforming through their small-minded attempts at escaping a system that they feel doesn't meet their specifications. At the same time, I would finally like to note that even the redeemable points are murdered by how awful the movie is. I would rather sit through several hours of MTV than have to watch this overlong piece of devastatingly derivative rubbish ever again, for I may not be a Christian, but I certainly felt like thanking God when this movie was over."

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is certainly better than the last Disney movie based on a theme park attraction (""The Country Bears"") and one of Jerry Bruckheimer's more endurable productions - but it never really catches fire, much as director Gore Verbinski's ""MouseHunt"" and ""The Mexican"" ultimately didn't cut it either. Although the movie doesn't even wait for the Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films logos in its rush to get started (they're relegated to the very end of the movie), there's not much real excitement to be had.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush make it worthwhile as rival pirates Sparrow and Barbossa; both put so much relish in the licences to ham it up that are their roles that they fully deserve their billing and more - Depp in particular is a blast from the time we see him arrive at port on a sinking boat, and is fully in the spirit, giving the movie an energy it could use more of. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley ensure that both sexes have somebody to lust after during the two and a half hours (and both do okay in the performances, with Keira's character at least not a wimp), and the movie's certainly never dull - and unlike some other Bruckheimer efforts, never deafening - but somehow despite such a scope it doesn't take off.<br/><br/>I blame those scurvy knaves Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, who have a knack for writing movies that promise a lot and never truly deliver (admittedly they worked on ""The Mask Of Zorro"" and ""Aladdin,"" but they also have ""Small Soldiers,"" ""The Road to El Dorado"" and the 1998 ""Godzilla"" on their resume); ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" throws in ghosts, battles on the high seas, narrow escapes and swordfights, but because the movie keeps veering between an all-out adventure and... let's face it... panto, it never settles down; when you see a ship crewed by skeletons and the first thing that comes to mind is Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video, it's hard not to think you're taking the movie even less seriously than the makers want you to.<br/><br/>The score doesn't help either - many fans weren't pleased when Alan Silvestri was replaced on the project by Klaus Badelt and a whole band of other Media Ventures composers, and the resulting Hans Zimmer-soundalike doesn't help proceedings. This is a pretty good time-passer, and the work of Industrial Light and Magic, Captive Audience Productions, Digiscope, Boy Wonder etc can't be faulted (and it's nice to see that there's still a place for miniatures in these CGI days), but ""Sinbad: Legend Of The Seven Seas"" made much less money and was much more fun. And it had better music. I'll stick with ""Armageddon,"" which has Liv Tyler and is therefore instantly preferable to this one, Keira Knightley notwithstanding.<br/><br/>All that said, the scene after the end credits should NOT be missed."

","`Yo! Ho! Ho! A pirate's movie is not for me!' I always said every time I watched a torturous pirate film.

In fact, that can lead to pirate `eye-for-an-eye' warfare where it turns out too difficult for friends to patch things up. Anyway, back to pirate films. I am astonished but glad to report that `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' has broken the curse of horrendous pirate flicks. The film is based on the Disney attraction ride, and the movie does not derail from its voyage of cinematic cleverness. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, a charismatic pirate who is on a quest to regain his old ship `The Black Pearl'. Johnny be very good with his oscar-worthy performance as Sparrow. With this work, Johnny has paid his Depps I mean debts to those critics who have condemned him for not selecting roles in more commercially appealing films. It is one of the best acting pieces of the year! Co-star Orlando Bloom is blooming into a star with his role as the Blacksmith on a quest to rescue the Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann. Speaking of which, Keira Knightley√Ç‚Äòs breakthrough performance as Elizabeth was also commendable. Geoffrey Rush as the evil pirate continues to demonstrate his scene-stealing ability to portray scoundrel antagonists. Director Gore Verbinski provided just the right touch of Goreism for it to be a Gore candidate as the best film he has directed. `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is the pirate film for me!

As the love interests Orlando Bloom was fine and Keira Knightley while no where near perfect was okay.<br/><br/>
But folks at the end of the day this was pure fromage. Fun but fromage nonetheless. From the moment Captain Jack (Johnny Depp) entered the scene and stepped off his sinking boat onto the dock all you could do is burst out laughing as you knew this was, well, pure fromage. And if course it didn't stop there to the Pirate with the glass eye, Geoffrey Rush playing the baddy to the hilt, all of the sword fights and while the Pirates changing into skeltons and back again was pure fromage it was well done at least especially the final battle scene with Depp and Rush. Topping the list of fromage was the Pirates den which looked like well something you would encounter at a cheesy theme park. Of course it was based on the Disneyworld Pirate theme park so what did you expect - realism. <br/><br/>Okay this wasn't Academy Award material but Johhny Depp's performance might be and at least it was fun should save this piece of fromage from the Razzies. See it. But folks don't take this fromage too seriously. IMDB top 250 material this ain't despite its current score. 6/10."

I hadn't seen the first Disney attraction based movie ""The Country Bears,"" which was probably a good move on my part because I've heard it's a pretty awful film, and might have made me want to steer clear of this one. After seeing the theatrical trailer when I went to see ""Holes,"" I knew that I had to give it a shot. I didn't get a chance to see it in the theatres, and now that I have seen it I wish I would've found some time.

To make matters worse, these bloodthirsty pirates are cursed and will be difficult to defeat.<br/><br/>

"bobbie_8478","Null","0","1","11 December 2003"," A Pirates Tale
","The Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl may be a long winded title but the movie is no such thing.  It was a good revision of an old story.  Jack Sparrow ( Johnny Depp ) first seems to be a terrible pirate but as the movie progresses the character proves very clever.  He maneuvers himself out of several hairy situations and assists Will Turner ( Orlando Bloom ) in rescuing Miss Elizabeth Swann ( Keira Knightly ) from the evil Captain Barbossa ( Geoffrey Rush. )<br/><br/>The storyline is nothing extraordinary.  Will Turner loves Miss Swan but cannot express it because of her status.  When she is captured by Barbossa he pursues them in spite of the immanent danger.  It is loaded with adventure, lots of sword fighting, explosions, and savvy pirate lingo.<br/><br/>What set the movie apart are the interesting special effects.  When the cursed crew of the Black Pearl encounters moonlight they appear as skeletons. One scene which stands out is when they are walking under the sea as an army of skeletons.  It was a clever approach by director Gore Verbinski.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of humor in the movie.  Barbossa has a very sinister sense of humor.  Though he is supposed to be the bad guy, it's hard to hate him.  Jack Sparrow seems half-baked throughout the entire movie.  It makes his character more comical and thus easier to like.  It's the kind of comedy befitting the movie.  If it had been portrayed as a horror film it would have been a complete failure. The comical mood added to the adventure makes it an excellent watch.<br/><br/>Another good feature of the film is that Miss Swann is a take action kind of girl.  She's not the stereotypical damsel in distress.  Of course, she must not be too masculine and there are times when she's screaming her head off.<br/><br/>Will Turner is a character who attempts to remain in the good graces of society. He first refuses to accept the fact that his father was a pirate. Through the course of the film he becomes more pirate in character.  Him coming to grips with his pirate blood is a major aspect of the movie.  It is his blood which will lift the curse off of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is nothing out of the ordinary.  The bad guy dies, good prevails, the hero gets the babe, and the witty underdog gets away. Still, the movie maintains elements of excitement and its comedy masks the familiarity of its storyline.  Though it is predictable, it's a good movie to see."

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" is weird and wonderful; funny and droll, but cannot stand up over repeated viewings.<br/><br/>(Well, it can, if you check your brain at the door before taking your seat.)<br/><br/>I mean, come on now! Six, count 'em, six writers, and hundreds of workers on the film and NO ONE pointed out that the main plot falls under the film's own rules? Should we not expect more from Disney and Bruckheimer? Oh. I forgot. Disney is adept at making lies into ""popular fact""... such as their enduring lie that lemmings commit mass suicide (they pushed the little fellers off the cliff to their doom!) and teaches moms are expendable, a subtle misogyny, and more, to little kids in their animated films. (Not so subtle is the showing of a woman being hit by men... twice! Once by a large black man, enforcing nasty stereotypes, and then by the pirate captain.) Then there is Jerry Bruckheimer, well, his career has been uneven, at best. From ""Con Air"" and ""Top Gun"" to ""Kangaroo Jack"" and lots of television stuff, so perhaps we should expect non-thinking films from him.<br/><br/>So, don't examine the premise closely or it will unravel like an old knit sweater.<br/><br/>Before you holler about it being a kid movie, realize PG-13 is NOT a ""kid movie"" and Capt. Sparrows obsession with eunuchs (also see deleted scenes) is certainly NOT appropriate for the minds of 13 year old males, (who are embarking on a critical stage of sexual development with its attendant castration fears) let alone younger children. With the DVD release coinciding with the Yule season, a lot of youngsters will be getting this film, which is exactly as the marketers intended. Besides, 13 year olds are bright enough to question the film's violations of its own internal logic... even little kids are adept at pointing out movie inconsistencies these days. Taking it too seriously, you say? Well, watch the extras on the DVD, the makers took this film seriously, and obviously intended we would also.<br/><br/>**** *** ** Warning! Logic Ahead! ** *** ****<br/><br/>If Miss Swan's corset was so tight she could not breathe, and she fainted from it, then what reserve of air was in her lungs that she could survive the plunge to the depths and back up again?<br/><br/>Ol' funny eye screamed about being burned, but the cursed has no feeling as Captain Barbossa informs us.<br/><br/>How is it the cursed carried such wonderful fresh food aboard a ship when for a decade they have been unable to eat? Any food aboard makes no sense. Apples in the Caribbean in the 18th century? And how is it the blade plunged into Barbossa has blood on it when withdrawn?<br/><br/>If the cursed cannot ""die"" (and we repeatedly see them walk away after mortal wounds), then why is it that ""William 'Bootstrap' Turner"" - who was cursed by stealing the medallion - stayed dead upon being thrown to ""Davy Jones' Locker""? The other medallions were on the Isle so don't say it was because he sent the medallion to his son. If the cursed pirates can walk the ocean depths, then why not ol' Bootstrap?<br/><br/>If Capn' Sparrow can immediately become a dead and cursed skeleton upon stealing the gold medallion, then why didn't Elizabeth when she stole that same medallion in the cavern? Or young Mr. Turner who also stole it. If it makes one immediately cursed, and dead, and the dead can't bleed, how came it to be that Will Turner could bleed and thereby release the curse?<br/><br/>Why is it blood was not required of every other piece of gold retrieved?<br/><br/>If Isle de la Muerta is only found by those already knowing its location, (and still a special compass is needed) then how did the Commodore's ship find it? There was a huge squall when Sparrow made way to the isle in the 'fastest ship in the fleet', so they could not have followed.<br/><br/>What is it with Depp's accent? It doesn't quite belong anywhere, and he acts as though he is blitzed or something throughout the whole film... (he marred ""Chocolate"", one of my favorite films, with his dreadful Irish accent!) if you look carefully, you can catch sight of some of his tattoos. I wonder how he felt making the little ""France"" joke, which obviously caters to the current American distaste for the country. (More blatant and foul in the deleted scene for it, with its allusions to eunuchs, the French, and mayonnaise.) Screenwriters should be careful in period films about modern allusions as they invoke stream of consciousness thoughts, causing the mind to wander from the film, possibly never to return. If the mind does not make the connection, then there is no point to the allusion. Screen writing Russian Roulette, guys.<br/><br/>For fun, you can even sneak a peek at Bloom's LOTR elvish tattoo on his right lower forearm. I suspect he will come to regret such obvious placement. (Elijah Wood was probably wise in getting his placed below the belt line.) Bloom is an up and coming actor and I look forward to seeing him in new roles.<br/><br/>And so on. At this writing, Disney is just releasing its second film based on one of its rides, ""The Haunted Mansion"" it seems to be getting little fanfare, so maybe the trend will stop. It is, of course, better than them ruining great old films by filming remakes.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Rush is impressive as usual, and if you let the film just wash over you it can be fun. At least the first time around."

","I went in with high hopes. I admitted that Keira was hot. I even watched it a second time when it came out on DVD. <br/><br/>But it's simple - I just hate Pirates of the Caribbean. I tried not to. But I do. Everybody else likes it - why can't I? I don't know, but I just... I don't. <br/><br/>To be frank, this movie is boring. Strange, I know, because there are constant fight scenes, but something about them makes them less than entertaining. Take the fight scene in the blacksmith's shop. There was all kinds of peril and stuff, fighting on rafters, ducking under things, fighting on a cart, but it just seemed so cliched. It felt as though I'd seen it before, and I knew what'd happen next. The fact that it was an overly long fight scene didn't help matters much. This was the case with most fight scenes in the movie - they're not really outstanding in any one way. Nothing really surprised me. And again, so incredibly LONG. A fight scene should keep itself fairly short. Take the subway fight scene in the original Matrix - how long was that? 3 minutes? 4? And it kept away from cliches pretty well too. And then, after three or four minutes, the fight scene was over and we were on to a chase scene. That's the beauty of it - in a movie theater, people want to see lots of different locations and variety. Even if a fight scene isn't cliched, it doesn't do well if it's really, really long, and Pirates seemed to miss that. <br/><br/>Also, I maintain that this movie is roughly 37 hours long. It was like they had 120 minutes worth of plot, but enough film for 143 minutes, so they just said 'what the heck, do an more with the zombies and an escape scene too'. There were bits all through the movie that could have been cut out to make the movie less of an ordeal to go through. I'm not knocking long movies - Pulp Fiction, Chinatown, those movies were justified in being long because they would have sucked were they not long. Polanski didn't say 'what the hell, throw in some action scenes here' and Quentin didn't give Jules a love interest because they didn't need that, just as Pirates didn't need that escape scene on the end. <br/><br/>Maybe I just dislike this movie normally, and then hate it because everybody else likes it and I feel cool when I go against the flow. Or maybe I'm just different. I don't know, I just wish that I'd never wasted my time on this movie, that they wouldn't make a sequel, and that they'd show the marching band half time show on televised college football games rather than cutting away to a bunch of people talking."

","Just about everyone I know who saw this flick when it was initially released, raved about how funny it was, how campy the actors were, how engaging the story was. For some reason, I didn't see it until it was released for rental. Good move on my part because I only paid $1 to see this film which was clearly worth only 50 cents. How disappointing! What a fine cast -- Depp, Pryce, Rush! What a lousy screenplay! A few laughs, yes, but more out of embarrassment for the actors and the lines they had to mutter, than the fact that the content was actually funny. I know I am clearly in the minority here as a sequel has been announced! Yipes! So perhaps I missed something. Maybe so. I'm thinking it could be that I am cursed to watch over-produced, special effects cotton candy cinema. I could lift the curse, however, and it's quite simple: Avoid movies like this."

","I saw POTC at the cinema and wasn't that blown away by it to be honest. So I rented it to see if maybe I liked it more second time around, seeing as how everybody seems to rate it so highly.<br/><br/>But no, I still think it's overlong, unfunny and...just average really. It's not the worst film ever, but it certainly doesn't deserve the 'best film of the summer' taglines either. There's too much talk and not enough action IMO, and the leads are pretty to look at, but utterly bland in the acting stakes (Bloom and Knightley have all the sexual chemistry of two wet towels being thrown together). And Depp is just annoying. What's so 'brave' about a performance that basically comes down to pretending to be drunk for the entire movie. Brave? I'd call it lazy if anything. And I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, before you beat me with clubs.<br/><br/>Cutthroat Island however, is a much better pirate movie IMO. Hell, all the best action in POTC is stolen from this very movie (the monkey, the ship-to-ship firefight, characters getting trapped in the hold before the ship blows up).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I liked POTC, but can't help but feel it's hugely overrated, especially compared to the bombastic action in Cutthroat Island.

","I watched PoTC on my friend's birthday, and honestly, the money was rather wasted. Most of my friends went to watch ""Orli"", and unfortunately, we do not see his valor such as the role of Legolas in this movie. Rather, as my friend (who went to watch Johnny Depp, not Orlando Bloom) said, ""He looks like a sick puppy who was kicked in the ribs"". I also felt that Will Turner pretty much gets to do anything he wants, because he's a hero. So not. So if you are going to watch your Orli, don't bother.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, on the other hand, showed a wonderful performance. Wild, funny, and a bit crazed, he acts as a ""gentleman-Pirate"" who can't live without rum. He is probably the only one who upholds the dignity of this movie as a movie. He's a typical pirate, rather in a slight lewd way, his drunkenness, and his crazy acts.<br/><br/>Captain Burbosa acted as a typical bad pirate, but he strongly reminded me of Captain Hook from Peter Pan.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Schwann... different story. She acts as a typical Mary-Sue, a pretty rich girl who gets abducted and turns a warrior and marries her love. Wonderful. Congrats. The end. This typical ""Hero-girl"" storyline might make viewers puke. Between Will Turner and Elizabeth Schwann, a world of 'I love you, you love me' unfolds, and they dramatically ""gets over the difference of class"" by dumping poor Captain Norrington. Although Keira Knightley is a good actress, there is little doubt that this role is messed up.<br/><br/>Action scenes are so muddled that I don't remember anything except skeletons dancing or some other similarity, which is ridiculous.

","I have mostly praise for Pirates. Johnny Depp absolutely carries the movie with his exceptionally brilliant, somewhat comedic, performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. He was everything you could imagine a pirate to be - a sly thief with a swagger in his step and nothing but a desire to sail his beloved ship on the high seas. Orlando Bloom (personally, my favorite actor)gave a nice performance as heroic blacksmith Will Turner and Kiera Knightly played Turner's captured love interest Elizabeth Swann. Also, great performances by Geoffrey Rush as Jack Sparrow's undead enemy Captain Barbossa and Jack Davenport(whom I love in the British sitcom, Coupling) as Commodore Norrington. Another great attribute of this film was it's soundtrack. Klaus Badlet hit the nail on the head..perfect Pirate music! I only had two problems with the film. First, there were questions pertaining to the plot that should've been answered such as, why a Turner's blood was needed to break the curse. (It is possible that that question was answered but I missed it.)Also, the fight scenes between the British and the skeleton-pirates were a bit drawn out and could've been shorter. However, overall, this movie was one of the best times I've had at the movies in a long time!"

"Capt_Nez_Obiwan_Sparrow","10","0","2","29 October 2003"," YAY! A Pirate's Life For ME!!!
","When I first heard that Disney was going to be making a movie inspired from the theme park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, I laughed, `Oh my God, they're getting desperate for new material now.' The trailers came out for the movie, featuring sword fighting, skeletal ghost-pirates, and the seemingly out of place Johnny Depp; I was very much intrigued. I walked i nto the cinema opening day, having no expectations about its entertainment or general value. Silly me, I forgot to heed the warning from the advertisements: `Prepare to be blown out of the water.' I absolutely loved the film from beginning to end! Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a great movie because of the magnificent actors, the engaging story, and the reminiscence of some much loved old-time adventure films. At first, the prospect of a pirate that walks and talks like Rolling Stone Keith Richards with the haughty egomaniacal mentality of Warner Brother's Pep√É¬© le Pew may seem rather outlandish. However, Johnny Depp manages to make this blend very credible and comically entertaining as Curse of the Black Pearl's purveyor of eternal piratical adventure, Captain Jack Sparrow. A mouth full of gold teeth and a often slurred cockney accent make a wonderful source for a symphonic cacophony of witty lines such as the soon-to-be classic retort to a snooty British naval commodore's observation that he is the `worst pirate I've ever heard of.' Depp's Captain Sparrow smugly replies, `But you have heard of me.' It is the opinion of some critics that Depp's portrayal `steals' the show (you say `steal,' Captain Sparrow would say, `Commandeer: it's a nautical term'). However crucial to the success of this movie, Depp's performance is not the only one noteworthy. No one could surpass Geoffrey Rush's gritty, undead persona that is the spirit of the delightfully, fiendishly cunning villain Captain Barbossa. Taking the more traditional route in terms of pirate look, speech, and mannerisms (did I hear him say `Arrr'?), Rush nevertheless accomplishes freshness to his character that establishes him as an archetypal but menacing `baddy' who is threatening not only in his cursed skeletal form but also his yellow-toothed, yellow-eyed, fully-fleshed leering scallywag. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann respectively, fit very nicely into their pegs of the star-crossed lovers thrust into this grand adventure that is lovingly referred to by its fans as `POTC.' The story, by Shrek screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot, has the feel of traditional epic adventure movies with a tongue-in-cheek humor employed to hint at the movie's theme-park ride roots. In one scene, a key-carrying dog cocks his head at three pirate prisoners whistling and waving a bone to lure the mangy mutt toward their cell door. A parrot slowly screeches through the rolling fog an eerie forewarning of threat: `Dead men tell no tales!' A scene with Will Turner and Jack Sparrow touring the pirate island of Tortuga reveals buccaneer party antics such as bar brawls, busty babes, and of course, lots of rum drinking. Such is the soul of the famous attraction in Disneyland, California. You will never get to a moment in Pirates of the Caribbean where you will be remotely jaded. Around every corner are spooks to make your skin crawl, sword fights to quicken your pulse, and tension relieving wisecracks to split your sides. The comedy is often very refreshingly intellectual for a so-called kid's movie. Pleasingly, a lot of the humor is geared toward adults yet still appropriate to present to kids. Many adults found themselves laughing more than their children. A couple of well-known, classic movies come to mind to which I can compare to Curse of the Black Pearl. They are: Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Princess Bride and Star Wars. Curse of the Black Pearl has the fundamental nature of the classic adventures of George Lucas' ultimate American hero, Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. (AKA Indiana Jones). Captain Jack Sparrow is our new `Indy.' He fences villains and dodges perils on quests requiring bravery, faith, and a little help from his friends-old and new. Will Turner, in exchange is the new Wesley of The Princess Bride: the lover turned pirate. The situational absurdity and word wit of The Princess Bride is imminent in Pirates of the Caribbean in scenes such as Jack Sparrow's final escape from the British navy and his accord with the commodore. Pirates of the Caribbean also shares the element of total immersion into the world of its characters (and a fan following sure to eventually match) with the original Star Wars film. Fans want to dress like the characters and they debate technical and philosophical aspects of the film with others (such as `How are Will and Jack able to hold a overturned rowboat under water, trap the breathing air within it, and not float to the surface of the ocean?' and `What more specifically are the motivations behind Captain Barbossa's severe hatred of Jack Sparrow?'). Thankfully, fanatics will have more to ponder and discuss when the film's sequel is released some time within the next few years. The principal actors have expressed passion and interest in a chance at meeting with their alter egos for a second, and perhaps even a third time. Frankly, I am enthusiastically and impatiently awaiting the arrival of the continuing tale of Captain Jack Sparrow and his trusty ship, the Black Pearl."

Johnny Depp is particularly good in his lunatic role of Jack Sparrow.  He definitely makes the movie with his nonchalant air of cool confidence while at the same time - messing up a good percentage of the time.  His make-up was a little overdone - but his character itself is so odd, that I found I forgot all about his makeup about five minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>The sword fight between Sparrow and the young blacksmith is all one could hope for in an all-out acrobatic and elaborate duel.<br/><br/>It's not a masterpiece by any means and the movie suffers from some predictability.  The second half of the movie isn't nearly as tight as the first half before Sparrow and the blacksmith steal the boat in pursuit of the Black Pearl.

The star of the show is the always reliable Johnny Depp, who turns in a career best performance as the seedy but lovable Jack Sparrow. He takes turns chewing scenery with Geoffrey Rush, who is perfectly over-the-top as Captain Barbosa. The supporting cast is great as well, but Depp and Rush leave them in the dust.

"FilmOtaku","6","0","1","19 October 2003"," A decent action/adventure film that has a secret weapon
","I have never been to Disneyworld or Disneyland so going into this film I had no idea what this movie based on an amusement ride was going to be about except for the fact that it was going to have pirates in it.  And lots of them.  After seeing this film, I still have no idea what the correlations between the ride and the movie are, but I did come to one solid conclusion: Johnny Depp is an unbelievable actor.<br/><br/>Without Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow, this film probably would have still done very well.  It's a fun, reasonably well-done swashbuckling film that has a `cute' lead actor (Orlando Bloom), a `cute' lead actress (Keira Knightly) and Geoffrey Rush, a very good actor (who has unfortunately made some, shall we say, `interesting' career choices in the last few years) as the main villain.  Plus we have a lot of sword fighting, perilous moments and an undead monkey ¬ñ all elements that will bring the kids in droves to the multiplex.  Myself, I had no interest in seeing it really ¬ñ mainly because I figured I would either A) embarrass myself by laughing at the pirate-speak, which never fails to set me off, or B) engage in said pirate-speak myself, thereby embarrassing both myself and whoever was unlucky enough to drag me to see the film in the first place. <br/><br/>
I could not ignore the buzz surrounding Johnny Depp's performance however, which ultimately is what got me into the theater in the first place.  He is *so* incredible as Jack Sparrow that even a subtle facial expression or use of body language was enough to make me laugh out loud.  I have long respected his career since he eschewed the mainstream `hunk' roles that he seemed to be genetically predisposed to doing after his stint on 21 Jump Street in favor of more avant garde fare, but this particular performance solidified my opinion that he is one of the best actors we have in the industry right now.  I remember hearing that he had taken this role last year and was disappointed that he seemed to be jumping from his independent/obscure film repertoire in favor of commercialism, but his inspired performance will without a doubt get me into the theater to see the sequel(s).  <br/><br/>In terms of the direction, I had absolutely no problem with Gore Verbinski's approach.  I found it to be atmospheric and evenly paced, and the special effects were impressive as well.  Conclusively, a good movie ¬ñ with Johnny Depp, a great movie.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

Bloom and Depp complements each other perfectly, giving this movie the little extra that actually makes it something to watch out for. Sometimes quite funny, but I suspect that they will not pass the test of time, and a second watching of the movie might not be quite as enjoyable. The action scenes are of good quality, about what you'd expect from a modern movie after watching the remake of Zorro starring Bandeiras/Hopkins. Don't go to this movie and expect to see something new though, the parts have all been done before, and most of the time better than what you'd get here. The combination is new though, and as the genre of swashbuckling isn't very common in modern movies you will find some fresh elements still in this movie so I'd say that if you enjoyed the aforementioned Zorro (which I rated 9/10), you'll find this a pleasant experience.

","I don't watch Hollywood blockbusters much, and I just have to say films like this are the reason why. I'd probably rate this as an above decent family, with some decent special effects, which is understandable considering the budget they had. It didn't really titilate me, despite an originally gripping storyline. An hour into it, and the film quickly turns into comedy, with ghost pirates dying in comedy moments and pretty much no seriousness whatsoever. I understand these kind of films aren't coming across as serious, but then I argue what's the point? Originally it reminded me of one of my favourite movies from childhood, The Princess Bride, but in the end it didn't live up to the promise.

This movie was written to entertain, and in that, it meets it's goal."

","If you read reviews of films in various newspapers and magazines, you will eventually notice trends in writing styles and points that are made in the discourses of the reviewers. In short, when they find something they think sounds important, they all focus on the same topic, and in a manner which seems meant to show off their petty vernacular skills, they make sophemoric quips and plays on the title of said flick, and/or gobble up several pages of the calendar section with mindless tripe that doesn't really get the reader anywhere. Not that a film critic really serves much purpose in the world, and thus shouldn't be taken too seriously, however, it is the fact that they are given so much attention for their interchangeably identical opinions that they should be avoided at all costs. Their recurringly similar reviews quite literally ruin movies, for they build an impression of a film before an individual has even seen it. In some cases this can be a good thing, i.e. advice to avoid a surefire disaster, or something like that. Yet when said impression is not met by the actual viewing of the film, disappointment inevitably ensues. This really only concerns films that would have been a nice little surprise, where one walks out of the theater and says, ""That was just a fun movie."" People who read film reviews don't get that pleasure anymore, and so, when a reviewer says, ""i wasn't expecting anything, and this turned out to be enjoyable, the audience then goes into the film expecting something that they otherwise would not have, and then, don't enjoy the film as much. This was the case with Pirates, where there was such a deluge of reviews claiming that this was a terrific, fun summer movie, with a bravura performance by Johnny Depp, that by the time one actually saw the movie, it seemed dull and pointless. Been there, done that sort of feeling. I say, damn the reviewers for taking what was a nice little movie, and blowing it into something that it wasn't, so that it seemed like an umpteenth viewing of Star Tours up on the screen. You new everything that was going to happen, every quirk and eccentricity, and so, it wasn't new, fresh, or really anything. In short, I advise people to ignore reviews, and see a film for themselves first, to determine what they want to think about a movie. This would probably have been a nice little diversion, so I would recommend it, if only on the grounds that one carries no expectations into it, so that they are not disappointed."

","I've always loved the pirates' genre but I must admit a strong dislike if it comes to Disney.  However, Johnny Depp starring in a Disney movie?  I was somewhat intrigued...  Had Depp finally succumbed to Disney or could it have been the other way round?  I gave the movie a try and was (massive understatement ahead) truly rewarded.  This movie is sheer fun to watch! The cast acts joyfully but most of them pale into insignificance compared to an absolutely stunning Johnny Depp who's got all the good lines and acts OTT yet wonderfully. Sure, there's been a lot of nagging about historical incorrectness and inconsistencies (Port Royal's destruction was mentioned before).  For instance, the ""Dauntless"" probable role-model ""Victory"" was launched no sooner than 1765 and had never seen the Caribbean...  But that's real nit-picking.  If you permit yourself to see this little, colourful gem as a fantasy-film with an amazing soundtrack rather than a historical pirate-movie (which could never had been its aim), you'll have a good time and lots of memorable quotes to get on your friends' nerves with... Savvy?<br/><br/>I give it a meagre 9/10 due to the aforementioned minor flaws and an overdose of slapstick comedy (the two couples of stupid English soldiers and pirates).  Surely this won't stop me from watching it a fourth and fifth time until the broad grin on my face will have to be surgically removed. 20/10 for Johnny Depp, and I'm NOT exaggerating!"

The fighting scenes (which 99% of the time never interest me in any film) seemed particularly pointless here given that the enemy couldn't be killed.<br/><br/>As said several times the two pairs -the 2 pirates & 2 guards (English too- there was a surprise) were pathetic characters. That was the biggest problem with the film it tried to be funny & failed and couldn't seem to make out whether it wanted to target itself at kids, adults or everyone. Consequently, with such a laid back plot, it became difficult to keep concentration with the plot, who was cursed, why, how etc etc.<br/><br/>Still, it was an ok story, had some good scenes, kept me reasonably interested and was acted well.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I went into this movie with a negative attitude. I always have my doubts about big budget action films, despite the great cast. I had also seen Verbinski's The Ring, and I was not very impressed. However, I was impressed with this film. It was full of laughs, which gave the appearance that it wasn't trying to take on the plot completely seriously. The action scenes were good, and most characters had fairly witty lines and were well acted. The only problem I have with this film was the way the characters held together. We were shown to constant double-crossing, and people that rescued each other, then betrayed them. For example, Jack Sparrow (played by Depp) seemed to have only thing in mind. But then, in the next scene, he was saving someone else (by the way, I'm being especially brief as I don't want to give away any spoilers to the people who have not yet seen this movie). Apart from this small problem, this movie was very good, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good action-packed laugh."

"Danimal-7","Null","0","1","16 September 2003"," An absurd story, but a fine movie
","Contrary to some reports, Pirates of the Caribbean is not a movie about a band of pirates seeking to raise an Aztec curse by some mumbo-jumbo ritual, or the heroic rescue of a beautiful maiden who has fallen into the cursed pirates' hands.  Oh yes, the cursed pirates, the Aztec ritual, the rescue and all that rubbish are IN the movie.  But, fortunately, they're not what the movie is about.  Pirates of the Caribbean is really about white canvas sails and creaking cedar hulls, gleaming cutlasses and flintlock pistols, sailors' tattoos and golden earrings, sun-spattered islets and towering Caribbean cliffs, moonlit seas and driving storms.  It is not about any particular pirates, but about the aura of pirates, their atmosphere.  And if you love the pirate aura, as I do, you'll forgive the picture the preposterousness that it wears on its sleeve.<br/><br/>The best thing about Pirates of the Caribbean is that the actors and the crew show real love and affection for the screwy B-movie they are making. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Geoffrey Rush all look like they're having fun, and director Gore Verbinski's shots look like he loves watching the scenes he's making, lingering on the pirates and the ships and the islands instead of hustling them on and off.  <br/><br/>This movie is much better than such dreck as Die Another Day, not because it's any smarter, but because it lacks the air of cynicism, of contempt for itself and its audience that mars productions like Tamahori's.  Die Another Day was made by people who didn't care a flying fig for espionage or intrigue; Pirates of the Caribbean was made by people who loved piracy, adventure and the sea.  The scene where Captain Sparrow finally swings aboard, caresses the ship's wheel like a long-lost lover, and murmurs, ""Bring me that horizon,"" is inconceivable in a typical heartless summer blockbuster; most action filmmakers wouldn't be caught dead expressing such embarrassingly sincere emotion.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Pirates of the Caribbean deserves comparison with the handful of real classics that have also been summer blockbusters, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars.  Those movies had stories; Pirates of the Caribbean has a muddle that passes for a story.  Just because Verbinski's movie is better than the average summer fare we get nowadays does not mean that it's great art, or even good art.  But unlike most movies about which people say, ""Don't think about it, just have fun,"" Pirates of the Caribbean actually IS fun.<br/><br/>Rating: **¬Ω out of ****.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Lovers of pirates and the sea must catch this one in the theater, but others can wait for video."

Keira Knightley is a pretty face, but she has yet to show her real acting abilities, she sure didn't show it in this movie.

Orlando Bloom was really good too and I think you will see more movies with him in the future. The only question that stays for me is that I really don't know why it is important that Mr Bloom has to give his blood, there is not really an explanation, but who cares - the movie was so good that you can forget about this faux pas.

"cutnitgat","Null","0","1","15 September 2003"," Yo ho ho, and a bottle of errors
","I have to admit to enjoying this film in spite of my self. What makes it even more fun, though, is the many innacuracies and errors, the most important of which I list here for your irritation/amusement.<br/><br/>1. The date. Much of the action in this film takes place in Port Royal, a city that was utterly destroyed by an earthquake and abandoned in 1692. However, the fire-buckets on board of HMS Dauntless are inscribed with the royal monogram of GR, which indicates that the film must take place before 1692 and after 1714, when George I came to the throne.<br/><br/>2. The punchline of one of the jokes is ""You've clearly never been to Singapore,"" which is entirely understandable as Singapore was not founded until 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles, after whom business class on singapore airlines is named.<br/><br/>3. The Rank of Commodore. Captain Norrington is 'promoted' to Commodore, even though this rank does not exist at this time, except as a stopgap, temporary appointment when a captain is given temporary command of a squadron.<br/><br/>4. Flags. Letting the Commodore inaccuracy slip, they failed to properly denote Norrington's rank as none of the ships which he commanded ever flew the broad pennant that indicates that a Commodore is aboard. Also, if the film is set before 1692, then the British engisn is incorrect, as the combined scottish and english flag was not introduced until 1707, although to be fair they do get good marks for displaying correct commissioning pennants<br/><br/>5. The ships. Though I have no complaint against the pirate ship as a harmless fantasy, the ships of the Royal Navy, in particular HMS Dauntless, are from at least 50 years after the film's period."

This guy is marvellous, and in this rollercoaster-ride of a movie he delivers his best acting since Edward Scissorhands. The rest of the cast also does a graceful, wonderful job, and Keira Knightly's strikingly beautiful close-ups should be reason enough to watch this cinematic gem. Featuring a lot of memorable moments, witty quotes, hilarious laugh-out-loud scenes, exciting action sequences, cool sfx and beautiful visuals, this movie is all about FUN. There's never a dull moment, and you'll be wishing for more when the end credits roll. All movies should be like this very well-made adventure.

I was in a belief that it would be either a pretty scary children's movie or a boring sword-clanging movie with Orlando Bloom as a stupid pirate.<br/><br/>But, as usually, I was proven wrong.<br/><br/>The movie was hilarious, exciting, unique, adventurous and romantic all the same. While there were serious and exciting sword fights and attempts to take over Captain Barbossa's crew, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) always appeared as a comic relief and easened the atmosphere a bit.<br/><br/>One of the best things about PotC was absolutely it's smooth and clever dialogue. I had probably one of the best laughs ever in movie history while watching this pearl of movie industry. PotC was funny, but not too funny so that it would have ruined the movie's adventurousness or scariness (yes, it was scary, occasionally. Or what do you say about a skeleton-monkey?).<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow is definitely the coolest pirate there is. And he wouldn't have been much if it wasn't for Mr. Depp here. Johnny did an amazing job playing Jack Sparrow and I must say, as a big Johnny-fan, that this was his best role so far.<br/><br/>Luckily the name refers to the fact that we might get a sequel - the movie didn't make it too bad on the box offices...<br/><br/>Overall this was a very entertaining movie in every way. 10/10."

Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Geoffrey Rush were terrific in their roles, and the supporting cast was really good. Johnny Depp deserves special mention. What an actor! He brought the role of Jack Sparrow to life with such a majestic performance. Now for my one complaint of the movie, and one that I expected, given that it was Disney. Way too many out-of-character/setting one liners/jokes/tension-breakers... whatever you want to call them, every modern day American movie seems to have them. There were little flaws too that can be easily overlooked, like one of the cursed pirates using the term ""spitting image"", which can't be more than 30 years old (and this movie is set in the days of pirates). No more complaining though, this was a wonderful, vibrant movie that everyone of any age should see. The special FX were awesome too, and I loved the main theme from the soundtrack.

","***Spoilers***<br/><br/>I didn't expect much of this movie, and neither, I assume, did a lot of people given its origins. I was dragged to the movie with a group of friends, and I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst it wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, and definitely not the most memorable, it was amusing and enjoyable in most places. My biggest concern, though, was the plot holes - if the pirates, once cursed, couldn't die, then how come Orlando Bloom's father was killed by the other pirates? Also, how did he come to be on the ship at the beginning of the film? I didn't think that the plot was thought through, and while the film was fast paced enough for an audience member not to have to worry too much about these errors, I would have rathered a greater amount of continuity in the story. My other concern with the film was the portrayal of the characters of Elizabeth's father and Annamaria. I felt that Elizabeth's father in places was trying to be a comic character, such as during the climax of the film, whereas other times you were expected to take him seriously. Jonathan Pryce is a great actor, and I thought it was a shame that he was stuck in a part with no personality that served either to spell out the feelings of other characters or to give the audience comedic relief. I also would have liked further development of Annamaria, the token black woman on the otherwise politically incorrect, white-male-dominated Interpreter ship. Her only lines seem to be either to make assumptions which are wrong, or to yell at the central characters. There was no real feeling in her character. If the producers had really wanted to be politically correct, they would have served better to either discard the character altogether or make her a more rounded character, rather than inserting her as a prop merely to keep the minority groups happy. Criticisms aside, I though Johnny Depp gave a fine performance, which was quite surprising considering the last movie I saw him in was ""From Hell"". ""Pirates"" is an ok movie, not the best release this year, but it will serve as good rental material. 7 out of 10."

","This movie was BORING! Sure the Pirates storyline held my attention for a little while, but why make the movie so long man? It was interesting how they implented the elements of the DisneyLand/World ride into the movie, but 3 hours??? I mean, Disney, come on, how long do you think people are going to actually pay attention to. If this movie was 1 hour and 30 minutes, or possibly 1 hour and 45 minutes, it would have been ok, but the story was drawn out way to far, and it was very slow. Disney has just gone downhill ever since Walt passed..."

","...at most, a fun movie. Without the presence of Depp, this would have been just another summer movie. Which in itself, is a testament to the prerogative of ""the actor"". Unfortunately, the director was unable to develop what JD had given him. What lay behind the facade of Sparrow? What drove him? Where did he come from? Did he like girls? And so on... As for the bad guy - too benign to be fearsome. You can't be subtle as a pirate in a pirate movie and Geoffrey Rush was perhaps a little too unwilling to assume the absurd. Our dashing hero was nice - not much else to expect from such a role. And the closest our heroine ever got to lustiness was a brief moment of pretense on the island with Sparrow. The commodore was a nice touch - beautifully understated by Jack Davenport. It was not too often that the British admiralty was painted in a good light when up against movie pirates. The movie also looked like it was shot on a back lot at Disney. The computer generated opening scene of the approaching ship was particularly unrealistic. But that said, I will probably see it again on DVD."

","...pure entertainment.<br/><br/>It has to be said: The plot is thin, so thin. Sailing to an island, returning from there, sailing back... The last line which completed the romantic part was just hilarious and felt like some pulp pirate story a la ""The Maid and the Pirate"". I saw it coming from miles, and I kept repeating ""DON'T SAY IT! PLEASE DON'T SAY IT!""<br/><br/>She said it.<br/><br/>The action wasn't over the top at all (comparing T3, for example), and there was clearly more space for better effects. There isn't a single scary moment, even the introduction of the curse (when the pirates showed their true faces) looked more like a musical to me. Nobody in the audience ever jumped. 50 zombies, and not one single scary moment. Hmm.<br/><br/>What a great movie!<br/><br/>Honestly, forget all the contra points. Johnny Depp carries the movie from one laugh to the next, his acting is just one big feel-good-smile. Every time he disappears from screen, I just wanted him to return. Without him, it's a below-standard one. With him... Oh my god.(And I'm not even female! :) I loved him in Sleepy Hollow, but this one tops it easily (the acting, not the movie - SH is way better in plot/thrilling/etc.)<br/><br/>It's not pulp fiction, and surely not fight club, but I can promise you 120 (okay 100, taking away 20 minutes without Depp) minutes of pure entertaining. Just expect a comedy, and it delivers."

"personguyman","8","0","1","7 September 2003"," A Whole Hell Of A Lot Better Then I Was Expecting
","*POSSIBLE SPOLIERS*<br/><br/>So, I don't really like pirate stories, and the idea of a movie based on a ride doesn't blow my skirt up either, and i'm not one of those guys who just sees movies because they're movies, i love movies, but, i don't have time to see everything out there. So, why is the hell did i go see this one? My friends Justin said that he felt that it was going to be the best movie of the summer, and i figured what the hell, i'll just go see it, if i'm gonna be an actor, i prolly won't act in movies i like all the time, so, it'll be a good excercise.<br/><br/>There were flaws in it. The scene where Depp gets swung around the wooden poll, it is very obvious that it is a stunt double. Also, pirates that can't get killed fight on and on with their swords. But, all of that crap is ok, because, this is not the type of movie that is suppose have everything be flawless and to always makes sense. This is suppose to provide a good time, and that it does do. It would have been nice if some of the problems weren't there, but, they are a non issue just because of the sheer energy of the film. Depp's charecter and Depp himself also do this movie alot of justice. Depp's charecter, Jack, is a perfect example of a charecter that that does not need to have an arch, but can still be interesting threw it's dinamic. Jack doesn't change in the movie, your perception of him does, but, he doesn't, he's the same robber baron that he was at the begining. His performance of the role is also something to behold because he plays it with incredible comic timing and with sparking originality, which saves the part, because, as i said, it has no arch, Depp adds the dinamic.<br/><br/>All in all, a good flick, i suck at deciding what number to give films, but, i think this is a pretty solid 8."
"muscatac","10","0","1","6 September 2003"," I tried to explain the reasons why I liked/disliked the movie without letting out any spoilers.
","I just saw Pirates this afternoon and to be truly sincere, I liked very much and I don't think that I would change 1 single bit from the film.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the action started immediately. MAYBE there were some parts (small ones but) that were slightly far-fetched but the result was good with them. The film length was just right not too short, neither long - 1 point in favour. Another thing I liked about the film was that some parts were predictable and others weren't. Also, I think that every action had a purpose and wasn't done just to fill in time. The actors were very good. Johnny Depp was hilarious. So were certain lines. Another good thing about the film was that humour was spread here and there not all in one go. One point against the film was that I wasn't exactly sure why the blood was needed to lift the curse. Either it wasn't specified or else I was too busy admiring Orlando Bloom and missed that part. (For those who haven't seen the film - sorry if I seem vague or senseless but I don't want to give any information on the storyline.) You will find fight scenes galore which I really enjoyed and there's this particular scene  when the pirates step in and out of the moonlight which I really loved. Film summary: mixture of pirates, romance, action, magic and luck. By the way, Jonathan Bryce has a very very funny scene and we simply couldn't stop laughing my mum and I.  My advice is that this film is definitely worth a try. In fact if I have the chance I would certainly go see it another time. Congrats to all the cast & crew."

","I think the movie reviewers must have had bad days when they saw this movie, because their opinions are cranky and don't make sense! Pirates of the Caribbean is a blast to see, if only for the old-fashioned swordfights, romance, witty comedy and hilarious acting by Johnny Depp. Depp totally steals the show with his clueless swagger and drunken one-liners. Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom also perform relatively well, although I think Knightley's show in Bend it Like Beckham was better. Orlando plays a classic shy-but-determined romantic, which works well for him, especially since (fortunately for all the Orlando-lovers) he has more lines in this than in both of the Lord of the Rings movies combined. The movie as a whole is a good way to spend some time, and a ticket worth paying for (which can be hard to find sometimes). I absolutely recommend people see this film!"
"efi_de","10","0","1","5 September 2003"," I'm swept away!
","Just returned from my first viewing of POTC - Sooooooo hilarious, all my nerves are still aching from laughing.<br/><br/>A very clever mix from the best bits and pieces of ""Captain Blood"", ""The Sea Hawk"", ""The Black Swan"" and ""The Crimson Pirate"" (the carrying of the small boats under water for cover, and disguising extremely ugly pirates as women to distract the attention of the soldiers from the main action), and bits from the Disney ride, like the prisoners trying to convince the dog who has the keys to their cell with a bone to hand them over. Also Captain Barbossa as a skeleton drinking wine resembles a figure at the ride, who is rumored to be a reverence to Errol Flynn, who apparently gave Walt Disney the idea to the ride in the first place. And there is also a nod to ""Troy""...<br/><br/>Kira Knightley is as least as graceful and witty as Olivia DeHavilland was in her pirate days, opposite Errol Flynn.<br/><br/>Sword training with the elves has certainly left a mark on Orlando Bloom, and his moves resemble Errol Flynn, not much of a surprise as he has got his major training from Bob Anderson, who had brushed up Errol's movements for one of his last pirate movies ""The Master of Ballantrae"". Not to forget that he has become a really good actor, and a very handsome one too. But I still kept looking for the pointy ears ...<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is over the top, not as something between Keith Richard and a French cartoon character, but as a mix between Ozzy Osbourne and Robin Hood, with a hint of Burt Lancaster's artistic skills and humor as Vallo in ""The Crimson Pirate"" thrown in for good measure ...<br/><br/>One of the best movies I have seen for a long time, and certainly one of the best pirate movies I know - and I know pretty much all of them!<br/><br/>I'll see it again tomorrow.

"Ekimsov","6","0","1","6 September 2003"," Feels like it was intended to be an animated film...
","Ok, I must admit, I went in to see this film with rather high expectations, but I was aware of the danger of it being overhyped and tried to watch it as openminded as possible.<br/><br/>That being said, I still cannot deny that it has left me dissappointed. When I heard it was supposed to revive the pirate genre, show some awesome specialFX and would feature J.D. as a pirate, I half expected a dark and erie story that would keep me at the edge of my seat and make me mumble ""woooow"" every now and then into the bucket of popcorn I am holding on to.<br/><br/>
Well... none of it came through. Don't get me wrong, I did find it entertaining, but all throughout the movie, I kept thinking that I watching a film that was meant to be animated and reminded me strongly of former disney antics, just that (thank god) they didnt break into sing every now and then...<br/><br/>The story is barely more than ok, slimly suits the audience of 12+, the characters are flat and stereotype, the Fx are awesome but sometimes not put to use too well I feel - the zombie pirates didnt really scare anyone at all - and the humor was often flat and failed to hit its mark more than once...<br/><br/>
It is a sunday evening film for entertainment, even of the family sort, but certainly not what I would spend the saturday night start-off money on... I'll give it a 6 out of 10, barely missing a 7, and it is 100% absolutely NOT the best film that came out this year."

","I had a tough choice - see an already proven but maybe repetitive ""Tomb Raider"" movie, or the ""Pirates"". I decided to try something new, for a change, somewhat prepared for lots of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley yawn romance, just spruced up with a piracy theme.<br/><br/>I couldn't be more wrong.<br/><br/>The moment I saw Jack Sparrow - excuse me: Captain Jack Sparrow - played by Johnny Depp with surprisingly well placed black eyeliner, I knew that this time a secondary character would steal - excuse me: commandeer - the screen. And a heck of a job he did at that!<br/><br/>Of course there's much more. Based on a Disney theme, this movie features most extraordinary swordfighting action which is... precisely timed with the music! Remember the old days when Disney movies had almost every move of every character accentuated by musical instruments? This film takes this technique a step further: it's not only separate instruments, but a wonderful full-blown orchestrated sound track keeping in sync with the clashing swords, jumps, kicks, dodges and parades. Think ""Dance Dance Revolution"" in swordfighting terms, if you wish.<br/><br/>And, there's more. Crazy dialogue lines, again mostly by Captain Jack Sparrow. Good special effects, featuring a merry skeleton crew (pardon the pun, but I'm surprised they didn't place THIS one in the movie! Or did I miss it?). Hilarious and ridiculous plot twists and quirks, ranging from loading cannons with silverware (fork missiles, anyone?) to sailing on the top of the mast (when the rest of the ship has already sunken).<br/><br/>That it's not very complicated? It doesn't have to, it's a family swashbuckling movie. That it has a happy ending so sappy that it oozes? So what, movies created for simple entertainment have to have happy endings. That it's full of cliches? That's the stinkin' point, ye landlubbers! Avast!<br/><br/>But speaking of Monkey Island in the summary above, for the non-gamers of you, there is a series of games under that title, about the adventures of a would-be pirate with a ridiculous name of Guybrush Threepwood, which alone provided tons of fun as no-one could pronounce it properly. The games are packed to the brim with piracy humour... and if I ever see any of them filmed, I definitely want it done the Black Pearl style.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since the last good pirate movie - which, in my opinion, was Polanski's Pirates - but it'll take even longer than that to top the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". Definitely a new standard has been set."

","I had low expectations when I went to see ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."" After all, it is based on a theme park ride for Pete's sake. I left the theatre wanting MORE.<br/><br/>I love EVERYTHING about this movie. It shows that a blockbuster can be both intelligent and entertaining.  The score, the visual effects,and a wonderful cast come together to create what I feel is the most entertaining film of the summer. Verbinski fills the screen with beautiful photography, humor,action, and awesome sword fights (in particular, the one that takes place in the blacksmith's shop). The fight scenes seem pointless since the villainous Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his men cannot die. But the British Royal Navy aren't aware of this, and so they skew the evil pirates with their swords. Also, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), and Jack Sparrow have no knowledge of the immortality of the Black Pearl's crew. They, too, try in vain to kill them.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is loaded with humor and goofy one-liners. I particularly enjoyed the Abbott and Costello antics of a pair of pirates, one of whom has a wooden eye. In one scene, they are in a row boat dressed in women's clothing.<br/><br/>Clearly, the highest praise goes to Johnny Depp for his performance as pirate, Jack Sparrow. Excuse me, 'Captain' Jack Sparrow. Imagine the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards in a pirate costume and you have an accurate picture of the character. And who knows? Perhaps pirates were the rock stars of their day.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and add ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" to your to-do list. You will be glad you did. Savvy?"

POTC is so far and away one of the best Pirate films I've seen, it has all the elements of the classic Swashbucklers made in the 1930's that so many folks have had a hard time emulating. Depp and Bloom reminded me of 21st century versions of Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power. They had charm, humor and a sense of fun and pure enjoyment for what they were making. Not so serious that it felt heavy like Cutthroat island, which was decent but still lacking in the pure escapist fun that the original films had. I think that is why this film is so good, Mr. Verbanski was able to give us a true sense of the world of Hollywood Pirates. I mean who'd want to see real Pirates? They were dirty, nasty, brutal murderers and had very little sense of adventure that you see in these films. Remember folks, this isn't history..it is fantasy! Hurrah for Disney, they've produced a film that sounded ridculous at first but became a true reminder of the Swashbuckling adventure films of old!"

"Bab5er","Null","0","1","4 September 2003"," (Spoilers) A frightening lack of enthusiasm displayed by (nearly) all involved...
","(Spoilers!)<br/><br/>First of all, let me make clear my attitude towards all things piratey: I *love* them!!! I own (legal) copies of all four Monkey Island PC adventure games, played ""Pirates!...Gold"" for quite a while and even liked the near-universally loathed ""Cutthroat Island"", as well as 1991s ""Hook"".  I also approached ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" with appropriately low expectations, as one should every comedy/action/adventure movie. This was just going to be good, low-brow fun on an otherwise wasted sunny Saturday afternoon in August, I told myself.<br/><br/>And yet I was *completely* disgusted with this movie! (Much to my own surprise). And what's worse, I felt I saw my own disgust mirrored in the bored, lacklustre performance given by most of the actors concerned (excluding Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, who did a fair job with the material they were given), as well as the poor quality of the costumes and props (especially the magic compass, the Inca chest and the other riches in the treasure cave). Much of this movie looks as if it was actually *shot* on some location in some Disney amusement park.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's make-up looks completely ridiculous, while he walks around like he is either a monkey, drunk, or blatantly gay. Neither of these qualities is completely believable for a pirate (not even non-stop drunkenness). It's as if Depp took one look at the script and decided to pretend it was all a grand rehearsal he only had to recite his lines for and look hazy.<br/><br/>What is worse, Geoffrey Rush (playing Depp's antagonist) appears to have adopted a similar stance towards the movie. The only times his character comes across as even remotely menacing or even scary is when he turns into a skeletal zombie. And that's not something you can really credit the actor for, I feel. To all those who do not share my opinion on Rush's performance here, ask yourself this: When the girl with the coin is taken aboard the Pearl for the first time, and you see the group of pirates standing in front of her, could you have guessed which one of them was supposed to be the captain before he is introduced as such? Me neither. I supposed the real captain was sitting in his cabin somewhere and she would have been taken to him. Compare this to Dustin Hoffmann's portrayal of Captain James Hook in ""Hook"". There is no way that anyone could have mistaken him for anyone but the pirate captain, even if they had been unaware of the (Disney rendition of) the Peter Pan story.<br/><br/>The British army captain is portrayed with appropriate stiffness, I feel, but that's still not much of an acting accomplishment. The British governor is also adequately portrayed, but is too trivial a character to really improve the movie much.<br/><br/>Then there is the god-awful plot, which keeps dragging its anchor all over the place. The main surprise (the story behind the curse and all) is given away fairly quickly, and the eventual outcome is fairly predictable. Even the trick with taking a coin to become invincible could be seen coming a mile away. Then there is Depp's youthful appearance in the movie. Taking into account the plot point that the curse was put into place some 10 years before the start of the story, Sparrow would have looked *even younger* when he was captain of the Black Pearl. A mere teen boy! While the rest of the crew looked *exactly the same* (i.e. fairly old) back then because they have been preserved by the curse in the meantime. Sparrow would have looked terribly young to have been captain of the crew the way he looked during the movie, let alone 10 years before!<br/><br/>Logic takes a (distant) backseat in this movie. The whole point of Jack's ship attacking the Pearl *knowing* the crew was invincible was beyond me. It might have been to damage the ship, but that didn't play any part either during the rest of the movie. As it was, this was just 15 minutes of meaningless filler. Likewise, the decision by the Pearl's crew to surrender once they had lost their immunity from wounds was perplexing. They were all going to be hanged anyway! What's the point of surrendering, then? The British soldiers fighting on upon first realizing the pirates were immortal was odd as well (as was the length of the fight, given the advantage the pirates had as long as they could not be harmed).<br/><br/>As it was, there was not nearly enough plot to fill what felt like almost 3 hours. A lot of going back and forth for no good reason, plus goofy decisions made by the characters, filled a lot of time better spent otherwise (as in not watching this film!).<br/><br/>As for the humor... why bother including it if you won't try to make the jokes as funny (and in-character) as possible? About the only one I liked was the one at the start when Sparrow confidently steps off his sinking ship onto the walkway. The rest just seem improvised (the slapping joke with Sparrow's exes, the interminable eye-joke with the one-eyed pirate). Maybe an accomplished comedy writer could have been included in the writing team to ensure more and better jokes?<br/><br/>The comedy takes away from the horrifying feel arguably intended by the skeletal scenes. Perhaps it would have been a good idea if the writers had made a choice between horror with the occasional moment of relief and comedy with some horror elements (as portrayed in the ""Monkey Island"" adventure series). As it is, the writers seemed to be going back and forth. Sparrow should have been either a copy of Guybrush Threepwood, or a competent pirate with a sense of humour. Not kind of both at the same time, since that just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Many of the action scenes convey the same sort of bored indifference portrayed so fittingly by many of the key actors.<br/><br/>Oh, but the SFX are gorgeous, of course. Scoring the only points I can give this godawful excuse for a fun summer action/adventure movie. Makes me wonder if the people doing the SFX had somehow been isolated from the rest of the process of making the film, since none of feel of the rest of the movie is present in the skeletal scenes.<br/><br/>The verdict: 3/10"
"angelsinjeans","10","0","1","4 September 2003"," Applause for Johnny
","If anyone is to receive praise for this movie, the competition is tough, but our leading man is defiantly our number 1#! When you think about the memorable characters that you associate with Johnny Depp, for example Edward Scissorhands,  Edward D. Wood, Jr. and  Inspector Fred Abberline to name just a few, you see him create a character to which you will always make a connection.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow is a character to whom i would have never linked to Johnny Depp, but following his performance in The Pirates of the Caribbean: The curse of the Black Pearl, i can see no person to parade this character in his full potential better than Johnny. A very good actor to bring a very good character to life.<br/><br/>Not forgetting other actors and actresses in this film who also made it one to remember. Geoffrey Rush, Captain Barbossa makes you believe this truly is the maddest man to move a mast! Demonstrating a character who has determination and the will to put up a good fight to get what he wants, be warned, never mess with him.<br/><br/>Once again, we see Orlando Bloom make the girls smile as he puts up his sword and proves he is worthy to grace an action movie set with whatever weapon you got! A fine performance!<br/><br/>Finally, we have Keira Knightly, who proves, just because she is young, she can still take on Hollywood. Few films can make you cry with laughter but at the same time make you fear what is coming. That, i believe, is one of the reasons to which i must applaud this film.<br/><br/>My film of Summer 2003!"
"movie_yid","10","0","1","4 September 2003"," The most fun you can have with your clothes on!!
","If ever there was a summer that needed a film like Pirates of the Caribbean it was the summer of 2003. For all their merits as entertainment, the likes of X2, The Matrix Reloaded and Hulk were all fundamentally serious affairs, treating their subject matter with a sober integrity. Pirates isn't that kind of movie. Pirates has only one agenda: fun, fun and more fun. It's the kind of tongue-in-cheek, flight-footed family movie that will almost certainly be premiered on BBC1 on Christmas Day in a couple of years, and will soon after be making regular appearances in Bank Holiday TV schedules for years to come.<br/><br/>It has so much to recommend it - the old-fashioned swashbuckling action, the sparkling gag-filled script, the gorgeous coupling of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, the stunning CGI - and yet it's easy to pick out its strongest point. With a performance that deserves an Oscar nomination (but of course he won't get it), Johnny Depp - as the roguish, ambiguous, enigmatic Captain Jack Sparrow - doesn't so much light up the screen as burn a hole in it. Keith Richards is the obvious basis for his characterisation - all lop-sided tics and mockney accent - but unlike the wrinkly axeman, Depp looks fantastic. Never before has a man with a plaited beard, dreadlocks and permanent eye shadow looked so damn attractive. His forays into big-budget territory may be few and far between, but there can be no doubt that the guy is a proper Movie Star.<br/><br/>It would be a lesser movie without Depp, but that's not to say the movie relies on him. It's like saying that Indiana Jones would be a lesser movie without Harrison Ford, purely because he's so perfect for the part. Pirates stands worthy comparison with Spielberg's archaeological trilogy. Director Gore Verbinksi (returning to the family-oriented mood of his earlier Mousehunt after the grisly The Ring) makes light work of handling multiple characters, a fairly complex revisionist plot (in this pirate movie, it's all about putting treasure back), judging the scenes of the supernatural just right so that they scare the kiddies without giving them nightmares, and allowing even Geoffrey Rush (with the toughest task of the four principals as the cursed villain of the piece) to camp it up and have some fun. Leave your cynical, adult self at the door, because for sheer uncomplicated entertainment value, Pirates of the Caribbean is the best movie of the summer, if not the whole of 2003."

We all laughed our butts off. Johnny Depp was at his best in this movie (not to mention his sexiest). He plays Captain Jack Sparrow with a zest that cannot be matched. I especially loved when he said, ""Welcome to the Caribbean, love."" That was one of the best lines of the film. I voted it a ten, and recommend it for those who are considering seeing it. It should win several awards this year. I'll be very disappointed if it didn't."

","The casting is good it works. The scenery is good. The special effects work well too as they are used to support the story and are not a gimmick unto itself. The music however is a bit awkward. The theme tune is fine but it is repeated incessantly and in the major fight scene where you are trying to follow the swordplay and effect and characters it is totally wrong. The music is distracting and doesn't follow the events on the screen, as it should. It breaks the scene down and distracts, which is a great pity.<br/><br/>A great movie, go and see it."

The casting is great, I couldn't imagine the characters being played as anyone else. Johnny Depp plays a wonderful Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom also plays his character with great style. One of the things that struck me were the costumes, they had a great appeal to me, although they were quite simple, I found I quite enjoyed studying them. The film has a mix of comedy and action, the main comedy lines coming from Johnny Depp. I found the storyline quite gripping and the action scenes had some wonderful effects. Overall, it was a spectacular movie, well worth watching."

The acting is mostly good. Johnny Depp delivers one of his best performances as Jack Sparrow, he is funny and just entertaining to watch. Geoffrey Rush is also very good as the bad guy. Orlando Bloom is fine. Newcomer Keira Knightley, while very beautiful, is just plain bad here.<br/><br/>
Director Gore Verbinski does a decent job directing here. This is not his best film nor his best directing. I think he was much more successful with The Ring. <br/><br/>Pirates is visually well made.

"queitus","Null","0","1","6 September 2003"," Charming but fell short of great
","This movie is reminiscent of virtually every Hollywood blockbuster I've ever seen. It did its job: charmed the charmable, roused those appreciative of trite, forced humor, wooed those susceptible to petty, undramatic romance, and overall, won people over by general appeal and advertisement rather than by substance. Granted, a lot of people like that sort of thing. And frankly I should have expected it. But I went in expecting something a bit more riveting, involved, and overall, something that perhaps would take itself seriously.<br/><br/>I was looking for more of a period action film with its own aspects of fantasy that remain consistent and serious (Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to mind, though that's not technically a period action film, it falls into the category right up there with Braveheart, Last of the Mohicans, Gladiator, etc. and still has its fair share of humor). I was interested to see how this would be done. The trite humor and cleches in the beginning, I thought to be something that would pass. Then I realized that they were to remain and then I of course saw the wonderfully comic CG skeleton pirates! And said to myself, ""oh, it's one of these.""<br/><br/>So I'd just like to let everyone else know, this is a Hollywood blockbuster and nothing more. Don't expect it to stick with you for long or to make you think about anything. Also, the plot twists just got annoying after a while. However, some good points: Geoffrey Rush and especially Johnny Depp in some roles that they obviously enjoy, and can overact wonderfully with reckless abandon! Great job by the two of them, very entertaining. Especially when Barbosa grunts, simply, ""ARRRR!"" The action is superb, with some brilliantly choreographed sword fights and wonderful effects throughout. Plenty of eye candy and humor for the whole family.<br/><br/>I'd hardly call it great cinema, but it was certainly fun. Go into the theater in the mood for a fun movie and you'll probably enjoy it much more than I did."

","True to the ride I guess. I think we all wondered what the plot of Disneyland's ride was, considering there never was anything it was based on (yet it was one of the COOLEST)<br/><br/>Plot: First you wait in line. Then sail through lovely seas of the Caribbean. Then there's a skull saying something mean to you, your boat falls down and splashes. Things get dark. Then Pirates happen.<br/><br/>Like Disney's family ride, you get great scenery, you get some thrills, spills, and some good honest humor, particulary with Johnny Depp's crafty swaggering character. Bloom and Knightley fit in nicely when it comes to the tale of a damsel in distress and her true love saving her. Rush commands his army of pirates well with a matured manner, yet he can still be quite evil. What really deserves some credit is the Special Effects and the Pirates themselves. We get a good gathering of savages and thieves, giving the ride lovers what they wanted. Good swordplay and great ship battles, what more could you want? A less sappy ending I guess. I mean C'mon!<br/><br/>Bottom line: It has Hollywood branded all over it's filthy tooth smile but it delivers what one would want out of a Disney Pirate movie, much like the ride (before they took out the pirates chasing women)."

","My expectations was fairly high when I went into the cinema to see this one. I love Johnny Depp and he is one of the best actors Ive ever seen, so this movie was a failsafe just because of Mr. Depp. And just as I expected the movie was AWESOME! Johnny Depp have never been better. Maybe in ""Fear and loathing in L.A"" but otherwise he is born to be a pirate. He has the coolest appearing with his dreadlocks and black makeup and a sweet dialect that fits his role very well. Orlando Bloom is an extraordinary actor too but not aswell as Johnny though. Together they make a hell of a team. Jack Sparrow as Depp's character is named is hillarious. He is really funny. One bad thing about the humour is that more people then depp is supposed to be funny. Too much humour is never good and since they are not funny enough they could just be normal and leave all the funny lines to Johnny Depp. My rating on this one was 9/10. It was maximum entertainment!"

","This film is a lot of fun, with great (over)acting from Jonny Depp (in his most attractive role yet) and Geoffrey Rush. It is a fairly simple story but with everything you could want; plenty of swashbuckling, zombie pirates, a lovely heroine with lovely eyebrows, Gareth from The Office, and Jonny Depp.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom still can't act and clearly really wants to be as cool as Jonny Depp, which he is not. And there is nothing cool about elves fighting the enemies of Middle Earth with extreme sports, such as surfing down stairs on a shield. However, a film like this doesn't require much acting from the hero - he just has to stand there and look good, which he does.<br/><br/>

","Having only seen the film once I am not sure if what I'm about to ask is on the money or not, but I digress:<br/><br/>In the scene when Rush and Depp are fighting just before Bloom is headed to the chest with Cortez's gold we see Depp prepare to toss the coin he stole from the chest to Bloom so that the curse may be lifted.  In a very swift motion Depp slices into his own hand and grasps the coin before tossing it upwards to bloom and after Bloom drops both coins we clearly see a line of blood on each coin.  Are we to think in some way that Jack Sparrow and Will Turner are in fact related?  What could be the relation as earlier in the film it is stated that Bootstrap Bill Turner had but one child?  Perhaps in the sequel we will see this mystery revealed?"

There are numerous similarities between them: both treat historical truth rather loosely, both are packed with humour and both are thrilling to watch. Even though everyone knows how the story will end.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is excellent in this movie and steals (commandeer, nautical term!)the show. Orlando Bloom is so handsome it hurts and - he can act. Maybe he still has bits and pieces of that cool, elvish charm, but he sure looks better non-blonde. Keira Knightley prooves that not every girl in a pirate movie should scream and run around with no purpose (save the purpose of falling in the arms of a leading male). Geoffrey Rush is demonic but one can feel pity for him. And the monkey Jack is the best. Really.<br/><br/>One may nag, that the plot is a bit conventional, but that's the way it is; it doesn't spoil the fun. The sea battles are - on the other hand - totally unconventional. Shooting cannon with forks and knives aspire to one of my favourite scenes... Of all movies, altogether.<br/><br/>Not to mention a corset scene... All corset scenes, actually. It may be a little far fetched, but does it not remind You of a scene from the 'Titanic'? And 'Gone with The Wind'? Having in mind that the script came from the men who gave us 'Shreck', I am not surprised at all."

From the first moment i saw him appear on screen i was on the floor laughing, and his opening scene where he looks so proud that he's standing on a boat thats sinking. Johnny Depp IS the film, and without him it could never of happened. Don't get me wrong i love Orlando too and Laura Knightly was great in her role. But Depp gave it something special. Something that not many people have. I thought he was a great actor before the movie, and now I think he's the best. I don't know how some of these reviews can be so miserable. THIS FILM ROCKS!!! Infact I'm craving it now, and i can't wait for the DVD. If you have a good sense of humour then you will love this film."

","After seeing all the hype within the trailers I decided I would spend the 7.75 to see this movie...The plot was well detailed and the story actually held me attention throughout the movie.. My only grievence was that some of the action scenes would just not end. If anyone has seen the movie i'm sure you know the one i'm talking about towards the end. I think special effects are being used way to much these days and movies are way to dependent on them. But besides the extreme use of special effects this movie was very well written and worth anyones time. I would rate it a 7 out of 10. Good acting and a well written story add to the overall greatness of this film.....<br/><br/>War"

","My first inclination upon hearing about a film based on a Disneyland ride was to abandon ship and stay away.

","My first experience with pirates was turning on the TV one weekend afternoon when I was little and watching a classic Errol Flynn flick called ""Captain Blood"". This was very exciting to watch and it held my interest throughout the picture. Basically that wasn't the first time I was interested in pirates. Pirates have been scene in movies and TV shows for years,and the shows I can recall were shows based on Saturday morning cartoons and those thrilling Saturday afternoon matinees that were shown from the 30's and 40's on television,if there wasn't anything else to do. Basically,the last ""pirate"" movie that was okay,but did it every suck was the overrated Geena Davis vehicle called ""Cutthroat Island"",and from then on I really lost interest in the pirate genre and so did Hollywood for a while.<br/><br/>Until now.........................<br/><br/>""Pirates Of The Caribbean:The Curse Of The Black Pearl"",maybe the best the finest pirate movie to ever grace the screen,and it is done in the grand tradition of those classic pirate movies of the past and it also goes back to those classic standard Disney fare that hasn't been seen in ages,and if Walt Disney himself were living today,he would be proud. This film is the first ever ""PG13"" rated feature under the family friendly/family oriented Walt Disney Pictures and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and it its one of the biggest thrill rides of the summer.<br/><br/>It has everything you expect in a grand adventure/action packed flick: action,intrigue,romance,humor--all on a grand epic scale that is not to be missed! It's full of old-fashioned thrills and spills. It has classic Hollywood glamour as well---not since the likes of Errol Flynn- men sporting pencil-thin mustaches and women wearing tight corsets,not to mention fantastic special effects all around courtesy of the full advantage of 21st Century cutting edge technology that gives it the marvelous touch,thanks to the crew at George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic along with that special Disney touch.<br/><br/>Best of all,the filmmakers didn't shy away from putting all of the elements to make this a damn good flick,in other words, to make a pirate movie,a pirate movie and to stand out like a pirate movie. People walking the plank, Pirates grabbing ropes and swinging onto other ships,Pirates searching for buried treasure and others including a pirate who has a talking parrot on his shoulder,and another one with a glass eye and another one that yells out....""Aaargh""!<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes,this film belongs to Johnny Depp. It is the reason to go see it. Johnny Depp gives the performance of a lifetime looking like the smidgens of classic actors Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks,Jr. ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" is a terrific and satisfying popcorn picture that aims to please and has per se,kicked out the summer competition of 2003 at the box office.<br/><br/>The scariest scene but also the best FX scene in the whole movie: When Captain Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) and his crew transformed into walking undead skeletons in the moonlight---this is surely Oscar material here,and I'm so glad that Ray Harryhausen is still alive to see this movie! This scene is scary and maybe too intense for the younger ones."
"angelusbuffyspike","10","0","1","29 August 2003"," Fantastic Movie
","The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is without a doubt the best movie of the summer.  I emmencley enjoyed watching this film the 6 times I went to see it. Even though I went to see this movie an insane amount, it never got old nor did I enjoy it less than the time before. The only other movie that might(and probably will) beat this film will be Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, which, coincidentally, also stars the young, very talented and future major star Orlando Bloom. That sexy star has a very very bright future, esspcially when he co-stars with phenomonal actors like Johnny Depp, Geoffry Rush, Vigo Mortenson, Liv Tyler, Eligha Woods, Josh Hartnett, and so on and so forth.  Anyways getting back to Pirates, This movie features a wonderful acting job from Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush.  They both were cast wonderfully for the parts that needed to be played.  I think we'll be seeing a lot more of Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and well we already see a lot of Geoffry Rush. Peace to all my homies on the S Island!!! I love you Orlando!!!"

","It helps if you have been on the synonymic ride at Disneyland as it serves as the inspiration to the movie.  This was good old fashioned fun.  I took my children (15 and 13) and they loved it.  For me it worked on several levels.  There were in jokes for people who had been on the ride, Several nautical jokes which 'sailed' (sorry) over the heads of landlubbers and spectacle galore.  We got pushed into going by our 13 year old daughter who rather likes Orlando Bloom but I thought all the cast did a very good job even if Johnny Depp rather stole the show<br/><br/>All in all - better than I expected."

","Pirates of the Caribbean is a well-made movie and is worth taking the time to see. Its excellent story and wonderful selection of actors and actresses has drawn in many people of all ages. What makes this movie so good is it's never ceasing action, which was brilliantly choreographed. Its musical score is quite good also. It might just seem that is the best movie ever made, or that it can be shown anywhere to anyone. But it is obviously not the greatest movie, nor can it be shown to whoever wants to watch it. Let me remind you that this movie is PG-13. This is because of its crude humor and intense fight scenes. This is why only people that are teens or older should watch it, hence PG-13. Other than that it is an excellent movie which deserves being watched more than once."

Great first scene where you see him standing on top of a mast, and you imagine that it's some big pirate ship and then the camera pans out and it's a tiny little rowing boat with a small sail that is sinking.

"jaffakree340","10","0","1","1 September 2003"," ARRRRRRRR!!!!!
","It's not often that one leaves the theatre wanting to stay and watch it all over again. PotC is one of those movies.<br/><br/>Excellent cast. Johnny Depp makes one of the best, if not the best, pirates ever seen on the screen (I'd throw him in the same boat as Dustin Hoffman's ""Hook""). Capt. Jack Sparrow is one of the most memorable characters in recent years. Orlando Bloom was actually better at Will Turner than Legolas (so far) in LotR. Keira Knightley was surprising. Being a very attractive woman in a pirate film, one would expect her to be either a helpless bimbo in distress or a sultry seductress. Nothing could be further from the truth on both. She was proper, respectable, and played both a damsel and a fighter at the same time. Geoffrey Rush makes for an excellent villain, one you just can't help but like, even though you hate his guts (well, bones in this case). <br/><br/>The effects are superb, especially that of the fights in and out of the moonlight (if you don't know what I'm talking about, you'll know when you see it). The music, well, WOW. This is the best soundtrack since Gladiator and possibly even better. Perfect mood setting.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent and fun film that's both enjoyable, full of action and adventure, GREAT music, and can both make fun of itself yet still take itself seriously. On this rare occasion, Cap'n Bruckheimer and his scallywags get an A+."
"clevelander","6","0","1","31 August 2003"," Fair example of the pirate genre
","This acceptable example of the swashbuckle genre passes an enjoyable afternoon.  However, only Johnny Depp's original interpretation as the cynical pirate captain gave it any depth. Nothing else excited old the grey cells.<br/><br/>Nice effects, including a convincing set of ghostly pirates.<br/><br/>I should have liked to have seen Knightley's character, for the sake of humour,  a bit more caricatured, more  girlishly excited about pirates, (edging towards Miranda Richardson's Queen Elizabeth in Blackadder) which would have made her a better foil to Depp. And Jack's new crew should have been allowed to get  more into their characters, not dragged in from the actors' bank with ten minutes rehearsal."

"nadger_09","Null","0","1","28 August 2003"," encounters some rough moments but overall a nice ride
","Probably the most commercially successful pirate movie after the days of Errol Flynn, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" pairs blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) with unscrupulous pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Along with a ragtag team of pirates, they must battle a band of the world's most notorious pirates aboard the legendary ""Black Pearl"" ship led by the cursed Captain Barbossa, in order to save Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the daughter of an English governor and Turner's love interest, as well as to reclaim certain honors and possessions that were once Sparrow's.<br/><br/>The film is lavishly produced (it's backed by Mr. Bruckheimer, what else do you expect?) and we have a flamboyant production design. I like how Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom exchange banters with each other and with the rest of the cast, and those swashbuckling skills are well displayed. We also get some decent performance from Geoffrey Rush but I really would want to give credit to Keira Knightley who did a marvelous portrayal of Elizabeth Swann. She's got the looks, the spunk, and the appeal; plus she's probably the prettiest English actress I have seen in a while. So does this mean that ""Pirates"" goes for an absolute smooth sailing henceforth? <br/><br/>Not really. <br/><br/>Sure there are sword fights, ship adventures, and the whole pirate-movie shebang. Also, the leads' charisma and diverse natures work together, and here the story itself is more than good enough to stand in its own right. ""Pirates"" has all the elements I am looking for in a typical summer film and I commend it if only for the entertainment value. <br/><br/>But while the character ambiguity of Depp and the on-screen presence of Knightley make the whole outing interesting, the film steered a bit towards being a ho-hum. It is more like an overstretched theme park ride that seems enjoyable at first, but then eventually becomes tiresome. Or maybe this is one case where I expected too much that it left me quite unsatisfied.<br/><br/>
So I guess this depends on what your expectations are. Sure, it had its shortcomings, and it wasn't as good as it could have been, but I know this is certainly what majority of moviegoers are looking forward to these days. If so, fine. Just like Barbossa, we are parched with thirst for a good summer movie and this could be the one that could break the curse and quench that thirst. So go on and sail into the movie. You know you want to.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","Hi, My boyfriend and I just finished seeing ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and afterward we both realized we had no idea why the cursed pirates of the Black Pearl needed the blood of either young William Turner or his father in order to lift the curse.  We have many speculations, but none of them quite seem to add up, such as...  Perhaps because Bootstraps, as one of the cursed pirates, gave one of the coins away to his son, so when the coin is returned his blood must accompany it, but he's at the bottom of the ocean somewhere, so his son's blood must take its place.  However, that would mean that every pirate would need to shed his own blood every time a coin was returned that the particular pirate spent, and mostly the pirates are just skeletons (although they do seem to occasionally bleed)?  Basically, we think we must have missed some major step in the movie, but I spoke with my sister who's seen ""Pirates"" twice, and she seemed just as baffled.  Someone please enlighten me, and fast!

Starting with my favorite actor, Johnny Depp.  In every movie, no matter how horribly rated by critics, he was always commended on his performance!  This one, he throws his audience another character out of his vast onsemble...and I cannot get over how cool Jack Sparrow turned out to be!  He had the most tasteful lines, reactions, and whatever else I can't think of right now for the comic relief.  Then, the youthful, but talented Orlando Bloom brought the role of Will Turner to life just as he did Legolas in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" acting as the hero and playing well with Johnny Depp's insane, Capt. Jack Sparrow!

","Johnny Depp, I'm male and I love you. Yes, this is how great he is as Captain Jack Sparrow in this Disney adaptation of a Disneyland ride.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this film was on a bootleg copy in Thailand so it wasn't the best experience, what with missing half the words to fuzziness and general rubbishy quality. What I saw though made me realise that this was one film I couldn't miss.<br/><br/>When I got back to Bangkok (still in Thailand) I went to a Thai cinema to go see it which was great because the seats were leather recliners and you got food delivered to you! My sister and I settled down and prepared ourselves for the next 140 minutes of swashbuckling fun.<br/><br/>In my eyes this is Johnny's film. Without it Pirates of the Carribean is just another Summer moneymaker, with him it becomes a classic. Everything about his character is pure entertainment, from his funky looks to his drunken stagger.<br/><br/>Speaking about his funky looks, I'm so getting dreadlocks when I'm older. I reckon with a dab of eyeliner, a bandana and a pirate's hat I'll be quite close to Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm talking rubbish now so just go see this great film."

","Fabled as being the fastest and most powerful ship on the seaboard, ""The Black Pearl"" reigns terror on all ships it encounters.  With its legendary Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his crew of scoundrels damned to scour the world with the gold of Cortes, accursed gold, which, if possessed leaves one as a mere shadow of a human; a skeleton, invulnerable, yet unable to enjoy the benefits of humanity, even when in human form.  It is this quest that brings them to a mooring town in the Caribbean. Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) the young governess who possesses the final gold piece, which holds the power to restore the pirates of The Black Pearl to their former human selves, is torn between love with a blacksmith , William Turner (Bloom), whom she had rescued as a child, and Norrington (Davenport), a Commodore, and friend to Swann's father, Governor Weatherby Swann. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jack Sparrow (Depp), a seemingly inept (and somewhat gay) pirate, is captured and prisoned.<br/><br/>The plot thickens when the governess (and the coin) are seized, and brought to the resident island of the pirates; an island which can only be found if you have been their before.<br/><br/>Sparrow and  Turner league with one another to save the damsel and defeat the pirates of the Caribbean...<br/><br/>Brilliance in itself.  Johnny Depp recovers from his recent slump and comes out with an Oscar worthy performance of the renowned, yet inept pirate Jack Sparrow.  He retains a somewhat drunken stupor throughout the film, yet still is able to fully form a complex character.  <br/><br/>Bloom too was good; He far outdoes his previous role of Legolas Greenleaf, in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  His usual somewhat boring demeanor in films is actually erased from his role and actually allows me to respect the man.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush was a disappointment though.  Since his Oscar winning performance in ""Shine"" he has not really pulled off a good role, sadly enough.  This was just another confirmation of this  slump... Hopefully soon he will yet again find his niche.<br/><br/>Other than this, all the other actors played exceptionally well, and provided a good 143 min of film.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this film to anyone, as this is not only a swashbuckling film, but a comedy, romance, and to some horrific...  Though the skeletons were really quite humorous, and the monkey remained cute... Anyways, four fingers and a stub out of five."

","This movie should get an oscar for the best entertainment value. It was fun, it was funny, it was clever and it had a lot of action. It had a few minor ""bugs"" in it, but when you're enjoying a movie this well, you barely notice them. As always Depp was perfect in his role, it was almost like he was born for that role, or the role was specifically written for him. The other actors were also great in their roles. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because I only give 10/10 to really original or somehow special films. But if you want a movie that is very enjoyable, go see this one."

","I've seen this movie twice now, and have to admit the first time i went to see it, it was because Orlando Bloom was in it.  But I went the second time because i enjoyed it so much.  The actors all fitted their roles perfectly and it's great to see a cast containing lots of Brits.  Every actor/actress fitted there part superbly; Geoffry Rush plays your traditional pirate with lots of energy and Orlando Bloom makes the ladies swoon over him as the young Will Turner.  Of course for the men there's the beautiful Keira Knightly.  The crew of the Black Pearl all put 100% into their roles, especially Mackenzie Crook, and gave the audience the creeps. But it was Johnny Depp who stole the show as Jack Sparrow, he didn't have to say anything, just his body language and facial expressions could steal a scene. His English accent may not be totally accurate but it doesn't matter because it fitted his character perfectly.  He successfully plays the lovable rogue, because by the end of the film everyone has, well, fallen in love with him.  The film may be long at over two hours, but you never get bored because there is always something going on.  Lots of swashbuckling sword fights and great special affects make this a must for any fans of action-adventure movies.  And of course, girls if you don't fancy all that action and fighting theres always Orlando Bloom!"

","Before the film came out, I was looking forward to it purely as a fantasy adventure, where I could switch off for a couple of hours and just enjoy.<br/><br/>There is always a danger with a film such as this, which is heavily hyped as a great film, that it won't live up to that billing. Lets face it, if it isn't great, you'll be disappointed. So when a highly regarded UK critic called this one of the worst films of the year, I was somewhat reassured. The balance had been restored!<br/><br/>And I'm glad to say that this was a really enjoyable night out. There is no way that you can take the subject matter seriously (just watch the trailers), so accept it for what it is.... a very well made (though slightly overlong) Saturday Matinee film. Gruesome baddies, a wisecracking hero and two innocents that stumble into the story and end up saving the day.<br/><br/>I thought all of the main players did a fine job. No-one will win an acting Oscar for it, but they will draw in the crowds. Go see!"

There's lots to like though, some quirky dialogue, sometimes much funnier than expected (only when delivered by Depp though, reading the quotes on IMDB well... i guess Depp deserves even more credit for this film).<br/><br/>Summary: long film felt an hour, so can't be bad. Would have loved some more marooned-island-drink and less moonlight-skeleton-fight, and a more memorable ending... it wasn't very memorable generally really, all i can think of now (same day) is two turtles strapped together. But it felt good and made me + nippers laugh, so 7 or 8 out of 10. (I wonder how good this *could* have been with a better *story*!

Orlando is the brave cute nice guy, and always fun to watch. but it's Johnny Depp who steals the show. even though he was dressed awfully (like a real stinky pirate) with golden teeth and two plaits in his beard and walking around like a some drunk dude, he still has this magical glamour around him. he still looks so damn handsome when he's putting on his (black bad teeth) smile. and of course Geoffrey Rush as the perfect evil man. further the special effects are pretty well done. the fight between Depp and Rush in the cave with the moonlight is really cool.

","The film was about 2 hours and 20 minutes, which is getting rarer to see these days with all the arguing between studios and directors about which cut of films we see in theaters. The movie wisely does not ever take itself seriously, as pirate movies have been done many times before far better. The granddaddy of them all is The Sea Hawk, 1940, with Errol Flynn; there are subtle tips of the hat to this film in Pirates Of The Caribbean, such as the ""sea monkey."" The Crimson Pirate, 1952, with Burt Lancaster is a close second; there is a real nice ode to Burt Lancaster & Nick Cravat in this film. Tyrone Power in The Black Swan, 1942, is also very good. There have been very few pirate movies made in the last 20 years and those that have been made, well... which may be why audiences are welcoming this film so well this summer. Johnny Depp doesn't hurt either to get the targeted demographic into theaters. Orlando Bloom doesn't have a lot to do, playing second fiddle. Geoffrey Rush is almost choking on all that scenery he chews on. Jonathan Pryce plays his part appropriately as the really important person, who is an easily duped oaf. Keira Knightly is ravishing as the girl that needs ravishing. The funny inside joke about the corset scene is that she is extremely rail thin; I would be willing to wager the costumers had to construct a corset that had to appear to be pulled tight around her as none probably existed in real life. I thought the plot about the curse was pretty lame, but it was consistent with the overall preposterousness of the goings-on. It also served as an excuse to provide the real neat special effects, which are obligatory in any ""A"" budget film these days. The soundtrack contains a jolly good rousing score, which could rival the best of Erich Wolfgang Korngold. I suppose it's asking too much, but I would have loved to see more odes to the pirate movies of yesterday, such as those I mentioned above. For those of you that don't know what I'm referring to, see the above mentioned films. *** of 4 stars."

"wolfoul","8","0","1","18 August 2003"," High Seas Hi-jinx of the very best order.
","I enjoyed the ride so thought the film should get an equal chance to impress, and it did! The basic story centres around the Black Pearl and it's crew,captained by Barbossa brilliantly played out by Geoffrey Rush, searching the world for certain gold medallions and a sacrifice to bring them back to the land of the living but with Sparrow, that's Captain Jack Sparrow accompanied on this adventure by Orlando Bloom , it is not going to be that easy. The casting was a breath of fresh air using talented actors that might not be well known to some film goers who played the deadpan humour perfectly, an english thing, and you had no feeling that they were out to upstage each other, an american thing, and was impressed at how they all seemed to relish their parts. The effects are superb, especially the seamless swapping from walking dead to salty sea dog scenes. ILM never fail to get it right, or are they real??? The only thing I couldn't quite get to grips with was Johnny Depps' accent, it was border line Tommy Cooper, an english thing, and gave the impression he was drunk throughout the movie, a pirate thing(?), however, he played the part with such an off the wall air that he did enough to impress. I would have liked to have seen a few more 'real' pirate scenes given their apparent notoriety. I recommend this film for high sea adventure and subtle humour and some good old fashioned sword play without a lazer in sight! One word though, for those who leave before the credits end, never understood why, there is a final scene that is amusing and possibly leaves a 2nd film in the pipeline."
"piratequeeneliza","10","0","1","18 August 2003"," A toothsome romp; Hollywood's answer to Monkey Island
","I am a longtime pirate fan and amateur pirate scholar.  I went into this film expecting a great deal, and I got it all and more.  Outstanding performances from everyone, beautiful special effects, excellent direction, and not-too-visible Bruckheimer.  The only issues I had were as follows:<br/><br/>1. Keira Knightly is too...modern-looking, I suppose.  She didn't sit quite right with me in this role.  I would have cast someone who looks less like every other hip young thing. I would have liked someone a little more unusual or remarkable; less cookie-cutter 90's starlet.  She did a decent job, however.<br/><br/>2. The music, while decent, was not up to snuff with the rest of the film. At first they had Alan Silvestri, then Hans Zimmer, and somehow ended up with Klaus Badelt, who's not a feature composer at all.  He does fill-in music, and it sort of showed.  I would have preferred a riotous Zimmer theme like we had in MTI, or maybe even a Goldsmith. Again, this is a very very minor point that I'm not going to quibble over. My vote is 10/ 10<br/><br/>Those of us who played the Monkey Island series waited so long to see a decent pirate flick.  The much-maligned Cutthroat Island had the swash, and Muppet Treasure Island had the charm, but not until Curse of the Black Pearl have these ingredients been combined properly.  No longer will the spat-upon swashbuckling genre be relegated to cheap parody and jokes about Errol Flynn.  Bloom was a perfect Guybrush, Rush a gorgeous LeChuck, Knightly a fair Elaine, and Depp is (as always) without compare.<br/><br/>I will be spending more of my hard-earned money to see this at least once again.  Well done, Hollywood!  Now let's see what you can do with Peter Pan."

However, i thought the best performance came from non other than Johnny Depp himself.  I just loved his character, and it is safe to say, he gets most of the best lines in the film. And he plays him so well! I was a moderate Johnny Depp fan before the movie, and a great deal bigger fan of him now.  I hope he continues making such great movies and acting to such a good degree of talent.<br/><br/>The special CGI effects of the cursed crew are also great to see.  As they shift in and out of the moonlight effortlessly, so do the effects, keeping in time with the actors performances all the way through.<br/><br/>Truly, and enjoyable, entertaining, swashbuckling, fun packed movie.<br/><br/>Although i could say a huge deal more about this film, i won't.

","Johnny Depp and co shiver their timbers, hoist the mains'l and buckle their swashes in this jolly romp on the high seas.<br/><br/>The, frankly, bonkers plot sees much toing and froing and double double crossing as Jack Sparrow tries to reclaim his ship, the semi-mythical Black Pearl, now captained by Barbarossa. He in turn is hell bent on lifting the curse on him and his men by trying to recover an ancient Aztec coin belonging to British Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann.<br/><br/>Depp steals the show as brain-addled pirate, Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush hams it up as Jack Sparrow's nemesis Barbarossa but lacks the true menace of, say, Alan Rickman in Robin Hood. Keira Knightley is the spunky love interest, Elizabeth Swann while Orlando Bloom once again dons tights for his action role as her unrequited love.<br/><br/>The other standout performance is that of Jack Davenport as Keira Knightley's fiance. British viewers will know Davenport as Miles from the BBC's This Life. Here he returns to form as the sneering, preening, supercilious Commodore Norrington after his shot in the BBC's lamentable 'comedy' Coupling.<br/><br/>Strangely, the action scenes are leaden, lacking the panache of the Errol Flynn-like movies of yesteryear. These needed better editing and, in fact, the slow second act could have done with some judicious pruning, easily losing fifteen to twenty minutes off the running time.<br/><br/>However, all in all, great fun that rises head and shoulders over the rest of the summer's disappointing releases."

","This movie had everything in it to be a bad film. An awful film. But it's not: in fact, it's one of the best action-adventure movies of (at least) this and the past decade. Johnny Depp is over the top but hilarious as capt. Jack Sparrow. He seems to be out of balance everywhere he gets; hence the swaggering. To compensate for his eccentric behaviour, we get Orlando Bloom's Will Turner: he plays it straight but gets the girl - Keira Knightly, not doing to bad herself. Geoffrey Rush's performance is not as extravagant as Johnny Depp, but he does a great job at it anyway. The extra's are good too, and though the plot story is a bit thin (!), the gags are great (one word: fork), and even though it lasts for 2,5 hrs. it never got boring for me. Highly recommended."

I had heard about its success in the US, but the movie didnt really appeal to me, I was never ""into"" pirates when i was young, and I don't tend to like films set about 200 years ago, I usually find them slow and boring. However, was I pleasantly surprised. From the moment the movie started, till the moment it ended, I truly enjoyed myself. Not a single moment of this film was boring, and although the film is slightly long you barely notice it. In fact, I have seen this movie several times, and i still didn't find it even slightly tedious. Its got all the qualities of a top movie: fast pace, excellent script, excellent actors, excellent set, excellent action and excellent special effects.  The acting was superb. Needless to say, Johnny Depp stole the show with his hilarious rendition of Jack Sparrow, however I think all the actors and actresses were great, and I mean ALL of them, Bloom, Knightly, Rush, and even the smaller parts were perfectly played. There was not a single poorly acted part in the whole film, contrary to pretty much every other summer film that has come out this year. Therefore, I would give this movie a 9 out of 10.  The reason why it doesnt get a 10 is because, Pirates Of The Caribbean is not a deep, meaningful story set out to send a serious message to the audience, etc. all that stuff.  Its just a really, really, really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Its out there to entertain the audience, and it does a flawless job in doing so. Films seriously don't get as enjoyable as this."

","It's great to see a movie made by people who remember what it was like going to saturday morning pictures, where our parents would leave us at the door and in we went with a few hundred others to let rip, and boo, hiss and cheer.  Pirates brings all that back, with the writing, action, effects and great perfomances by all bar the still not good keira, she does try but does not quite make it. she was crap in beckham, and is not the great beauty she and some others think she is.  Anyway the film was great fun and as everyone has picked up on Johnny Depp shows how good he is as an actor and what a great sense of humour he has.  Keith Richards should be proud as he is now immortalised on celluloid."
"Letham","9","0","1","15 August 2003"," Yo ho ho Me' Harties
","Johnny Depp excells as the slightly off pirate captain Jack Sparrow, his Fear and loathing style character draws a laugh every time he is on screen, which thankfully is quite often, some good british performances too I am happy to say with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley showing good chemistry, but being shaddowed by Jack Davenports the commanding performance of the up right british officer, Anyone who wants to look up his roots should get the very funny british comedy series 'Coupling'.<br/><br/>In round up this is a refreshing break from the ushall Holliwood production line of Superhero movies and sequals, and I'm sure I'll still want to be watching these salty sea dogs in years to come with all the family, just be prepared to be talking in pirate and want to swashbuckle when you leave the cinema. Yo Ho Ho A Pirates movie for me."

I enjoyed it because I enjoyed watching him, and not because he is eye candy (which he is...have you seen him on the cover of GQ?? *Sizzle*) but because he was just fun to watch.

Johnny Depp absolutely steals the show (I love him!) as Captain Sparrow. The actor who plays Captain Barbosa...was excellent as well.

"minnaloushe90","10","0","1","13 August 2003"," Sparrow is in, Stifler is out
","I was dragged to see Pirates of the Caribbean, and I agreed to go only because I figured no matter how awful the movie is, Geoffrey Rush always gives a good performance and Orlando Bloom is easy on the eyes. After that show, I wanted to watch it again right away. I settled for the next day. Since then I've seen it four more times and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. I have never, ever been this enchanted by any movie.  I resist action/adventure movies, I cannot stand any movie that involves a knife/sword/blade of any kind, I especially don't like Pirate movies and prior to this, was not a fan of Johnny Depp.  This movie has become a very distinct exception and I encourage anyone whose film style prefers Sleepless In Seattle to Indiana Jones to give this movie a chance - don't miss out on a wonderful time.<br/><br/>I live near Disney World and the ride the movie is based on is one of my all-time favorites.  For those of you familiar with the ride, I am happy to report that the film captures the whole spirit of the ride:  a good story and told tongue-in-cheek.  For latter quality, we can thank Johnny Depp for that.  I remember thinking that the words ""Walt Disney Pictures"" and ""Johnny Depp"" do not sound right together, but after seeing this I realize just how important an actor like Depp is to Disney right now. For me, he brought that element of magic to the film that recreated the magic of the theme park ride it is based on. Had Disney insisted on a more conservative actor or performance, this movie would have definitely been lost to Davy Jones' Straight To Video locker.<br/><br/>All the peformances are good but Depp's performance is by far the most memorable, interesting and scene-chewing of any film I have ever seen. And I personally think it takes a lot of talent and possibly true madness to upstage Geoffrey Rush. Keith Richards, Pepe LePew, Dudley Moore's 'Arthur', drunken Dean Martin - every description of Depp's performance is adequate in giving some kind of an idea of what to expect. A new standard has been set! To illustrate what I mean, after living in Captain Jack Sparrow's adventures for awhile, I went to see American Wedding.  Somehow, post-Sparrow, Stifler and his (mis)adventures seemed kind of... boring.<br/><br/>If there are a few bad things I can say about this movie is that it is so much fun, such an original character that I generally have been bored by every movie/performance I've seen since then and b) it's going to be a lonnnng hard wait for the DVD and sequel."

"rexbot","10","0","1","12 August 2003"," I want to be a pirate!
","This film has probably made its way to my personal 10 best of all time. It is light hearted and funny yet has a few moments that really make you think (like Jack's two line summery of what the real rules of life are).  The acting, costumes, dialog, and special effects are all first rate.  This is the sort of film that you will want to see again and again.  Depp and his excellent portrayal of Cpt. Jack Sparrow pretty much makes the movie, though Rush's Captain Barbossa was simply amazing.  This is simply one of those magical films where good actors, are combined with an excellent script and solid direction.  This one has classic written all over it.<br/><br/>10/10"

I have seen this movie 5 times now.  It is NOT too long, as some reviewers have said.  The story is well constructed.  The casting is superb.  The locations are amazing.  There is a rumor that some of the locations used were used for `20,000 Leagues Under The Sea'.  If true, maybe it is the waters, and more movies ought to be shot there.  GO SEE IT!!"
"willrams","8","0","1","17 August 2003"," Nefarious & scariness.
","A lusty loud and funny pirate tale.  Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, is an unlikely ally of Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp.  He is so funny with his loose antics, and wild scary appearance.  They battle together against the most treacherous pirates led by Captain Barbossa, in order to save the lovely Elizabeth, played by Keira Knightley, the love of Will's life.  They recover the lost treasure that Jack wants.  A clashing of swords between Will and Jack reminds me of milder sword fights in 30s films with Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone.  An exciting film with good score, but it is scary and may be too much or too long for little kids.  As a big kid, I enjoyed it!  8/10"
"24540647","9","0","1","16 August 2003"," One of the best films in ages.
","From the opening scenes, I realised that this film was going to be something special.  Having been disappointed by such films as T3 and Bruce Almighty, it made a change for a film to live up to it's billing.<br/><br/>The special effects are stupendous, and used to move the film along, rather than carry a poor script.  The end fight sequence moving between the shafts of light is superb.<br/><br/>There are many laugh out loud scenes, and at no time does the film slow down.  Well paced and well written, I can only hope that any future sequel is as good.<br/><br/>Recommended for all the family, this is a definite 9 out of 10."
"Asterisk0128","10","0","1","12 August 2003"," Worth Going Back for a Third Helping
","`Pirates of the Caribbean' is one of those movies that don't quench your thirst with just one viewing.  You have to go back several times, just to keep up that same happy feeling you have when you leave the theater.  I still haven't had enough of it, myself.  But I've only seen it eight times. And it's the best I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>First off, the cast is better than excellent.  Never once at all did I feel another actor/actress could have done a better job than the three main characters.  Keira Knightley depicts the beautiful Elizabeth Swann, a gorgeous young woman who still manages to *use* the brain she was given, unlike too many damsels in distress on the big screen. Orlando Bloom is coming into the acting world with flying colors.  He portrayed Will Turner in a way that every teenage girl cannot help but fall in love.  Will is an extremely rugged blacksmith, and yet a hopeless romantic all at the same time.  Many people take his `I would die for her' line too lightly, mostly because of its overuse and the fact that it directly precedes another of Johnny Depp's hilarious comments as Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Johnny Depp completely stole the show away from anyone within a ten mile radius.  Every line that left his lips split the entire audience's sides, even if it was not meant to do so.  I have to admit, I had never once seen one of his movies previously (I'm not a fan of most strange/gory movies), but after watching his performance in `Pirates', I will never doubt the man.  He *was* Captain Jack Sparrow.  I never saw Johnny Depp anywhere on screen.  Only Jack, from his most comical walk and slurred speech, down to the blinking of his eyes.  I would LOVE more than anything to rave about Geoffrey Rush's performance as Captain Barbossa, but I am at a loss for words (and space).  All you need to know is that he is the definitive pirate of this movie.<br/><br/>Of course I could go on and on about the realism of everything: sets (stunning), costumes (brilliant) and make-up (just look at Johnny's eye-liner).  But what blew me away almost as much as the outstanding acting was the score.  I've always been a lover of Klaus Badelt, but the music in this movie alone was a huge reason I HAD to go back and see it again.  My wallet thanks me for buying the soundtrack instead.  The music reminded me much of The Lord of the Rings music (also tremendous score) even though it sounds nothing like it.  But Mr. Badelt captured `piracy' itself in this music and it'll be stuck in my head for a long while.<br/><br/>The film did seem to run a bit long, but it was worth it to see the characters in that extra screen time.  It is oh so good to the last drop. No one I've met has regretted going to see this movie and I recommend it to everyone.  It is action-packed, very comical, and is worth seeing over and over again.  If you enjoy every element that makes a great movie, Pirates of the Caribbean is definitely for you.<br/><br/>My rating: 8 out of 10."
"dbn3","7","0","1","15 August 2003"," Suprisingly Good (7/10)
","[I saw this in the theater, YMMV]<br/><br/>First off, I have to say I am a fan of the ride at Disneyworld and looked forward to the movie.  Although there were four or five different parts of the movie I remember from the ride, the movie is not just scenes from the ride strung together inchoerently.  Instead, we slowly learn the story of Captain Jack Sparrow.  For a movie aimed at teenage girls with the inclusion of Orlando Bloom and a feel-good fairy-tale story ending, it is suprisingly good.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that I was suprised at the end of the movie to see this was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.  If I had known that, I would never have gone.  He makes terrible, over the top action flicks like Days of Thunder, Bad Boys, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon and Blackhawk Down.  And in retrospect, his grubby fingerprints can be seen in the overly-long action sequences.  The cute computer trick of having the actors move in and out of the moonlight to look whole then like a skeleton is neat the first five minutes of the final fight.  But, as in all Bruckheimer movies, the action for action's sake is dragged on far too long."
"Lumpenprole","6","0","1","15 August 2003"," cute
","Fun film.  It's the first time I've seen Depp do a crowd-pleasing lead.  His Jack Sparrow is pretty much standard Deppian posturing which really works for me, but I was surprised to see it as the centerpiece of a Summer blockbuster.  Between Scissorhands and Fear and Loathing, he always seemed to me at least as smart as the script, but in this case he pretty much soars above it and delivers his lines with a real relish for camp.<br/><br/>The rest of the film was sorta okay, which is saying a lot since I generally loath the work of The House of Bruckheimer.  Like a lot of other 2.5 hour braindead epics, this one could have edited down for time.  It's not Bergman for heaven's sake - the characters beyond Depp's and Rush's (and theirs are all style) are almost cheap cardboard cutouts.  The advantage of stock characters is supposed to be economy.<br/><br/>The story is excellent compared to general summer fair, especially in this summer plagued by stories ripped from comics, old TV shows, reality TV, and, in Bruckheimer's other Summer film, a bunch of cop show cliches mashed together.  It's not so complex a story that 2.5 hours is necessary.<br/><br/>If producer Bruckheimer has a signature shot it's either 1) that much overused A-Team stunt explosion in the middle ground while a person is catapulted away from it in the fore, arms and legs kicking, or 2) special effect shots THAT NEVER END.  In almost any Bruckheimer film there is an effect or stunt that makes you say `wow' and you want to see it again, like the melting heads in Raiders of the Lost Arc once did.  With Bruckheimer you can count on seeing that effect over and over and over again during the course of the film until every drop of techno magic is drained.<br/><br/>The shot of the undead pirates walking on the ocean floor was great.  It is exactly the sort of imaginative storytelling that has been lacking in many recent blockbuster films."

The movie is not a brilliant one, but it makes you feel good, and it cheers up... It's not boring at all, but it's not all about fighting and car (ok - ship) chasing.

","I never liked Johnny Depp, not even when he did really good work coz for some reason, I always found him pretentious but after seeing this movie, I think he's really brilliant, well, at least in this movie. I know he based his character on Keith Richards but somehow he managed to pull off all originality here. He was indeed the life of this movie and eclipsed all the rest, unfortunately, even Geoffrey Rush. Though Orlando Bloom provided the handsome supporting lead, I was thankful the sub-plot love story wasn't pushed into the main story. He looked really good with Keira Knightley - she's one to watch out for. The supporting cast were all good especially Jack Davenport who I regularly saw in 'Coupling' - he had a really different role here. Typical good versus evil storyline but there's no harm in that - it's summer and you want to enjoy yourself so we can leave the difficult movies nearer to Oscar time. This was a very good movie but I hope they never make a sequel to it. Some things are better left to one."

But the stand out performance has to be from the wonderfully unorthadox Jonny Depp. He could have played Jack Sparrow like any other dashing rouge, but in true Depp style, he adds his own unique characteristics and make Sparrow a wonderfully funny, charming (and lets face it girls,damn sexy)character.In every scene he's not in, your just waiting for him to come back on screen. He steals every scene he's in. This film is just whats needed after the overblown self important junk thats come out this summer. POTC is a great way to spend a couple of hours. It didn't even feel that long to me.....FAB!"
"annam_s","Null","0","1","10 August 2003"," The pirate life for me? No, thank you!
","It's ultimately very romantic to be a pirate, it appears... Or so dear Keira, oops, Elizabeth, would like us to believe. She read a lot of books about it. And she can kick everyone's butt too, even though she wears the painful corsets from time to time. Actually her dialogs and behavior reminded me of another sea-located movie's heroine. Which was just as improbable and illogical as this one. Every minute Keira was on screen, i was afraid she'd burst out into another Freud discussion. Thankfully, she didn't, and, i guess, Gore Verbinsky thinks now we should be grateful at least for this.<br/><br/>OK, OK, Gore. We've got it. Thank you.<br/><br/>As for her acting - did anyone notice that in her previous movie, Bend It Like Beckham, the critics praised mostly her co-star and the actual heroine Parminder Nagra? Didn't it ring the bell of warning to no one? And look who's now hot in Hollywood! The irony of being blond... Apparently it's not all that tough as Reese Witherspoon would like us to believe.<br/><br/>The same goes for Orlando Bloom. Don't get me wrong. He's cute. He knows how to move in the frame. He knows sword fighting and he knows to shoot arrows and wear a blond wig and pointy ears gracefully (not exactly in the same movie, but you've got the point ;)). He may be the most intelligent and thoughtful human being on Earth, i don't know him personally. But his talents ON THE SCREEN are unfortunately restricted to the ones mentioned above. He's given his share of pretty amusing lines and he fails to deliver them to amuse the audience, except for his fans (who were absent from my screening). With his each new movie the directors try to find the acting talent beneath his clothes, so he becomes less and less... erh... burdened with costume detailes (check the set pictures from Troy). Maybe they've become pretty desperate. The next time they'll try to look behind his Troyan skirt, i guess. I won't mind, surely ;).<br/><br/>The less said about the poor Governor and Commandor - the better. The same can be said for the rest of the cast with 2 exceptions, the special effects, which left me totally unimpressed (though one good point - they didn't overshadow the movie, but, alas, there was not that much to overshadow). The direction and cinematography were decent, but nothing worth crowing about. The fights were OK, i guess, with some actually funny moments (the forks were priceless). Though some showdowns were staged simply for the sake of staging (like the duel between Sparrow and Turner with the tagline ""let's try to do this shtick, sounds impressing"").<br/><br/>But the main problem of the movie is that it simply overstayed its welcome. At least half an hour could've been left in the editing room with a couple of the unnecessary turns (not twists, just turns, back and forth, like a dog after its own tale). And the ending... OK, i'd better stop right now. Oh, mine...<br/><br/>But to the only 2 BIG (though not big enough) pluses: Depp and Rush. They were great. Simply put - great. But, considering their reputation and the previous work, it didn't surprised me. I only wished they were given more screen time. The rare actors which, while having a ball with the camp they have to be in, can share their fun with the audience. And make this camp way more deserving than it has any right to be.<br/><br/>Ultimately The Pirates isn't a really bad movie, mostly because of those two wonderful talents mentioned above, just not a particularly good one.<br/><br/>And this summer, as i see, we don't have much choice. It's a pity we don't deserve better. And the thought ""Come on, it could've been worse!"" doesn't help. IMHO, of course..."
"guzzardmg","5","0","1","9 August 2003"," Overblown Bruckheimer. Fun, but long.
","I love pirate adventure and Curse of the Black Pearl seemed to have it for the first half hour or so... but as usual, Bruckheimer's bloated action sequences with little substance or credibility quickly became exhausting. Johnny Depp's performance is stand out. The rest of the cast is outshined by their costumes and makeup(Geoffrey Rush by his teeth). I could talk about the basic lack of interest created by  expositions and explanations given for every motive... but I do enjoy pirates and the 18th century fare so I give it a 5/10."

","My dad took my family to see this, and I wasn't to glad about seeing it, because from the ads I thought it would be bad, but boy was I surprised. This movie was awesome.  Johnny Depp did an awesome job playing Jack Sparrow.  The way he moved when he talked and stuff... really good acting. I love Orlando Bloom too!  I have never seen the lord of the Rings, and this was my first movie with Orlando Bloom.  He's a great actor.  I like the way this movie didn't get too romantic, like some movies that aren't meant to be romantic do.  Overall, this movie rocks!!!!"
"IamWilliamBlake","Null","0","1","11 August 2003"," Too short-really.
","There are a lot of people complaining about the length of this movie.  Most say it is too long.  I, for one, do not agree.  Simply put, Pirates of the Caribbean is too short.<br/><br/>My attention span along with a lot of other people craves for a longer more involved story.  Sitting in a theater for two or three hours is no great task.  Especially when the action on the screen is entertaining, the characters are engaging, the dialogue is funny, and the suspense is gripping.  This can apply to any movie that you find interesting. <br/><br/>
I did not know the film was over two hours long until I read a negative review about it being two hours.  I thought that I must have seen a different movie, because the one I saw was not long enough.  When it ended, I wanted more.  I wanted to see where Jack Sparrow's next adventure would take him.  The other characters, even the minor ones, presented a curiosity that made me want to see their stories as well.  The character arcs of the Norrington, Will Turner, and Miss Swann are well paced and compelling--not at all forced.  At the end of the film you look forward to their adventures and hope that they cross paths with Capt. Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>
After all, what is a movie√É‚Ä¢s prime goal? To entertain?  Doubtful, though it could be.  Film is a business.  If a film can fill seats and get you to do it more than once then it is a success.  POTC is the first movie I have gone to and paid full price twice.  I will buy the DVD, I will probably get the game, and I will go to the sequel on opening night.<br/><br/>This movie is laugh out loud hilarious, has heart pounding action, breathtaking thrills, a romantic touch, and it actually makes you care for the characters on the screen.  Heck you even genuinely care for the villains.<br/><br/>This is not a movie you should expect to find deep meaning and cultural superiority.  It is a fun movie that lets you remember what it was like to dream of faraway away places doing amazing things and winning in the end... unless you want to be a villain, but even the possibilities are only limited by your imagination."

I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie so much. The  acting was excellent - especially Mr. Depp's character.

","not for me.  If you base this movie on other pirate movies such and Cut throat Island or Treasure Planet, then think again.  This movie rocks. This summers movies have been abit light on the plot but this one is great. All I have to say is go see it for yourself and enjoy.  Of course there is the obvious reflection to the Disneyland ride, i.e. the song.  Johnny Depp give another great performance.  It is will be as memorable as Edward Scissorhands and Benny and Joon.  One thing for the Disney studios if they make a sequel, please don't ruin a good movie with a piece of garbage sequel like the Robocop series or Speed 2."

","I loved this film.  Wonderfully atmospheric, energetic, spooky, and downright fun.  As usual, Johnny Depp turns in a performance so immersive, you forget it's him playing the role.  And as typical from the academy, I'll bet he's passed over for an Oscar nomination on it.  Sure, the film isn't ""high artsy-fartsy,"" but it is a great piece of work and Depp does a perfect job as Cpt. Jack Sparrow."

","I went into this movie expecting a real good time, and the blissful actings of Johnny Depp ( Yours Truly ) and other cast members blew the monkey on my shoulder away! I have been waiting for a movie like this all summer, and I am so glad it was this one. This movie had the right amount of Action ( mind you, that is said with pryde ) the powerful feel of Adventure ( making me feel the breeze on my face ) and the very classy and witty elegance of Captain Jack Sparrow, and the very bashful apperance of Will Turner.<br/><br/>
Even though there were parts in the movie where all I wanted to do was FastForward to Jack, Will, or Barbossa, the movie Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl in all is a rewarding adventure for all ages. Savvy? 10/10"

","The first two thirds of this movie are superb. Depp is the perfect pirate and the story is so excellently portrayed that time flies by. I became totally engrossed in the film. Its one of the few recent epic summer movies to have anything more than eye candy sequences one after the other. The only improvement would be to reduce the length of the action sequences towards the end."

","""Pirates"" was an extremely well-made film. The cast alone is worth seeing it. Depp, Bloom, and Rush all play their characters as if they were pirates themselves. This lengthy flick keeps you wanting more at all times. It has everything needed to make a pirate movie great: Amazing ships, cruel villians, valiant and brutal Britains, a beautiful woman, explosions, and most importantly, savage pirates.

","Since I have been on the ride 'Pirates of the Carribean' at both Disney World Florida and Disneyland Paris I was very intrigued to see this movie since it is an adaptation of this classic ride.<br/><br/>It is absolutely great! Its nice to see something original for a change rather than yet another sequel or 'superhero' movie. The sword fighting sequences are wicked and the special effects of the cursed pirates add a great eeriness to the film. All the cast are great but Johnny Depp probably steals the film in his hilarious portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>This is a 12A in the UK and pretty suitable for everyone although I wouldn't recommend taking a child under 7 as they may find some of the scenes very distressing.

Keira Knightley was easy on the eyes, to say the least.  Geoffrey Rush...well, Geoffrey Rush was ALMOST as good as Depp.  And the special effects, although not of the BAM! in your face variety, were nonetheless spectacular in subtle ways like the parting of clouds on a stark, moonlit night at sea.<br/><br/>This movie was not just a ride on a boat; it was a trip..."

Johnny Depp is a great Pirate and the cursed Pirates are marvellous to see (also switching between Skeletal/normal form in between light/dark during fights,etc.).

The theater was packed, which I found unusual since the last movie we had gone to, The Matrix: Reloaded, was completely empty except us. (I figured out why by the end of each)<br/><br/>I had little interest in watching this movie going into the theater. I figured it would be all action or boring plot.<br/><br/>I'd have to say this movie was just the right mixture of action, comedy, love, and fantasy, to make viewing a very pleasurable activity for all ages. Johnny Depp is great as a pirate, and the character is deep enough to make me wish both leading men ""got the girl"" at the end of the movie. Too bad there's only one leading woman.<br/><br/>The authenticity of the dialogue, look, and feel of this movie is about 5/6 believable, but that's close enough. The special effects are pretty cool and they aren't overpowering the whole movie which is good. I thought the casting was very well done also.<br/><br/>The slight twist at the climax of the movie was almost unexpected.<br/><br/>
I just don't feel the father would have reacted that way at the very end. Not in those days he wouldn't have... public hangings were a family event...

","I was a little bit skeptical when my girlfriend and I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean...not being a big summer movie fan, I braced myself for huge explosions with very little plot development and intelligence.  But I was greatly surprised and genuinely riveted to the screen, especially to Johnny Depp's performance.  Had anyone else portrayed Jack Sparrow, the film would merely have been OK, but Depp gave the Captain a swagger that few could achieve.  He walked, talked, and handled himself like a rock star (like Keith Richards on a boat!) and provided humor not in fart jokes or lewd behavior (generally the type of ""comedy"" seen in summer movies) but in style and voice inflection.  Is it an Oscar caliber film?  The answer is no, but Pirates will still provide good, funny entertainment this summer season to those who want to turn off their brains for a few hours and enjoy the ride."

"Aristophilis","7","0","1","5 August 2003"," The perfect Summer movie!
","You have to love this movie. When I knew that this movie was coming into theaters I knew I was going to love it just because it's a pirate movie. This movie is what every summer movie should be about. It has action, a lot of laughs, a cute adventurous story and settings, and lots of fun. The characters are just lovely, and Johnny Depp is just too hilarious. It was worth watching this movie just because of his character and the way he transformed himself into ""Jack Sparrow."" This priate is such a genuine guy. He is smart and funny, and above all good looking. He made me laugh every time he said something. This movie is so much better than Bad Boys II which I thought had a really stupid plot. On top of that, it was too dragged out, and even though some of the scenes make you laugh, they are way too exaggerated to the point where you stop laughing and wonder how easily amused the rest of the audience can be just because they sound like they are talking like to gay lovers in a public record store while being filmed and while the rest of the people in the store are watching them. Well, anyway. Like I said, the cast was terrific, and this is now my favorite adventure-movie. The fact that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie helped in the creation of such a daring vision of a priate movie. I don't think there is one action movie that I do not love by this guy.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Carribean had spectacular special effects, and the landscapes that they chose to film on were just too beautiful. And Keira Knightley is just one smokin' hot brunette. She has the most beautiful face in the whole wide world. I would have given anything to have been Will Turner at the end of their adventure."
"DocIndy","8","0","1","5 August 2003"," The best film I have seen this year!
","First of all I am a 44 year old male who cannot ever remember seeing a pirate movie that I liked.  It is an engaging movie with good direction, writing, costume and special effects.  The near 2 1/2 hours fly by with good pacing.  (Watch all the credits because there is a surprise at the end.)<br/><br/>I would not say that I am fanatically attached to anyone involved in the production.  I would say that it should be nominated for best costume and special effects.  Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance but he is unlikely to be nominated for a film of this genre.  It is the first Disney film that I have liked since the Lion King and undoutedly the first nonanimated film that I have liked by Disney since I was a child.  My wife also enjoyed the film and our adolescent daughters did not think it was cool to go the film with us, but I would suggest that it would be appropriate for most all children over the age of 10. It is a far superior form of entertainment compared to its namesake theme park ride!<br/><br/>I doubt that the Haunted Mansion can rise to this level when it hits the screens at Thanksgiving."
"sdillon-1","9","0","1","11 August 2003"," A first rate adventure film.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is easily the most enjoyable blockbuster film of the silly season for one simple reason: its immensely good fun.<br/><br/>
Its a classic tale of adventure on the high seas as blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) discovers his true heritage as a pirate. The wonderful, surprise-laden plot is too intricately daft to spoil, suffice to say it rattles from start to finish with cursed medallions, sea battles, hidden islands, secret tunnels, treasure, ghostly scares, sword fights, betrayal, romance, action, adventure and of course pirates (both alive and ""undead"").<br/><br/>
The whole cast is superb with Orlando Bloom playing the straight hero to Johnny Depp's hilarious and stunningly offbeat pirate Jack Sparrow (or ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow as he insists on being known). Kiera Knightly is wonderful as spunky love interest Elizabeth Swann, who gets a lot of the best lines (including some great gags about corsets). Geoffrey Rush makes a splendid villain, and Jonathan Pryce is marvellous as Knightly's cowardly father.<br/><br/>
The script is sharp and often hysterically funny (""the pirate code is more like guidelines""). The special effects are stunning, as is the cinematography, which makes beautiful use of widescreen. The music score is appropriately rousing and Gore Verbinski directs the whole thing with a tremendously old fashioned sense of fun which makes this film rank up with the classic Hollywood swashbucklers like Captain Blood.<br/><br/>
All in all, a first rate adventure film."
"dromasca","7","0","1","10 August 2003"," This Summer's Summer Movie?
","This might be well the summer movie of the year. The audiences at least seem to prefer it to Terminator 3, or Matrix. I saw it a few days after the release here in Israel, and the theater was much more populated than with the previous summer movies, and the reaction of the public was more sympathetic. I think the reason is that the film does not pretend at all to be more than it is - Disney-level entertainment. When you enter a Disney park you leave out any big cultural experience expectation, you get in childhood mood and enjoy the ride. Do the same with 'Pirates', and you may enjoy it. Backed up by some decent acting, and with special effects that will fight for the Oscar with the Terminator stuff, the film is decent entertainment - probably some of best you can expect from the US studios this summer. 7/10 on my personal scale."
"psi_fla","Null","0","1","10 August 2003"," Solid gold
","Rating: **** (out of *****)<br/><br/>Every year has a hidden treasure, and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is 2003's. <br/><br/>When I saw the name of Jerry Bruckheimer attached to this a few months ago, I expected a no-brainer. Well, I am very happy to confirm that all the positive advance word you'll have heard regarding the film is true. Hulk and T3 are both solid but leave you with an empty feeling. Pirates doesn't. The writers of Shrek, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have come up with a believable pirate story that is full of wit and one-liners, never taking itself seriously while not being obviously camp. <br/><br/>I guess you could call it your typical story of saving the damsel in distress from the pirates, except there's a major twist. Pirate captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is jailed for several crimes he committed on an island in the Caribbean governed by British governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce). Later, when a group of ""evil"" pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) capture the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) tries to rescue her (well, he's had a crush on her since he was young√Ç‚Ä¶). But he realises he can't do this on his own, so he helps get Sparrow out of prison in exchange for the pirate's help. Both are soon to find out that Barbossa's motives for capturing Elizabeth are more complicated than expected.<br/><br/>Pirates differs from your average blockbuster in three ways: One, the script may not be a work of literature, but it never cheats the audience's intelligence. Two, patriotism and manipulation are not overdone. And three, the visuals are good, but they don't take centre stage.<br/><br/>If Pirates wasn't a little bit too long, it would actually be almost perfect. Still, there are many things about Pirates that I can't praise enough. One of these is the fine cast. Johnny Depp's slurred Cockney accent may cause some of the film's fine one-liners to be missed, but, with a performance that is almost as camp as it is cocky & energetic, his importance to the film cannot be underestimated. Nearly everything revolves around him, and he doesn't let the proceedings down.<br/><br/>He doesn't overshadow everyone else though. Geoffrey Rush is suitably menacing and chilling, while the youngsters don't disappoint either. Orlando Bloom has built on the strengths that we saw in the Lord of the Rings films and shows that he is more than capable of handling more singular roles. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth doesn't fall into the category of being too tough or too weak, instead a nice mixture of both. Knightley finds the perfect way of playing her character, and it doesn't hurt that she looks great as well. British comedy fans will spot Jack Davenport of Coupling and Mackenzie Crook of The Office (playing a pirate with a CG-""eye""; you'll see what I mean when you watch the film), neither of whom are out of place.<br/><br/>Pirates has many nice touches. Several scenes that you think will finish `by the book' suddenly become more compelling scenes or battles. Pirates keeps you hooked because something good or great always happens when you least expect it. Plus, even if stunt doubles were required for some of the swordfights, that doesn't prevent them from being entertaining (although I personally preferred the ship-to-ship battles). And, for those who care, there are some clever nods to the film's theme park inspiration.<br/><br/>This film has single-handedly restored my faith in the Hollywood blockbuster."
"little_sexy_katie","10","0","1","10 August 2003"," Fantastic!
","Pirates is quite possibly the best movie I have seen all year. It has that special quality that reminds us why we love movies so much, it is an escapist. It has absolutely everything you'd want from a great movie; there's adventure, romance, suspense, comic relief and some great special effects. The acting is fantastic, Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow completely steals the show and puts in his best performance in a long time. No joke, this man deserves to be nominated for an oscar. The rest of the cast is very good as well, each person manages to create a character that you really care about. Kiera Knightly will definetly be headed to superstardom after this one, not only is she a great actress she is simply gorgeous. The bottom line with pirates is that it is a fun movie but avoids becoming cheesy because you actually care about the characters and the outcome. It is a movie everyone can enjoy, very young kids might be frightened but there is enough comic relief to keep it from getting too dark. If you are going to see one movie this summer, make it Pirates of the Carribean."

","Pirates of the Caribbean puts just about every other film released this summer to shame. The cast is superb, particularly Johnny Depp who's eccentric Jack Sparrow steals every scene. The film looks beautiful in every department. The script (from the writers of Shrek) is smart, funny and true to the genre. This kinda film is just whats needed amongst the slew of the superhero films and sequels, good old fashioned family entertainment with out a single frame of bullet-time in sight. A must."

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl""  Is the best movie of the summer.

","When I first saw the trailers to this movie, I wasn't very interested thinking that it was yet another pirate movie. But I was dragged by friends to go watch it on opening night...and was I ever glad I did!!! This is such an amazing movie! It's about 2.5 hours long but you don't even feel it. Everything in the movie is related...there are no scenes that just come out of nowhere. The character development is really good. I especially like the character of Johnny Depp (as Jack Sparrow). His actions and his screen presence is just amazing. Without a doubt, he steals the show as Captain Jack Sparrow. His British accent is also very convincing. It is hilarious to watch him on screen. He is perfect for that role. Orlando Bloom (as Will Turner) is also very good as is Keira Knightely (as Elizabeth Swann). I was half expecting the traditional 'maiden in distress' role for her but surprisingly, her character is far from that. Geoffery Rush (as Capt. Barbossa) is really good as well. The special effects in this movie are amazing. Definitely a movie to watch this summer."

"johnnysugar","8","0","1","5 August 2003"," A glorious return to a lost genre
","Some people may be unfortunate to remember the 1995 Geena Davis/Renny Harlin disaster ""Cutthroat Island,"" a bloated and stale attempt to revive an old sub-genre, that of the swashbuckling adventure film.  Long dormant after Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks hung up their tights and rapiers, the genre was due for a comeback.  Now, much like ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""Chicago"" revitalized the sleeping form of the musical, pirate films have been rediscovered in the form of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl.""<br/><br/>At a British colony in the Caribbean, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter to the governor, is being wooed by two men: the proper and stoic naval officer Norrington (Jack Davenport) and the unassuming yet sincere swordsmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom).  But courtship has to wait when the infamous pirate ship the Black Pearl, headed by the vile Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), invades the colony and kidnaps Elizabeth.  Will's only hope to save her is to free the Black Pearl's former captain, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a dangerously unstable and hardly trustworthy fellow.  Things are further complicated when it turns out that the pirates have all been cursed for stealing Aztec gold and that moonlight reveals their true state: that of rotting corpses.<br/><br/>This film is wonderfully entertaining.  All of the performers give fantastic performances, from Knightley's strong-willed and curious Elizabeth to Bloom's resourceful and determined Will.  Plus, it's great to see Bloom without elf ears.  The best performance by far is Johnny Depp, giving one of his wildest and strongest performances of his career.  His Captain Jack is half-way between Keith Richards and insanity (which may not be too far), an amalgamation of swishes, slurred words, and blustery bravado.  Depp just doesn't steal every scene he's in: he robs it at sword point.<br/><br/>The director has a hand for sweeping adventure, as well.  Gore Verbinski is best known for directing the supremely creepy ""The Ring,"" and some of the moody hand that guided that film is present here, as well.  But Verbinski knows how to handle the genre and his actors very well, everything coming together in a strong wind that sweeps the audience along with it.  The movie is full of characters but never overcrowded.  It is swarming with details, but it is never tedious.  The script, like the film, hearkens back to the witty repartee of early swashbuckler films, which may sound laughable on paper but makes perfect sense coming out of the characters.<br/><br/>The most striking thing about the film is the CGI involved in rendering the skeletal pirates.  While there are several scenes of fully-skeletal pirates, the most impressive use of this effect is during a fight in a cave, where the pirates dart in and out of moon light with only part of their bodies transformed.  After the offense to cinema that was ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"" and after seeing the fantastic effects WETA pulled off for ""The Two Towers"", I had lost faith in Industrial Light & Magic's ability to inspire wonder.  They have outdone themselves on this picture.<br/><br/>Despite the entertainment value of the film, there are a few minor drawbacks.  At almost two-and-a-half hours, the film is slightly long and could easily have been trimmed down by 30 minutes.  Similarly, several minor characters, such as Zoe Saldana's black female pirate Anamaria, are intriguing and sadly underused.  These are minor complaints, however, and they do not detract much from the overall enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is sure to inspire other directors to helm their own voyages into swashbuckling adventure.  Here's hoping that they all turn out to be as thrilling and enjoyable as this one.  9 out of 10."

But it *was* a good movie.  The script was wonderful.  The dialogue was absolutely fabulous, so quick and witty.  The film was also visually stunning, a real tribute to new movie-making technologies.  As for the sfx, I need only point to the underwater march.  Two very difficult elements -- cgi underwater and cgi skeletons, mastered simultaneously.  Overall, I think this is one of the best movies I've seen this year.

","Okay, I have read some reviews from some 'highbrow' critics, punching holes in the storyline, commenting on the FX and length of the movie, sniffing at the 'over the top acting' - well folks, I normally don't enjoy movies at the theatre, even sitting through them at home when they come out on DVD is torture, (I can't sit still that long!) I am NOT a young female fan who went to see the 'hotties', I have never been a Johnny Depp fan, I usually HATE Disney movies, and I, like many, thought the Pirate film genre has had it's day. So it was only a family birthday party that got me to this one in the first place.<br/><br/>Well, I am sure glad because I have never enjoyed anything so much in years -  the acting, the scenery, the story, the costumes - all great fun! I have seen it several times since and every time I see something I missed before - and some of the so-called storyline holes and unexplained things make sense once I saw it again.  This was great entertainment, pure and simple, and although I don't know if I will like Johnny Depp in anything else, he was THE MAN to play Jack Sparrow.  I heard he was given free rein (although reluctantly at first) by the Powers That Be to flesh out this character - that was their best decision because Jack Sparrow stole the show.  Geoffrey Rush WAS the way I always picture a crusty old  Pirate Captain, he did a great job.<br/><br/>From 8 to 80 - enjoy this hilarious romp - I didn't expect the humor but it works great!  And although I am sure the pompous imperial wizards of Oscardom will not recognize this flick for anything except maybe costumes - the music was excellent, Rush deserves a nod, and Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar for this character's development.  Awesome job, buddy!!"

"soccer_sweetie_18","10","0","1","4 August 2003"," Awesome Movie!!!
","I went to this movie expecting the only good part to be Orlando Bloom. Instead, I got the best plot for a movie since... well actually since Lord of the Rings, but that wasn't too long ago so it might not mean anything;) What I mean to say is, Pirates of the Caribbean is fabulous.  It is truly what the word action packed was made for.  This movie is entirely unpredictable with false endings all over the place.  Whenever you think the movie is about to end, it surprises you in ways unimaginable.  To add to that, the casting was fabulous.  Johnny Depp was the star of the show, portraying the crazed ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" (""That would have to be the worst pirate I've ever heard of"").  For being over 40, Depp was very good looking as well;).  Geoffery Rush was perfectly casted as Captain Barbossa of the Black Pearl.  He created a perfect mix of a villain and a poor tortured soul.  Keira Knightley played the part of Elizabeth Swann wonderfully.  Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook were incredible as the goofy pair of pirates Pintel and Ragetti, respectively.<br/><br/>Okay, now onto Orlando Bloom.  While I love him dearly, he is clearly not cut out for the hero role.  He plays a much better sidekick.  Still, he played the part of Will Turner to the best of his ability, which is still remarkable.  It is very obvious that playing the elf Legolas in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy has made him a much better actor.  Whenever there was a fight scene he pulled out the Legolas moves he acquired while filming the trilogy.  There's also the added bonus of him being so hot!:)<br/><br/>
Having seen this movie 3 times, I hope you will take me as a credible source, and go see this movie.  At the very least, rent it when it comes out on video."

"profx72","9","0","2","3 August 2003"," More fun than the ride....
","It amazes me that so many people get on the computer an pan perfectly good movies.  Pirates kicked arse, in my opinion. (Note the English accent so prevalent in this movie.)  Johnny Depp made the movie, which, admittedly, was little more than a special effects tribute to the popular Disney attraction. His character was not only the basis for the film and a cause for the best action sequences, but also the comic relief. The plot was curiously interesting, and made sense if you think about it, adhering in many ways to the type of pirate legends that made up the Caribbean history. If you liked Cutthroat Island, you'll love this movie.  It's fun, exciting, and well worth your schillings.<br/><br/>Also, as a Florida boy who went to Disney many times in his youth, Pirates was always one of my favorite attractions.  Not only did it have air conditioning (which in the summer months was a major draw in the magic kingdom's choices), but it also featured the animatronics and music that made the ride famous.  Glimpses of this attraction can be seen throughout the first sequence with the pirates, including, but not limited to, pirates chasing wenches, the pirates locked in the prison trying to tease the dog into bringing them the key, and the pirate skeletons hanging from the rock.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, and would recommend it heartily...mates."
"polargirl","8","0","2","3 August 2003"," Give Jack Sparrow an own movie!!!
","You are probably getting sick and tired of ranting reviews on Depp's performance in pirates of the caribbean...well... here's one more! Without Johnny Depp's HILARIOUS Jack Sparrow this movie would be an average summer blockbuster for the kiddies. Depp's tongue in cheek interpretation of the character gives the movie exactly the sort of light heartedness that it needs. To be honest any serious pirate movie cannot possible be any good, or in this day and age won't be found entertaining. The youth of today, majority who buy movie tickets and download movies, thinks pirate stories are old fashioned and frankly, boring. Its the humour in this film, which Jack Sparrow gives it that makes it worth seeing.<br/><br/>The other actors in the movie are on the whole acceptable. Rush's over-the-top cursed mutinous first mate fits in well in the overall feeling of the movie. Knightley's performance as damsel in distress is just as good as any. Its her chemistry with Bloom which is sparkling and in my opinion justifies the choice of her as the lady of the film.Bloom on the other hand seems at times a bit lost in this big budget movie. He certainly looks dashing enough and there are some genuinely romantic scenes between him and Knightley, and he's good at action sequences, however at times his acting is pretty awkward.If Depp hadn't been cast beside him: this movie would have been a stinker. Bloom doesn't have the on screen presence yet. But hopefully that will develop.He does have talent.<br/><br/>The plot and story of the movie is as expected very thin and there are problems with pacing. The movie is 20 minutes too long. The middle part of the movie being occasionally uninteresting. But the beginning and end make up for the mediocre storytelling in between.<br/><br/>I'm starting to become a fan of Gore Verbinksi. He has certainly created a unique atmosphere in Pirates of the Caribbean.Keep up the good work!!And know i'm not alone on this: GIVE JACK SPARROW AN OWN MOVIE"

Keef!<br/><br/>How funny!<br/><br/>Heard it /saw it / felt it Before reading confirmation here and elsewhere that he Was being Keith as a pirate, and Yeah, it obviously wasn't just some arbitrary hip choice, like playing him as Bob Dylan or even John Lennon. It's great to know Keith is still living and breathing among us, and great to see him living and breathing on a pirate adventure in the 1800s through overlaid masks of Johnny's Hunter Thompson and Ichabod Crane and Don Juan -- like Ed McMahon becoming an axe-wielding maniac thru Jack Nicholson -- bizarre, but it works.<br/><br/>The choreography of all the many swordfighting scenes was great -- comical at times, theatrical & tense at others -- it was Errol Flynn with a little Fred Astaire, and maybe Eddie Murphy or Jim Carey.<br/><br/>This is Swiss Family Robinson, Kirk Douglas, swashbuckling swordfights, swinging from ship to ship -- except done in a real 21st century foxy way -- with explosions that shake your soda, and a surreal Star Wars bar scene in Pirateland, where Jack 'Han Solo' Sparrow goes back to recruit a crew.<br/><br/>
The music was just great, swept you along with the swooshes of swords, as did the choreography.  The sets take you there, the castles make me want to be there, and the living skeleton special effects bring out my own worst nightmares.  The acting is typically melodramatic Disney comedy, but that's the genre, and its consistent and funny.  The storyline is kind of convoluted and ridiculous, but the dialog is righteous (just look at all the quotes on this site after about one week in release).  Finding faults in this is like complaining about Duck Soup;  ignore the flies, and just fly with the parrots.  This is a silly, wonderful, imaginative, transportive ride based on the coolest scary ride at Disneyland.  How could it not have been made before?  And I'd love to have a five bowl serial."

","Pirates of the Caribbean is a swashbuckling adventure in the flavor of the Golden Days of Hollywood. It took me back to the days of Errol Flynn in ""Captain Blood."" It had plenty of the high seas action, just enough creepy mystery and a healthy dose of contemporary humor. I agree that Johnny Depp stole the film with his memorable approach to Captain Sparrow. But, it was only because he made such brave acting choices that he rises above this otherwise gifted cast. Everyone is cast perfectly and the director sets the tone beautifully from beginning to end. The real hero, however, in this film is the script. It launches us on a hair-raising voyage full of intrigue, conflict, false bravado, and laughter that doesn't let up until the final frame. How rare that a film is both entertaining and family friendly in the tradition of the old adventure classics!"

Johnny Deep was great as Jack Sparrow and I loved his representation of a pirate. Orlando's character, Will Turner, is the perfect man. Sweet, caring, kind, passionate, strong, dependable, his own man, and a skilled craftsmen and swordsman. If only I could find a guy like that. I was really impressed that Keira Knightley's character, Elizabeth Swann, was portrayed as such a strong and independent person. Usually female characters in movies set in this era are displayed as weak and in need of a man to save her from every little problem. And while Elizabeth did need some rescuing she didn't just stand by and wait for it to happen. She helped in the fighting and even at one point even did the rescuing of herself and Jack. This is a great movie that left wanting to see it again even as I left the theater. This is one movie I will definitely buy as soon as it is released."

There's a little bit of everything for everyone in this movie.  For those in the audience who love women, Keira Knightley is beautiful and talented, if somewhat a little too close to looking JUST like Natalie Portman.  For bad-boy lovers (even if only hormonally), Johnny Depp is a wonderful choice, and for those of you who like the boy next door, Orlando Bloom keeps up his star-power with a pretty face, and he does well with what little he's given to do. Johnny Depp positively steals this movie.  For Depp fans, it's been a while since we've seen him stretch his proverbial wings.  This role is not only fun, it's quirky, and quirks can be darned hard to portray.  He does a fantastic job capturing the audiences' imaginations, not to mention the occasional mind, heart, and oh my yes, set of hormones. I was disappointed in Geoffrey Rush's performance; it seems bizarre that the man who played ""twisted"" so well in ""Quills"" could put forth such a mediocre bad-guy in this film. One thing I did find disappointing was the LACK OF CHARACTERIZATION AND PLOT given to Will and Elizabeth.  It hardly seems fair that we are told nothing of what happened to them between childhood and adulthood.  C'mon... give us at least something.  Nonetheless, their respective portrayers did well with what little they had. All in all, it was good entertainment.  I recommend it."

","but those whiners that are slamming this movie on imdb have missed the point by such a wide margin that you either have to question their sanity or their intelligence.<br/><br/>The sword fights weren't violent enough or well choreographed enough for you? Suck it up, it's a Disney movie, it's meant to be suitable for kids. What were you expecting? Blade?<br/><br/>You could tell the CGI was CGI? Nice going there Sherlock Holmes. Here's a hint for you: walking undead skeletons don't exist, of course it was going to be CGI.<br/><br/>You disagree with the method for boarding a ship? Oh give us a break, it was supposed to be a comedic moment.<br/><br/>You thought the acting was over the top? You people need your heads checked. It is supposed to be a fun movie based on a fun ride in a fun park. Grow a sense of humor or just keep your uninformed and negative comments to your miserable and sourpuss selves. If you wanted Training Day or Schindler's List, you should have rented them.<br/><br/>For those of you who have not seen this movie, go and see it. It is probably the most fun swashbuckling movie since Raiders of the Lost Ark and provides a very enjoyable evening's escapism. If you want to see a feature full of gritty realism, go and see one."

","FIRST IMPRESSION<br/><br/>I dont know about you, but I've been on Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ride probably a dozen times.  Its a classic, and in some ways the new blockbuster hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, is one as well.<br/><br/>
SUMMARY<br/><br/>Basically, Johnny Depp plays Jack Sparrow, a cunning and smooth-talking pirate who seems like he might have spent a little too much time at sea. After the governor's daughter gets kidnapped by an odd gang of pirates, who have been sailing on the mythical Black Pearl, it is up to Jack and a courageous blacksmith to not only save the kidnapped girl but also prevent the crew of the Black Pearl from destroying the curse that plagues them.<br/><br/>
ACTING: 93%<br/><br/>Truthfully, I wasnt a big fan of Johnny Depp.......until now.  He is terrific in this movie.  His smooth, humorous words and his somewhat drunken stature make his original pirate character into a full scale movie of its own.  In some respects, I dare say, he made this film.  But, all the other actors, including Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush, are top notch and worthy of praise.  Still, its Johnny Depp who lights up the screen, and everytime he enters a scene, the movie is somewhat enhanced and ultimately more enjoyable.  All in all, great acting all around.<br/><br/>
STORY: 75%<br/><br/>Moderately good story.  I mean its nothing epic or rather new, but its decent for an action movie.  Usually in a standard action flick, the plots follow a set pattern.  The bad guys steal something, and the good guys set off to take it back.  ""Pirates"" follows the same premise.  One thing I didnt like about the story, and this is a big chunk of the story actually, was why did Jack and Will Turner want to stop the pirates of the Black Pearl from breaking their curse?  I mean, once the curse is broken, they become mortal men.  So, the danger of walking skeletons with the intent to kill would be over.  And it wasnt like they were going to kill Will Turner over the coins; they just needed his blood.  They knew and the audience knew that a simple cut would have sufficed.  Decent story, with that one big fault in the story.<br/><br/>
DIRECTION: 85%<br/><br/>When a high scale action blockbuster comes out, you know its probably a Michael Bay film or a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  In this case, its a Bruckheimer film, and he doesnt disappoint.  The shots of the battling ships floating around in the fog and the smoothness of the transition of the pirates to skeleton are all perfect.  The shots of the beaches and palm trees also bring out a certain feeling of being stranded on a deserted island, with nothing to do but fish.<br/><br/>
FUN FACTOR: 85%<br/><br/>One of the things that plagued this film slightly is its length.  At 133 minutes, the sword fighting got a little boring towards the end.  But, nonetheless, the rest of the movie, especially the beginning is totally engrossing and I would have to say ""Pirates"" is one of the more entertaining movies of the year.<br/><br/>
FINAL IMPRESSION  ---84%<br/><br/>With its exciting action sequences, the humor of Johnny Depp, and the excellent shots of the town and ships at sea, Pirates of the Caribbean is one movie definetly worth your time in the theater.  Oh, and did I mention Johnny Depp?"
"Yavin2","9","0","1","30 July 2003"," See it for Depp's Performance
","The movie was a lot of fun, though it dragged on for about a half-an-hour too long, and the ending seemed altogether unrealistic.  Most of the fight scenes were too long and I had a hard time believing that mortal sailors could give undead pirates such an extended fight.  And the ending should've had Bloom and Knightley joining Depp as he sailed away with his new ship. But all that aside, Johnny Depp gives his best performance since Donnie Brasco as the wild, crazy, and slightly effeminate Jack Sparrow. Throughout the film he's incredibly funny and he obviously had a lot of fun with the part. The rest of the cast, for the possible exception of Geoffry Rush who shines as the villain, isn't anything special, but at the same time there's nothing really to complain about.  Knightley is definite eye candy, but wasn't that believable, and Bloom does a good job(just not Legolas good). Overall the film was exciting and you should definitely see it, if only for Depp's performance."

I haven't had this much fun at a movie since ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" (all-time favorite movie, by the way).  Johnny Depp, an unexpected surprise, makes the film, and the all-star cast along with him just makes things even better.  Twists and turns in the plot are more numerous than the Disney ride itself, and I am amazed that the script writers created such a genuine article from just a ride!

","I thought this was a great movie. It was good to see Depp in a film that wasn't so gothic or dark like his past films; Sleepy Hollow, The Ninth Gate and From Hell. Those were all good movies, but I was happy to see him in something more comical. Geoffrey Rush did a great job as the villianous captain, and Orlando Bloom had a nice follow up outside of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The only thing slightly negative I can say about this film, is that it was a tad bit long. Other than that last half hour, I thought it was a wonderful flick."

","Whoever the genius is that decided to make a movie out of a Disneyland ride, instead of the other way around, thank you. This movie is a ride. Don't look for anything other than a lot of action, fun, a few funny lines, and a riveting performance by Johnny Depp. Costuming, sets, music, sound all deserve nominations. This is Depps best performance. He's an actor I respect because he's willing to expose his career to off beat roles. His supporting cast, including Orlando Bloom is fine, but this is clearly Depp's movie. Enjoy it, like you would snack food. For me, it's the most watchable film of the summer. Good cross-over should mash it past the $200,000,000 mark with ease. It leaves itself open for a sequel, but I don't know how Jerry Bruckheimer would top it. The summer belongs to Disney. After five losing years they are back at the top of the ziggurat. Congratulations, Michael, you teamed up with a winner and a winner is what you got. Can't wait for the ""making of"" DVD."

Let's just say I was never emotionally drawn into the story of this little money maker.This movie is great for those who are content with flashy effects and simple plots, but it won't impress those who crave to forget where they are and truly live in the world of the movie. If the theatre smells or a person next to you coughs the flimsy spell this movie attempts to cast will be immediately broken.This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.

Depp was magnificent - as naturally anyone would imagine that knows his work.  I'm jealous I'm not him, but that's between me and my therapist to work out.  Bloom shows just as much skill in his craft as in Lord of the RIngs, and it always seems to work for him that his characters are masters of their trade.  He just has that look of wisdom beyond his years... I guess.  Knightley... quite a different role than 'Bend it Like Beckam' but also a good strong female role. And she succeeds to be the damsel in distress that can kick some butt.  Disney delivers as only it can and WATCH for some scenes from the actual disney ride.  Brought back those childhood memories from my favorite in Disney and now this:  my favorite DIsney film. I wasn't sure if i was going to mean that, but I really do.  I just hate it when people build up a movie, getting my expectations so high, so I'll try to restrain.  Great cast.  Smooth direction.  Disney elements (music, fun, and plot).

","***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** This movie... well, it's so good I can't even begin to explain it. I may begin with saying that Johnny and Orli look awesome in it. The scene where Sparrow first appears is just wonderful, on his sinking boat.<br/><br/>Johnny's acting is perfection in this movie. So far I have seen it 5 times, soon to be six, and it is wonderful. Keira Knightley is excellent, and Geoffrey Rush is great as Barbossa.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Pirates of the Caribbean is flawless. I usually hate violent movies, but for some reason I love it in this movie. Probably because when they stab the people and stuff, there's not much blood and you rarely see the bodies, especially at the end. The casting for this movie is perfect, and nobody else could ever play the characters. Jack Sparrow is hilarious, and he makes the movie a comedy. Without him, the movie would be a lot less wonderful, but still good. I think the best thing about this movie is that there are few curse words, therefore making it okay for younger people. Although it is violent, like I said before there is little blood and few bodies shown.<br/><br/>Another good thing about this movie is, well, I sometimes feel akward when dramatic moments occur, and in this movie, even the most dramatic moments can remain pleasurable.

I give it a 7/10 but without Depp I can see it possibly garnering a 5 or 6.  I liked Keira Knightley in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" but she didn't do anything for me in this one--though she ""looked"" stunning :)  Orlando Bloom need something. Maybe more engergy or a enthusiasm, I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Some of the fight scenes got a little silly but for the most part they were concise and not too drawn out.  However, one idea did strike me as odd.  If the bad pirates could not be killed because they were undead...then why didn't the good characters help them lift curse, thereby taking away their ""powers"" and making them mortal?  Anyway, if you like the big screen see it now.  If not, wait for it to be on cable."

","Just saw it last night and I've got to say, what a fun movie!  Lots of humor and adventure, an interesting (if at times overly-convoluted) plot, and an over-the-top performance by Johnny Depp, who unquestionably carries the film.  I have heard that Depp consciously modeled his performance on Keith Richards, remarking that pirates were the rock stars of their day. Well, it works like gangbusters!  The support is good too, though nowhere near Depp's level.  And the female lead is certainly easy on the eyes.  The special effects, particularly as regards the ghost pirates, are good as well.  Overall, this is the kind of film you can just sit back and enjoy, without having to think too much if at all.  And well worth the time and money at a first-run theater.

Special effects are very good. Depp's character is a treat to watch. Its unfortunate that once a movie gets so much attention, people become very critical... almost like they feel they have to dissect every detail and show the rest of us why we are wrong in thinking that the movie is good.

To make matters worse for Orlando Bloom, Geoffery Rush as Captain Barbossa was brilliant. To top the whole movie off, the blend of comedy and action was great.

Despite all of these good points, something just didn't work for me.  The pacing was off and I found it too long.  I think it would be a much better movie if it were 1/2 an hour shorter.  I found myself checking my watch several times-not a good thing.<br/><br/>The length of the movie offset most of the good points for me and I gave the movie a 6/10.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","30 July 2003"," Fantastic not-to-be-taken-seriously-ness
","Whether from innate childhood psyche or collective memories, pirate stories have always had a special fascination for us. The first seed could have been planted by the kid that never grows up. My personal favorite, inevitably so whenever a G&S version is available, is The Pirates of Penzance, on the movie version of which I have contributed my comments. This latest pirate yarn taking place in the Caribbean has its own special attractions.<br/><br/>
Right from beginning, you know that this movie is not to be taken seriously. But what a cleverly crafted piece of not-to-be-taken-seriously-ness. The duel scene at the beginning was shot, I bet, with serious attention, to produce the not-too-serious joviality. Helped with clever angles and dexterity in cutting, this sword fighting scene is second to none that has come before. Orlando Bloom, less Elvish looking here, is just as dashing. As to Johnny Depp√Ç‚Ä¶ well, I'll come to him later.  <br/><br/>Admittedly, the movie dragged on for too long in the middle, and I must confess that I succumbed to a temporary lapse of consciousness (which was not too long). When I woke up, the movie became fun to watch again, with a somewhat intriguing plot of three conflicting parties: soldiers, living pirates and living-dead pirates (reminiscent of Rhyme of the Ancient Mariners). Jeffery Rush delivers an excellent chief villain, and a final irony of gaining life just so that he can be killed.<br/><br/>As to Depp, I'm just wondering if there is a limit at all to what he can do to surprise and delight. Playing this imaginative role of Captain Sparrow, he outshines what was once my top favorite pirate role, Kevin Kline as The Pirate King in The Pirate of Panzence. If not for anything else, this movie should be seen just for Depp."

The pirates are a colorful, entertaining lot. Acting was okay; Depp was amusing, and fake-Winona was nice eye candy. There are some wickedly funny moments, but plenty of stale one-liners and repeat gags as well. They are the kind of cheap shots at humor that can be sure to have the audience rolling on the floor as long as the movie has already roped them in by then.<br/><br/>The ending is naturally cheesy and draws out for way too long.

A blown opportunity for a neat ending.</li></ul><br/><br/>***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The special effects were good, but that's not enough nowadays to carry a movie.<br/><br/>I was trying to figure out how this movie pulled off an IMDb 8 out of 10. Here's my theory: the promotions for Pirates successfully scared off the vast majority of would-be critics. The trailers and ads had Disney and BRUCKENHEIMER splashed all over, and that was enough to insure that only the sure-sells would actually pay to see it in a theater. I am predicting that Pirates will not age very well, and the rating will slip over time down to about 7.<br/><br/>Overall, I give Pirates a 6 / 10: worth seeing at least once. Perhaps I am outgrowing the action, adventure genre."

"pandora8","10","0","1","27 July 2003"," This movie just makes me happy.
","I love this movie, and am glad that it has (finally) made its way on the top 250 movies on the IMDB. It deserves it. Pirates of the Caribbean is amazing on every level. First of all it's a movie with a screenplay. Many witty and interesting lines pepper the dialog, making it entertaining. So many movies are just there to watch, there is nothing to listen to, it is a breath of fresh air to be caught up in the words as well as the visuals. But on to the visuals, the special effects are amazing as well. Leaving the movie theatre there was only one scene where the special effects took me out of the movie, and that was the first one with the ship coming out of the fog. Pirates of the Caribbean achieves what every other blockbuster has failed, delivering great CG effects that are realistic and seamlessly woven into the movie. Now on to the acting, the weakest link in this is Orlando Bloom, but that is not to say that he is bad by any means. He has the least to work with so it isn't fully his fault. Keira Knightly is very good she is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses, and her character is wonderful. She is not just ""the girl"" she is one of the leads up there with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. Her character is one of the best female characters in an action movie since Princess Leia. Geoffrey Rush is one of my personal favorites and doesn't disappoint in his part as the evil pirate captain.<br/><br/>Now Johnny Depp, he deserves his own paragraph (as well as an Oscar nomination) for his Captain Jack Sparrow. From the moment he sashays onto the screen with his beaded dread locks, gold teeth, and slurred cockney accent you cannot take your eyes off him. He is marvelous. So off beat, and perfect that if all other parts of the movie were bad, he would have been worth it anyway, and the fact that the other parts of the movie are great makes his part glorious icing on a delicious cake.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is my fourth favorite movie of all time. I give it 10* out of 10. Please excuse me though, I must go to the movie theatre to watch it again."

","One of the best I've seen this year.  Possibly, the best, this year. Great story, plenty of action. My 2 sons, 12 and 15 loved it.  It has something for everyone, even a romance for us ladies. Johnny Depp steals the show. He is terrific!  Lots of humor. I wouldn't take really young kids to see it, cause it does have some intense scary scenes. But this what Hollywood should be making instead of a lot of the garbage that comes out of there.  Great movie!!!"

","For those that were disappointed with the action of this movie, I think you have missed the point.  The comedy has something for everybody (parents and kids will laugh at the same jokes for different reasons).  Even though it is a long movie, I never once looked at my watch or thought 'enough already.' This is a first class movie all the way!!!!  Except for the academies bias against comedy, I think Johnny Depp would get Oscar buzz."

","I've seen this movie a total of 4 times. Why? Not because I didn't understand it because it is easily painted out for you the first viewing, but because it is a great story and an actor's showcase. I haven't seen a film in a while that has kept me as entertained the entire length of the film such as this one. Johnny Depp completely steals the show as Jack Sparrow and his love for the Black Pearl. (SPOILERS)<br/><br/><br/><br/>He tries to get the ship back in his own hands, as he was captain before the curse set it's course, but he was thrown off the ship and marooned on an island. Since he was unable to take a coin from the cursed chest, he wasn't affected by the curse itself. This is what I don't understand. Many people say the plot is thin and doesn't make sense, but the whole movie revolves around the Pirates looking for the last piece of gold.<br/><br/>(End of Spoilers)<br/><br/>I loved this movie and will buy every version that comes out on DVD in the future, I strongly suggest you see what a good movie is all about."

"leyenda61","8","0","1","29 July 2003"," no wonder it's doing so well at the box office
","First of all, I really wasn't expecting to be impressed with this movie, even though I am a Johnny Depp fan. Most movies this summer have have been pretty bad, most notably, Bad Boys II.  Jack Sparrow was always two steps ahead of everyone, and I really liked the way that the story tellers didn't reveal was his wily plans were until they came into fruition.  The casting was dynamite, as was the cinematography, writing, humor, and set decoration. If I were to raise some of the films weaknesses, I'd say that 1) It was probably too long and had at least one too many endings, 2) some of the violence was a little too graphic,in particular, the slicing of throats and when the British navy troops were run through the sternum with swords.  I might also have editted out the crying child when the pirates plundered.  It was a little too realistic.  The denoument was a little drawn out, but i like the way that even though the damsel's finance was written as unlikable, they didn't cliche him and make him into the scorned rejected villain. But all in all, I definitely recommend this movie.  Maybe the sequel will be a little more family-friendly, but still, I endorse this film as sequel-worthy."
"medakesh","10","0","1","27 July 2003"," Disney's done it again
","Pirates was one of the better movies I've seen in awhile - not only was the cinematography great and the special effects amazing, the acting left nothing to be desired.<br/><br/>The plot was gripping and left me wanting more - 2 hours is fairly long for a movie, but I could have sat through 2 more hours and loved every minute of it. A great blend of action, adventure, and comedy.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and exciting, with the final battle leaving most of the audience cheering and clapping, not to mention laughing, going from skeleton back to human again.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow was amazing, his facial expressions and mannerisms really made the character one of a kind. Unfortunately, Orlando Bloom did leave much to be desired (not in a good sense, ladies)- good looks aren't everything. Geoffrey Rush makes a great pirate, and Keira Knightly did a good job in more of a lack-luster role compared to the others.<br/><br/>All in all, a flick that left me wanting to see it again and again.

"iaingibson","10","0","1","26 July 2003"," Best summer entertainment movie since...
","Pirates of the Caribbean is one of those rare films that gets better the more times its viewed.  In fact it seems deliberately designed for repeat viewings, so dense is the amount of information packed into what I found to be an incredibly short two and a half hours.  It may not be an intellectual piece, but it's certainly one of the more intelligently created films that I've seen.  Perhaps its this denseness of information that's caused various critics to complain about plot holes because it does get to the point that you blink and you've missed something.  Not that the film cannot be enjoyed without following every single explanation, but those critics determined to nitpick will erroneously find something to complain about. Certainly if they're unwilling to dig deep enough - and with a summer entertainment flick like Pirates, who would think that you needed to dig deep?<br/><br/>On the substance of the film itself, watching Pirates is the most fun I've had in the cinema since... actually, I'm not sure when the last time was that I enjoyed a film this much.  Johnny Depp's performance stands held and shoulders above pretty much every action hero to grace the screen.  His entrance alone will become one of those shots thats played alongside Gene Kelly singing in the rain, the Death Star blowing up, Julie Andrews singing in the mountains and Indiana Jones running from that boulder.  I've seen the film four times, and now I don't laugh when I see it, I start laughing about five minutes before (much to the annoyance of the rest of the audience).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are pretty good too - a stand-out performance from Geoffrey Rush, solid work from Orlando Bloom, (the gorgeous) Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and the host of minor players. The script is witty, clever and imaginative, while also still managing to pack in every convention of pirate movies under the sun - but then what else would you expect from Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio who wrote Shrek, The Mask of Zorro, and apparently Disney's Aladdin.  And then Gore Verbinski's able direction manages to create a look that's both modern and classical at the same time.<br/><br/>The only downside to the whole thing is the musical score.  Much as Klaus Badelt (et al) produces some decent music to match the pictures, the music does sound derivative, it lacks a decent hero's theme (something along the lines of the Indiana Jones theme), and probably would have sounded much better if it had been written by Alan Silvestri.  But that's a minor complaint in a film that actually makes me think that there's hope for the summer blockbuster."

The casting is pretty good, though many of the characters are far too restricting for the actors to go anywhere with it.  Johnny Depp is absolutely delightful with his rendition of the slightly-addled, but all-together wise Captain Jack Sparrow.  There are a few moments that will make you chuckle and a few moments that will send your heart into your stomach.  Also, a couple of nice references back to the ride (such as the infamous jail scene with the dog).  All things considered, this flick has only half a brain, but continues quite nicely and allows the viewer to leave the theater with a smile on their face."
"TheGlen","9","0","2","25 July 2003"," Johnny Depp sure can buckle a swash
","Where to start.  From Johnny's Depp's opening scene on the sinking dingy to well done CGI that didn't overwhelm the movie, Pirates has established itself as one of the finest pirate movies of all time.  Each character is well acted, even the minor characters have well established personalities. The fight scenes are well choreographed, and the CGI meshes perfectly from flesh and blood to bones and tatters.<br/><br/>As far as plot goes, it's a pirate movie.  Buried treasure, kidnapped lady, plank walking, ancient curse, broadsides and lots of sword play, they hit all the cliches you would expect.  But they do it well.  Where other pirate movies have failed, Pirates manages to mix action and comedy in the right amount.  I know these kinds of movies don't win Oscars, but it at least should get a hard look.  Depp and Jeffrey Rush especially for their brilliant portrayals of rival pirate captains."

It wasn't pretty good. Is wasn't good. It was great. Now, I will start this with the graphics. They where amazing! Every bone was correct, and the rotting flesh was so creepy it wowed the audience in every way. Now, the actors... they where all also perfect. The one that I must say shined the most, was Johnny Depp (Captain jack sparrow)! He was perfect, and his acting and moves made him the most complex character. The others where also great, but there's something about Johnny Depp. Another thing to talk about. It's rated PG-13. Is this a bad thing? Not at all. Should you take your little kids to see it? No. It's almost as violent as ""Lord of the rings"". That's not a bad thing, though. The music. This was yet another great part of the movie. The tunes where fast paced, action packed, and amazing. In fact I highly recommend for you to buy this soundtrack. The setting was perfect, and the parts that are the best, (The duel, and the final battle etc.) are absolutely amazing. This is not only the first PG-13 Disney movie, but ""Pirates"" was also probably the longest. The comedy was side-splitting. Overall I highly, HIGHLY, recommend this movie. You will love it.

","I found this film to be thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable.  While some parts could certainly have hit the cutting room floor, with no loss to the film, I still enjoyed it enough to recommend it to everyone.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp turns in a hysterically entertaining performance as Jack Sparrow - I'd call this one of Depp's greatest performances, and the price of admission is worth seeing his turn here. Orlando Bloom makes a believable pirate as well, and gets extra points for having that lovely hair.  Kiera Knightley's talent as an actress is apparently debatable; but then again, the part wasn't much, so I can't judge her based on this film alone. Geoffery Rush makes a great bad guy, but I expected nothing less than a stellar performance from Rush anyhow (that is what he does, after all).<br/><br/>The sets and costumes are gorgeous and lush, and the ships are beautiful to look upon.  I do wish there had been more swordfighting, though! Overall, I think this film will sit well on the shelf along with the other Disney live-action films that have done so well over the years, and is entertaining enough to watch more than once.  More than twice, in fact."

"turningpoint33","10","0","1","23 July 2003"," A must see film...
","The Pirates of the Caribbean; the Curse of the Black Pearl, is long in both title and running time. However, to those of us, myself included, who would sit forever in a movie theatre so long as we liked the movie we were seeing, the time was neither too long, nor over-done. At a whopping two hours and fifteen minutes, I found surprising little lag time in the plot as it hopped easily and smoothly from one scene to another. Though a lot of people are saying it was repetitive (and I'll admit, some parts were), I found I didn't care much as the movie was such a well done piece of work that it had me wanting it not to end.<br/><br/>If you haven't heard enough about Johnny yet, here's some more. Though the casting was superb for all the roles, Depp certainly stole the spotlight. With a swaggering walk, slurred accent, and clever costume, the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow sweet talked his way out of trouble (an into the audiences' hearts!) time and time again. This suave rougue with his half-drunken manner, his clever comments, and his daring eye-liner look, got himself into and out of trouble in about equal amounts. Though he always managed to come out on top, most of the time it was obvious he was not entirely sure of what he was doing; though he did a good job of faking it. Not on any one side all of the time, Jack Sparrow played the part of a hero (whether he had intended it or not), while just trying to retrieve his beloved ship from the hands of the mutinous Captain Barbossa. However many flaws the bumbling Captain Jack had, and though he didn't always play by the rules ('pirate' after all), he became a loveable, goofy character that has landed Johnny Depp his greatest role yet, I believe. He seemed to have sunken completely into his role, and invented such a clever character.<br/><br/>This action packed movie has a little bit for everyone, comedy, action, adventure, even romance, though Disney did a good job of not steaming up the screen too much. A carefully placed love plot was tied in with the rest of the movie, so as to keep it discreet but add a little spice to this adventuresome flick; not to worry parents, no Titanic scenes in this film! The two lovers, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, were played by the talented Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, both of whom did excellent jobs with their roles. Geoffrey Rush played the mutinous Captain Barbossa, who was an excellent villain, though not so funny as to take away Depp's role as the main comic relief.<br/><br/>The animation was nicely done, and it was an interesting concept to see the crew of the Black Pearl turned into living skeletons. The plot is easy enough to understand, and will keep the younger audiences interested, as well as the older audiences. Great twists, memorable characters and quotes, beautiful scenery, and a carefully crafted plot kept me interested the whole way through. I'm only sorry I didn't stay to see the extra scene at the end, I'll be seeing the movie a second time, and will definitely enjoy it just as much. It has quickly climbed my ranks among favorite movies of all time. Though it was based on a ride, and many would consider it just a 'marketing ploy', I say; ""if they spent the time and money to make it, and it's good, let them reap the benefits. They earned it."" Pirates of the Caribbean is a memorable movie, with an awsome selection of characters (and actors) and a clever plot that I think anyone who just wants to escape reality and have a good laugh will enjoy. Definitely one to see in theatres!"

","I have to admit going in to this picture I had some reservations. I mean how desperate has the movie industry become that they are driveing around Southern California looking for amusement park rides for story ideas. I grew up in Anaheim right next to Disneyland so I am intimately familiar with The Pirates of the Caribbean ride there. I have to say that thankfully though this movie only has passing resembleances to things that take place on the ride; instead chooseing (correctly) to use the ride as inspireation for almost a completely new story idea.<br/><br/>First off I have to say that the special effects were incredible, of course what could you expect but the best from ILM. I dont think i've seen a movie in the past year where they dident have some part in the special affects in the movie if needed.<br/><br/>The movie itself was supriseingly rather well paced. I dident realize untill I got home that the movie was over 2 hours long, there simply are no slow spots in the movie, and certainly nothing you'd start thinking about sneaking out to get some popcorn over so you better come in with all the goodies you want for those 2 hours because your not going to want to leave.<br/><br/>
The story is amuseing in enough places to make the movie generaly classed as a comedy along with the action/adventure/fantasy tag but it somehow manages to roll all this into one without boreing the audience.<br/><br/>
It's sappy in some places, but comidicly so instead of being weepy. And the romantic sub-plot is goofy enough to be funny but romantic enough to be beliveable, and above all fairly original.<br/><br/>The only reason I don't rate this movie a 10 is I dident leave it with the heart pounding intensity of being totaly drawn into the movie and the story it represents, but to be honest this dosent seem to be the intention of the movie at all. Instead it comes off as a light hearted romp thru the imagination of someone who's probably been on the ride at Disneyland one too many times. :)<br/><br/>There are a few nods to the ride itself also, specificly 3 or 4 places where scenes from the movie could have been cut directly out of the ride, but it comes off more as an homage to the ride origin of the story itself instead of the movie relying on peoples familiarity with the ride to support it.<br/><br/>
There is also an amuseing bit at the end that I wont spoil here you can click on the side bar under ""Crazy Credits"" to see exactly what it is but it's probably the only part of the movie that shamelessly plugs the possiblility of a Part II if the movie goes in that direction."

","This movie is a classic. It's going up on my shelf the day the DVD comes out. It's so much FUN! :) Loved the acting, it was even better the second time, and I'm planning on going to see it in the theatres again. SFX were great, Johnny Depp is the heart and soul of this movie, my favorite swording-fighting scene was between Depp and Bloom in the rafters, Knightley is lovely and funny in her own right, and Cap'n Jack Sparrow's entrance has got to be one of the filmdom's classics. Great cinematography, the plot was great (and left room for a sequel :), and I don't have a single complaint about it. The thing I enjoyed the most about it was that it was just rolicking good fun. It's up there with quotables like The Princess Bride and Holy Grail. Rush played a very good ham to Depp's cheese. Depp played it like he'd had a bit too much rum...ten years ago. Pryce was even redeemed upon a second viewing. Great costumes, a totally plastered good time!"

I hadn't expected much, but for a Disney movie it's pretty violent. The plot is pretty good actually and is played out well. It's just a fun time, nothing too in depth.

"CMUltra","7","0","1","27 July 2003"," As fun as it looks!
","From the first scenes with Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, you know this is a movie meant for fun.  Sparrow is not serious and brooding, nor is he portrayed as a typical action hero.  He's quick on his feet to be sure, and fast thinking as well.  But he's also bumbling and prone to mishap.  He's a *delight*.<br/><br/>You see the Commodore, played by Jack Davenport, and you immediately expect the tired ""self-righteous pompous person of authority"" stereotype... but they don't use it.  Norrington turns out to be decent and honorable which is another refreshing change.<br/><br/>Even the undead pirates are presented in a humorous (not comical) light, rather than serious horror.  That's a testament to the skill of director Verbinksi who certainly knows how to do horror (see: The Ring), for the undead are shown in full rotting, guts-bared glory.  Yet, like the rest of the film, they are elevated into adventuresome fun.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, Pirates is fair.  This is an adventure film, and to try to make more of it is to recognize its failings.  Popular film for a long time now has glorified the wrong things.  Evil over good, etc.  Pirates doesn't do any better here, but at least it's not heavy handed.<br/><br/>Remember, this is a ""summer movie"".  That has come to mean action over story, style over substance and lots of adrenaline.  Pirates succeeds well here.  As with most ""adrenaline movies"", you won't remember many details afterwards but you will be left with a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction. Pirates won't make you think, but that's the point.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."
"keithanddeenie","Null","0","1","27 July 2003"," A real snore...only a ""five""
","`Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' tries hard to be a Monty Python-esque farce, and also aspires towards the fantasy and horror element, but winds up falling flat, probably because it tries too hard, and ends up somewhere in between.<br/><br/>There is actually quite a bit to like about this film (provided you manage to stay awake), the story, for one.  The problem here is that the sound is so poorly mixed that it's often difficult to understand the dialogue, so that only near the end does the plot become clear.  As a result, quite a bit of suspense is lost.  This would have fared better as a silent film with subtitles (They're going to love it in France).<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush, as `Captain Barbossa' stands out in a cast that includes both Johnny Depp and Jonathan Pryce.  He alone, among the three ""name"" actors in the cast, seems to be completely comfortable in his character's skin.  He was able to traipse the none-too-fine line (under Gore Verbinski's direction) between satire and drama that both Depp and Pryce seemed at a loss to navigate.<br/><br/>I am a great Johnny Depp fan, but as much as I've admired his work in every single film in which he's appeared (especially `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'), I have to conclude from this effort that he's simply not the swashbuckling type.  As much as it pains me to say, `Pirates...' would have fared better with an overblown ham like Tom Cruise than an artist like Johnny Depp.  I could see Cruise (assuming that Verbinski could properly direct him) standing on the deck of a sinking vessel, striking a GQ pose, and uttering some daft speech in a way that would better conform to the spirit of the movie.  Depp, on the other hand, appears almost groveling whenever he delivers a comic line.  As a measure of how comfortable he was in the shoes of `Jack Sparrow', one only has to observe his ghastly eye makeup and beaded strands of beard.<br/><br/>Pryce made a valiant effort (considering the direction), but the best he could achieve was a mad scramble to keep his character real, and ended up only looking winded, like a marathon runner who'd been going in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>I liked the acting of Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Jack Davenport. Bloom came off as a pragmatically chivalrous hero, and played the action, dramatic and comic scenes with equal dash and enthusiasm.  He actually brought out the best from Depp, especially in the sword-fight sequence in the blacksmith's barn.  Knightley is a dark-eyed beauty who gave us a wonderfully not-so-helpless damsel in distress, played with vigor and intelligence.  Davenport, as the commodore and swain of Knightley's `Elizabeth Swann', stayed fully within his character, with an uneasy frumpiness that accurately depicted the paradox of a youthful man given great responsibility.  He would have been a perfect foil if only someone could have come up with a well-timed punch line.<br/><br/>Despite its high points, this is not a film I'd find easy to recommend.  The promotional excerpts are better than the final product, and promise far more, especially from Johnny Depp, than is actually delivered.  I saw `Pirates...' with my wife, and she summed up her impressions concisely with a single letter, oft-repeated:<br/><br/>Z-z-z-z-z-z-z..."
"saska-3","9","0","1","27 July 2003"," A summer blockbuster that will stand the test of time
","It's bizarre, if you think about it.<br/><br/>Millions of people are crowding theaters to see a movie about pirates - that famously dead genre that nonetheless gets resurrected by a studio executive every few years, to the same crushing defeat.  Yet ""Pirates"" is slipping by minor percentages each week in the box office, outperforming sure-fire blockbusters that opened after it did, and garnering repeat viewings in what must be record numbers.<br/><br/>How did this happen?<br/><br/>Start with two brilliant character actors who are both over-the-top and yet utterly within character, and who shine in equal measure when they share the screen: Johnny Depp and the not-oft-enough-mentioned Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>Add the archetypal forbidden romance between members of different social caste, who have loved one another since childhood and yet are destined to be apart.<br/><br/>Throw in a swashbuckling score, plenty of well-executed swordplay, great special effects and enough humor to keep all the melodrama from eliciting groans.<br/><br/>These are the elements of a box office phenomenon.<br/><br/>For those of us who look for more in our movies than ""that was fun"", there's plenty to keep us in our seats (or get us back in our seats, as was the case with me):<br/><br/>The story is intricate, the legend well-developed and fully explained, and the execution consistent.  I've heard every question raised pertaining to the plot of this film, and every one of them is answered within the film.  I think those subtle details get missed because there's not a tremendous amount of exposition - which would bog down the movie's pace.  Instead, other than a comic diatribe describing the curse of the Black Pearl, we must get our information in bits and pieces, paying close attention to the movie throughout the entire running time.  This is the hallmark of screenwriters who care, and who participated in the movie's development.  It is also the result of a director who cares about story, and who insisted on getting it right all the way through.<br/><br/>In addition, there are moments of brilliant and unusual cinematography that keep the otherwise-tedious swordplay interesting.  Watch the first swordfight between Will and Jack for all the background set details, the movement of the machinery in the blacksmith's shop, and the camera angles. Later, when the curse is in full evidence, the seamless special effects provide visual spice throughout the longer sequences.<br/><br/>On second viewing, the score was a bit heavy-handed (though nowhere near the constant amusement-park calliope of the ""Harry Potter"" films), and really, it's allowed - we must remember that this film is in part an homage to the ride at the Disney theme parks, and the music is a great way to give a nod to that feeling.<br/><br/>I'll agree that the final 20 minutes or so of the film lag a wee bit - there's one more skeleton-pirates-fighting-melee scene than I personally needed, and everything after that is clearly set up for a sequel.  But I won't say I didn't enjoy those 20 minutes, nor can I point to any single part of them that I think the film would have been better without.<br/><br/>I'm a movie buff, but I'm picky.  This one will be in my collection, and frequently re-watched, when the DVD comes out.  And I have this funny feeling I'll be back to the theater again before it leaves the big screens. 9/10"

","Well,<br/><br/>I just came back from the theater and let me tell you, I am dead tired. The movie itself was well written and exciting but probably because it ran too long, that my brain feels asleep. <br/><br/>I don't seem to remember a lot of the plot, though I know enough to tell you I liked it. You can always count on Disney to create a good family movie for all to enjoy, though I have to say this is a little bit beyond Disney with all the fighting and blood that was shown. I found those two blittering idiot pirates to be awful in providing comedy relief, to me they were just plain annoying. Johnny Depp seems like an ass to me, his performance was good but I just didn't get into his character. Just getting slapped by a bunch of women and then shooting Barbossa in the chest seemed unoriginal to me. Some parts to me thought that they should be serious and not funny but hey, everybody has their own opinion.<br/><br/>It's definitely one of the better movies out there this summer. As far as story goes, this movie has more twists and turns than a water slide and water world. I recommend anyone watch it, if they are looking for a good summer flick. Hopefully you will have the patience to sit through this for 2 hours and a half hours."

","A Disney movie is a huge blockbuster hit? Who knew? But it's true, Pirates of the Caribbean is without a doubt the best summer blockbuster this year. Some have said that this movie was targeted toward kids and that small-minded adults would find it good as well. I hardly consider myself and my friends small-minded but when we went to go see this movie we were laughing our heads off and left the theater pumped after it ended. Of course you can't talk about this movie without talking about Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. I knew this movie was going to be a classic the first time Captain Jack came on the screen. I wont give anything away but those that have seen this movie know what I'm talking about and probably laughed as hard as I did. I'm not the biggest Johnny Depp fan, mainly because I just haven't seen too many of his movies, but this has to be the role of his career. He probably wont win any awards for it but niether did Harrison Ford for Indiana Jones and that's the sort of character Jack Sparrow is only more quirky and flamboyant. The supporting cast was outstanding as well. Geoffrey Rush played a good pirate, but I never thought he was all that bad. I mean who could blame him for being a little ornary after ten years of dealing with that curse? Orlando Bloom plays a very heroic and Erroyl Flynn type character.  He plays these characters well but wasn't given a whole lot to work with. I did like how he made fun of Jack's mannerisms in one scene. And then there's Keira Knightley. What can I say about her except that she's absolutely beautiful. People say she looks like a cross between Natalie Portman and Winona Ryder. I say who cares who she looks like she's gorgeous and her British accent completely knocked me out. I've read a lot of these reviews but I can't believe no one has mentioned the two gay pirates or the two stupid British soldiers. I'm sure they were used to make the movie more appealing to kids but they were still hilarious! I couldn't help laugh at them. Overall this movie kicked butt. So it's two and a half hours long. I didn't notice it. And for those who seemed bored with it and mock it for whatever they find wrong with it I always remeber this. This movie wasn't made for the oscars (or though I wouldn't be surprised if it got some special effects or costuming nods) it was made to entertain an audience and that's exactly what it did.  You can't go into a movie and expect it to be Citizen Kane or The Godfather everytime. You have to understand where the producers and cast and crew were coming from and all Bruckheimer does is make entertaining movies and this is definitely one of them. 10/10"

Pirates of the Caribbean is the best Disney film yet! The story is creepy with cursed pirates. Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is fantastic. He was humorous and Captain Barbossa made a great appearance as a scurvy pirate. The famous song was sung many times in the film. It's great.

","This movie was fabulous. I don't think I've enjoyed a movie in the theater this much in a really long time, and I see lots of movies. The critics mostly gave this movie mediocre to good ratings, but I wonder if they were at the same movie I was, because it was great!<br/><br/>I have heard that this is the first PG-13 Disney movie, and it certainly has more blood and violence in it than most Disney live-action films, but compared to most adventure movies it's quite tame. The skeletons and sword-fights are realistic and well-done without being real enough to be scary to anyone but small children. I'd recommend it as a family movie, having watched it with my parents and friends.<br/><br/>It's also a teen/twenty-something movie, with particular appeal for fans of Johnny Depp, as well as for everyone who drooled over Orlando Bloom as Legolas in ""The Lord of the Rings."" My male friends, who found Keira Knightly so attractive in ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" may not even recognize her in this movie because she has such a different look, but it's a look that's much more typical of a romantic heroine.<br/><br/>In ""Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" Orlando Bloom shines as the very good-looking Will Turner, and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swann plays opposite him with vim and verve. Will has some wonderfully swashbuckling duels, and just the right touch of romance, adventure, derring-do and endless courage as he faces up to his personal tragedies and revelations about the past without dwelling on it or making the movie sad. Elizabeth is a little different from the usual fainting females whom men are trying to rescue, because she isn't afraid to get in a boat alone and row after Will when he needs rescuing.<br/><br/>One of the best special effects is when the pirates are moving in and out of shafts of moonlight, particularly the duel between Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. Johnny Depp, who played Captain Swallow, seemed a bit tipsy throughout the movie, and his odd behavior and wry wit cracked me up time and again. Jonathan Pryce, though his part is small, is quite enjoyable as the prissy governor, Elizabeth's father. Another highlight is the monkey, whose antics are possibly the most freaky of any in the movie. I couldn't understand the talking parrot most of the time, and the guy with the glass eye who was supposed to be comic relief wasn't all that funny, but generally the humor in this movie was great; not too heavy-handed or dirty, just highly entertaining.<br/><br/>If you get a chance to watch it, I hope that you enjoy the Pirates of the Caribbean as much as I did! Go see it! 10 out of 10."

The acting, especially Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, was superb. And Orlando Bloom ensured himself a bigger role in his next movie. The story line was actually quite entertaining and the special effects?<br/><br/>
The ships always looked like ships, not some CGI image of a ship. And the crew of the Black Pearl?<br/><br/>Let's just say that the effects used to depict the crew were remarkable. A real tour de force, which was very subtle at first and then caused a ""what the?"" reaction when it sunk in. <br/><br/>As others have said, it's not a movie for youngsters.

Johnny Depp is hilarious as Jack Sparrow, Orlando provides the eye candy as he swashbuckles his way into your heart, and Keira Knightley is, of course, the beautiful damsel in distress.

","Yeah, it was produced by Disney and the budget had ""Disney"" written all over it, but I have never seen a Disney movie quite like this before... and I like it!  It wasn't easy getting me to this movie: I don't see Disney movies in the theaters... ever and I never see pirate movies, but my friend convinced me to go and to be honest the commercials looked good.<br/><br/>Well, I'm glad I went.  This was an experience to behold.  The landscapes and cinematography is beautiful and the acting is terrific.  The story is the only thing in this movie that's Disney and that is only the basic framework. I.g.: Don't expect a surprise ending, be prepared to say, ""Well isn't that ironic?"" In a sarcastic way.  But that is okay because a movie that ends like that is okay now and then.  Besides, what is inside the frame is totally un-Disney and it made me like pirates.<br/><br/>There are many sword fights and many people die... I think just one is a record for Disney.  The over all tone is dark and foreboding and the solution to the plot is more like an Indiana Jones film.  While there are more senses on land than in the ocean, all the scenes are beautifully done and look like something you should see in a pirate movie.<br/><br/>Now onto the best part of the movie: Jack Sparrow.  I have a new respect, actually I have some respect, for Johnny Depp; no one could have made the role better.  He plays a headstrong, not-not-so-up-to what he thinks he is pirate.  In fact, most of the amazing stuff this guy pulls off is totally luck and total stupidity on the part of his enemies.  He also brings a level of humor that goes between sarcastic and blunt and back and forth that really makes you wonder what he's going to say. The one liners and over all mood he gives the film makes it all that more enjoyable.  He's like a modern day good for nothin' wannabe hippie that had everything dropped into his lap and if it isn't given to him, he gives up... finally a pirate I can relate to!  Anyway, I hope he returns for sequels.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly is, well, a perfect balance between talent and beauty.  While anyone could have acted the role she makes the heroic portions of the role all that more believable and she looks damn good doing it.  She's a woman that you can believe four guys would be going after at once.  She is sexy and strong and I loved her in the movie.  Wish I could say the same for Orlando Bloom, but he really wasn't in his element and obviously hasn't developed enough to make the best of what he's got... he seemed to method act a lot of it.  Geoffrey Rush played Barbossa really well and looked especially well.  I really felt hate towards him.<br/><br/>In all this is a terrific movie that deserves it's success.

","I've seen a lot of movies this summer.  Everything from X2 to The Matrix Reloaded to Hulk to T3.  These were all action packed and/or thought provoking.  It was about time for something that was just `fun'.  Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl filled that quota.<br/><br/>Orlando `Legolas' Bloom stars as Wil Turner, a typical `blacksmith-with-a-heart-of-gold-turned-to-piracy-after-undead-pirates-kidnap-his-one-true-love'.<br/><br/>Keira `Not-Natalie-Portman' Knightley (who actually played Queen Amidala's decoy in The Phantom Menace) is Wil's one true love, Elizabeth Swann.  It's one of those `high-class-girl-has-to-marry-high-class-even-though-she-loves-lowly-blacksmith' stories, but when she's captured by undead pirates, things change.<br/><br/>Johnny `Didn't-He-Used-To-Be-Really-Famous?' Depp makes this movie as Captain Jack Sparrow.  Depp stole every single shot he was in, playing the typical `pirate-who-you-never-really-know-what-side-he's-on-even-at-the-end'. Depp is hilarious, and I will probably buy this movie when it comes out on DVD, if only for his performance.<br/><br/>
""Impressive"" Factor: High.  Besides the humor brought by Captain Sparrow, the special effects were beyond.  Just beyond.  Industrial Light and Magic outdid themselves on this one.  You see, the undead pirates show their undeadedness when moonlight hits them, which makes for some creepy, dramatic moments, but once that point is brought across, it's almost like it's no big deal.  Skin, no skin, its all the same.  It's about time special effects weren't the focus, no matter how awesome they might be.  The ending battle is great, perhaps only because the special effects were used to enhance the story, not just be there.<br/><br/>
Overall:  See this film.  It has everything.  Pirates, love, humor, special effects.  Go.  Now."

","POTC is absolutely the BEST movie I've seen all my life and I've seen a number of movies. It contains different genres, such as comedy, adventure, and romance, that come together to result in a great film that's, without a doubt, worth seeing more than twice in the theater. Johnny Depp, who plays the hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow, has proved his superior acting skills once again, while at the same time, taking the female audiences' breath away with his gorgeous face and hot bod. It's actually kind of awkward that I find the black eyed ""pirate look"" he flaunts to be very sexy and I think gives him a sense of mystery. He was deff. my favorite! As for the other cast members, they also did an outstanding job. Geoffry Rush, who's other movies I've never seen, played the villain of the film very well. Newcomers Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are rising stars who were lucky enough, AND talented enough, to get one of their first roles in a movie like this. The movie is entertaining for all ages, both boys and girls. It was thankfully long and kept me sitting in my seat wanting more and more, even after the two and half hours were over. POTC deserves every kind of movie award there is and I hope it receives at least three. I am going tomorrow to see it again with a friend who has also already seen it. After that, I'll probably go a few more times because I can't wait long enough for it to be released on DVD!! Go see it before it's no longer in theaters!!!"

","Well, shall I say ostentatious and cynical, rather...<br/><br/>I find myself frustrated when I read bad reviews of good movies. I know that it is a critic's job to be critical, hence their title... and I know that a critic can still appreciate a movie and still use wit and intelligence to point out some of its flaws... and I also know that a critic should not conform to other's views but I've unfortunately glanced over a few biting reviews of this film. It's really disgusting. The only reason I see that one would denounce this film as one of the worst of all time is that they are trying to go against the grain to seem really smart or ironic. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is one of the greatest movies of all-time - finally an Indiana Jones/Star Wars type adventure for the modern generation. And even if an audience member (or critic...) didn't personally enjoy the film (which I find very hard to believe) - he or she can at least admire it for all the technical achievements and brilliant writing, editing, cinematography, direction, acting...! Any way, my point is, there is a line that a supposed critic can cross over, they can cross over into cynicism... in which a reader of his or her review should question whether this person knows anything about movies in the first place. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a masterpiece and I don't think the readers on IMDB need to be told that, they should just go see it! A crowd pleaser with depth and intelligence, finally! It is times like these when I thank God for Disney and Johnny Depp!"
"amie_madison","10","0","1","22 July 2003"," What more could anyone ask of a movie?
","Truly, what more COULD anyone ask? ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" has adventure, drama, comedy, swordplay, excellent writing, a moderately capable damsel in distress, and two very, very beautiful men (for those moviegoers who find such things appealing). I saw this movie on opening night and wasn't disappointed in the slightest, although I had exceedingly high expectations for it.<br/><br/>I've been a Disney fan since early childhood, and Pirates was always my favorite ride. I eagerly awaited the movie from the first moment I heard it was being made, even more so once I learned that both Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp were to star in it. They both pulled their weight admirably, particularly Depp, whose Keith Richards-inspired, not-quite-effeminate Captain Jack Sparrow is, in my opinion, one of the best characters ever put on screen.<br/><br/>In short, I wholeheartedly reccomend seeing ""Pirates,"" repeatedly, and I fully intend to buy the DVD the day it comes out. (And by the way...make sure you wait until the end of the credits to leave--there's an extra scene!)"
"shervinv","9","0","1","22 July 2003"," Great film!
","This movie begins with very clever and subtle humor that continues through the whole movie.  The visuals of this film were spectacular!  Excellent special effects and excellent scenes produced just the right atmosphere for every scene.  Johnny Depp was brilliant as usual, though I failed to understand what he was saying at times (along with some of the other characters).  No, it wasn't the smarmy sea slang, it was just bad sound (or mumbling).  The movie definitely dragged on towards the end, not ending several times when it could have.  But even though it was late, I found myself hoping that it wouldn't end!  It was just that kind of a show. <br/><br/>
My only complaint:  I went at 11 pm, on a Sunday night, and I was SURROUNDED by noisy children and infants!  Is there nothing sacred anymore????"

","Man, another Disney Tie-In... How remarkably lame. And this time, not only is it a tie-in, but its a tie in for a RIDE at a Theme Park! What an insult! Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's what I thought too... until I saw they bagged both Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush! Not to mention the Director of The Ring, Gore Verbinski! And it didn't hurt that this particular ride is possibly the coolest in Disney History. Just about every guy who has ridden this ride has thought, man, this would make one great movie, man! I'm one of them! And we were all right! This is probably the most fun movie of the whole summer (just about tied with LXG)!<br/><br/>Was a great action movie with intelligence, wit, and good actors too much to ask? Clearly not, as Disney (of all companies) has delivered just that! This is a swashbuckling, rip-roaring riotous assault in the senses with more fun and laughter than you're likely to find in just about any movie! Yeah, it's the sum of its parts, but its parts are very good. Johnny Depp doesn't find himself at the mast of a top-heavy film with only him to rely on! Instead, almost universally you find good actors here to grace the good script and the good directing. It's a good film... choke on it... I'll be at Disneyland... it worked, sue me!<br/><br/>The plot centers around a pair of unlikely lovers in the form of Orlando Bloom (Legolas from Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings adaptations) and the mind-shakingly hot Keira Knightley (if you think she looks like Natalie Portman, you're not alone... George Lucas thought so too)! The lovers meet as kids and watch each other from afar for most of their lives, propriety preventing a union, much like the secret love we all know that Tom Daschle and Dick Armey secretly harbor... but I digress! When Knightley's character Elizabeth Swann first meets Bloom's Will Turner she sees an Aztec designed medallion about his neck which reminds her of the pirate mythology she has come to know, so she steals it and spirits it away, never knowing it might have more significance than she thinks!<br/><br/>Though these two are two of the main movers of the plot, it is without question Johnny Depp's movie. Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow a homosexual pirate down on his luck and riding into the same town that Will and Elizabeth live in! Soon after his arrival a ship called The Black Pearl, a sort of legendary Flying Dutchman from Hell, arrives to rape, pillage and burn, not to mention find all the Aztec Gold the crew scattered around which led to their demonic curse causing them to literally exist as the walking dead, led by the maniac captain Barbossa!<br/><br/>What follows is an adventure leading to some amazing team-ups, surprisingly satisfying CGI, hilarious moments, and more underhanded scheming and backstabbing than a convention of Hollywood Producers! Aiding the fun is Depp's well-acted, yet incredibly funny in manner Sparrow, complete with compass that points only to his treasure stash and more secrets than a Linda Tripp phone call! The Animation, when needed is amazing, and pretty much flawless. When the Cursed Pearl Pirates are lit by moonlight they are shown for the undead ghouls they truly are, but only then! During an underground fencing match characters move in and out of lit breaks in the ceiling becoming skeletons, then men, then skeletons, then men! It's seamless to my eyes. The scenery, and the sets (real and animated) are just beautiful to behold, and set the scene perfectly!<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is a perfect pirate. Funny at the right times, scary at the right times... and Orlando Bloom has the makings of a great actor. Knightley is not only beautiful but plays her part very well. As do the supporting characters, such as Jack's Crew (featuring the almost equally yummers Zoe Saldana)! I've long been a fan of old Jonathan Pryce in his roles as a brave, yet conflicted character of complexity in Brazil, Tomorrow Never Dies... those... Lexus commercials! Here he plays an aging, sniveling man who is pretty funny in his attempts to raise his daughter and survive disembodied arms fighting with him in his cabins.<br/><br/>Depp steals every scene as Sparrow, and keeps the laughs coming with his daring schemes (that usually work), his insane mannerisms, and his occasional bumbling. Sparrow dresses like ""Love in an Elevator"" era Steven Tyler, and acts like a Male Ullman Character on Tracy Takes On! Verbinsky never lets you forget that Sparrow is above all other things, a pirate, and not exactly the golden hero one might expect from Errol Flynn or someone. It's not only refreshing to see a dignified gay hero in a major motion picture, but to see this hero not be a stock character in all other ways. It's common to se a cleverer than life Hollywood Hero who sets into motion events that ultimately pay off for him in the end. Sparrow isn't so much a hero as a haplessly goofy Keith Richards, thrust into a leadership role. While his plans commonly work out, he's commonly as surprised as the rest of us that they do, and he's just bumbling enough to not really know what the hell he's doing! He doesn't so much exude confidence as he does an forlorn acceptance of unfortunate events that he's pressed into. Rotten scalawag or not, Sparrow is impossible not to like from his Gold Capped Teeth to his obnoxious swagger, he's as much fun to watch as a J. Edgar Hoover Home Movie!<br/><br/>There are a few nods to the Disney ride, fans of which should giggle with the recognition of these. The film doesn't rely on these little things though, so you who have never been to Orlando or to Anaheim won't be negatively affected. The scenes are clever with or without precedent! There is one truly terrifying scene (at least to me) that takes place on a desert island (there is nothing funny about the mass torching of Spiced Island Rum)! There is also a bit of a curiosity to the method of breaking The Curse of the Black Pearl. Apparently this involves the shedding of the blood of a certain character deceased before the events of this film... but why this is doesn't seem to ever be explained... if I missed it please, tell me why!<br/><br/>There really isn't anything to complain about in this film! It's a heck of a lot of fun, and well worth the ticket price. Therefore, I'm giving it a rare Four and One Half Stars! I'm glad the Pirate Movie is back... I just wish Cutthroat Island hadn't gotten such a bum wrap! So... why not the full five stars for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl? Well... it's not quite Citizen Kane!"

The only thing this movie didn't have were tears (which I was glad to do without). What more could you ask for?<br/><br/>This was interesting and fun.

","To see the previews with Johnny Depp with Tammy Faye Bakker-like eye-liner caked on, I thought, ""Finally a movie that makes Cutthroat Island look reputable.""  But after viewing the film, I realized that only someone as quirkily eccentric as Depp could have pulled off this role.  Most of the fun stems from Jack Sparrow's charismatic bumblings.

","I'll admit that I am not hard to please when it comes to the action genre. When I go into a theatre to watch an action film, I'm not expecting any kind of magnificent acting jobs or solid plots. But I was pleasently suprised with POC.<br/><br/>For starters, this movie had tons of quality action in the form of sword play, gun fights, town raids, and naval engagements. Second, it was solidly funny, especially Depp. His character and acting job is so funny, you might mistake him as some veteran comedian if you had never seen any of his previous work. Third, the imagery is simply compelling - many film makers should strive to meet this level of quality. Fourth, if you are male, miss Knightley is extremely easy on the eyes. You looks like an ultra-hot version of Wynona Rider with long hair. And finally, the plot is actually way better then I expected. It keeps you so engrossed that the 2.5 hour run time passes in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>I would have to reccomend this film to everyone. I will no doubt buy the DVD the day it hits shelves."
"milesm7597","Null","0","1","21 July 2003"," What a mess!
","The film is a complete mess!<br/><br/>I believe much of the problem with the film lies with the screenwriters and director Gore Verbinski, who seem to be struggling to please Disney while insisting on violence and gore (pardon the pun).  The tone of the film vacillates between swashbuckling adventure and lurid ghost story, achieving neither suspense nor horror.  Instead, the film half heartedly plods along with some tedious dialogue and obvious lapses of narrative logic, occasionally eleviated only by amusing special effects.<br/><br/>One of the major problems with the film seems to be dialogue that sticks out like a sore thumb. In addition to the rather stilted language (especially in the earlier portions of the film), the film is also hampered with a script that begs for a few more rewrites.<br/><br/>(POSSIBLE SPOILER COMING UP - BUT IT IS NOT REALLY A SPOILER SINCE THE FILM SPOILS IT FOR ITSELF) There are many lapses of logic in the plotline that took me out of the film. Among them: The film is ambivalent in dealing with the pirates.  When it becomes clear that only a little blood (not a death sacrifice) would revive the cursed pirates, one wonders why the leads would not simply consider getting these pirates out of their hair by simply acquiescing and getting on with their petty lives.  Again, when it is revealed midway through the film that the pirates cannot be killed, the rather lengthy fight scenes that follow suddenly become labored and accessive, and the gore accompanied with that smacks of gratuitousness. It is as if the air that kept the film buoyant till then was suddenly sucked out, and the film, like many of the ships in the film, begins to sink.<br/><br/>
The characters in the film are also not the most interesting despite gallant attempts at making them so.  Jonathan Pryce is mired line after painful line, by hackneyed dialogue.  Kiera Knightley's Elizabeth is a pretty face but lacks the spunk, character and hootzpah that made Karen Allen's damsel in distress so appealing and unpredictable in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Orlando Bloom's William, while gallant, fails to transcend stereotype. Even Geoffrey Rush's pirate fails to surprise or intrigue.  Perhaps the only person that comes rather unscathed in this debacle is Johnny Depp, who has made a career of making interesting (if unsuccessful or unconvincing) choices.  Despite common belief, Depp's forte is not in being a talented or transformational actor.  Depp's performances do not hold the gravitas or subtlety like a Brando, a Pacino or a Deniro.  Rather, Depp's strength is in the courage and the curiosity of his choices which has earned him the respect as a risk-taker, rather than an excellent actor.  Having said that, Depp, whose accent is not all convincing, and whose casting in the part is not at all perfect, winds up inadvertently being the most interesting in an otherwise flaccid film.<br/><br/>Save your ten bucks for Indy 4."

There are some healthy doses of Errol Flynn-Basil Rathbone derring-do (Bloom and Depp buckling swash in the smithy shop) along with great comedic moments and memorable characters -- I need not mention that being Depp's manic and hilarious Jack Sparrow.  A manlier, gayer pirate has never lived.  He would have walked away with the movie completely if Orlando Bloom had not been well nigh perfect as the earnest love interest, looking pretty damn good in those nice-fitting duds and delivering his lines seriously to counterbalance Depp's utter insanity. Geoffrey Rush looked like he was having a fun time snarling ""arrr! me buckos!"" around the deck and the whole ride was worth my money.  The only negative is Keira Knightly's bizarre way of holding her lips.  Must be an affectation, because I have seen the same maneuver on Renee Zellweger and Michelle Pfeiffer (in years past).

This movie is SO WORTH your money and more importantly, your time. It's not your typical, ""arrgh.."" peg-legged, one eyed pirate movie, its an original movie that this summer has been dying to find. In a summer full of seemingly endless sequels, Pirates proved to be the diamond in the rough. Full of spectacular action sequences, a humble love story, and a very subtle (yet hilarious) humor, its got something for everyone. Johnny Depp gives the performance of his life in this movie and most definately proved that he is a genious in the acting world, and is one of the most brilliant underrated actors ever to be on the silver screen. Granted, I have appreciated Depp for his other acting roles in his career, but his work done here is incredible. His Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the most intriguing characters in movie history. With his humorous wit and indescribable charm, he is the pirate that guys want to be, and girls want to be WITH. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, as the young beautiful stars in this movie, give the movie its youthful spunk, adding to the fact that their acting job was terrific. Definately rising stars! Geoffery Rush was outstanding as Captain Barbossa, and the greatest villain that you loved to hate.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was just unforgetable. It is a good 2 hours and 30 minutes to spend with whoever you want, and is worth seeing more than once, even if you have to shovel out a couple of dollars in your wallet.

It's just so much fun to watch, it's appropriate it was based on a Disney ride, because that's exactly what it is, a 2 1/2 hour long movie ride that lets you escape from reality into a wonderful fantasyland.<br/><br/>They couldn't have picked a better cast for this picture.  Johnny, Keira, and Orlando were perfect in their roles. Keira reminds me of a cross between Brooke Shields and Jennifer Garner. She's pretty without being too perfect, but portrays the damsel in distress that can swing a plank of wood like McGwire if need be. Orlando is a great romantic anti-hero/love interest for Keira's character. And as a dirty, natty-braided, gold-toothed, and, you assume, smelly pirate, Johnny Depp was as sexy a swashbuckler as you'll ever see on film (and MINOR SPOILER...) he doesn't even do anything resembling a love scene!  Any female that doesn't want to jump his bones after seeing one of his side-ways glances needs to get her hormones checked!<br/><br/>Filmmakers who are wondering why their movies don't make money at the box office need to take a long hard look at this one and learn some lessons.<br/><br/>A)  If we want to see serious issues or be depressed, we can turn on CNN.<br/><br/>
B)  Movies don't have to be crammed full of blood, gore, profanity, or nudity to be a smash hit.  You'll make more money when parents can take kids to a show without being embarassed or horrified every 30 seconds.<br/><br/>C)  When we go to a movie, we know the people on the screen are acting, and the actors know we know they are acting, so let your actors have fun with this, and subtly wink at the audience every now and then.  It doesn't hurt and we viewers love it!<br/><br/>D) Don't underestimate the intelligence of the movie-going public, even the kids.  Movies can be hysterically funny with well-written, well-timed lines without resorting to stupid slapstick, pie-in-the face, or toilet-themed humor.<br/><br/>My kudos to the creators of POTC.  They did everything right, and I predict they'll sell a fortune of DVD's when this comes out at the stores.  I know I'll be buying it the first day.  This is a movie I'll want to watch many times over."

","This was the 'surprise' movie at the close of the Cambridge Film Festival - and lived up to its billing. At no time during this lengthy movie did my attention waver . This was an occasion where the driving sondtrack did aid the pace of the film, and did not obliterate the action, but complemented it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp excelled himself, archly camp for much of the movie. The fight scenes   were all excellent, though my personal preference was the first one between Johnny Depp's Captain Sparrow and  Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. Lots of small humourous notes - the false eye being struck by a fork being a personal favourite! I'm left wishing I could look as great as Johnny Depp does in his make-up - that stays immaculate throughout, and the energy he invests in the part makes him clearly the pivotal role in the movie, wise-cracking all the way. I'd never normally go to watch a film with this kind of story line - now, I can't wait for it to open in the UK on August 8th - go see!"

"iLUVangelinajolie","10","0","1","19 July 2003"," Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
","When I was growing up as a young lass there was nothing I wanted to be more than a pirate.  I've been to Disneyland and ridden Pirates of the Caribbean more times than I can count.  I must also admit that even as an adult I've always come home with a few plastic swords and sacks of pirate treasure. There is something about the thought of being a pirate that totally frees someone.  Of course we all picture honorable scoundrels much like Indiana Jones or Han Solo to name some modern ones (First two characters I thought of, Harrison Ford however is not in the film).  But the rogues we have here are just as lovable, each in there own way.<br/><br/>From beginning to end this film is a winner, everything on the scene is gorgeous and full of rich color, filming in the Caribbean really made the movie stand out. Personally I'm chomping at the bit to get the soundtrack. About 5 minutes into the film I said to my friend sitting next to me ""Isn't this great music?"".  It's touching during the few quiet scenes and suitably bombastic when it comes to fighting always helping the story move along and reach the right emotional tone.<br/><br/>Depp as so many other have already noted is simply remarkable in his role and it the Academy had any sense whatsoever he'd at least be considered for an Oscar (not nessacarily win) but that won't happen God forbid an action/comedey that is successful and appeals to everyone win something, can't appear mainstream.  Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush fill there roles quite nicely, Bloom and all the other are ok but certainly not outstanding.<br/><br/>The plot...does really it matter?  Honestly it doesn't but that fact that is above par for a summer movie only make this movie more worthy.  And while it does get a bit long at 140 minutes or it barely noticeable.  Maybe about 10-15 mintutes could have been trimmed without losing anything. All in all a 9/10, add another point for all the lovingly placed references to the ride i.e. , ""That dog is never going to move"" and you get my score a perfect 10/10"
"Lily-32","10","0","1","18 July 2003"," A great movie that some critics just don't get
","It seems to me that the only people who didn't like this movie were the movie critics and their wanna-be's. And it's been my experience that if the critics don't like it, the audience does. Vice versa. It's one of those facts of life, I guess.<br/><br/>Now, one could say it's because 'the audience just doesn't understand' as if we're just lambs to the slaughter, mindless drones who gobble up anything the masses tell us is fun and cool.<br/><br/>Normally I'd agree, but I think this is one instance where the audience knows something the critics don't, not the other way around. Oh how I long for the days when a movie was watched for enjoyment and not the lighting concept alone.<br/><br/>Oh wait, we're there. *in a stage whisper* Someone forgot to memo the critics and the wanna-be's.<br/><br/>And for those who said they got lost in the plot twists, I just have to say: you can't multitask either, can you. That's not a question. A statement of fact.<br/><br/>In short (or long as the case may be. I do tend to ramble.) I loved this movie. I found it entertaining in everyway possible; the F/X, the romance (a personal fave of mine), the comedy, the action. And that last one is saying something since usually I find the fight sequences in movies rather drawn out.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie four times. That's right four. I enjoyed every minute of it. Not once did I feel the need to glance at the watch I don't wear. And I plan to see it many more.<br/><br/>Sure you can say I have no life. That's your opinion and you're entitled to it. But seeing as it's my life, I think I'll spend it in a way that's most enjoyable to me. And since I found POTC very enjoyable, that's one of the things I'll do.<br/><br/>I guess all I have to say is that those who didn't like it lost their imagination a long time ago. That's not something you should be checking at the door when you enter a theater, just so's you know.<br/><br/>On a final note (yes, I promise I'm almost done), for those nonbelievers, take a look at the box office results. If the movie were that bad the word would spread like it did with Matrix Reloaded. You wanna talk bomb.<br/><br/>JMHO.<br/><br/>AL"
"Baseball8468","10","0","1","19 July 2003"," The first true contender for an Academy Award
","Since its release on July 9th, I've seen this movie 3 times, and enjoyed it more with each viewing. With a wonderful cast that included the humorous Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and the evil cursed pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), this film should contend for an Academy Award in 2004. This movie encompasses the entire realm of why pirates were viewed as dishonest buccaneer looters who only cared about themselves and gold treasures. Former captain of the Black Pearl, Jack Sparrow wonders through the Caribbean looking to regain his ship from the mutinous Captain Barbossa. After saving the life of the beautiful governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), Sparrow runs away from the British Naval Fleet and meets the son of a famous pirate, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). After Elizabeth is kidnapped and taken to the Black Pearl, Sparrow and Turner join forces to rescue Ms. Swann, who Barbossa believes is the one who could shed her blood to end the curse. Sparrow manages to get aboard the Pearl, but is unsuccessful in getting back Elizabeth and instead is marooned on an island with only a pistol. Once Barbossa learns that Will Turner is the only blood relative of the late William ""Bootstrap"" Turner, he tries to kill him only to be rescued once again by Jack Sparrow. Once Turner spills his blood on Aztec gold, Barbossa is shot, and the pirates are defeated, Sparrow is sentenced to death by hanging by the leader of the Royal Fleet, Commodore Norrington. Sparrow's life is saved by Turner and he escaped to regain control of the Black Pearl, while Will and Elizabeth proposed their love to one another. An incredible, edge-of-your-seat action comedy that will make you want to see it over and over again. Truly the best movie of the year and worthy of some hardware. I recommend it even for those who don't fancy adventurous films."
"mosquito12","10","0","1","18 July 2003"," Action packed, well worth seeing
","I have to admit this movie was better than I thought it might be. Johnny Depp is of course a great actor, and in this movie he displays once again his extraordinary ability to develop a unique and memorable on-screen persona in any movie in which he appears.  This ability is made even more incredible by the staggering contrast between his real-life self and the characters he plays.  Orlando Bloom has fewer lines than you might expect, but he does a good job with what's given to him.  Overall this movie is not heavy on plot or on character development, but as an action movie about pirates it is as good or better than one can reasonably expect it to be.  It may not be one of the best films ever made, but it is certainly good entertainment for your ticket money."

It had a interesting plot and wasn't your normal Pirate movie.  Normally the romance is between the Pirate and the leading lady, but Orlando wasn't a Pirate...at least not in the way He thinks.<br/><br/>It has a interesting back story as well and was incredably funny.  I went to see it twice and laughed more at the second time simply because some of the things I realised were funny because of later events.<br/><br/>I recommand this to anyone one who loves pirate movies and doesn't mind laughs and good fun.

","When I saw the 2nd trailer for this film, I thought to myself that it was ""The Mummy"" done at sea with pirates instead of in Egypt with mummies. But that's not a bad thing necessarily; this film is fun in an over the top, tongue in cheek kind of way. More a parody of pirate films than a real pirate film itself.<br/><br/>Many people say that Johnny Depp makes this film as Captain Jack Sparrow, and while he certainly is fun to watch, every goofball needs a straight man to play off of, and Orlando ""Legalos"" Bloom does that about as well as anyone else out there would have. Oh and Keira Knightley is hot.<br/><br/>The plot concerns Miss Keira being kidnapped by pirates (the ringleader played by Geoffrey Rush) who think that her blood will break a nasty curse hanging over them, all they need is to cut her hand open on the gold medallion in her possession by way of Orlando. The only problem is that it's actually Orlando Bloom's blood they need, not Keira's. But no one is aware of this right away so Orlando busts Johnny Depp out of jail and he agrees to help Orlando rescue the woman he loves.<br/><br/>Chaos and mayhem ensues. It's fun!"

","just got out of this movie like 20 minutes ago and i loved it, well not so much it but him. Johnny depps role which all are raving about IS worth the hype.  Ive never seen a more likable character in a summer movie he brought a screen presence like nothing i have seen before, and while he was amazing the movie itself was far from it, the cgi was top notch but it is a movie about pirates so it wears on u a bit, but everytime i looked at my watch i would miss some little gesture depp made that was hysterical, so i just stopped looking at my watch, and i think geoffery rush's character is being overlooked by a lot of people he was excellent as the other captain with some great one liners.  only real issue with this movie was legolas (orlando bloom) he was nothing special by any means and made me somewhat angery because his character clashed so much with all the others, they all looked like they were having fun but he was a little too serious. but all in all a great movie, and im impressed with disney this summer they put out 2 of the best flicks this summer, even though they didnt quite touch 28 days later, or matrix reloaded. well done disney, and i think Depp deserves an award for keeping a 2:30 long movie alive by himself, not many actors can do that."
"supertom-3","9","0","1","18 July 2003"," One of the years best, pure fun start to finish, Depp is on Fire!!
","Harking back to the days when Pirate films and fantasy films were being released with decidedly more regularity this film really brings the young imp inside us all out, the sort of young imp that takes delight in watching classic fantasy swashbucklers from the 80's such as the Princess Bride. I am a big fantasy film fan, I love to plonk on oldies like Krull, Labyrinth and this is the sort of film that really brings that desire back again, not quite to the same level that Lord of the Rings did but still this is a fantastic adventure movie.<br/><br/>What you have here is your basic pirate/fantasy adventure storyline, there is treasure involved, ghosts and of course damsels to be rescued not a Princess but a governors daughter in this case. Considering that the last big studio pirate film was the pap Cutthroat Island and that this film is based off of a theme park ride the signs did look ominous that this would be pants, but the cast involved plus good scriptwriters and a very excitable trailer put pay to that and as such this has struck gold at the box office and is a critical and public success.<br/><br/>The film has great set design, it looks great and there is real scale to it. The action is exciting, the score is chest thumpingly good and the film creates a sense of magic, this is movie making magic, it's a feel good summer movie and has likeable characters and a witty script, hence this seems to have got the best audience reaction I've heard in ages. This movie is about having a great time, it's not particularly meaningful but it is great all round family fun that doesn't suffer from dull patches or failed expectations.<br/><br/>The cast are all good. Orlando Bloom is given a lead role for the first time and he handles himself well, Keira Knightly is feisty and sexy as the damsel in distress, who of course is whooping ass with the best of them by the end. Then there are Brit actors such as Jonathan Pryce, Jack Davenport and Kevin Mcnally who are all good. Geoffory Rush takes delight in chewing the scenery as the bad guy, but in typically show stopping form is Johnny Depp as Cap'n Jack Sparrow who plays him out like Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones (I s*** you not). Depp is superb, he makes the movie, the movie on its own right is pure fun and a good time but Depp really does add another level to it with his charm and his humour. He has boundless energy throughout the film and his cockney accent is faultless, Depp proves once again what a versatile actor he really. Until watching this filming I had not enjoyed a film so much this year aside from Nemo and X2. It was a rollicking good time with great effects, and also very funny. This is good news for the fantasy film genre, with it coming alive recently with hits like Lord of the Rings and Harry Porter perhaps we'll see some more, while perhaps not with the regularity of certain periods like the 50's or 80's. One of the years best most definitely.****"
"Squirelly_Jo","10","0","1","18 July 2003"," Finally, a Pirate Movie That Works.
","You would think that Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer would discard the notion of making a pirate movie after Cutthroat Island and Pirates 'success' (the first of which shut down a film company). Yet, undaunted, they set out to make Pirates of the Carribean. They made more than a movie, they made a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Plot: Very creative. Something that many movies now are lacking save for a few.<br/><br/>The Music: Incredible. Many movies have a bland score that leaves a bad impression on the movie. The score ranks up with that of the Lord of the Rings movies.<br/><br/>The Cast: As if newcomer-turned-famous Orlando Bloom wasn't enough, they also tossed Geoffery Rush, Keira Knightly and Johnny Depp in the mix, the latter of which would be a shame if the Academy Awards didn't nominate. The supporting cast is well done as well.<br/><br/>The Acting: It wasn't surprising to see that Orlando Bloom did a great job, seeing as how his acting in Lord of the Rings really stood out. Keira Knightly put a good twist on the 'Damsel in Distress' stereotype by actually doing something instead of just moping about and screaming like most Damsels in Distress. However, Geoffery Rush and Johnny Depp really stole the show as Captain Barbossa and Captain Jack Sparrow, 2 sides of the same coin so to speak.<br/><br/>The SFX: Also would be a shame if the Academy Awards didn't nominate. The transformation of the pirates is shown seemlessly and effortlessly. I was worried that the SFX Team would 'forget' to transform a pirate into a skeleton every now and then, but luckily they pulled through. The other effects are spectacular too, such as the boats, scenery and what not. Even some parts have better SFX than The Matrix Reloaded<br/><br/>The Twist: It's a Disney movie. It's PG-13. Now if that doesn't surprise you, this will. Blood, swears, explosions, people getting stabbed, people getting blown up, people losing their eyes (sort of, if you've seen the movie you know what I mean), use of alcohol, people getting their throats cut open, some real creepy parts (the skeletal monkey was one of them) and to top it all off, prostitutes... Disney should make more movies like this.<br/><br/>So far, 2003 has been a fairly good year for movies (aside from Dumb and Dumberer, Legally Blonde 2, ect.) but this movie has shone out from the rest. However, the year is nearly drawing to an end, but there are still 2 more great movies coming out: The Matrix Revolutions and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. All in all Pirates of the Carribean will stand the test of time, much like Lord of the Rings and The Matrix will, and hopefully its impending sequels will too. I really hope the sequels don't put the Pirates underwater, like 99% of Disney sequels do."

","I went to go see this movie the third day after it was released. I went in thinking I'd enjoy myself and I sure did. I was in awe of how Johnny Depp became the pale man he was in Sleepy Hollow, to the rough and dazed pirate he was in this movie. I was not overall impressed with Orlando Bloom's role in this movie, but when his character was needed for certain scenes, he was there. I liked the 'heroine' of the movie, though, in some scenes, I found her a little too, bland. The storyline was pretty good, though, not the kind of thing you would see in a disney ride, more like for ""Jason and the Arganauts"". I really hoped that it wouldn't be all scifi, and stick more to the lines of an pirate movie where they smuggle and steal, and rape and kindle. The swordfight was rather good, though I had to tell myself 'Your not watching Errol Flynn'.<br/><br/>But all in all, I enjoyed myself when seeing this, and I will be buying the movie when it's released."

","I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would.  Sure, the casting is great, but does every ride at Disneyland need to be a movie now?<br/><br/>
But back on track, 'Pirates' is good fun.  Very tongue-in-cheek.  Johnny Depp's Cap'n Jack Sparrow is hilarious.  Just about everything Geoffrey Rush does is worth watching.  Once I got past Keira Knightley's amazing resemblance to Natalie Portman-it took me about half of `Bend It Like Beckham' to figure she was too tall to be Natalie, so who was she?-it wasn't hard to see there is much more to her than just a lookalike. Orlando Bloom is...well... Orlando Bloom (I'm smiling while I type this).  Though he really doesn't have much to do except look smoldery and act rashly, which applies to Depp and Knightley, too, depending on the moment.<br/><br/>It's a little hard to figure who the protagonist is, but I didn't mind too much.  There are several bouts of swordplay that look great but lean toward the pointless side (please ignore the pun).  A lot more is going on than is necessary: a lot of quirky little subplots that the house enjoyed but that don't really go anywhere.  Over all the film is really quite long, and begins to feel like it; trimming would have helped, not hindered.  The special effects were great, and Verbinski didn't dwell on them as other directors would have (thank goodness).  All of that aside, though, I had a good time.  I have always been impressed with Johnny Depp and thought him capable of much more versatility than he receives credit for; I think this piece demonstrates that versatility, as did the pleasant surprise that was `From Hell'.  And he is hot, even with nasty teeth and eye-shadow.  Huzzah that someone finally made a stomach-able pirate flick!  I'll give it a B+."
"mathay","10","0","1","18 July 2003"," Probably Johnny Depp's funniest performance yet
","I was a little skeptical in the weeks leading up to the release of POTC. From what I could gleam from the previews I felt it had the potential to either be terrific or horrific.<br/><br/>However, after reading a few great reviews on the day of the film's release I let my hopes get up and for once was justified in doing so.  While the basic love story between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley left a little to be desired and sort of left parts of the ending a wee bit flat, the movie makers wisely did not let that side of the story play too key a role in this film's overall presentation.  I should clarify that the actors' performances were good and did not carry the blame for the lack of spark and flame in this romance.  It seemed more like the writers wanted just enough romance to move the story along where needed, but not so much as to interfere with other more interesting aspects of the film.<br/><br/>One thing became quite clear about 5 minutes into the show; this is Johnny Depp's show all the way! However, it does help to have a great surrounding cast to bring the thing off nicely.  Geoffrey Rush was fabulous as Captain Barbosa and several of the minor roles were played with unusual comedic brilliance as well.  While not a perfect, nor moving film, POTC has to be one of the most entertaining and fun films I've seen in a long time. Parts left me fighting the temptation to start clapping and cheering.  Besides, after a long week at the office it's just what I was looking for."

Did we learn nothing at all from The Country Bears movie?  But the more trailers I saw, the more snipets of Depp's performance ... I began to look forward to the film's opening.  By the time it arrived at theaters, I could not wait to see it.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed, not in the least.  This move is entertaining and funny, start to finish. Jack Sparrow's entrance is a classic and Depp never lets up from there.  He is amazing, bringing something so unique to this role that it is literally unforgetable.<br/><br/>Some have remarked that the horror aspect may be a little strong for the younger kids, but don't let that put you off.  If your children could handle either of the Harry Potter movies, the scare content of this film is no worse than giant snakes or disembodied evil sorcerers.<br/><br/>By last count, there are over 400 reviews of this movie after it had been out for only a week ... that says quite a bit about it already.  There is really no point in rehashing all the comments already being made.  I would only reiterate this singular point: Don't miss this movie!"

","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003) Rating out of four: **** Starring: Johnny Depp, Geoffery Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly Directed by Gore Verbinski<br/><br/>
Where to start?<br/><br/>This movie is exactly what people need this summer.  It has it all, comedy, adventure, action, and a slight bit of horror.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely amazing!  Everyone played their part spot-on. This is definately Johnny Depp's finest performance.  The way he slurs his lines when he talks, his face and hand gestures, and the way he walks around like he's drunk all the time hit a good spot with the audience.  Depp stole the show.  Geoffery Rush was fantastic as Captain Barbossa, him and his crewmates adding creepyness to the movie.  Keira Knightly anf Orlando Bloom did a fine performance.  I was especially pleased with Knightly's.  As an 18-year-old actress, she acts like she's been doing it for years and years, worthy of a best supporting actress award.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie.  CGI wasn't absolutely stunning but it did it's part.  Showing us what the curse of the aztec gold had on the pirates. I enjoyed the scenes of the beautiful landscape and waters of the Caribbean, especially that one little island that Jac..(sorry) Captain Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann were marooned on.<br/><br/>Drink up me 'arties yo ho!"

"filmbuff-36","9","0","1","20 July 2003"," Well, blow me down! This movie ain't half bad!
","I entered `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' with mediocre anticipation.  Pirate movies are said that have a curse of their own, with a handful of such films failing miserably at the box office throughout the √Ç‚Äò90s.  With such low expectations, imagine my surprise when the movie turned out to be far from a turkey.<br/><br/>Now that's not to say that this is a great film.  Heaven knows that for the past decade most Hollywood summer releases are essentially $100 million B-movies, and this is no exception.  The story is shoddy, the quips are many, and the special effects have a sort of `look at how fake I am!' feeling to them.<br/><br/>But it is a rousing adventure, and for the most part, the cast eats up the proceedings with vigor.  Our film begins with young Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) spotting a boy floating on a makeshift raft near the decimated remains of a ship.  The boy is pulled aboard Elizabeth's ship, which is currently transporting her father Governor Swann to a settlement in the New World.  She takes a pendant off the boy while he is unconscious, which has a suspicious looking gold coin attached to it.<br/><br/>Flash forward eight years to our story proper, where Elizabeth is now blossoming into womanhood.  Despite the well-meaning interference of her father to arrange her marriage, Elizabeth's heart still lies with the boy, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who is now a blacksmith with a deep resentment of pirates which stems from his mysterious past.  Before the conflicting love triangle can come to a head, however, the fort comes under attack by the pirate crew of the Black Pearl, a supposed ghost ship that haunts the Spanish Main, and Elizabeth is taken hostage along with the pendant.<br/><br/>Upset about the unwillingness of the British Navy to go after her, Will decides to enlist the aid of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a pirate being held in the fort awaiting a hanging.  Sparrow is naturally more then eager to escape the gallows, and becomes especially intrigued when he discovers Will's name.  The two unlikely companions gather a scurvy crew and then set sail after the Black Pearl, Turner on a rescue mission and Sparrow seeking to settle a vendetta.<br/><br/>The standard pirate movie cliches of forcibly boarding ships under naval engagements, talking parrots, sword fights and buried treasure abound, but the film has such a refreshingly energetic pace that every plot point seems fresh.<br/><br/>Depp is the most pleasant surprise in this film, as a dishonored pirate who laughs at danger while reminding everyone that they're in the presence of greatness.  He manages to make Sparrow a unique character, with a laid back demeanor even during crisis and a strange loose limbed drunken-like gait that resembled the way he stumbled about in `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.'  He takes a shine to young Will, playfully dropping hints about the boy's father's past.  Depp took what should have been a textbook role and brought life to what could have been a lackluster adventure tale.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush also excels as the Black Pearl's Captain Barbossa, the leader of a supernatural crew of cutthroats searching the seas for the artifacts that will restore their mortality.  Rush is energetic but not hammy, and steals his scenes by underplaying his role instead of trying to fill the screen.  Along with Depp, he is the brightest star here.<br/><br/>Bloom and Knightley are serviceable but not outstanding, certainly up to the task of the stunt work but not the human side of the story.  They're in love because the script says so, and there's little chemistry between the two.<br/><br/>Apart from the Disney World ride the movie takes its title from, it probably owes equal parts of inspiration from `The Mummy,' `The Evil Dead 2,' and, because of all the skeletons, `Jason and the Argonauts.'  The movie offers a few unexpected surprises and charms, and stands out like a diamond in the rough against most summer dreck.  Plus you have to have to admire any film in the 21st century that delivers lines like `avast me hearties' and `shiver me timbers' with a straight face."

","I had been a fan of the Disney ride ever since I was a kid, and it remains a favorite into adulthood. We were in DisneyWorld in the fall of 2002 when we heard that they were making a movie of the ride and my first impression was not good. However I'm glad to say that I was wrong! The movie had the same fun-spirited adventure as the ride and it's surely to delight kids of all ages, whether or not you've been on the ride. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp was truly wonderful as Jack Sparrow, as were Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa and the lovely Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. The flim had humour, lots of adventures and battle scenes, and the special effects were great. This is truly a film for all ages, though the little ones might be scared by some of the scenes.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","This movie is seriously a great show. It has everything in it that anyone could ask for out of entertainment and nothing you wouldn't want. Plus for disneyland buffs like myself the ""inside"" tributes to the ride has in it are amazingly hilarious. Johnny depp is absolutely the BEST person they couldn't have gotten. HE IS CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW!!! The on screen chemistry between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley is stunning. I have seen this movie four times already in less than two weeks of its run and I know I will see it many times more. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET...GO SEE IT RIGHT NOW!!!"
"ndrwdyng71","6","0","1","20 July 2003"," A movie for the young and the young at heart
","At a lengthy 2 plus hours with intense fight scenes aplenty, this movie doesn't exactly seem like kid stuff.  Don't be fooled.  Like the Disney Land ride that inspired it, this is a movie that can be enjoyed only by the young and the young at heart.  Aged cynics should see something else.  This is a movie for all the men and boys who have ever dreamed of making women swoon by skillfully wielding a sword, all the women and girls who have ever dreamed of being saved by a dashing young man.<br/><br/>Leave logic at the door, because like all those childish fantasies, this movie exists for the thrill of the moment, the clash of swords, cheeky one liners, and a bombastic score.  The whole thing would be completely ludicrous if not for the performances of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, who give a little class to the whole affair.  They handle the material by going completely over the top, and winking conspiratorially at the audience as they do it.  In his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, Depp combines equal parts drag queen and fiersome pirate to arrive at a character that captured my attention every moment he was on the screen.  Geoffrey Rush isn't as good, but is good enough as the evil Captain Barbossa.  Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly get to play it straight, while simultaneously giving audience members something pretty to look at.<br/><br/>The plot is too complicated to adequately summarize in a short space, and why bother?  The plot is inconsequential anyway, serving merely as a means for these actors to fight with their swords, swing around on ropes, and go broke for laughs.  If you wanna enjoy this one, you might as well just let go and get in touch with your inner child.  You'll be glad you did."
"captain_robert_april","10","0","1","20 July 2003"," The pirate film has returned
","The pirate film has returned, and Errol Flynn would be proud. Pirates of the Caribbean is simply a fun film to watch. Johnny Depp is particularly over the top which makes Captainb Jack Sparrow stand out that much more as a legend in his own time (and mind). Geoffrey Rush is his usual great self, and plays dignified evil to the bone.    Outside the acting, Verbinski continues to use imagery which is simply fun to look at. Much like in ""The Ring"" he has some visuals which really pulls you into the movie. The script never lingers too long without coming back to life and it seems like the cast generally enjoyed the experience which comes across in their dialogue and word play. In the end, this film may be 2.5 hours, but it feels like so much less, and it accomplishes something most films don't. You leave saying, ""I would watch a sequel to that."""
"wingchild","9","0","1","17 July 2003"," Well worth the $7
","As disheartened as I was to hear that a feature film had been made based off a Disney ride, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow really carries the entire film and is completely worth watching.<br/><br/>This film also marks the only time I have ever seen CNN's movie critic and the critics at The Onion's AV Club both say that a film was worth seeing; that alone should drive you to the box office. ;)"

And, although Jack Sparrow may seem dishonest, it's the honest one's you should look out for, honestly.<br/><br/>The first trailer I had seen for Pirates of the Caribbean was pretty mediocre, and only showed the actors who'd be starring.  As soon as ""Johnny Depp"" graced the screen, I thought that there was some home for this poor looking movie.  Then I went to see it myself, and was totally blown out of the water.  I've seen it three times myself now, and I feel every time is worth it.  It's fun hilarity that the entire family can enjoy, and it'll spurn parents on to read pirate stories after bed time."

It was a real pleasure to see an all-around good movie, with plenty of action, more comedy than I expected, and some drama and romance, all while telling a pretty good story.<br/><br/>There were several scenes in the movie which were taken directly from the Disneyland ride, and they were done very well.  They fit right in to the movie, and would not even be noticed by someone who hasn't been on the ride. However, those of us who have, the scenes were very entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall, this was just a lot of fun."
"AndytheDirector","Null","0","1","19 July 2003"," It's inconsistent, predictable, the characters have no development, and it's the most fun I've had since Raiders of the Lost Ark
","This is perhaps one of the most uproarious movies of the summer.  It's what it is: a swashbuckling adventure movie with beautiful damsels and heroic sailors.  Don't go into it and want to tear it apart with errors is facts, continuity, etc.  Go into it and expect a good old movie time.  Orlando Bloom is great as a hero, recalling Errol Flynn's Robin Hood.  Geoffrey Rush is a creepy villian, but he also has a motivation that is understandable and makes you sympathetic to him and his crew of pirates.  And now to Johnny Depp: he steals the show.  I almost wanted to see a movie just about him. His lines made me laugh out loud, and his stature, a gawking demeanor he carries that similar to a drunk, but he's sober, is a riot.  There is just to much to say about his character.  I think Hulk deserves Best Editting at Oscars, and Depp should win Best Supporting Actor.  Yo-ho-ho-ho, a pirates life for me!"
"Aaron1375","9","0","3","19 July 2003"," Other than a few unresolved plot points and a long running time this one is pure fun.
","Seeing the previews of this one I thought it would be a nice fun adventure and as it turns out it was.  The person though that stands out the most in this one though is Johnny Depp, he was great has Captain Jack Sparrow. There wasn't to many moments in this one when he was on screen that didn't make me at least chuckle.  He really made the film for me, though the rest of the cast was good to with Geoffrey Rush as the bad guy and Orlando Bloom doing excellent jobs as well. The female lead was great too.  This one though was just a purely fun movie to watch.  The scenery was great too on the open seas.  The only thing I had problems with are some plot points and the movie did run a bit long.  I still am not quite sure why they needed the one guys blood and there was something else that didn't quite fit together as well, like what was up with the compass, but these are minor problems I had with it and in no way do they diminish the enjoyment I had watching this one.  Great swordfights in this one as well, as I love a good sword fight in a movie.  This one is also good for the whole family, and I am still wondering why it was rated PG and not PG-13 as I think the ratings board these days is a bit crazy.  If the last two Star Wars movies were PG then this one should have been as well.  All in all a great time to be had by everyone."

We need more pirate films for sure. A must see on the big screen.  The effects of the cursed pirates was very well done - kudos to the CGI folks.  The mix of a small bit of scary (enough for the adults and good for the older children) and sufficient humor to go with the beautiful scenery and smashing action made for a superb viewing experience."

I personally think it was very well written, and the fight scenes were very well choreographed.<br/><br/>The actors were very well chosen and played their role very well. I can remember the audience laughing at most of Johnny Depp's witty comments and jokes. Geoffrey Rush was an outstanding pirate captain, almost made for the role. Orlando Bloom played the charming blacksmith, in love with Keira Knightley, the governor's lovely daughter.<br/><br/>The whole plot was interesting and you could tell the writes knew what they were doing. The crew of the Black Pearl was under a curse because they stole coins of Aztec gold. Until all the pieces were reunited, the curse could not be broken.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Pirates of the Caribbean was not just a mediocre pirate's movie. It is worth seeing, and most would agree you are not wasting your money on watching it. I would give it a 10/10. I strongly suggest you watch it, while it is still out."

","For all those out there who are knocking this movie, you are being much too harsh! You can't expect a life-changing experience from a Disney movie based on pirates and plunder, but you can expect a lot of fun.I would have never guessed the idea came from a ride in a theme park...<br/><br/>With a cast of Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Kiera Knightly, the constant witty humor and good vs. bad battle makes it so much fun to cheer for the good guys (Knightly and Bloom) and also the not so good guy (Depp). Depp was outrageously funny in this movie with his quirky humor and gestures, all three leads did an incredible acting job. Whenever Bloom had a funny line he delivered it perfectly, which just goes to show how versatile an actor he can be. I was impressed at the writing and plot which was easy to follow, and had fun twists along the way.<br/><br/>This is really a movie that can appeal to everyone."

","This movie is extremely interesting, a blast of fun, and won't put you to sleep, some pirate movies are so boring because all they do is show how the pirates live. This one they accomplish that objective, and accomplish a very interesting obstacle, with a thrilling ride to keep you awake. The acting in here is another great part of the movie, Johnny Depp does a great job because every other second his eyes get bigger, then smaller and etc. Johnny Depp also walks weird the whole movie. Orlando Bloom does a tremendous job of a man who loves a woman, you can see that when he looks at her he doesn't care about anything else. The woman (i forgot her name) does a great job, she to showes that she doesn't care about anything else while she looks at him. They both really show there amount of chemistry in this movie. Captain Barbosa had a real job of it, being tremendous as a bad guy, having the accent that most pirates have, basically he plays the role of a bad guy pirate extremely good. Another great part of the movie is the script, while coming with an action sequence, the movie has bit parts of comedy, showing how much pirates like rum, how much pirates do wrong to woman, and sometimes how stupid pirates are. A great script also because of the use of language. The directing job by Gore Verbinski (also did a great job on The Ring) was tremendous again, also a big help to the actors by telling Johnny Depp to move his body a certain way. Telling each actor the way to act. Overall this movie turned out a masterpiece, thrilling, comic, interesting, dramatic, and romantic. Ten out of ten I gave it, I would suggest you see this one to if your up for a blast of fun, and a thrill."

There was only two things that I didn't like about this movie.

Geoffrey Rush is his equal as Sparrow's enemy Barbossa.  Brilliant casting with the up and coming stars Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly (""Bend it like Beckham"") give this film very wide appeal to the mass audience - not an easy task for a swashbuckling pirate movie - ask Geena Davis and Renny Harlin.

This is a great movie, one of the best films I've seen not just this summer, but period. Where to begin? Gore Verbinski has given us an action packed swashbuckler with lavash scenery, fine performances, and wall to wall action in the mold of films of yesteryear. The peformances by Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were fantastic. The special effects were also very well done. when the pirates of the Black Pearl would step into direct moonlight...well you can see for yourself, pretty impressive.

"mhoney-1","Null","0","1","18 July 2003"," Fun--but nothing special
","If it weren't for Johnny Depps amusing antics and some other little character bits of humor, this movie wouldn't be worth the price of admission. As it is, it still barely is. The story kind of meanders a bit and at times it becomes confusing whether the story is about pirates and their attempt to raise a curse that has left them as undead, impossible to kill and impossible to feel. Or if the moie is about romance and the British Navy's attempt to rid the seas of pirates.<br/><br/>The former is most certainly the true plot, but bddie Geoffrey Rush, who seems to have been born to one day play the standard bloodthirsty pirate, consumes maybe not even half the screentime, and as a whole, seems relatively unimportant in a story more concerned with a young blacksmith's realization that he is the son of a pirate, that he loves the Governor's daughter, that he holds the key to ending the curse of the Black Pearl, and that he must deal with the bumbling Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp).<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom has some good bits playing the young blacksmith, and he shows he has some great mileage beyond Middle-earth, if only he can get out of sword-fighting (he costars with Brad Pitt in the upcoming ""Troy.""). The movie is long and action-packed, full of comedy and some frightening images. And succeeds on a level thanks almost entirely to Depp's off-the-wall performance."

"JanetSnakehole3","10","0","1","17 July 2003"," One of the BEST summer blockbusters!!!!
","I really enjoyed this movie. Its highly entertaining, and performance by Johnny Depp was amazing. I just love him. I only have one small complaint: romance between Orlando Bloom's character and Keira Knightley character, was not believable at all. They had no chemistry, no sparks, nothing, at one point i asked myself ""why is he risking his life for her?"". Well, i guess u cant have it all. But it doesnt matter, this movie is highly entertaining, with good actors (johnny depp), good action and good story. See it!!<br/><br/>

","I just got back from seeing the Pirates of the Caribbean and all I can really say was it was one of the most fun and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. To me, it was more than just another ""Johnny Depp movie"" it was a look back at my childhood. I can remember being 5 years old on the Disney ride having the time of my life. In all honestly, there were several parts in the movie that almost looked like the robots from the original ride (such as the part when the 5 pirates are in the jail cell holding the bone so the dog with the keys in it's mouth would come near it) It was just great. The action was intense, the music was good, the sets and special effects were awesome, the acting was terrific, and the story line was nothing less then pure fun. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow was nothing short of amazing. You can tell he was having fun with it and really got into the character. I have never really been a big fan of Geoffrey Rush but he definitely pulled off playing Capt. Barbossa without a doubt. The only minor thing this film lacked was Orlando Bloom (you know, Legolis Greenleaf the elf) I think in LOTR he is excellent but this might have been over his head, although, he wasn't horrible, I'll say that. One thing that stood out to me was the violence. I loved it. It was, by far, the most ruthless Disney movie I have ever seen. Basically the bottom line is, I walked into the theater thinking this epic wouldn't be all that good and after 2 1/2 hours I walked out thinking it was a definite 4 star movie. Reccomend for sure ... extremely entertaining!"
"Streetwolf","10","0","1","17 July 2003"," Movie of the year... so far!
","This was truly a joyful and entertaining movie that from my point of view was most likely this years worth a watch!!<br/><br/>The curse of Cortez is set on the pirate ship crew by the name of Black Pearl. In order to remove the curse they have to find the missing gold piece they had stolen and to spill the blood of a dead pirate after they retrieve the last piece. Unfortunately the missing piece is in the hands of the beautiful Elizabeth Swann, a governor's daughter in love with the local blacksmith and swordsman Will Turner. When Elizabeth is kidnapped by the crew of the Black Pearl, Will Turner accepts the help of the low-life pirate Jack Sparrow, but little does Will know about the true story of Jack Sparrow, as they sail after the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>We were very hesitant to see this movie in the beginning, but after reading the reviews we decided to give it a chance and we were surprised and in awe of the wonderful story it contained. The movie has it all, action, adventure, humour and a wonderful cast. Orlando Bloom makes a wonderful appearance outside of his superb portrayal of Legolas in Lord of the Rings as Will Turner, the young man, who knows so little about his family. Johnny Depp was quite surprisingly brilliant as well as the strange, wigged out and 2-faced pirate Captain Jack Sparrow and least of all the beautiful Keira Knightley, who portrayed Elizabeth Swann is a definitely rising star in the chain of Hollywood actresses! I rate this 10 out of 10 and then some!"
"Special-K88","Null","0","1","17 July 2003"," overlong but enjoyable swashbuckling pic
","Long, but fun and entertaining high seas adventure about a young blacksmith who conceals his love for the governor's engaged daughter. When she's abducted by a ruthless gang of ghostly, undead pirates, he makes a deal with an eccentric rogue (himself a pirate), to try and track her down. The film would certainly have been more effective had it been shorter, but it's full of engaging action scenes, elaborate set design, colorful wardrobe, stunning visual effects, and spirited performances. Depp is an absolute riot and pulls out all the stops as the flamboyant Captain Sparrow, and keeps the film watchable during its plot-heavy moments. ***"

","I saw Pirates of the Caribbean last night at Cine Capri.  I was impressed and enjoyed it despite it's run time of 2.5 hours.  Yes, there was a bit too much swashbuckling, but it was Geoff Rush and Depp who made the movie so enjoyable.  Johnny Depp is a really good actor.  I heard that he used Keith Richards as an inspiration for his character.  After watching his performance, I believe it.    I really liked Geoff.  He said ""Arrrhhhhgggg"" constantly!!!  He played a very good pirate.  I also thought it was a nice touch that they included several scenes that were directly from the Disneyland ride, such as the jailed pirates trying to get the key from the DOG!!!  There was a little kid sitting next to me.  He kept saying he was scared.  So, I don't know if kids will like it.  But I am sure if your kids love disneyland, they will like this movie.   <br/><br/>A couple of things that bothered me were 1) the female who always looked perfect, despite the horrid situations she found herself in.  Her makeup was always perfect etc.  That was a tad bothersome.   2)  Some of the hokey one liners delivered by Depp and the female lead.  They didn't bother me THAT much, but there were a few lines that were definitely CORNY.<br/><br/>The cinematography was nop notch and the most enjoyable part of the film. It made me yearn to return to the Caribbean.  However, now the Caribbean is all cruise ships and tourism.  <br/><br/>the Pirates were awesome. I loved the way they turned to skeletons when the moon light shined on them!!  They were comical more than fierce.<br/><br/>
All in all, 8 dollars well spent."

","Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent movie.  I am not big on the whole pirate issue so I was unsure if I wanted to sit 2 and a half hours to watch this but time was well spent seeing this movie.  For it being a PG-13 Disney movie it was spectacular with it's action sequences and the story line all together.  Though the ride at Magic Kingdom is totally different but idea was somewhat the same, the movie turned out great.  I am going to go and see it again.  Let me tell you it's worth seeing."

"totalqt","10","0","1","16 July 2003"," See other comment for more details: EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!
","NOTE: THIRD PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILER FOR EXTRA SCENE!<br/><br/>Please see my other comment, with the one line summary of ""One of the best movies of all time!"" for more information. I believe that is what it was called anyway.<br/><br/>I recently saw this movie for the third time (once on a sneak preview 2 days early, once with a friend, and today with a relative) and I still am not at all sick of it! I love this movie! Everyone does a wonderful job, especially Orlando Bloom ;D and Johnny Depp : ). I give it 10 out of 10, and I would give it more if possible. Disregard the rumors that it is ""too long""- none of the three times I have seen it have I felt bored or anxious for the next scene. Pirates of the Caribbean will keep you on the edge of your seat with excitement, or rolling on the floor laughing. Also do not believe it is a kids' movie. Kids will enjoy it, but it is made for more mature audiences. Other false rumors say that the accents are all fake (NOT TRUE!!!) or Orlando Bloom cannot act (WAY NOT TRUE!!! He is one of my 2 favorite actors). All in all it is AWESOME!!!<br/><br/>I just had to add another comment to tell anyone who did not stick around for after the credits to tell them what they missed (NOTE: THIS IS A SPOILER!!!) There is a quick scene after the hundreds of boring credits that makes waiting worthwhile. It begins by showing Barbosa's green apple floating in the water just off the shore of Isle de Muert(o?). The camera shows random sights like Barbosa's body, the coins, the water, the gold, the treasure chest, and then switches to a view showing Jack the monkey swimming over to the stone chest of the cursed Aztec gold. The monkey then climbs to the top of the chest, takes a coin out, and turns back into a skeleton monkey. A perfect setup for a sequel! As seen on the Pirates of the Caribbean trivia section of this site, The Curse of the Black Pearl was added to the title after the first few previews came out in hopes that the movie would do well in the box office and a sequel could be made. And things are certainly looking promising! The movie has done excellently in the box office and I for one am highly anticipating (and hoping for) a follow up. Let's just hope it will be as great as the original!"

","This movie was okay. The storyline and plot was good, except a lot of the funny parts they tried to make sound funny... didnt. The only parts that I thought were funny were with Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow and although they tried to put humor into the other characters, but I didnt think it was funny at all. Jack Sparrow cracked me up a lot though, but that was because he acted like a retard a lot.<br/><br/>Overall... 3/4 I recomend it"

","I loved the film it was Gr8 I think that it was 1 of the best movies disney has made in years!  The movie was not only exciting the first time I saw it I was on the edge of my seat not knowing what the cunning Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom would do next!! The Other elements that interested me were the stunts and special effects having the pirates turn into skeletons before your eyes were spectacular, the list of stunt men and women names in the credits were very long! One thing concerned me that ""bootstrap Bill"" William Turner Senior if he was shot off the Black Pearl, was he a living skeleton, wouldn't he be a living skeleton also with the rest of the crew? If he was he would be in the ocean unable to die giving him in the neighborhood of 10 years to get to land or be picked up by a ship! Whatever happened to him? Overall the Pirates of the Carribean is a ""MUST SEA"" that is sure to send you to the high seas!<br/><br/>Other Movies I would recommend: Lord of the Rings The Fellowship, Lord of the Rings The Two Towers, Legally Blonde 2, and Finding Nemo<br/><br/>
Other Movies I would not recommend: The Hulk"

","All right you insecure excuse for men.  Yes, Depp's character was unconventional, but Depp added real depth to it.  Obviously those of you questioning your own sexuality had a problem the sayshaying of a swashbuckling pirate.  Depp's character of Sparrow was magnificent.  The character's layers were wonderfully teased at and by the end of the movie, I was wishing I was the love of Captain Jack Sparrow instead of the Black Pearl, much to the dismay of my husband.  It is a wonderful movie.  I have seen it three times already and plan on seeing again.  I just love men in boots carrying swords.  They make me swoon."

","All I can say is WOW.<br/><br/>The special effects were great.  They flowed very well within the film. There is not much gore, very little blood, and no curse words except for a few British sayings. The backgrounds and settings were beautiful; they make me want to travel to the Caribbean.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Johnny Depp was incredible. He really made his character come to life in a very unique way. I don't remember any other pirate in a movie having anything like his personality.  He stole all of the scenes he was in. Orlando Bloom did a great job as the conquering hero. I was more impressed with his acting in this film than I was with his acting in Lord of the Rings.  All of his fans will be swooning in the aisles of the theater. Geoffrey Rush did a wonderful job as the villain. There were times that he made me just sit back amazed at his character. Keira Knightley was a beautiful heroine. She was strong, smart, and witty enough to make me feel like cheering a couple of times.<br/><br/>Make sure when you watch it you take a look at the end of the credits. There is some film at the very end that you shouldn't miss."

Gore Verbinski really shows his versatility coming from directing ""The Ring"", which I thought was great - again unexpectedly. I will definitely be on the look out for his future projects. With these 2 movies he jumped right into ""My Top 10 Favorite Directors"" list."
"sbyers77","7","0","1","15 July 2003"," Surprisingly Good.
","I had heard mixed reviews about this movie, some of my friends told me that it was the best movie they had ever seen, and yet others told me it was garbage. Usually I am a harsh critic when it comes to movies, so I was pleasently suprised when I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.<br/><br/>To me it was interesting that Disney would make a PG-13 movie, but I suppose that is how the winds are blowing these days. But it worked out well. Although I expected more blood and violence, and possibly cussing, I can see why the movie got the pg-13 mark even with it's lack of gratutity in most 13 films. Also I was suprised that the Director could have some redemption in this movie after making the oh-so-awful and stupid ""The Ring"".<br/><br/>As for the acting, Johny Depp was also suprisingly excelent in this role. I dont think I would have casted Orlando Bloom for his role however. *Spoiler* At the end where he suddenly became a pirate it seemed more like he was still a blacksmith pretending to be a prirate than anything else.<br/><br/>This movie is almost two and a half hours long, but never was too boring. The pace was constant and didnt drag on. Although long, it ended where it had to and I didnt feel borded or gyped.<br/><br/>I give Pirates of the Carribian a 7 out of 10."

Not in the sense that it sucked.  It didn't suck at all.  Johnny Depp was hilarious, and the visual effects were great.

","There is one rule that I try to always keep when watching a movie: don't have expectations.  When I'm seeing a movie in the theater, I also add on to just see the movie for fun.  Well, due to all of the comments I read on here saying that the movie was great, I broke my own rule.  And surprisingly, I was still impressed.<br/><br/>This movie is one that I will definitely be seeing again in the theater, and buying as soon as it comes out on DVD (hopefully with director's and actors commentary).  When I saw the first preview for this, I thought ""hmm, interesting"".  Then I started seeing more, this time with scenes from the movie instead of just a list of the cast.  Finally, they started to reveal the basics of the plot, and I knew that I would have to see this movie. It's based on one of my favorite rides at Disney, with an amazingly contagious song (which is sung in the film), and I was looking forward to seeing how it would be portrayed in a cinematic point of view.<br/><br/>Acting in this movie was near to perfect.  Johnny Depp gave one of his best performances ever.  No one would be able to tear their eyes away from him. His Captain Jack Sparrow wasn't what I was expecting when I first heard of his part, and it was a better character for it.  He wasn't the typical pirate.  You expect a swagger, but he has a sway.  He seems to be permanently drunk.  And although he is a pirate, he's honest in many of his tales, because no one would believe him anyway, especially as most of them are outrageous.  I would go to the theater again just for him alone.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom, there so that young girls will go see this movie, does a very good job at his role as Will Turner.  Unfortunately, there wasn't that much to his role.  He's a bit too love-struck with Elizabeth Swann to be interesting, though his role is needed in the film.  His sword play was probably the most interesting part about his character, and the fact that he has pirate blood in him despite holding a hatred towards their kind.<br/><br/>The audience can almost feel Geoffrey Rush's evil in the movie as Barbossa. He plays his role well just as one would expect from an actor like him. He even gets to deliver a few of the funny lines, although most of them were awarded to Depp.<br/><br/>For the least known of all the leads, Kiera Knightley seemed to hold her own against veterans such as Depp and Rush.  While they were still the ones that eyes were kept on, she delivered a great performance, and will probably be awarded quite a few roles stemming from this film.<br/><br/>There are few problems that I had with this film.  The acting was impressive, the sets were amazing, the CGI well used, and the storyline went along smoothly.  One thing that I greatly enjoyed was the Errol Flynn style fighting, instead of the Matrix style that most films are trying to use, despite the century that it is set in.  One doesn't need that sort of thing in a movie about swashbucklers.  Fluid is the only way to describe the CGI usage of the pirate skeletons.  It was as smoothly as the moonlight shining on them.  And the added references to the ride (ie. the dog with the keys never moving, the song) gave it the perfect touch.  Granted, some might complain about the length, but none of it was wasted.  Just don't drink a large soda while viewing.  And the final scene with Will & Elizabeth seemed a bit forced.  But those can be forgiven when the film is looked at as a whole.<br/><br/>It was impressive from start to finish, grabbing the viewers attention and never letting go.  Like the ride, you can just kick back and enjoy the show going on around you.  Not one to miss."
"stamp1","10","0","1","17 July 2003"," Another Perfect Movie In The Best Year For Movie Watching EVER!
","Well, what can I say that everyone else hasn't already said about Pirates of the Caribbean (POTC)? Since Dec. 2002, one very good or great or FANTASTIC movie after another has been released. I have been watching movies in theaters now for about 40 years, and the quality of films this year has never been better overall in my opinion. I have seen 3 films that I thought were perfect, (I didn't think they could be improved at all), these were Finding Nemo, Terminator 3, and now POTC. Of course, the plot was great, incredibly entertaining, non-stop ACTION. Great special effects which were TOTALLY BELIEVABLE (if you can believe in undead skeleton pirates!). Fine acting (with Johnny Depp giving maybe the best acting performance of the year-it helped that he had such a great script & all those funny lines). The costumes, sets, ships all seemed so real, it was easy to believe we were REALLY back in the pirate age set in the Caribbean Sea. If this film is not nominated for an Academy Award, then there will be no justice (of course it WON'T, any movie that is popular & makes more than $10 million at the box office won't be considered ESPECIALLY if it is the best movie that year.)<br/><br/>I have seen every Johnny Depp film he has made I believe. I haven't always liked them, because some were too oddball or weird, but he has ALWAYS been interesting & fascinating in them. For those who are too young, (and he probably doesn't want to remember), his first hit film was ""Nightmare On Elm Street 1"", where he stood out among all the dead teenagers. About the same time, he became the star of a great TV show on a brand new FOX TV network, called ""21 Jump Street"". A great show which only lasted a few years I believe. He was great in ""Cry-Baby"", he was PERFECT in ""Edward Scissorhands"", he was great in ""Benny & Joon"", he was PERFECT in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" (the movie that started Leonardo DiCaprio's career as a star). In this film, Johnny Depp should have won an academy award for best actor (maybe for E.Scissorhands too.) In ""Ed Wood"", he & Bill Murray were FANTASTIC, in ""Don Juan DeMarco"" he was the only good thing about that movie. Same with ""Legend Of Sleepy Hollow"". In POTC, the rest of the cast is good, but Johnny Depp IS OUTSTANDING!!! If this movie doesn't win an Academy Award, then Johnny Depp DESERVES to win one! Disney/Bruckheimer announced a sequel already, I believe they said Johnny signed up for it. IF HE DIDN'T, then don't bother making a sequel. He is the reason I could have watched the movie for 6 hrs. instead of 2 & 1/2. He was that fascinating (with the help of the great script!) I hope to go back & see this film again, along with ""Finding Nemo"" & ""Terminator 3"" which were equally perfect also."

","This film delivers. I had high expectations when I walked into the theater, and for some reason I half expected to be disappointed. Some movies that get too much premature hype leave the viewer unsatisfied, but not so with Pirates of the Carribean. The film grabs your attention from the beginning, when young Elizabeth Swann discovers the Aztec medallion that will put the story's events in motion years later.<br/><br/>Verbinski did an excellent job choosing his cast. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow entertains throughout the movie with his rugged charm and offbeat personality. Though Depp always seems to choose odd roles, he does them well. Rising stars Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann also performed well. This movie will probably make Bloom a household name, and draw more attention to Knightley.<br/><br/>The plot may have a few loopholes and the movie's running time of two hours and twenty-four minutes may be a bit lengthy, but overall Pirates of the Carribean is a captivating film with adventure, romance, comedy, and a superb cast to help the movie reach its full potential."
"allykaym","10","0","1","15 July 2003"," A Great Movie- Exceeds Expectations
","I actually went to see this movie twice- and for ten dollars per ticket (ah, gotta love New York) this means something.<br/><br/>I was initially dragged to this movie by my younger sister with very low expectations, considering it was Disney-made live action, a PG-13, and the previews weren't that great.<br/><br/>I was very pleasantly surprised to say the least.  This movie put me in the mind of ""Indiana Jones""- a great action movie with some comedy thrown in- and ultimately very entertaining.  Unlike most action movies today made mostly for the teen-to-20's male crowd who will spend on video games, etc. this movie wasn't just an endless repetition of big guns, explosions and breasts.  Sure, all three of those made it in there (and some of the battle scenes are a bit long), but they didn't dominate- they were part of the fabric of the story and atmosphere.<br/><br/>Both times I saw it, all but three of the jokes got laughs from everyone in the audience (and the sight gag that introduced Capt. Jack Sparrow was great).<br/><br/>Two words: Johnny Depp.  Not only is he unbelievably sexy (eyeliner and all - sorry :) )  but his character is amazing- funny, well-acted, and really the moving force behind this movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the other actors' performances as well (though Kiera Knightley seemed to be struggling to stay on par a bit- but I do give her credit for the physicality and comedy required).  Orlando Bloom, although required by the script to make a few cheesy faces and declarations, does a good job as the classic man out to save his love (and even has the look of a classic movie star).<br/><br/>The only detractors were the over-the-top cheesiness of the romance and the attention paid to the Black Pearl pirates (or perhaps that attention would be ok if they were more pirate-like and a bit less hammy?)<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was a refreshingly good movie- something that has been missing from summers for quite a while.  Can best be summed up in one word: ""Entertaining!""  Go see it!"

And I must say, I had more fun sitting in that theatre than I have had in a long time. Honestly, this one of the best efforts I've ever seen. Johnny Depp was Jack Sparrow. I don't mean to say that he merely played Jack Sparrow. His actions and attitude and accent and voice all came together so perfectly that you forgot that he wasn't actually a pirate, sailing the seas, completely mad and wonderfully amusing for it. Orlando Bloom played such a Will Turner that made it obvious that the part was all but written for him. His eyes held all the emotions that Will felt. He was an inspired choice. Two very enthusiastic thumbs way up from this movie-goer. The critics were wrong, yet again."

","As far as entrances go into a film, only Darth Vader surpasses Captain (never forget the prefix to his name) Jack Sparrow.  Depp steals this movie from the first scene he is in on.  I love Legolas, but i don't really want to see Bloom play him in every one of his films.  He did not take his character in a different direction from the swashbuckling, sleek, bravery in the face of certain death in this film.  There was charisma in this film as opposed to the other ""blockbuster"" opening this week (ehhemm.  cough hack, LXG cough, hack.)  Keira Knightly was delicious in her portrayal of a non-stereotypical, albeint a little predictable damsel in distress yet in love woman of the era.  The effects were very impressive.  What can I say, Bruckheimer knows how to blow crap up.  This movie is not one of those ""absolutely must see"" movies, but it is worth going to go see in the theatres."

","This movie was so good that I still can't believe it.  I loved every moment of the movie and never found it long or slow.  This was undoubtedly my favorite movie of the year (Matrix Reloaded and Holes were my previous favorites - and no, I'm not under 30 LOL).  Johnny Depp deserves an academy award for his brilliant performance IMO.  It reminds me a bit of Lee Marvin's comedic character in Cat Ballou, which I believe he did win an academy award for.  Not that the characters were that similar, but yet both roles provided the actor with the chance to really get into the role and create a totally unique character, and even though they were traditional ""bad guy"" roles (i.e. pirate, outlaw) they had heart and were funny and were indeed really the good guys.  The FX are amazing, the story is amazing, the actors are amazing....what more can I say but check out this movie."

","Ahoy, me hearties!  The pirate movie be back and, blimey, if it be keelhaulin' the scurvy- ridden bilge that be marooned in yon summer theaters.<br/><br/>
Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl is a big, sprawling adventure.  The kind you don't see anymore and it's a damn shame.  The script is smart. It allows the characters to figure things out.  It keeps you in the film.  Yeah, it may be a tad too long at its two hour and twenty-four minute run time, but it flies by a good portion of the time.<br/><br/>The acting is superb with not a single person acting in any self-conscious way that would reveal they are in a pirate movie.  Geoffrey Rush is great as Captain Barbossa with his pirate-like growl.  He even utters ""Arrrr"" much to the delight of the audience. Casting off his turn as an elf, Orlando Bloom takes on the unlikely hero role with vigor enough to prove his acting chops.<br/><br/>Of course, the real star here is Johnny Depp as the fey pirate, Jack Sparrow, a pirate captain without a ship.  In fact, Depp gets the best movie entrance this summer in a leaky, sinking dinghy.  His character he claims is based on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and it shows.  He is half-crazed and swishes around delivering the best lines in the film.  Yet, he is completely believable and never goes (dare I say it?) overboard.  I say it's about damn time the Academy stood and noticed one of our generation's most versatile and creative actors, but that's just me.<br/><br/>Pirates is one of those adventure films that will have you grinning with pleasure through most of its high-spirited hijinks and is right behind Finding Nemo for pure summer fun. Ye be a swab if ye miss this one.  Sink me, if I don't be givin' this movie four st-arrrrs."

The effects were great, and Geoffrey Rush comes in a close second to Depp in inspired performance.<br/><br/>Sure, you can nitpick and say the fight scenes and some of the other actors were a little flat, but that would be entirely missing the point.

"jerrywilson","9","0","1","14 July 2003"," An unexpectedly fun and funny flick
","Disney flicks aren't what they used to be, and that's a good thing for adults. Sure, they still crank out the silly kids' movies that have just enough adult humor to keep the parents relatively happy. But this one is not for kids.<br/><br/>It's an action-adventure comedy that doesn't insult its audience with unbridled silliness. It was cleverly written and excellently played, especially the role of Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Though seemingly shallow, the character has surprising depth. Depp plays him as a quasi-homosexual, macho swordsman with a heart. He delivered his comic punch lines with impeccable timing and flawless expressions. He was the best part of a very good movie.<br/><br/>Is Sparrow the hero or the villain? Sometimes it's hard to tell, because he's a little of both. He is a pirate, after all. So one would expect that he would have a streak of evilness about him. And so he does. But it's not an overriding character flaw, as he redeems himself on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean was a marvelously funny, action-packed adventure movie. It holds your attention throughout its 2-and-a-quarter hour running time. I usually say that if a director can't tell his story in under two hours, something needs to be cut. But this movie pulls it off throughout its length.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it and gave it a rating of 9."
"happie_bunnie","10","0","1","14 July 2003"," A movie unlike ANY!
","I will admit, the reason I went to see this movie was because I truly think Orlando Bloom running around in sexy clothes is WORTH every cent of money I pay! When the movie started, however...holy c**p! I have never laughed so much in a theater in my life. Johnny Depp is brilliant, totally surpassing anything he has ever done! His comedic timing is priceless and his portrayal left me at a loss of words. Orlando as the love-struck Will was also jaw-dropping, though many people say he was just there to be there and look good. I think Orlando is one of the actors we will be seeing a LOT of. Geffory Rush kicked major a** as an evil pirate who will stop at nothing to regain his life, and Knightly knows how to swoon anyone. The movie all around was brilliant, one of my favorites!"

","Johnny Depp was fantastic! I couldn't get enough. The overall story was hilarious but I don't think it would have worked out without Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. The story follows ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow with his dream of becoming captain of his own ship once again. When Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) offers him just that in order to save his love Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley). They are faced with the fact the shipmates on the Black Pearl are, indeed, dead. This causes a problem because they are incapable of winning back Elizabeth. The funny antics are guaranteed you to laugh until you cry. ****"

","About:  Well, I wont tell you much about what this movie is about, because I walked in not knowing much, and I loved discovering things a long the way as I watched.  Here's what I WILL tell you: The Black Pearl is a ship of cursed pirates that are after the one thing that can free them from there curse, and Will Turner (Bloom) who needs the help of Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) to stop them.<br/><br/>What I liked:  What DIDN'T I like about this movie? It was great, swashbuckling entertainment!  And despite the fact that it's a Disney movie, it really isn't something I'd take my 6 year old little brother to go see. What it does have from Disney is the typical pair of characters as comic relief in the form of two arguing British soldiers, and two bumbling pirates.  It also is very funny, with jokes that never are never ""hit and sinkers.""  I love Johnny Depp's character, Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny once again proves that he is one of the finest actors of today, and while he is drop dead gorgeous, he loves to play against his looks, which is one of the great things about him.  His character is one of the highlights of the movie, a roguish, quirky, crazy? maybe, but oh so clever pirate. I also liked Elizabeth Swann (who is that actress) who, thank God, is like a normal girl.  They didn't give her amazing sword fighting abilities, or try to make her into a ""butt kickin' cleavage showin' vixen"" that we often see on movies today.  While she does do her share of pirate bum kickin' and don't worry Jeff and Vince, she's a very pretty girl, despite the lack of cleavage. C'mon, this is Disney folks.  The pirates are menacing in both their day form as ragged wild men, and in their night form as skeletons.  Also, the monkey scared the beejeezus out of me.<br/><br/>What I Didn't Like:  Please do read above, where I said ""What DIDN'T I like?"".<br/><br/>Bottom Line:  For a great blend of action, adventure, and comedy, go out and see Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl soon!"

","Pirates of the Carribean was excellent, Johnny Depp stole the show! He was perfect, his characterization was flawless, his humor was well-timed and not too over the top. The special effects were stunning, the scene with the pirates walking underwater towards the end was especially breathtaking. The fight scenes did seem a bit messy though, they could have been more choreographed, and did anyone notice that Orlando Bloom was an underappreciated waste of talent? I mean, I'm not saying he didn't do the best he could in the role he was given, he acted great and didn't ever look out of place, but maybe he should pick roles that better suited him. Well, that seems a bit harsh. He was fantastic in this role, this role was a good one, the movie was a definite A, but Orlando Bloom can do so much more as we've seen in LOTR. Maybe compared to LOTR, every other role is going to look like a second-best. Keira Knightley definitely kept the damsel in distress to a minimum, and she kicked butt when she could. She pulled off the perfect balance of vulnerability and spitfire. Well done cast and crew!"
"totalqt","10","0","1","14 July 2003"," One of the best movies of all time!
","To begin with, my top 6 list of movies is as follows: #1: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, #2: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, #3: Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, #4: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, #5: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, #6: Monty Python and the Holy Graile. You probably noticed that #3 on my list is Pirates of the Caribbean. This movie, in my opinion, is a 10 out of 10 must-see film. I attended a sneak preview on July 7th (2 days before it came out where I live), saw it again recently, and am planning to see it again. I am also highly anticipating the DVD, and maybe even a sequel (if there is one, I hope so!). Not to mention riding the ride at Disney World! The premise is strange: A movie based on a thrill ride. But it certainly lives up to the reputation of its namesake ride, and is by far the best pirate movie yet to come out! Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) was my favorite character, and one of my 2 favorite actors. Johnny Depp, odd as he is, really made the movie as Captain Jack Sparrow. The storyline follows the classic love story, but doesn't ""go overboard"" on it. Boy meets girl, boy loves girl, girl gets lost, boy saves girl, girl loves boy. But there is much more to the movie than that. I highly recommend this excellent movie to anyone. At 2 1/2 hours long, it certainly takes a while, but you'll find yourself wishing for more. To find out more about the movie, go see it at a theater near you, savvy? (That's pirate for ""understand?"").

"David V","10","0","1","14 July 2003"," The best movie I've seen in a long time!
","I can't remember the last time I had this much fun watching a movie.  All aspects of it were played out to near perfection, and the only things I can think of negative about it are only minor quibbles that for the most part I didn't think of until trying to force myself to look at a bad side of things.<br/><br/>At 2 1/2 hours, this movie does what only Fellowship of the Ring has succeeded at in recent history, it runs the exact length that it needs to for the movie to feel just right.  It is neither too long where you feel like they are padding just because it's becoming a fad to make big movies, nor does it run too short and feel like things were wrapped up too quickly or easily.<br/><br/>The acting is superb from all participants.  This is an ensemble piece, with multiple main characters, and it delivers an appropriately diverse and layered performance.  Every player fills his or her role to perfection, with several standout performances by all leads, as well as by numerous supporting characters (good and bad guys).  There were too many memorable characters to go into listing here, but they really did an excellent job of giving the feel that there was more going on in the world they created than just what they showed in the film.<br/><br/>The story was well thought out and developed much further than your average or even above average adventure films, yet it never got cumbersome or confusing, and was perfectly paced.  It's also incredibly fun looking for the easter eggs from the ride which they cleverly blended into it.<br/><br/>And one final, major plus...  The soundtrack is truly epic.  My entire group that I watched it with kept commenting, ""I gotta get the soundtrack!"" Very exciting, catchy music that will stick with you for a long time!  We don't see much of that anymore.<br/><br/>This movie is a breath of fresh air, and highly recommended viewing!"

","Most Disney movies that I've seen were nice, fluffy movies about happy things such as fairies and pretty, pretty, princesses.  This one was different in that it's a lot darker than the average Disney film, and more crude, as well.  While the movie was very well written and well played out, parts of it didn't quite make sense.  The plot seemed to move quickly, which was usually a good thing, but not nescessarily.  For instance; there was very little introduction for Johnny Depp's character in the beginning.  He just popped up all of a sudden.  There were maybe one or two holes in the plot, as well.  Overall, however, this was the best movie I've seen so far this summer.  As I said, the story line was very good, and the selected actors played out their characters perfectly (although more about the characters was to be desired).  So, in short, this film is worth the $8 to go and see in theaters."

Orlando Bloom especially and most of the cast in general tend to be a bit wooden, but then they don't really have a lot to work with.  The plot is shameless adventure movie boilerplate.  And most of the time it just feels like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie - occasionally clever but mostly forehead-slappingly tedious dialogue, excessive flash in the action scenes, and the requisite happy ending. So what was entertaining?  This has been said millions of times before, but Johnny Depp.  Maybe it was his entrance (one of the few genuinely funny gags) but generally he has a certain drunken stylishness to him.

"ilovedolby","8","0","2","15 July 2003"," `Pirates of the Caribbean,' is a fine blend of swashbuckling action, stunning visual effects, elaborate sets and fairly good performances.
","If you have ever been to Disney World, undoubtedly you have ridden one of their oldest and most famous rides, √Ç‚ÄòPirates of the Caribbean.' The ride first premiered at Disneyland in California in 1956. Since then, it has astounded riders with its stunning animatronics that make riders feel as if they are actually viewing real pirates. Now, in 2003, we are blessed with a film version, equally as remarkable as the ride, but far more frightening. Unlike the usual simple live-action films based on Disney creations, hence `The Lizzy McGuire Movie,' the new `Pirates of the Caribbean,' is a fine blend of swashbuckling action, stunning visual effects, elaborate sets and fairly good performances. Starring Johnny Depp (`From Hell'), Orlando Bloom (`Black Hawk Down'), Geoffrey Rush (`Frida'), Keira Knightley (`Bend It Like Beckham'), Jack Davenport (The Talented Mr. Ripley) and Johnathan Pryce (`What A Girl Wants'), `Pirates of the Caribbean' is quite possibly one of this summer's most exciting motion pictures. 	The story follows that of Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), who after being imprisoned is freed by a blacksmith named Will Turner (Bloom). Turner needs the help of Sparrow to hunt down a band of pirates who have kidnapped the radiant Elizabeth Swann (Knightley), who is the governor's daughter. Incidentally, Swann holds a medallion that has a secret power to transform her kidnappers back into real men, as a curse has left them as ghosts. It's now a race for Sparrow and Turner to find and kill the pirates before they sacrifice Swann in an ancient ritual to free themselves from the curse. <br/><br/>	Depp steals the show with his constant swaggering and drunken behavior-he fits the character of Sparrow like a glove. Beyond Depp, Rush is equally engaging as the nefarious pirate Barbossa. Bloom also pulls off a realistic performance, as he does in every film in which he appears. Mostly known for his role as Legolas in `The Lord of the Rings,' films, he brings class and wit to `Pirates of the Caribbean.' All three actors share something in common-they can do no wrong. They all grace every project that they work on and add a sense of intrigue to the plot through their characterization.<br/><br/>	The general feel of `Pirates of the Caribbean' is serious, yet campy enough to have fun along the way. The audience will certainly enjoy how Sparrow tricks British soldiers as he tries to steal a ship. But there is also a sense that the film is trying to be truthful in it's realistic portrayal, at least physically and set-wise, of what the battles would be like between naval ships. 	The set design is astonishing. A great deal of craft and creativity went into the building of ships and buildings that the pirates pillage and plunder. One feels as if they are looking at real ships from the era. Usually there are little flaws that seem to stick out on a movie screen, but with this film, they just don't seem to show up. 	The film may be a bit longer than necessary, but its thrilling from start to finish. Directed by Gore Verbinski (`The Ring'), `Pirates of the Caribbean' will long be remembered and loved for its action sequences and pure fun. However, parents should heed the PG-13 rating, as the film can be quite scary for the little ones at times. ***"

My family appreciated the witty script which did not try to spoonfeed every detail of the story to the audience. The different aspects of the film - casting, music, film execution - came together to make a sastifying movie watching experience."

","Why is it that every blockbuster now thinks that it has to come in at over 2hrs, some judicious editing especially in the fight scenes and this film could have come in at about 1hr 40 and been much tighter for it. Instead the film finds itself in the doldrums for long periods at a time.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp as the eccentric Captain Sparrow is wonderful, Orlando Bloom is so-so, in several fight scenes you were half expecting him to whip out his bow and fill the enemy full of arrows.<br/><br/>Jack Davenport, plays Jack Davenport, a stiff English middle class guy, just as he plays in Coupling and Ultraviolet but it's nice to see him getting exposure on the Big Screen"

","Let's face it, I have never been one to go for theme park ride inspired movies, especially rides from Disney -Youarehavingsomefunnowyes?- Land. Then I saw the trailer for Pirates of the Caribbean. Then I found out Geoffrey Rush was playing the bad guy. And then I was sold.<br/><br/>All in all Pirates of the Caribbean surprises on many levels, mostly (for me) in the special effects department. The animated skeletons, while still retaining the all to fluid movement of CGI, are much more believable than, say, some other CGI effects in much more high profile movies.<br/><br/>The music to the film is very fine, especially the end-credit piece, something I had not been counting on. The movie is very well cast, particularly in the case of Jonathan Pryce as a somewhat bumbling, but well-meaning father-of-the- heroine. And of course there is Johnny Depp, who seems to be vying with Guy Pearce (in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,) for the Most Flamboyant Character Portrayal Award. He truly takes the viewing experiance to the next level. Then there is Orlando Bloom, who seems all set to take over from Errol Flynn despite the fact that he has, with out a doubt, probably the worst role in the whole film. Geoffrey Rush is quite well cast in his part as Major Baddie in Chief, and seems to be having way to much fun with that monkey of his.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and I should really say something about Keira Knightley, she is good, better than most. But I would have still preferred to see Franka Potente in this part. Oh well.<br/><br/>Truth be told, Pirates of the Caribbean is a rolicking good time, although younger kids (and older ones, too,) may get nightmares, so be warned. I myself thoroughly enjoyed it, and cannot wait to see it again.<br/><br/>Warning: Johnny Depp's character is highly contagious, after viewing this movie I spent the rest of the day prancing about looking as though I was a member of the Ministry of Silly Walks, Naval Devision, and speaking with a low caliber English accent. Just thought I might warn you, although if you are a teenager it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>--- Jaiko"

","With action, comedy, romance, and, above all, pirates, this is the perfect summer movie!  The cast is superb.  Johnny Depp is hilarious as the over-the-top rouge pirate, Jack Sparrow.  Orlando Bloom, probably cast for the ladies ;-), is very handsome and makes a great blacksmith-turned-pirate, Will Turner.  Newcomer Keira Knightney is a beautiful and talented girl (only 17 years old at the time of shooting) who will go far in her career. Her portrayal of governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann was wonderfully fiesty underneath her upright exterior.  Geoffrey Rush was delightfully frightening as evil pirate Captain Barbossa.  This movie had wonderful visual effects, the best being during a swordfight in a moonlit cave.  Although not suitable for the youngest viewers, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a fun way to spend a couple hours."

","The success of this movie aren't in the morale (which is quite hidden) or even the plot (which is pretty silly, pirates with an ancient curse), but instead it is the non stop action without being pointless. Sure the battle scenes between the pirates and the royal navy are a little pointless but it adds the the drama and intensity of the movie. Johnny Depp as Jack is an excellent choice, probably the only one that could have pulled it off. He is senslesly silly, without being evil.

","According to the comments I had read, I was expecting this movie to be somewhat of a serious attempt to portray real pirates via some sort of mystery and perhaps romantic plot. I certainly had no idea that it was going to be more like Sinbad fighting skeletons. And speaking of skeletons, why would anyone engage an adversary in any kind of a fight with swords, muskets, or whatever if it is known that the enemy cannot be killed or harmed under the existing circumstances? Why bother to do so under the moonlight?<br/><br/>Contrary to other's views, I had to struggle to keep my attention focused. The movie is too long. Depp does a good job, he is a fine actor. But the truth is that the character he portrays is not the type that I like to see as a lead role at all. There were other fine performances as well, but overall, I would rather be entertained by Geena Davis in Cutthroat Island any day. Ditto my wife."

I loved his character in every way, including his dialogue, costume, habits, and accent!<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was pretty good as well, Orlando Bloom plays as good of a character as he does in the Lord of the Rings.  All of the other characters opposite Depp are satisfying and come together to produce a solid adventure with some descent moments of comic relief.<br/><br/>I'm glad the movie didn't have to resort to excessive gore or sex (although some sex would've been nice, maybe a boob shot?) to make a wonderful adventure.<br/><br/>Anyways, this movie satisfies in every aspect and fullfills the high seas pirate adventure we've been missing for quite some time now.<br/><br/>Go see it.

","It was hard not to be biased going into this film. Jerry Bruckheimer has been responsible for some of the worse movies in recent memory: Kangaroo Jack, Pearl Harbor, Coyote Ugly, Gone In 60 Seconds, Armageddon. Nonetheless, the prospect of pirates occupying the bigscreen for a couple of hours was quite appealing.<br/><br/>There, unfortunately lies one of the film's weaknesses: it's too damn long! A half hour of this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor...maybe reappearing for the DVD release.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is brilliant as Captain Jack Sparrow...but i'm sure you've already heard that in other reviews by now. Jeffery Rush's performance is also noteworthy, however the rest of the supporting cast is mediocre at best.<br/><br/>Depp is amazing...but that in itself does not warrant throwing down $9 for this movie. Perhaps if you stay in the theater and check another mediocre movie afterwards it would be worth it. Otherwise, wait for the DVD. At least then you have a remote available!"
"filmdolly","9","0","1","14 July 2003"," Aye matey...Stay through the credits!
","I was a drama major many years ago and always stay through the credits looking for names I recognize.  It pays off about 25% of the time.  Many films deliver a tasty morsel or an extra scene or an out-take to ponder at the end to keep you thinking.  I live for those moments.  I was all alone in the theater when Pirates of the Caribbean really ended and WOW!  I can't even talk about it, because no one saw it!  So stay. Watch. & Don't spoil it for others. On to the review...anyone who reads my reviews knows all I want from a movie is to be entertained. I wasn't expecting much, but Pirates of the Caribbean delivered in a big way.  I loved it from start to the end after the end.  Johnny Depp was fabulous as Captain Jack Sparrow.  This guy has the most amazing range.  I think he finally hit box office gold with this one though.  He was a bit of a swishy swashbuckler with just the right comedic blend.  It wasn't until near the end that I realized this portrayal had an actual reason in the movie. I thought he was just playing it over the top.  Anyway, this is a pirate tale with a hero, a hero in training, a damsel in distress, a villain, a ship full of miscreants aiding the villain, a ship full of good guys aiding the hero, a worried father, a competitor for the ladies hand, hidden treasure--with a curse, and battle scenes to fuel nightmares for days!  I thought the storytelling was unique and I loved the length of the movie, I'm sick to death of those 90 minute blurbs, I want something more for my nine bucks.  The supporting cast was excellent, also especially Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, the captain of the cursed Black Pearl.  Keira Knightly brought a 90's flair to the film as the not so helpless damsel that added to the suspense & the fun.  Do yourself a favor, see this movie on the big screen."
"jake-179","8","0","1","14 July 2003"," Everything a Pirate movie should have
","This was a great pirate movie.  It has been a long time since a high budget pirate movie has come out.  The last attempt was the dismal ""CUTTHROAT ISLAND.""  And where that movie failed, POTC succeeds. <br/><br/>
POTC has everything that a pirate movie should have.  Plenty of swashbuckling action, of course.  Lots of beautiful sailing ships.  Huge pirate vs. Navy battles with side guns blazing and swords flashing. Mysterious islands with hidden treasures.  And of course, a great sword fight showdown on top of a mountain of burried treasure. <br/><br/>
Of course, the highlight and the twist to this movie is that some of the pirates are somewhat ghosts, suffering from a curse.  The special effects team at ILM has once again impressed me.  The effects are amazing.  As the pirates move around, passing in and out of the moonlight, they transition so smoothly back and forth from ghostly skeleton to flesh.  It is seemless and very realistic.  There are an amazing amount of special effects shots in this movie that must have taken hours of pains taking work.  The special effects are definitely worth seeing, and they do not skimp. <br/><br/>
More importantly, perhaps, is the story of POTC.  The story is very well written, and the key characters of the script have very clearly defined motivations.  Captain Sparrow wants his ship back and to take revenge on the mutaneers.  The pirates want the curse lifted, and need the blood of one of their own.  Elizabeth wants to be with the blacksmith she has loved since childhood.  And he wants to be with her.  Naturally the pirates kidnap Elizabeth and the blacksmith is off to rescue her no matter what, and to discover his own origins.  All of these needs and wants are presented clearly and quickly in the movie, and backed up with a lot of great action. This makes the movie a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>The leading lady, Elizabeth, is incredibly hot.  They did a great job casting her, because she is a lot of fun to look at.  But that brings me to my only complaint about the movie.  She seems to be the only really hot girl in the whole movie.  I think it could have used a few more hot girls.  But then, I always think that.  <br/><br/>There is a lot of great stunt work, with a lot of great rigging.  But the stunts are not so over the top that they become distracting, which was the case in both ""CHARLIE'S ANGELS"" movies.  POTC takes you back to stunts in the style of an Indiana Jones film.  <br/><br/>On top of a great story, great writing, great casting, great locations, and great action, this movie is also funny.  There were many moments that the entire audience was laughing out loud.  Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.  You will have a good time.<br/><br/>Definitely worth the price of admission."

The biggest problem (and it's a big one indeed) is that this movie is really slow in spots.  If they would cut it down at least 30 minutes then it would have been better.  Too many spots where it just dragged on and on.<br/><br/>
The fight sequences are good but too few.  Over all I basically enjoyed the film but not like I had hoped.  Personally I think League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was better.  This movie is worth seeing though it just could have been better.  But you'll LOVE Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow. :)"

The opening scene of the beautiful Johnny Depp stepping off his mast onto the dock and the underwater boat scene are both taken directly from Burt Lancaster's movies.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is just as wonderful here as in the Lord of the Rings trilogy; I look forward to seeing much more of him.

","Most children grow up dreaming of being modern day pirates. Many of us have ridden The Pirates of the Caribbean at Disney Land and dreamed of wearing an eye patch and drawing our swords. Yet, most of us have been deprived of a big screen picture that not only captured our eight bucks, but our imagination as well.<br/><br/>But leave it to Jerry Bruckheimer & Co. to bring our youth a picture that can give them the same dreams and creative thoughts that compelled us. However, we must not be fooled by the appearance of this movie. The Curse of the Black Pearl is a film for men and women of all ages.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski has come a long way from his days of mediocre films such as The Mexican and Mouse Hunt. He even manages to out do the quality of his last film, 2002's brilliant fright fest The Ring. While not near as horror oriented, Pirates of the Caribbean still takes you on a roller coaster ride of thrills and excitement.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is decent as Will Turner, the blacksmith in love with the one woman he cannot have. Yet, among the supporting cast he is overshadowed by both Keira Knightly, who plays Bloom's love interest Elizabeth Swan, and Geoffrey Rush who displays his character acting abilities as Captain Barbossa. Both do an amazing job and stand out amongst all the sword fighting and piracy.<br/><br/>However, it is Johnny Depp who is truly amazing in this film. His ability to transform into a character is absolutely amazing, and as Captain Jack Sparrow he stumbles upon his greatest role since Edward Scissorhands. Even thrown in with the elaborate backdrops and jaw-dropping ships, it is Depp who catches the viewers attention.<br/><br/>With an amazing ensemble cast Verbinski is able to transport into the realm of swash-buckling pirates and mutinous first mates. Unlike predecessors, Verbinski creates the best Pirate movie since Roman Polanski's Pirates (1986) and the best movie yet released in 2003."

","I couldn't say in a 1,000 words what I truly thought of this movie. First of all, I credit Johnny Depp with being the best Captain Jack Sparrow possible, no one could have done better. Not only was his performance great, but he looked stunning; at the age of 40, this married man who has two children can still captivate the young female audiences with not only his looks, but his amazing ability to completely devote himself to the character he's playing. Ofcourse, my comment is to be about the movie. In my opinion Pirates of the Caribbean was the best film ever. I enjoyed this movie to the fullest. The graphics and animations were great and it was such a mix of genres, you couldn't know what to think of it at first. Jack Sparrow made it a comedy; Elizabeth and Will made it a drama; Barbossa made it a horror/fantasy film; and so on. I loved this movie and I recommend it to everyone!"

Not what you'd expect from Disney at all. <br/><br/>I knew Johnny Depp could do comedy bits... so the fact that his character was so lovable was not a surprise. However, this was the first time I've seen Orlando Bloom do a bit of comedy mixed into the action, and he did it very well. <br/><br/>The movie was filled with funny bits, plenty of action, well developed characters (my fav), and a decent plot (another key factor).<br/><br/>So what's there to complain about? The only thing I can think of is the make-up. Johnny Depp was made to look like a freaking nancy boy! He was wearing enough eyeliner to scare Marilyn Manson. I could've done a better job. Even after what seems like hours in the water, no one's 10 pounds of mascara was running. Unbelievable!<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing, (particularly the skeletons changing form in the moonlight as they walk through the water), and somewhat disturbing, (wooden eyeball... that's all I have to say).<br/><br/>But overall, this was a very enjoyable movie. If you don't go to see it for the gorgeous men in shredded shirts... see it for a good chuckle and some cool fight scenes (esp. the scene in the blacksmith shop). It has some very funny bits as well as tense battles. This was ultimately a very entertaining film.<br/><br/>One last thing... avoid looking too long at Orlando Bloom's hat in the final scene. I felt I would go blind if I had to look at that dumb feather for more than 10 seconds. It brought a new definition to the word ""fugly""... or ""f#$%ing ugly"" as it were."

I have not had that much fun watching a movie since Austin Powers 2. The movie was funny and exciting, with great special effects and even a love story. It could actually be a date movie. Johnny Depp is awesome as Jack Sparro (I mean, Captain Jack Sparro). But he doesn't steal the entire show because Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Kierra Knightly were all very good.

","More than any other actor of his generation, Johnny Depp has fascinated me the most. Save for the choices of Brad Pitt, Depp's depth in the roles he has chosen clearly puts him at the head of his class. His portrayal of Jack Sparrow, in this Disney winner, is a composite performance that cannot be compared to any I have ever witnessed. Rush, Bloom, and Knightley are excellent in their respective skins, but Depp's Sparrow is the reason to Fly to see this movie. Like his predecessors, Messrs. Flynn and Lancaster, each scene is an ode to what a real Swashbuckling Movie Star should be. Haven't had this much fun at a Movie in a long time. And the proof of this pudding is in the spontaneous applause you will see and hear at the end of the story(p.s. stay through the end credits).

","I'm going to keep this short and sweet.<br/><br/>I went into Pirates of the Carribean as a longtime fan of the ride, having been to disney world about 17 times all throughout my life. Many fond memories of the classic ride.<br/><br/>I used to love Disney, before they stopped making quality musicals like the Little Mermaid and focused their attention on ruining their theme parks with stupid deletions/changes of rides, ludicrous closing times (6 pm!?), over emphasis on being 100% P.C. and not p***ing anyone off (rather than putting out quality material), and of course exploiting every single movie they ever made with a cheesy ham handed sub par ""sequel"" (SNL went as far as mocking them with a bit called ""Bambi 2000"". You figure it out.)<br/><br/>Overall, I hate Disney's movies.  Anyone see ""Snowdogs""? Didn't think so. I went into ""Pirates of the Carribean"" thinking it was going to be another dumb ""strictly-for-little-kids"" fart-joke fest, with poor dialouge, a trite plot, crappy acting and general badness.<br/><br/>I'm also a film major, and I know my stuff when it comes to movies.<br/><br/>You could say I was probably the toughest audience member they could have had. ....and I was completely and utterly blown away.  Blown. Away.<br/><br/>Disney, somehow, released something that was devoid of all fart jokes, with no lame jokes or bad acting, or exploitation, something that wasn't watered down or cut or anything.  In fact, it was completely AWESOME.<br/><br/>They've managed to create a film that has all the wonderful fun, adventurous spirit of the old disney movies that everyone loved as a kid. It's as though Walt himself was watching over this project in some way.  All the emotions I experienced riding the ride as a kid came back to me...the forboding & sense of death lurking about, adventure, danger, and even humor...yes, that's right - they managed to NOT screw up the jokes at all - with a sense of flair and style that you could only expect from disney.  Depp gives a smashing performance, his best since Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, and the rest of the cast is positively top notch. The plot is creative enough to leave you guessing, but it still fits within the confines of a classic Romantic Narrative...and it was such a blast to watch.<br/><br/>That was the most important thing - I'm 20, and I was sitting in a theatre watching a new disney movie.....and I was ENJOYING every MINUTE of it.<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS.

"hera-14","9","0","1","13 July 2003"," I can't think of the last time I was that entertained.
","I went into the movie theater with a bit of a bias - Pirates of the Caribbean has always been my favorite ride and I really like Johnny Depp. I thought these notions might work against me. Could someone actually capture the magic of a favorite amusment park ride on the silver screen? The answer is yes. This isn't the greatest movie ever made, the moral isn't profound, the script isn't Shakespeare, and the plot is a bit thin. However, it's a tremendous amount of fun. What makes it so much fun is that they truly captured the feel of the ride. It's all there: the yo-ho yo-ho a pirates life me for me song, the inmates luring the dog with a bone, the ghost ship, and the town pillage scene. The story line is simple, pirates steal cursed treasure and then hunt for the last piece of the puzzle to break said curse. The acting is superb. Of course, how can it not be with Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush? I was also quite impressed with the special effects and the cinematography. Usually I think all special effects are unnecessay, but these definately added to the movie experience. I rated this movie a 9, not because I think it is as cinematically magnificent as Casablanca or Schindler's List, but because it was thoroughly entertaining and it made me feel like I was a six year old kid at Disneyland. If you are looking for Citizen Kane or don't care much for pirates, you probably won't like this movie. If, however, you are a kid at heart and want to spend $7.50 (or $10.00, depending on where you live) on a good time, go see it."

","Alright, first off, this movie rocks, but the thing that really sets it aside, really, truly sets it aside (especially after seeing the new Charlie's Angels) was that *wow* they used realistic physics in their special effects!<br/><br/>Maybe one scene, one, in the whole movie was exaggerated, and not by much. In addition, everything is perfectly balanced, like the person who's comments I just read noted, it has everything, but not excessive amounts, and the things it does have are done so well you won't care anyway.<br/><br/>I would have to say that this is the best new movie I've seen in a very, very long time.  Anyone who likes action and adventure, you need to see this right now, especially if you're a big fan of the whole pirate theme.<br/><br/>P.S.

Tension, action, romance, fights, but only one kiss, no gore, and only artfully placed signs of blood!!!  The comedy is great.  Of course if you don't like cheesey humor, this movie may not be to your taste.   This movie pokes fun at stereotypes and is the finest cheesey fun I have seen in a long time.  I just saw it for the second time  and I know I will buy it when it comes out.  If you have been to Disneyland and have been on the ride, you will love all the sight gags that are placed in the film.  Don't let that stop you thoug, my friend has never been to Disneyland and he almost hurt himself laughing, and he didn't even know there was a corelation.  That's cudos for the creators of the ride in making memeorable and funny images.  I would rate this a must see for most of the family.  Little children could get nightmares from the skeletons and teenagers may think they are too cool to like it.  Other than that, everyone else should love it."
"KatharineFanatic","10","0","1","12 July 2003"," 'There'll be no livin' with her after this.'
","Good swashbucklers just aren't in style anymore. It's been years since a pirate has sailed into the box office and made movie making history. But the applause must go to Disney for this grand achievement which can truly be deemed an 'epic.' Pirates of the Caribbean is in the grand old style of Errol Flynn. Not only are the sword fights grand, the escapes harrowing, and the cast top-notch, but the plot is truly brilliant and the two and a half hour pace never seems to lag. Most viewers will find themselves swept into an adventure unlike any other with a beautiful damsel in distress, a handsome rogue as her rescuer, and a motley crew of bloodthirsty buccaneers to provide the backdrop.<br/><br/>Though the plot may seem fairly cut and dried, the script is actually far more complex than a simple summary might surmise. Full of surprising plot twists, witty dialogue, excellent swordplay, and some truly astonishing CGI battles, Pirates of the Caribbean deserves a sailor's welcome. Much has been made over actor Johnny Depp 'improvising' the character of Jack Sparrow. He really goes out on a limb with his interpretation of a slightly batty, overall likable, and sometimes downright sinister former (perhaps reformed, perhaps not) pirate captain. The thing is, it totally works. His gold-toothed smile, his half-slurred speech, and his 'sea legs on land' stride never fails to engage a laugh. His own entrance to the film is particularly memorable, one of the movie's best comic moments.<br/><br/>This is one of the most stunningly visual movies I've ever seen. The costuming was beautiful, the backdrop romantic, and some of the cinematography, like a pirate ship sailing under a full moon, downright jaw-dropping. This film deserves a number of Oscar nominations for merit alone, and that's not including the excellent performances by Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and British beauty Kiera Knightley. There's enough humor to elevate some of the darker elements, and for once it's eye candy which pays off for the two-plus hours spent in a cramped theatre seat. But a final word of advice for those of ye brave enough to forge these waters... stay until after the closing credits. There's a tantalizing little tidbit which will leave you thirsting for more.."
"nivekj1","10","0","1","14 July 2003"," Yo Ho! Yo Ho! A Pirate's Flick For Me!
","This movie was a burst of concentrated fun, with not a moment wasted. This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Everything about this movie is note-perfect; every character, every nuance, every ship and sail. Bruckheimer and Disney have really outdone themselves (this more than makes up for Pearl Harbor). Johnny Depp's performance is amazing and even funnier than his Ichabod Crane from Sleepy Hollow. Orlando Bloom does a great job in his first major non-Legolas role. Keira Knightly does fine, and so does Geoffrey Rush and the other cast; I could go on and on. The writing (and even ad-libbing) is great, as is Gore Verbinski's direction. This beats Cutthroat Island, Treasure Planet, Sinbad, every recent pirate/ sea-adventure movie out there. Why, this is the best pirate movie I've seen since The Goonies, and that's saying something. If you haven't seen this movie, then what are you waiting for? Or should I say, ""Arrr! What are ye waiting for?"" Drink up, me 'arties, yo ho!"
"Busby1013","10","0","1","12 July 2003"," ""Welcome to the Caribbean!""
","And the award for yummiest summertime (or any other time) movie pairing goes to Pirates of the Caribbean... Thank God for manipulating the Hollywood heavens into that delicious Johnny Depp-Orlando Bloom star alignment. I bow to whomever dreamt up such a  wonderful casting concept. It only took half a summer for the unveiling of the most jaw-droppingly delightful cinematic fetish duo since Brad Pitt and George Clooney in Ocean's Eleven. The hotness of this film rivals the July heat, with a man-sweaty humidity to make it all the hotter.<br/><br/>In addition to my initial raging female hormone-induced reaction, I felt the adrenaline level become equally high. The high seas action/adventure doesn't get any more fun, thrilling or chilling than this... at least not in the PG-13 category... scratch that, it is awesome for any category. Sword fights and cannon blasts and walking talking skeletons oh my! The plot was more existent than that of Charlie's Angels and more realistic (ironically), which is a nice change from the general summer offerings. As usual, Bruckheimer spared no expense in transporting his actors and audience into the era of the pirate-run Caribbean. Cute references to the Disney ride and goofy, surly, yet sexy quips from good ol' Johnny top off the whole experience with sardonic spice.<br/><br/>
Two things come to mind upon leaving the theatre: How hot the boys are (duh) and the Freudian desire to BE Jack Sparrow. I want long black hair and dreads with beads and charms hangin' on 'em. I want a blade and a pistol, big leather boots, dark waterproof eyeliner, and a trident hat that's seen one too many battles and trips to Tortuga. I want to swing from ropes and climb on fallen masts, I want to sing YO HO! YO HO! and drink bottles upon bottles of rum on the beach of a deserted island. Unfortunately, in my case, all this would entail some major costuming, props and sex-change surgery.<br/><br/>I should probably just buy the video game ;)<br/><br/>This exciting and fresh foray into the classic cult pirate genre garners nine out of ten stars... savvy?"
"randall2","10","0","1","12 July 2003"," Great Entertainment!
","I've always been a sucker for a swashbuckling pirate tale, and have probably seen every one made. This one did not disappoint! Johnny Depp's Captain Jack was quirky and brilliant. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley played off his madness perfectly. Of course the plot had all of the expected elements ... damsel in distress, unacceptable suitor, nasty pirate with a conscience, incompetent naval officers ... but the cast made it all seem fresh, and the pace kept me captivated until the end. This movie is fun!"

After seeing the trailers with skeletons walking around trying to act scary and Keira Knightley saying ""like pain, try wearing a corset!"" I expected to be walking into a bad movie. As soon as Johnny Depp hits the screen the movie became good. His character was funny and entertaining and of course he ""is the best pirate i have ever seen."" Knightley's stupid line was explained before hand so it really wasn't that bad but a couple of things i thought could be improved were that Orlando Blooms character was a wuss and i expected much more (after all he is legolas) and the movie was really long. It didnt really lose your interest, its just that they could have chopped 30 minutes off of it. Not really big complaints and definatly worth the 7 dollars to see it"

","Yes, the menfolk are comely (I'm partial to Mr. Rush, myself), but run out tonight and see this one for the glorious good time. I haven't had so much fun at the movies in ages.<br/><br/>The casting is stand-up-and-applaudable, the action never once loses its rhythm, and the visuals are immersive and convincing. (Those who fear trigger-happy CGI effects, worry not. They're absolutely seamless and breathtaking, just like they're supposed to be.)<br/><br/>I was a little wary because I'm a big fan of the park attraction. The trailers seemed to be working against the ride, making the pirates seem pure villains and, worse, the female lead a contrived character created to reverse the auction scene that has bothered overly-PC park visitors for so long. I refuse to give away anything other than to say I was wrong to fret.<br/><br/>There were plenty of children in the cinema around me. None seemed troubled by the film, but keep in mind that those skeleton scenes are very realistic. (Also keep in mind that children who cannot reliably speak quietly in the cinema need to be left at home. Please don't break the mood of this wonderful film for the rest of us just because you either can't find a babysitter or have an unfortunate entitlement mentality. Grr. Arrrr.)<br/><br/>Oh, and if someone hasn't mentioned it yet (I'm sure they have), you need to stay all the way through the long, long credits. Nothing spectacular happens, but you will need to see the end-bit to fully discuss the film.<br/><br/>The best pirate movie ever. Ever. (And if there's a twelveplex in the next life, I know Graham Chapman forgives me and agrees.)"
"d_fairchild","9","0","1","12 July 2003"," One of the best pirate movies I've seen, but...
","On the surface, it's innocent enough.  (Capt.) Jack Sparrow is a likeable, although a bit fruity, pirate.  Orlando Bloom makes a wonderful breakaway from the LOTR saga, and Keira Knightly swoons with the best.  The problem? It's just a wee bit long in the tooth.  Eye candy like the ghastly special effects and great scenery notwithstanding, the entire last half hour could have been 10 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Other than that, I would highly recommend seeing this movie.  The history is dealt out in small parcels along the length of the movie, allowing you to digest each bit without giving too much away.  There is enough doing without explaining to make the movie a bit more intelligent than then industry standard would normally allow, and the sword fighting is reminiscent of black and white film. (A good thing)<br/><br/>Just remember: Commodore isn't a royal navy rank.  It's a temporary title given to a Captain in charge of other captains when an Admiral isn't nearby. They should have made the officer in question an Admiral.  It's a small change, but it made me distrust the movie in the first 10 minutes.  They won me back, but it's still dead wrong."

","Okay, so we've been bogged down with a summer of movies that each claim to be ""the end all, be all blockbuster"" or the ""best sequel ever"". However, I think this is easilt the best overall production of the summer. There is not a flaw in it from the writing, to the effects, costumes, or even acting; this is my movie of the year so far! Although running as a close second is Finding Nemo. But this is reality, in a very entertaining way. I spent 2.5 hours in a time warp that felt like 90 minutes. Depp earned his cut with an excellent performance and a great supporting cast, outfitted to the hilt. The story was strong for a summer flick (there were no Aliens losing a planet to humans with Apple computers), and it felt like Disney's flume ride through and through. I rushed to see Matrix, Hulk, Terminator, and sadly enough went to Legally Blonde 2 and Charlies Angels, but nothing has compared to this. All in all, excellent."

"tomkensil","Null","0","1","12 July 2003"," OK, Here is the deal folks...
","I'm 40 years old and am an amatuer authority on pirates, the books on them and pirate movies.  I have seen them all including the original classics. The Golden Era of the 30's and 40's with Errol Flynn are the best, even though they may seem corny to today's younger MTV type audiences. ""Captain Blood"" and ""The Sea Hawk"" are two of the best ever made.<br/><br/>I just got back from seeing this movie.  It's GREAT.  All the other positive comments on why to see this flick by other moviegoers are correct!  It is a very fun pirate flick, and yes, Johnny Depp is the glue that holds it all together.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is the Han Solo of Pirates! I highly recommend this flick to everyone, it gets an A for simply re-energizing a genre that has not been represented correctly in the past few decades and has sort of eroded.  Well, welcome back the successful pirate movie!<br/><br/>WARNING TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN IT:<br/><br/>However, I do have a few things to say on what is missing.  Yeah, the movie works just like the ride, so that is good.  Kids will love it.  But as a high seas adventure it kind of lacks.  Watching crews in their Tall Ships on the open ocean requires moments of working the ship and sailing it and exploring what is out there on the high seas.  I'm talking about what it is like to feel the sense of adventure, the feeling of hearing the wind blow, the masts creak in the wind.  The feeling like you are on a moving pirate ship at sea and the captain is thinking and planning and being on the lookout for the enemy.  You can almost smell the salty air. A good example of this feeling is in Moby Dick starring Gregory Peck. This requires segments of navigation and a certain calmness of the open ocean so the MOOD is set for the action to come.  This never happens in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".  To much of the movie is like a car chase at high speeds, not wind driven ocean going vessels trying to get into position to confront each other.  Also, instead of all these pirates and skeletons sword-fighting all at once, they should concentrate on more one on one battles so we can appreciate each fight's outcome better. (see Ray Harryhausen's ""Jason and the Argonauts"") Sometimes, it is so laden with action and confusion, we miss the benefit of the whole point of why the scenes are filmed in the first place.  Also, more daytime seafaring and scenery would have made it better. MTV-ers might love it the way it is, but check out ""The Sea Hawk"" and tell me which movie gives you the better impression and feeling of what it might have been like for the days of pirates that we are so facinated with.<br/><br/>
Anyway, I know it's just a movie based on a the best Disneyland ride ever. Is it a great ride?  Yes.  Does it do what it is supposed to do, Entertain about pirates? Yes.<br/><br/>I wanted SOOOOO much for this movie to succeed.  It did.  Thanks to Johnny Depp keeping it glued together with his remarkable, interesting and strange performance.  Without him though, I might had been hugely disappointed."

Orlando Bloom displayed his terrific onscreen presence as Will Turner, and Keira Knightley was perfect as the not-so damsel in distress Elizabeth.

Johnny Depp shows in this moive that he is an actor that can play anything, as he plays one of greatest charecters of all time, Catpain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom(Legolas in LOTR),as William Tunner, did very good in this moive, but his performance was kind of put away by Depp's amazing performance. Keira Knightley(from Bend it Like Beckham), as Elizabeth Swann, acting was good too, but like Bloom, Depp's performance just made her performance look like nothing. Geoffrey Rush play an excellent villian in the movie. Aside from the acting, the movie was just fun to watch. It wasn't a moive that was trying to be everything by having philosohy, action, comedy, drama, etc. It was a movie that was just fun to watch, and the greatest thing was that it was fun to watch for all ages. The movie was a bit longer than i expected, running around 140 min.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this moive a 10/10.

","(possible spoilers)<br/><br/>I believe that Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that should gain attention, and I definately am telling you to go see it if you have not already. This movie is excellent, and it never ceases to slow down and get dull.<br/><br/>One thing that simply amazed me, was what seemed to be a love story in the beginning, stayed pretty much out of the movie. The plot was incredible. It never stopped to thrill me. Surprising enough, they even included the scenes from the ride Pirates of the Caribbean (I was just in FL, so I remember it well). The movie had great comedy, and awesome visual effects.<br/><br/>I believe that if someone else than Johnny Depp played the role of Captian Jack Sparrow, then this movie would have only been a big sellout, if it was, to Orlando Bloom Fan girls. Depp portrays a pirate who has an incredible history for being a great pirate, and his troubles seem him drunk the entire movie. But it is the character's movements when he is speaking that really can show a personality. The way he moved his hands is what I am talking about. Yes, Orlando Bloom, did fine in the movie, as well as Kiara ? and Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>(SPOILER) One thing that gets to me is why wouldn't Bootstrap Bill be alive? Because he should have gotten the curse also when they stole the gold. (he stole it and gave it to Will Turner, his son).

","I  viewed this film with our 12 year old son July 10.  I was a bit dubious about the fighting and skeletons but  he handled  all the action just fine.  It's a fun film with beautiful cinematography and costumes.  It's also 2 1/2 hours - so get the big sack of popcorn!  I would not recommend this for children under 10 years old, it has some scary scenes with those skeletons and stormy seas.  Our son, when he was 9, was very frightened when we rented Titanic because of all the flooding.  I'm a Geoffrey Rush fan and he was great but I have to agree with everyone - Johnny Depp stole the show by his charisma, not  fighting abilities.  There's a great duel scene in here, too.  The leading lady does a fine job for her part - she just needed to be a bit feistier.  Thank you."

","It takes a pretty good movie for me to spend $9.50 per person twice in one weekend.  But for this movie, I'd even do it again.  Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl has action, comedy, romance, swordfighting, swashbuckling, drunken brawls, and some really great lines. <br/><br/>
But while the movie itself is fun and has great special effects, its crowning glory is Depp's portrayal of Capt. Jack Sparrow.  His wry comments and sheer panache provide some of the most memorable and hilarious moments in the film.  And the mannerisms he adopts make Jack even more priceless, from the constant swaying walk of a man too long at sea to his facial expressions, which even without dialogue provoke laughter. As far as I'm concerned, Depp's Sparrow goes onto my list of the all-time best characters in film, with the likes of Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham, Mandy Patinkin's Inigo Montoya, and Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector.<br/><br/>I can safely say that I'll be at the store to pick up the DVD when it comes out, and hitting the theater again for a sequel is a definite yes."

","Since May, it has seemed as if 2003 was going to be just a run of the mill summer full of so-so sequels, average action movies, and very little of anything to look back on.  In total, it may still turn out that way, but thanks to Finding Nemo from Disney/Pixar and now Pirates of the Caribbean from Disney, there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel.  They not only broke the mold by giving us a Pirate movie of all things, they gave us a Pirate Movie that is exciting, humorous, adventurous, suspense filled, and filled with excellent performances all the way around.  It is one heck of a good time at the movies.  Pirates of the Caribbean is everything that Cutthroat Island wish it could have been, but didn't even come close to realizing.  Renny Harlin and Geena Davis, eat your hearts out.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it.  From the moment he steps onto the dock as Jack Sparrow, this is Johnny Depp's film.  Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who wants to regain his ship from the evil Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush).  In order to do so, he is forced to join forces with Will Turner (played by Orlando Bloom)to rescue the girl Will is sweet on, Elizabeth Swann (played by Keira Knightly).  Depp's characterization of Sparrow is so memorable, that even when he isn't on the screen you are thinking about him.   All the actors are excellent in their roles, with high marks all the way around.  Keira Knightly shows more then just a feminine side in Elizabeth Swann, Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa is just evil enough to make a good villain, yet not so menacing as to bog the picture down. Orlando Bloom has the thankless role of playing the mostly straight arrow good guy, but he does it well, playing the part as it should be while knowing full well that doing so makes this Depp's film.  That is not an easy thing to do in any film.<br/><br/>The battle sequences and sword fights are staged to perfection by Gore Verbinski.  They are never confusing, even when there is a screen full of pirates having a bit of swordplay.  Though the movie is a bit long, you never think about it as Verbinski keeps his film paced just right, while at the same time letting you get to know all you need to know about his characters.<br/><br/>A movie based on a Disneyland ride could just never work, and a Pirate Movie at that.  That's what I and many others thought before seeing Pirates of the Caribbean. I hereby, eat one heck of a lot of hay, and am very happy to do so.<br/><br/>Next Class Please"

"Juansmith","8","0","1","13 July 2003"," A Pirate's Life For Me...
","When I first heard this film touted as ""the most violent Disney film ever made"", I wasn't quite certain what to expect. The trailers seemed to combine the adult appeal of such big names as producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski with the childish whimsy of an extended, ""Spy Kids 2""-esque title and the always kid-friendly Disney logo. While I expected a decent popcorn flick, I was still worried this would simply be a mutinous attempt to make a grab for the collective treasure of the preteen through adult market.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, it was a skilled combination of these seemingly mutually exclusive elements that made this film work. For a film so reliant on visual effects, care was taken that they not be the focus of the film. A decent (if simplistic) kidnapping plot expands to an epic tale of cursed pirates. A surprising amount of Disney humor is woven with non-stop action sequences and dazzling CG effects. The pirate-to-skeleton transitions are done masterfully, proving this yet another beautifully laid notch on the belt of ILM.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom plays his underwritten part decently, despite clearly expending less effort than his co-star Johnny Depp as the flamboyant Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush could not be more compelling as the treacherous Captain Barbossa, and Kiera Knightley shines in a mildly stereotypical damsel-in-distress-turned-heroine role.<br/><br/>Verbinski's direction continues to impress. This skillful director of ""The Ring"" is just beginning what will hopefully be an illustrious career.<br/><br/>

","This is a ""good fun for the family"" movie, if you prefer your adventure soft boiled. I can't quite decide whether Johhny Depp makes the movie better or worse. Without him it would certainly have been drearier, but with him it takes the movie from adventure to amusement park ride. He plays a scalawag pirate who is more of a swish, than swash, buckler. He teeters rather than swaggers, bombs out with the ladies, and never shows us any of the skills of a former Pirate Captain. <br/><br/>He's the modern androgynous anti hero we've had to put up with since ""real men"" departed the movies.<br/><br/>Geoffery Rush on the other hand is the anchor that holds this flimsy vehicle down. He is plays evil properly: with cold amusement, and a solid sense of his own superiority. He adds just the right trace of despair at his condition, and avoids all of Depp's silly stereotypical ""Pirate"" babble. A more ironic Director would have allowed him to escape his formulaic ending.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie doesn't know how to take itself seriously, when that is required, preferring to trot in a comedy relief duo when no such relief is required, and to insist on allowing Depp's character to stay dizzily in character, when I, for one, desperately wanted him to show some passion."
"mcgrew","4","0","3","13 July 2003"," Great movie, except for Johnny
","This movie could have been absolutely fantastic, except for one thing -- Johnny Depp's unfortunate choice of playing Jack Sparrow as a drunken, mumbling git. The movie (though a bit long), is great fun, with swordplay, gunplay, zombies, cannons, and witty dialog -- this last spoiled in part by Depp's insistence on mumbling all his lines. Although apologists say that the character was supposed to be crazy with the sun (for an incident we later learn was only 3 days long, and well-provisioned at that), it seems to me that it was just a completely bad choice of characterization. Better by far to have picked as a model the Burt Lancaster portrayal of Captain Vallo ""The Crimson Pirate"" (1952 -- as I suspect the writer intended -- ""Vallo"" --> ""Sparrow""). In that movie, Lancaster was perhaps the ultimate ""Ha-HA!"" character, with the same winking- at-the-audience kind of verve that the Jack Sparrow character sort of had. <br/><br/>(Indeed, the walking-the-boat-across-the-bottom scene is right out of ""Crimson Pirate"", along with the generally acrobatic ship scenes.) This and various plot holes (which involve massive spoilers, so I'll leave them out) took a possibly great movie, and made it a so-so experience for me..."

Pirates tells the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and the blacksmith Turner (Orlando Bloom) in thier attempts to rescue Turner's love Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) from the lawless pirates lead by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). The special effects are excellent and the plot is simple enough to follow along nicely. Sword fighting, cannon booming, and pirate snarling are just a few tacts used in the fighting scenes.  Longer than it had to be (cough...like the Hulk) but has enough humor to get you your moneys worth. Rush is great as the demented Barbossa, as is Bloom as the heroine Turner.

","""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a sun-drenched pirate adventure story of the second tier which combines with first rate special effects and engaged acting to create a very entertaining movie- one certain to be included among movie ""classics"". Employing many of the usual pirate movie themes and locales, (and, if you look closely enough, incorporating several very carefully reconstructed scenes from the eponymous Disneyland ride) ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" reproduces storms at sea, broadside fussilades and deck to deck combat with thoroughly updated techniques and technology which is truly a pleasure to behold- assuming you like movies with such plot necessities in the first place.  It reminded me of the old movies I used to watch on Saturday or Sunday afternoons when I was growing up (I am in my mid-forties), but improved 1000% in terms of special effects and technological prowess. I have never really understood the aura enjoyed by Johnny Depp, but he is actually quite entertaining in the role of the erstwhile pirate captain trying to take revenge against his mutinous shipmates and regain his ship (The Black Pearl).  In interviews he has proclaimed that his inspiration for the character was Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones.  (Perhaps he channels this role too well, as at times Captain Sparrow seems a bit too much like a stumbling, addled-brained junkie).  The girl from ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is quite good (and very fetching) as the mandatory high official's daughter kidnapped by the fearsome (and cursed) pirate band, and Orlando Bloom, plays the role of the honorable hero who tries to save her, very convincingly. As a boy, a favorite scene in a favorite movie of mine was when in ""Jason and the Argonaughts"" Jason and his crew fought the skeletons of the men killed by the Hydra.  This scene is also similar to some of the battles in Brandon Fraser's ""Mummy"" films.  The cursed pirate crew of the Black Pearl appear in skeleton form under moonlight, and move in and out of their ""real"" appearance with astonishing ease and ""realism"".  It is truly an inspired and brilliant piece of CGI, and really makes the movie. The story is sound, with a few interesting plot twists, though the film may drag a bit towards the end, and wrap things up somewhat unconvincingly.  All told, however, even if dead men tell no tales, this is a really good movie (though maybe a bit too scary for small children) and well worth a few pieces of eight."

","For some reason, I've never liked Johnny Depp. Ever since I saw him die in A Nightmare on Elm Street and I was glad, I wasn't a Depp fan. However, as Captain Jack Sparrow, not only is he able to deliver snappy one-liners, he proves to BE the movie. If it wasn't for Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl wouldn't have a tongue-in-cheek feel; it would just seem like it was a serious pirate movie, which, by Jove, it isn't. There's nothing in it that's remotely bound to happen.<br/><br/>The story, which was based on a Disney World ride, has Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, aka the hot girl from Bend it Like Beckham) with a golden medallion, and bloodthirsty pirates come to kidnap her for it. If regular `yo-ho-ho' pirates weren't enough, they're zombie/ghost/skeleton pirates that cannot be killed. However, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, who was added into this movie just so teenage girls would see it and swoon over him), who's smitten with her, tries to rescue her with the help of Cpt. Jack Sparrow (Depp). Soon they're in way over their head.<br/><br/>As the previews for this movie started to come out, I had my doubts. I thought that this was going to be the worst movie of the summer, with a plot more contrived that Anger Management. Zombie pirates? Ech. Also, my grudge against Johnny Depp held me back. However, after hearing mainly positive reviews, and learning that Depp was actually good, I thought that I'd give it a try. And it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's not a piece of art, but it's a movie I wouldn't mind seeing again.<br/><br/>The plot is, frankly, really stupid. Like most movies of the summer, they focus too much on having a plot instead of having two hours of rollicking fun. However, Pirates of the Caribbean tries to have a real deep, moving plot, while it suffers with it. It bogs down the fun that we could be having. Also, while all of the fight scenes were pretty good, there were too many√Ç‚Ä¶not to say boring, but not exciting scenes.<br/><br/>Depp was pretty funny, but he also proved himself to be a welcome screen presence. I found myself amazed to actually be WANTING more Depp. If you've seen any trailers for Pirates of the Caribbean, which I think everyone in the country has, you know what he'll be like. However, I must object to the casting of Bloom. Just because he can be considered easy on the eyes doesn't make him a good actor, and he isn't. Every time he was onscreen, I was waiting for him to leave so Depp can do more onscreen. However, Gore `The Ring' Verbinski thought that somehow he wouldn't receive as much money if the reason half of the audience went to the theater wasn't on screen a lot, so in about every place, Orlando Bloom is on screen. Knightley, who was billed fourth and had the most screen time, was pretty good, but I think that she should stick to comedy.<br/><br/>Even if you hate Disney (as I do), you'll be able to find something to like about the first PG-13 `straight Disney' film, whether it be the tongue-in-cheek humor, the few good swashbuckling scenes, or the horrible plot.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for action/adventure violence."

Original story, solid plot, solid action, amazing effects that fit, great dialogue.<br/><br/>Depp's pirate makes the movie. He is one of those few actors who can play any role (or maybe one of the few who get the chance to try). Rush plays an excellent villain, and gets some of the best lines. Bloom and his love interest play more stock adventure characters.<br/><br/>It's not for the younger set. It's dark, violent in spots, and a lot of people get skewered, including ""good"" guys. My 8 year old loved it but he was scared in several scenes, and he doesn't scare easily. It ends with a good message and warm feelings though."

","The Summer of 2003 will be known as the ""Summer of Sequels"", so when a non-sequel comes out, you're curious. It is also ""the action packed"" summer with so many action- type films, they may all start to look alike before labor day, when the Summer Movie fare ends. <br/><br/>So what can you do when you've seen ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Matrix Reloaded"", ""T3"", ""Tomb Raider 2"", ""Bad Boys 2"", etc., etc more than enough times and want to be entertained.<br/><br/>You go see this. This has something for everyone. Some may complain it doesn't have ENOUGH of what THEY wish to see in a film, but being that this is geared for a PG audience, don't go in expecting ""R"" rated fare.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a Disney movie, make NO mistake. But it does have a little edge above the traditional Disney ""sappiness"". <br/><br/>There's action...but not excessive. There's scares...but not excessive. There's beauty...but not excessive. There's a love story...but not excessive. There is battle...but not excessive. There is blood...but not excessive. There are dirty, scummy Pirates...but not excessive.<br/><br/>Which is why this movie is delightful and entertaining. Children 7 to 10 will love this. Children 2 to 6...well you know your kids, if they cringe at images and have nightmares at scary things, don't take them! You go see it FIRST, then make the call for your own child.<br/><br/>For 'tweens', they will like this film for the plucky heroine and handsome guys. For 'teens'-- so may they. Young Adults will laugh and enjoy themselves and Parents will be able to sit through a film WITH their children (and you know this summer there aren't too many of those films out there!) and have be entertained. It's that kind of film and in this Summer of Re-runs...very refreshing.<br/><br/>Ladies -- will love Johnny Depp, Tweens and Teens will Love Orlando Bloom...and Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Guys will love Ms. Knightley.<br/><br/>And what everyone is saying is very important, Johnny Depp steals this film. You'll just love him in this from the first moments he arrives on screen until the end. (The Oscar folks wont nominate him, but you just wish they would -- yes, he's that good here.)<br/><br/>Special Effects fans will love the special effects but remember this is NOT a Special Effects film, so don't look for alot of it.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is alot of fun and does a great job as the bad Pirate.<br/><br/>This film is over 2 hours so be prepared. (For how much they charge for films nowadays, 2 hours will just about give you your money's worth.)<br/><br/>So remember, this is a fun 'Pirates' film (finally!!!) with the Disney touch, that the majority of folks can find something in it and really like. I know I did.<br/><br/>Go see it especially if you just wanta be entertained and enjoy a film this summer. It will be worth it!"

","Theres not much to complain about with the Pirates of the Caribbean. I know that if I were involved with this film, I would be very proud of the final product. The costumes and make-up should deserve Oscar recognition along with Johnny Depps performance which has always been overlooked by Hollywood. The only complaint I have is that they should have trimmed about 10 minutes from it as I thought some scenes weren't necessary and seemed to only drag the movie down. Its refreshing to see that Disney can still make a good movie without relying on cute animals and a Phil Collins soundtrack."

Not so with this movie.  By far and away, this was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Very, very entertaining.  It was funny, scary, exciting, and mysterious all at the same time.  Johnny Depp has become one of the best actors in Hollywood.  I remember him from ""21 Jump Street"" and it's been wonderful seeing him grow as an actor.  As far as Orlando Bloom goes, he was great in ""The Lord of the Rings"" but even better in this movie.  He made a great leading man and I look forward to seeing him in many more films.  I hope they make a sequel. Great fun and a great ride."

","I'm surprised at the great reviews this movie is getting on the IMDB since it's definitely not a great movie.  It's overlong, has an extremely weak ending, even by Hollywood standards, and boasts action sequences that are, to put it charitably, not particularly well-directed.  In fact Cutthroat Island for all it's flaws had far superior action sequences.  The only thing that really makes this movie better than this Summer's other Hollywood blow 'em up crap like Charlie's Angels Full Throttle and Terminator 3 is Johnny Depp.  He brings great humor and eccentricity to every scene he is in and single handedly makes this pirate movie a hoot.

","I hate Disney movies, Jerry Bruckheimer, and summer blockbusters. But the reviews of Johnny Depp in the film got my butt to the theatre, and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Occasionally, the movie gets into predictable ruts that are annoying, but most of the time the action is fast paced, the one-liners are zingy, and the acting is top notch. <br/><br/>The film is full of cliches, especially Love Conquers All, but for once they work. <br/><br/>This film almost ranks with Raiders of the Lost Ark and Spiderman -- it would be up there but for the emphasis on some bit part actors for comic relief that dragged the pace down. <br/><br/>The score, as for all Jerry movies, is overly frenetic, but it steers clear of bombastic.<br/><br/>Depp is certainly the highlight -- don't be surprised if you feel an urge to rent a bunch of Depp movies after this. Be sure to see Chocolat if you haven't seen it yet. <br/><br/>But Bloom is not quite as lame as some have painted. He does what he can with a fairly drab romantic leading man role, and I'm sure all the 12-year-old girls in the theatre were enjoying his big brown eyes as he gazed yearningly at Keira Knightley [who puts in a perky perfomance]. Here's hoping Orlando gets a role where he doesn't have to wear funny clothes and carry a sword!"
"dramalove","10","0","1","10 July 2003"," A true summer flick.
","In my mind a summer ""flick"" is full of action, has a great cast that keeps your eyes glued to the screen and makes my sides hurt. POTC delivers all that and more. While this movie may be looked down upon by the educated elite as being mere fluff, I think, ""what's wrong with fluff?"" POTC doesn't proclaim itself to be a film that will change your life or draw attention to the plight of the poor endangered pirate parrots. It is what it is. A great movie to go and escape from life too. Johnny Depp delivers yet another memorable performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. From the moment we first see him atop the mast surveying his domain right through till the credits roll, Depp captures your attention with his swaggering brazenness and lopsided smile. Depp commands attention, but is equally willing to share the spotlight with  Orlando Bloom who plays the endearing orphan, Will Turner. The only thing Bloom's character has in common with his LOTR Legolas is they are both good with their swords. Bloom shows great versatility in going from the stoic Legolas to the endearing Turner. This film is as funny as it is packed with action. In fact it was quite a bit funnier than I thought it would be. The entire cast fit together so perfectly from the devil-may-care Sparrow to the stick-up-his-bum Norrington(played to the hilt by Jack Davenport.) Keira Knightly was exquisite as the not-so-typical damsel in distress. Knightly kept up with the men and showed herself to be their equal in every way. If you are looking for a night of funny quips and flashing sword tips, go see this film. If you want to contemplate the meaning of life, go home and read Shakespeare."

","I saw Pirates of the Caribbean on opening day for two reasons: the boys, and Gore Verbinski. As for the boys, Pirates delivered in full.  Johnny Depp added sex appeal, spirit, and above all humor to Captain Jack Sparrow. He pulled off the sort of acting job that is expected from this well rounded actor and gave the movie a little zip.  He carried the show through his delivery of zesty one-liners and never-ending supply of wit.  Orlando bloom also did an excellent job as further acting eye candy but the character left a little more to be desired.  He was missing a lot of (for lack of a better word) presence when juxtaposed next to the insatiable Jack Sparrow. And as for Gore Verbinski, bravo.  The movie was a blast to watch from beginning to end. Along with them, good special effects, and a surprisingly nice job from Kiera Knightly, Pirates of the Caribbean was certainly entertaining and well worth matinee prices.

"Fury629","10","0","1","10 July 2003"," An amazing film for everyone except annoying nitpickers
","Pirates of the Caribbean (PotC) is an exceptional film unique in our film scene today.  Not only have pirate films not been common since the days of Errol Flynn, but as others have put it, they portray leads that have a mixed standing in America; half hero, half villain.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is exceptional in PotC as Captain Jack Sparrow, playing a rather cunning, if down on luck pirate in the eyes of both the British guard and amongst his fellow pirates.  He provides much comic relief with his laid back swagger and in-conversation wise cracks.  He does his good pirate/bad pirate thing well, and when Orlando Bloom is asked whose side he's on, Bloom tells it like it is; ""Ours... for now.""<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom and his love interest Keira Knightley, daughter of the Governor, fit their roles well as a rather scrawny blacksmith and well versed swordsman and very slightly tomboyish young lady with agendas different from her father's, respectively.  Bloom and Depp have pretty decent and sometimes funny chemistry when interacting, and the more romantic scenes between Knightley and Bloom are a cut above the rest.<br/><br/>Where PotC also shines is in the visuals.  The pirate/skeleton changing due to the exposure to certain kinds of light is flawless, and will most definitely get at least an Oscar nomination, if not the statuette.  The fight scenes, consisting mostly of sword duels and intra-ship cannon warfare, are well done and look very realistic, even in scenes between the evil skeleton pirates and the protagonists.  The imagery back on Bloom's home island of the British redcoats, old cobblestone streets and the moorings on the coast are also very well done.<br/><br/>Some homages are paid to the ride in Disneyworld, but this isn't just some kiddie-park ride.  Everyone can enjoy this movie, except for some nitpickers; with most period pieces and movies in general, they can find inaccuracies.  But if you find some, don't despair; the movie is definitely worth seeing."

But I had faith in Depp, because he is in so many wonderful, quirky movies, and damn, he didn't let me down! Depp owns this movie. He was so funny and heartfelt and wild. I'm almost positive they'll make a sequel to this movie because Depp's Cpt. Sparrow is going to be so widely loved. Although I found Bloom and Knightley a little bland, the rest of the cast was super. Geoffrey Rush was excellent, somewhat reminiscent of his Sade in ""Quills,"" which I loved. I didn't think the CGI was overkill at all. The skeletal pirates were awesome, but I most enjoyed the ship battles and swinging from the rigging stuff. Great fight choreography, beautiful settings and costumes. Again, esp. on Depp whose dreads, braids, gold teeth, and kohl-rimmed eyes is enough to make girls (corset-wearing or not) swoon.

"FargoUT","9","0","1","11 July 2003"," Johnny Depp and a bunch of other people...
","Well, I'll be.  When I first heard about a movie being filmed based on a Disney World ride, all I could imagine was standing in long lines only to be bored for 15-minutes (in this case, 2+ hours).  But I should have taken a look at the pedigree involved.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski, hot off his hit ""The Ring"" (which I was so-so on), impressed me with ""The Mexican"", a quirky unusual romantic comedy that struck a chord with me.  Johnny Depp, an actor who is entirely particular with his movie role choices, appears as Captain Jack Sparrow.  These two things alone should have made me take notice--but with the Disney studio overseeing the film's production, I expected ""The Country Bears"".  What I got instead is one of the best films I've seen all year.<br/><br/>With a well-written script, ""PotC"" becomes that rare summer movie we all hope for: smart, exciting, but never serious enough to spoil the fun.  The cast is mostly to commend for this, I suspect.  Orlando Bloom, hot property thanks to his performance as Legolas in ""Lord of the Rings"", makes a commanding lead, a star in the making.  While his turn as Legolas made him well-known amongst fans, he has a far larger role here, and manages to make his hero into something more than a bland male lead.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley, along with Claire Danes in ""Terminator 3"", creates one of the few strong female heroes that audiences want in action films.  While it isn't a great performance, it suits the film extremely well.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush was born to be a pirate, with a great look and a mixture of comedy and dead seriousness.  He does a very good job and commands the screen whenever he's front and center.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Johnny Depp is also usually around.  With one of the greatest performances in movie history, Depp creates Captain Jack Sparrow as one of those movie characters people will dress up to look like at Halloween.  His character is a swishy, slurry mess, yet in full command of his senses, his wits, and his ability to manipulate others to do what he wants.  With limp wrists and a constantly shifting center of gravity, Depp portrays Jack Sparrow as a self-assured, inventive, yet dangerous pirate.  He's a benevolent figure, but sneaky and crafty like the best villains usually are (that he is not a villain speaks to the screenwriters ingenuity).<br/><br/>According to Depp, he decided to form his performance around his good friend Keith Richards.  The resemblance is rather uncanny when you think about it. While there are spectacular set designs, cinematography, special effects, and action scenes, Johnny Depp becomes the film's saving grace--if there is any justice in this world, Oscar will not forget him come nomination day.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinsky has given us an old-fashioned pirate film with updated visual effects.  The effects are practically seamless, with flesh melting to bone and back again with ease (although this brings up a question: if moonlight is merely reflected sunlight, why doesn't sunlight show their true form?). In the grand tradition of Hollywood epics, he entertains us without pandering to us.  It's a stylish, well-crafted film that features some very good performances--and of course, Johnny Depp.  If you had told me a few months ago that ""PotC"" would have an Oscar-worthy performance in it, I probably would have laughed.<br/><br/>All in all, ""PotC"" is a must-see summer film, if just to watch Johnny Depp prance around like he owns every inch of celluloid."

During the final fight between Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush the effects are flawless. But the thing that i enjoyed so much was the humor.  the fact that this movie was not meant to be taken seriously was very appealing.  The two british guards adding the color comedy during the entire movie as well as the two bumbling pirates.  The characters were another huge asset to this movie and Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is probably the best i have seen him in lately.  Geoffery Rush is equally good as the cursed pirate Captain Barbossa and Orlando Bloom is quite good as Will.

","This movie is the epitomy of fun. Smart dialogue, excellent fight scenes and blow-you-mind-animation that is on the same scale, if I dare say, as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, as has been said again and again, praise he is worthy of, steals every scene. His presence, even when he is not the center of attention, is so captivating. ""You forgot one very important thing, mate. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow!""<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom played an excellent handsome love interest. Sometimes, I felt a little tired with his continued forcefulness, but he was very much the slightly naive but determined side kick.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley! A beautiful girl that I hope will have a long career. She acts with grace and conviction.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush was such a fascinating presence, playing Captain Barbossa with finesse. His on-screen presence was nearly as enjoyable as Captain Jack.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone looking to laugh until their sides hurt and leave feeling boyantly revived. Though, it may be a little strong for the younger ones. 10+"

Yes, it's an action flick with moments of lovelorn cheese, but if you're a fan of Johnny Depp's work you'll love it. He's amazing in the role of Jack Sparrow, making a character who in other circumstances you might not like, 100% loveable. Second to Depp is Geoffrey Rush who, frankly, I would watch fight his way out of a paper bag for two hours; he's just that good in everything. He's very good in this as well. If you keep in mind that this movie is supposed to be FUN and that it's based on a DISNEY theme ride, you'll enjoy it very much. CG-wise the ""pirate underwater"" scene is very cool and that's all I'm going to say about that."

In fact, I envy the young kids that get to go home after this film, meet their friends in the backyard and have mock sword fights with any bit of stick they can find.<br/><br/>Although a tid-bit long, this film is what summer movies are all about. You don't need to wow me with a gimmicky end, you dont need to send me into comma as I try to understand what the director was trying to say.....  simply entertain us.

"Talisin","10","0","1","10 July 2003"," Made my summer
","I'm the first person to cheer a movie that successfully enters the realm of ""art"" with deep, fulfilling plots, but when did being simply entertaining become something to apologize for?<br/><br/>POTC succeeds as pure escapist fun on every level possible.  I watched the movie in a theater full of a fairly mixed audience, ranging from around 9-10 to 50, and everyone seemed to have a great time.  Being the parent of an 11-year-old myself, I can say that it's possible that more easily frightened children might have issues, but mine ate it up and wanted to turn right back around and see it again.<br/><br/>Unlike some, I had no problem with the length of the film.  Frankly, any film with a running time over 100 minutes gets a bonus point from me these days, regardless of how terrible it may turn out to be.  Not having a stunted attention span myself, I am generally offended at the idea of paying the same amount for a 90 minute piece of fluff that I would for a 3-hour epic.  I was glad to see that the film was longer, and I barely noticed the time passing at all.<br/><br/>But enough of the soapbox: POTC was funny, exciting, engaging, and just plain enjoyable.  Well worth seeing on the big screen (and worth seeing several times, in my opinion)."

"JAKastner","9","0","1","10 July 2003"," The Moose Hole - Review of Pirates of the Caribbean
","The Walt Disney Company, which has been known for family fun and entertainment, has had moderate success at the box office with their animated films and pre-teen oriented live action films. Unfortunately they have not had the success of franchises like Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. Disney has been so desperate for a hit lately that they have dug not only into their archives and remaking some of their classic films like Freaky Friday but they have attempted to make film versions of their famous Disneyland attractions. Their first attempt at making the cross over from attraction to film, The Country Bears, was an embarrassment. The film barely (pardon the pun) pulled in $16 million in its entire run against a production budget of $20 million. Not only was the film a financial failure but a critical one as well. The studio hopes to bounce back from that failure with the film version of Pirates of the Caribbean. Pirates is helmed by Gore Verbinski, director of the horror hit The Ring, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Not only that but it stars Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp with special effects created by Industrial Light and Magic. How could it fail? Quite easily. The film is about pirates and pirates have been deemed box office poison for years. Look at Disney's Treasure Planet as a most recent example. So can the good aspects out weigh the bad and break the pirate curse or will all this `yo ho, ho' be just a `bottle of rum'?<br/><br/>The story follows the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who seems to be low on his luck. It all started when he crew created mutiny on his ship nearly ten years ago and left him deserted on an island in the middle of the Caribbean. Ever since then he has been moving from place to place searching for the Black Pearl. It is just by coincidence that he is captured on the same island where the last piece of cursed treasure is located. What cursed treasure? The treasure of Cortez that was stolen by the crew, lead by Captain Barbossa, that mutinied nearly ten years ago. The problem is that treasure was cursed and unless the treasure is returned, these men will be the living undead. They will turn into skeletons at night but look human in the daylight. They will also be unable to eat, drink, sleep, or even feel until the curse is broken. WillTurner, a blacksmith of the town, joins with Captain Jack after Barbossa and his crew kidnaps his true love, Elizabeth Turner. But there are more mysterious reasons for Turner to follow the Black Pearl that involve Captain Jack Sparrow as well. The story for The Curse of the Black Pearl is an exciting one though there are many holes in it. Those holes always seem to appear in the scripts of Bruckheimer films, so this film seems to be no different. It is best just to ignore those holes in the plot and sit back to enjoy a great action flick. One has to admit, though, that the dialogue within the film was much more serious then previous Bruckheimer films which indicate he is learning to mature his film making.<br/><br/>The cast for Pirates of the Caribbean is very well put together. Johnny Depp, who has worked on Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands, is probably the best feature of the film outside the special effects. Depp makes the role of Captain Jack Sparrow his very own and presents a style to him that makes you want to trust him but knowing he is a pirate tells you to be wary. The comedic timing presented Depp is absolutely perfect and works very well in every scene he is in. Depp performs so well that you feel an emotional connection to him that makes the ending all the more intense. Orlando Bloom, who is best known for his role in The Lord of the Rings series, does a good job as Will Turner. There are still some questions about the character that remain unanswered at the end of the film but that has more to do with the script then with Bloom's performance. Geoffrey Rush is absolutely devilish as Captain Barbossa. He presents a style that is both charming and creepy at the same time, which works exceedingly well in this film. Keira Knightly, who had a breakout role in Bend It like Beckham, does a wonderful job as Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter who is much tougher then most would think. The remainder of the cast is perfect for the most part. The only role that seems out of place is Governor Swann, played by Jonathan Pryce. There just seemed to be too little of the character and when the character is shown, he doesn't do anything for the scenes. He is just a mere distraction that doesn't work very well.<br/><br/>Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is probably one of the best action flicks of the year. There may be a lot of holes in the plot of the story and at moments there may be no point to certain sword fights, but that doesn't seem to matter at all. The special effects, created by Industrial Light and Magic, are the most amazing CGI work that has been seen in quite awhile. The skeletons look absolutely astounding and look even better in the final fight sequence of the film. The musical score for the picture is very original and works so well. Altogether everything seems to come together for the film and presents a delightful action flick that is so rare these days. There were very few problems for the film. The only one that can be thought of right away is the time length. At a time of two hours and twenty minutes, the film seems a bit too longer for the audience that it is intended for but that is a small squabble compared to overall effect of the film. Not a theatrical classic but an out and out good popcorn action flick for the whole family.<br/><br/>My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5 (Grade: A)"
"chris123","10","0","1","10 July 2003"," cool and entertaining
","Okay, I have been waiting to see this movie forever(being Orlando Bloom fan and a blow-them-up movie fan), but it truly surpasses my expectations.  I was laughing all the way through the movie, the action sequences are fun and funny at the same time. I've heard some complaints that the movie is long and the action is a bit repetitive after a while, but each fight is actually different, with their own little signatures that makes them enjoyable and funny.<br/><br/>The fight choreography is great, reminescence of Zorro and Princess Bride(not that much of a surprise, since they all share the same choreographer.  Bob Anderson is the greatest=)).  And for some strange reason, some part of the movie also reminded me of Princess Bride(battle of wits).  Frankly, I actually had to engage my brain to follow that bit, which I didn't expect from this action flick.<br/><br/>And as much as I am 'obsessed' with Orlando Bloom, it is Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow that makes this movie great.  Maybe it's just me, but I find everything he does hilarious and likeable.  Anyway, the supporting cast gives solid performances but they all pale in comparison to Depp.<br/><br/>
Orlando Bloom is good as Will(very different from Legolas), but his character doesn't give him that much room for development or a chance to shine(just a normal romantic, straight-forward and noble hero).  Keira Knightley is cool as the feisty and resourceful female lead, but she doesn't quite stand out as much as I first expected, her being the only 'girl' in the group and stuff.  Even Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa seemed a bit lackluster, a villain who's never quite truly evil enough to be the film's major 'bad guy' or nice enough to make people empathize with him.<br/><br/>I paid $11 per ticket(curse online ticket purchasing that charges $1.50 servive fee per ticket), and it's definitely worth the money.  I took my aunt, and she loved it too, saying it's very funny and entertaining.  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it again on my b-day.<br/><br/>
It's just has the right blend of action and humor that sets it apart.  I can't believe I'm saying this for real(as in not because of my obsession with Orlando Bloom), this is my favorite movie of the summer.  I used to rank Finding Nemo first for the humor and X2 right after that for the entertaining action; but this one has it all, humor, action and eye candy(at least for me).  The story is plausible, i.e. I didn't get distracted by it because it has too many internal inconsistencies or is too 'dumb' to believe.  I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>I'm stingent on giving points, so I'll give it a 9/10."

Inspired by the carefree and fun-loving nature of a pirate at rest, 'Pirates' has excellent comedy throughout the movie that accompanies the wonderful action sequences to roll it on with a great pace that always keeps the watcher happy and enjoying the experience with a smile and a laugh. There is, however, no sparing of the viewer from fights of many types and on many venues. The action is inventive, the lines are memorable, and yes, Captain Jack Sparrow makes all of the other actors dance a great dance around his magnificent performance.

The script was well written, the plot actually worked and wasn't just silly, the action was fast and intense but easy to follow which I love, the effects were ASTOUNDING!!!! The love storyline was there but didn't take up much screen time which was great because that's not what the movie is, it's an adventure, not a romance.<br/><br/>But the dialogue was so crisp and Jack Sparrows really made this movie something special. Even without saying anything, just a look or hand gesture worked great, but his spoken words were cutting and extremely delightful. The rest of the cast was also phenomenal, though Depp clearly sticks out as amazing. Bloom did great in his first real lead I've seen and was a perfect straight man for Depp, Knightley surprised me with her abilities and her great screen look. The supporting cast did their job as well.<br/><br/>Overall I gave this movie a 10/10 because I believe it is possibly the most entertaining film I have EVER seen and I have seen many.

"director1616","9","0","1","10 July 2003"," Finally, a Great Swashbuckling Movie!!
","The best thing about ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is that it does THE one thing that seems to be rare in movies today - it actually tells a STORY!  It is a true-blue pirate story - full of pirates, ghosts, treasure, ships battling at sea, etc.  Johnny Depp is brilliant as Captain Jack Sparrow, playing his character with such a uniqueness and abandonment, he is unlike any character ever seen in American films.  Geoffrey Rush's performance as Captain Barbossa is in the stratosphere - he plays his pirate character with such an evil subtleness that he is extremely convincing as a pirate.  But it is the entire cast (including all the secondary quirky characters) that really makes this film.  The screenplay by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio takes the audience where every pirate movie fan wants to go.<br/><br/>   Very impressive is the direction by Gore Verbinski, for the pacing of the film is near-perfect.  He did a wonderful job with the swordfighting scenes - for they are not as overly choreographed as we have seen in recent films, but they have a real touch of reality to every move.  The cinematography of Dariusz Wolski is first-rate, as this movie is visually wonderful to view, as the movie-going audience becomes swept-away into another world.<br/><br/>   ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a movie for everyone.  It may not be a perfect movie, but it's a great swashbuckling movie for the movie-goer who just wants to escape.  Just the performances of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush alone are worth the price of admission.  Young girls seem happy with the addition of Orlando Bloom to the cast, then you add the very elements that pirate fans would want in a movie, you have the perfect ingredients for a wonderful time and experience at the American cinema.  Hollywood should take notice - if a good story is told (and not rely solely on special effects, CGI and/or explosions), then people WILL flock to the theater every week and attendance records would be broken every year."

","I finally know the answer to that hard question: ""what is your favorite movie?"" And know i can proudly answer PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN!!!!!!!!!! I have been waiting for months for this movie, being my favorite ride at Disneyland! I just got back from the theater, opening day of course, i couldn't wait much longer.  I love Johnny Depp and he has turned out another amazing original character! It was such a funny movie, i loved that they incorporated soo much from the ride!!! I was worried that it would slack like COUNTY BEARS. This has everything: comedy, action, adventure, romance, thrills....and an opened ended ending to leave the possiblities for a rumored sequel. Disney did a great job and deserves a pat on the back. hopefully they willl recieve an Oscar for the groovy special effects. I LOVED IT!!!!!! I so want to see it again! and Again!"

","The pirate movie to end all pirate movies.  This one has no pretentions to be anything other than what it is: ideal summer escapism.  Get out of the heat, and set sail with Johnny Depp (the perfect pirate!) for this rollicking, funny, swashbuckling ride.  Geoffrey Rush is splendidly creepy, the film looks great, and all the players are obviously having a ball. Who would've thought a Disney ride could have ever turned into such an entertaining movie??"

","Pirates of the Caribbean was a lot better than I expected it to be. I thought Orlando Bloom did a good job (not great but good) Geoffrey Rush was an excellent bad guy. The best part of this whole movie is Johnny Depp's performance. If you don't like pirates at least go see it for Depp. Everything from his entrance to his fight scenes are done with this certain pizzazz. You can't help but feel good and smile every time he is on the screen. He was perfect for this role and I couldn't see anyone else in it. I think this is the best movie of the summer but I do not recommend this for very small children (too much violence). All in all a great movie I give it an 9/10."
"OAKTREELIVE03","10","0","1","9 July 2003"," BEST DISNEY MOVIE OF ALL TIME
","And by far the best of this year. Johnny Depp proves once again why he is one of the best actors ever, giving a hilarious performance as Capt. Jack Sparrow. With a great supporting cast but no one comes near Depp's performance save for maybe his rival of Geoffery Rush but even he cannot Blow Johnny out of the water. I was glad to see that this lived up to my expectations, but also and maybe even more importantly didn't deface the name of the beloved Disney ride like ""the Country Bears"" did. Of all the Pirate movies I have never seen a more well-rounded one. It has the perfect mix of action, superstition and reality of a pirate life. And for fans of the ride this film will be even funnier and much more rewarding featuring as advertized great tidbits from the original plot-line of the attraction.<br/><br/>Anyone looking for a change of pace from the usual summer Blockbusters I urge you to go see this. Or for anyone who has ever been enchanted by pirates whether by means of the ride or otherwise. 10++/10"

","I had a hard time deciding if I wanted to see this movie. The fact that Johnny Depp was in it guaranteed that I'd have to watch it at some point, but with Bruckheimer producing and some non-impressive trailers I wasn't that excited about it.<br/><br/>X2 was a fair effort. Terminator 3 sucked. I was convinced this was just a summer of duds. Thank God for Pirates. It blew those other films out of the water. Johnny Depp is a God send. Never before have I been so enthralled in a character. He was unbeliably fun to watch. His performance alone raises the film from above B-movie level. The actual script isn't funny enough to be a lot of fun, nor is it creepy enough to be a genre effort. But Depp's interpretation of his character transforms this movie into something awe inspiring. It gives it a completely different feel and actually helps it retain that sort of innocent goofiness the ride has. <br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush was also great as Captain Barbossa. The sword fight between him and Sparrow was a stand out moment in a film full of stand out moments. Orlando Bloom was pretty boring, but then again the role didn't require much else other than a 'straight man' to Depp's colorful Captain. I'd heard all these comments about how Depp was the best reason to see the film and I can sincerely say that none of that was exaggerated. It truly is reason enough to go see the film. <br/><br/>The special effects are average. Nothing spectacular but nothing horrible. The scene of the two ships doing battle is awesome. And all of the landscapes and towns they created digitally look perfect. From start to finish you are immersed in this world. Speaking of start to finish... waaaay too long. While it rarely ceases to entertain, there a few patches where you'd wish they could just move on to the next thing. <br/><br/>Bottom line: I thought it was a great movie. Better than the previews made it look and a lot more fun and worthy than other summer fare. I don't think it's bold to say Depp has created one of his most memorable characters. No small feat for a man whose resume is loaded with memorable characters. While its essentially a B-movie, the A-List cast and tongue in cheek attitude help raise Pirates to something else entirely. Well worth checking out. I give it an A-"

","I went into this movie with my hopes up, but yet a lingering doubt in the back of my mind that it might be a little too cheezy and touchy feely since disney had a hand in it, and it is based on a ride at Walk Disney World, but i was fairly surprised.  It was much better than even i had expected. There were a couple of moments of cheeze, but not nearly enough to spoil the extreme hilarity and action of this Summer hit.  And the acting by Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing. I would say that if it wasnt his show to steal, he would have stolen the show.

You almost find yourself waiting for his next appearance on screen.  Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley also gave quality performance.

"Cube_TX","10","0","1","9 July 2003"," Fantastic cinematography and costumes. Depp's best performance
","I just got back from seeing this movie and I was overwhelmed.  I wasn't sure what to expect and was terrified that it'd be another Cutthroat Island bomb. One of my favorite things to collect is pirate paraphernalia so I was very heavily anticipating this movie -- making me certain I was setting myself up for disappointment... Thank GOD I was wrong!<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has NEVER impressed me in all these years.  I hated him in every show and movie he was ever in (and that included Edward Scissorhands, Platoon and 21 Jump Street) until now.  This time he was right on the money. He stole the show and was by far the star over Orlando Bloom and Geoffery Rush.  His character was colorful and was a throwback to the swashbuckling of guys like Douglas Fairbanks, Burt Lancaster and Errol Flynn.  His costuming was fantastic, but the other characters' attire was great as well. Whoever picked out the outfits for this movie did a great job.<br/><br/>Equally great was the cinematography.  It isn't easy to capture much of the scenery the way they did.  The shots of the ocean and the islands were beautiful.  I was reminded of my trips to Hawai'i and Catalina.  Great wideangle shots.<br/><br/>I was also very impressed with the action.  The movie never drags despite its long running time of over 2 hours.  There are many fencing scenes and I enjoyed every one.  Somehow they manage to make the movie very action-oriented without making it turn into a mindless action movie a la Stallone/Schwarzenegger.  The movie is safe for the entire family despite its rating.  My girlfriend and I took her 9-year-old daughter to see the movie and she loved it as well.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland you'll find many aspects of the ride in the film.  The movie literally brought the ride to life with they way they recreated the ride's scenes without being hindered by them.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie, despite the bad reviews it seems to be getting in many newspapers.  You won't be disappointed.  Take the kids."

","There were many reasons to expect a particularly bad film, despite the list of talented actors that included Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, and Orlando Bloom. The fact that the entire is based upon a Disney theme park attraction makes one expect to see a cheesy kids movie. And let us not forget the horror of a film that was thrown at us the last time movie execs came up with the same brilliant idea: The Country Bears. <br/><br/>But alas, Disney may have struck gold in Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of The Black Pearl. It is a wonderfully fun action flick, albeit slightly too long, coming in at a padded 2 hours and 23 minutes. Granted, no academy awards will be won for the picture (except possibly for special effects or costume design), but it does not disappoint. It is filled with a thorough plot that leads us through some epic adventures and extremely fun battles.<br/><br/>
The acting, in particular, is top notch in this movie, led by the great Johnny Depp. It is hard to come up with the right words that can describe the way in which he portrayed Captain Jack Sparrow, but either way, it was nothing short of fantastic. Nobody else in the cast can seem to match the level of intensity that Mr. Depp does, but they all do an admirable job trying. Geoffrey Rush, as his arch-villain ex- first mate, Captain Barbosa, creates a believable villain that movie goers will love to hate. Orlando Bloom (the reason many young ladies will be seeing this movie I suspect) also does a great job portraying Will Turner, a blacksmith and childhood friend of Elizabeth Swann, played by the lovely Keira Knightley, whom he is very much in love with, unbeknownst to her. There are also several supporting actors who add great depth to this movie, such as Jack Davenport (Norrington), Jonathan Price (Governor Weatherby Swann, Elizabeth's father), and several others.<br/><br/>Not going into many specifics as to not spoil the fun for those who have yet to catch the film, Jack Sparrow, as captain of The Black Pearl, was ambushed by Barbosa and his men and left for dead. They went on to find a great treasure, which came with a great curse: under the light of the moon, it is revealed that they are nothing but skeletons; undead. Ms. Swann owns a piece of the treasure that is needed to erase the curse, so she is kidnapped along with said treasure. Will Turner, her childhood friend and secret admirer busts Sparrow out of jail and they are off to save his love. Adventure and excitement ensue.<br/><br/>The effects in this movie are particularly great, not as much for their visual portrayal, but for their originality. It would have been very easy to make the skeletons of the crew of The Black Pearl white and ordinary (like the kind in the classroom of a high school Biology professor), but they didn't. The fight scenes between the real life actors and the CGI skeletons are also fantastic. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that this movie is solid all around. There is nothing about this movie that makes for a great movie, but I imagine that it was never really supposed to be one, and that is admirable. In the end, this movie is exactly what it was meant to be, a good, fun adventure.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10"

","In the summers of the 1930's and 40's, if you wondered into your local movie theatre chances are you'd see a daring pirate off on some swashbuckling adventure.  Walk into the theatre today, and find a barrage of f/x laden sci-fi/fantasy films.  Pirates of the Caribbean is the best combination of both.<br/><br/>The success of the film is thanks heavily to Gore Verbinski.  I've always liked Gore's style, but felt he never had the movie to let him realize his potential (see ""The Ring"").  Verbinski and his cinematographer paint just some beautiful scenes in the film.  Some are enhanced by digital grading and other effects features, and it lends the film a great atmosphere and epic look.  He also directs his actions scenes expertly, not going edit happy like most directors.  <br/><br/>But of course, you can't have a great adventure film without a great hero. And you can't have a great hero without a great actor.  Enter Johnny Depp, the ultra-hip, charismatic leading man who is always the highlight of the film he works in.  Captain Jack Sparrow is just a downright cool cat, thanks largely to the help of Depp.  Depp himself added much the his characters costume and personal quirks, and his Depp's comedic timing is a spot on as ever. Just pure genius Johnny, as always.   Orlando Bloom does nicely as well, but it really felt more like he was warming up for his role in the next Lord of the Rings movie.  Geoffrey Rush found a even balance of subtlety and over acting, not extending the use of either, and though while not too memorable, it is still a good performance.  Keira Knightley is nothing really worth mentioning.  Typical damsel role, typical performance. Any actress could have handled the part, though must wouldn't have been as attractive.<br/><br/>The story and screenplay is very much ""Old"" Hollywood, a more slick line of dialogue that is light and fun without being cheesy.  It's levity is not forced, but transcends naturally from the actors and Gore's dream like directing.<br/><br/>All in all, it is one of the most fun movies too come out of hollywood in a long time.  It's a nod to the golden age of Hollywood with the visual conscience of a modern blockbuster.  The actors are great, Verbinski provides the smooth look, and the screenplay as joy written all over it.

"Mr Parker","Null","0","1","9 July 2003"," ...and a bottle of rum! (Or two. Or three even.)
","I watched this last night at a sneak preview here in NYC and I came away impressed. Johnny Depp has proven that he is the man, once and for all. I swear, from the moment you first see him, you're gonna have a big smile on your face. He's hilarious. That entrance was priceless. I kid you not when I tell you that it is worth shelling out the ten bucks just for his performance alone. Think of him as a Raoul Duke toned down for the Disney audience. As for the rest of the movie, I found it very enjoyable and the only thing that I'd complain about is the length which was a tad bit much. You start feeling it a little after the two hour mark. Also, there's something about a Bruckheimer produced movie that makes me want to throttle the man. It gives the movie a slightly canned, ""Bruckheimer Style"" flavor that makes me want to jam a finger down my throat and purge Monty Python's Meaning of Life style. The music, the chaotic action, I don't know. I'll say it upfront, I don't like the man but you probably figured that out already. Keira Knightley is damn fine. Thank god seventeen is legal in New York because I was kind of starting to feel bad thinking about how I would have liked to plunder her treasure. Filthiness aside, she played her part well, though her character's importance became irrelevant after the halfway mark. Orlando Bloom, while well cast, needs to be given a part that stretches his abilities a bit more. With a two hour plus runtime, there was no excuse for not having his character fully fleshed out and simply having him stare angrily at any of the villains. Maybe I'm wrong but I just felt he was sadly under used. Speaking of villains, Geoffrey Rush seems to be perfect in these types of scenery chewing, teeth gnashing roles. His performance here reminded me of his unapologetic performance in ""House on Haunted Hill"", the best thing about that particular movie. He makes for a good bad guy, so much that you never really hate him. He's a joy to watch as well. The direction by Gore Verbinski was surehanded and whoever was responsible for the writing gets kudos also. I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought I would, believe it or not. The action was pretty chaotic but on occasion goes on for longer than it should. The special effects were pretty good but I think ILM has been falling off as of late. I'm not trashing their work but it just seems uninspired these past few films (cough... cough...Dreamcatcher... cough) In the end, it's Depp's picture all the way. Thankfully this movie knows that it's supposed to be fun and not self-important. Not a bad way to spend two and a half hours. And if you do end up watching this and you don't enjoy hearing Captain Jack Sparrow slur every other word, I don't know what else to tell you. Rating: ***1/2 out of *****."

","(May contain spoilers)<br/><br/>I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this movie. It could be a really great movie with an interesting plot and action scenes, OR it could be a run-of-the-mill pirate movie whose main claim to fame was Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>It was indeed a really great movie with a surprisingly believable plot, understandable characters, superb special effects, and very good acting by the main (and not so main) actors.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom as pirate's son blacksmith Will Turner, Geoffrey Rush as evil Captain Barbossa, and Keira Knightley as governor's daughter/Will's girlfriend, performed admirably in my mind. Mackenzie Crook as the wooden-eyed pirate on the Black Pearl provided comic relief, and my mother was surprised that the movie was as humorous as it was. (Johnny Depp's funny little hand movements entertained me to no end. Then again, I'm me, so don't take my opinion for it.) But the BIG accolades for acting should go to Johnny Depp, as the rakish, dishonest, cool-headed and surprisingly sexy in that eyeliner, (Captain) Jack Sparrow. It is hard for me to describe the full extent of his acting, but let me tell you, HE DID GOOD. See the movie. See the movie just for Johnny Depp if for no other reason.<br/><br/>
The creepy cursed-pirates-in-moonlight may disturb younger audience members, but the effects that made them can be commended by many. The skeletons' torn clothes; empty, rotted eyes and skin-peeling skulls are especially freaky and appreciable in the scene where they attack the commodore's ship from underwater.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected and give it a 10/10."

","Pirates of the Caribbean is an extremely fun pirate action movie, filled with swashbuckling, cannonball-shooting, corset cleavage displaying, swordfighting revelry. It has all the familiar earmarks of the pirate action movie: A pre-Revolutionary War era settting, an attractive rogue who dances the fine line between bad guy scoundrel and good guy hero, a beautiful damsel in a corset, loyal sidekicks, stiff-as-a-board uniformed authorities, a menacing villain and his henchmen, swordfights, chases, daring escapes, gold treasure, plenty of humor, and oh yeah, a grotesque maritime curse that is deftly utilized by the plot. Hell, there's even a talking parrot.<br/><br/>The audience laughed during all the funny moments, and applauded at the very end. The story moved together very quickly for a two hour and twelve minute film, and I was never anxious to look at the time.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Jack Sparrow, a flamboyant pirate who practically exudes charm from every pore on his skin, and who totally steals the movie by exhibiting the most unique full-body gesticulations when he speaks. After trying unsuccessfully to steal-er, commandeer a ship, he is thwarted by an honorable blacksmith named Will Turner who shares a mutual (if unspoken) affection for the beautiful governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). After she is taken by pirates of the ship Black Pearl in the hopes of helping them to lift a terrible curse that was placed on them years earlier, Will agrees to free the jailed Jack in exchange for helping him rescue Elizabeth, setting them both on a wild adventure filled with cutthroat buccaneers, island caves, and constant reversals of fortune. The movie works because it knows how to use the plot and dialogue to move things forward. The action scenes are a wonder to watch, and even when characters engage in expository dialogue over dinner, one never gets bored, particularly given the pleasant humor that punctuates it. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush have great screen presence, and even Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley become characters that you root for.<br/><br/>There was one thing I didn't get, though: (SPOILER WARNING:  In the beginning of the movie, after Jack saves Elizabeth from drowning, he then temporarily takes her hostage to escape the hangman for piracy, telling her, ""I saved your life, you save mine."" But we later learn near the climax of the movie that he suffers from the curse of immortality.  So why take her hostage?  He could've just jumped into the water and escaped without her.  Hell, he could've been hanged, and it wouldn't have done anything to him. For that matter, why did he suffer from the curse?  He told Barbossa that he escaped it because he wasn't present when it struck Barbossa and the others."

I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised.  This movie is a fun little ride-- not fantastic or amazing, but enjoyable.  Johnny Depp is amazing in characterizing this pirate-- is he drunk?  Is he crazy? Or is Jack Sparrow just pretending to be that way?  He keeps up the act through the entire movie, which is a feat in its own right. So sit back and be entertained.
