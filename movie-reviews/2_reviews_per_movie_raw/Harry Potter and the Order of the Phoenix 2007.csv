","Oh you can shake Snape up! Oh you anyone can shake Snape up! Like boob fat, shake shake Snape, shake shake Snape, shake shake! Oh I love this film so much!<br/><br/>Bellatrix is such a lovely lady and she always cheers me up and turns my usual frown upside down every time I see her lovely nurturing motherly nature on display in this terrific top notch film. Bellatrix is the most sexiest and kindest woman alive in my humble opinion and I wish she was my Mother, tells me I'm a naughty boy and looks after me every day so that's a great testament to how much I adore this film. I know nothing bad will happen to me when I'm watching this film because I know Bellatrix Motherly instincts will protect me from any harm that comes to me, oh I love her so much, I wish I could hug her all the time to show her how much I love her.<br/><br/>James Potter was a great man, my 2nd favourite fictional character of all time and he showed that sobbing little man baby known as Snivellus Snape who's boss and I always cheer and clap every time I see that lovely Snape memory scene in this film as Snape gets some payback for having fashion sense that gives people nightmares, an annoying tendency to read and study things all the time and forever being an evil know it all. James and his friends are really complex memorable characters full of enlightening personality traits and they are great role models for British boys and this film always makes me appreciate that I have friends like James Potter did that I can have great fun with. This film is guaranteed to make you smile if you're a British boy crying out for some motherly affection."
"java5989","7","609","871","11 July 2007"," A great movie, yet completely surpassed by the book
","When I first walked into the movie, my expectations were not very high. The first two movies, I thought, were the best of the series mainly due to Richard Harris' dead-on portrayal of Dumbledore and screenplays that closely followed the original books. Though the third and fourth movies were very artistic and dramatic, I couldn't really connect to them in the way i had with the books. They glossed over many of the little things that made the Harry Potter series so magical in the first place, focusing on a select few plot lines and limiting dialog to only what was necessary to further the story. <br/><br/>As a result they've felt more like a collage of scenes, a series of puzzle pieces, thrown at the viewers faster than they can piece together, just leading up to a final confrontation. Pacing has certainly been an issue, leaving fans feeling disjointed, and those new to the series confused as to what exactly is going on. In this respect, Order of the Phoenix was very similar to the previous two movies. As a Hollywood film, it deserves praise, bringing this amazing world to the big screen, telling a compelling tale, and keeping the viewers glued to their seats for the duration of the movie. However, to the die hard fans of the books, you will undoubtedly be disappointed. <br/><br/>Many scenes that one would think invaluable to the story have been cut, replaced by the hasty filling in of plot holes. And while it pains me to ignore some of my favorite scenes from the book being left on the cutting room floor (St. Mungo's, Harry's Quibbler interview, the Quidditch fight, etc.), I realize that yes, not everything could be included in the movie. But in this watered down version of the book, there seems to be something missing. We still have all the drama and excitement, but some of the magic just seems to be gone. <br/><br/>Aside from Evanna (couldn't have made a more perfect Luna), the kids give simply average performances, never really reaching the full potential put forth by JK Rowling's writing. The same goes for Gambon, who seems to have ignored the calm, all knowing, endearing idea of who Dumbledore is, in favor of a more erratic yet powerful headmaster. Sure, this works well in the more dramatic scenes (specifically the final battle), but otherwise, his performance falls flat, lacking the eye twinkling charm we came to love from the late Richard Harris. Thankfully, Imelda Staunton more than makes up for this in an amazing portrayal of Dolores Umbridge, one of the more fully realized characters of the movie. As for the rest of the cast, it's largely hit or miss, determined by how each scene is written. <br/><br/>Overall, I would certainly recommend the movie for everyone, fan or not, as it really was a well made movie, despite a few wooden actors and some bad dialog. But when looking at the books, one really can't help but think how much more potential this movie could've had."
"PropTart77","4","143","203","12 July 2007"," Order of the Plot-Holes
","For those of you looking for a faithful adaptation of Order of the Phoenix, this film isn't it. How director David Yates got the go to direct completely baffles me. Not since Chris Columbus' stilted pacing has a HP film disappointed me. I realize that in a book as rich in detail as the HP series something is bound to be left out in the film version, but the direction and editing of this film leave much to be desired.<br/><br/>The film opens in Little Whinging with the dementor attack on Harry and Dudley. Mrs. Figg happens across the boys as if by accident just after Harry defeats the Dementors with his Patronus, but is never ""outed"" as a squib. The Dursleys were more worried than horrified, and never threatened Harry with expulsion from their house. The sheer vileness that audiences last saw in Prisoner of Azkaban was notable absent, leaving the view to wonder what happened to bring us the weak and whimpering version of the Dursleys that appears in this film.<br/><br/>When Harry is brought to the Order's headquarters, very little is made of the fact that the Noble House of Black was once a bastion of pure-blood fanaticism. Kreature makes a very weak appearance, and the simple existence of Regulus Black (R.A.B.?) was never even touched upon.<br/><br/>Fred and George remain the comic relief, but the ever developing character of Ginny Weasley is ignored. Even more upsetting was the notable absence of Mrs. Weasly's growing concern for her family's safety. I thought that one of the most touching moments in the book was the chapter in which Mrs. Weasly attempts of banish the boggart only to have it continually morph into the horrifying visages of various dead loved ones. Bill and Charlie were also not mentioned, leaving the viewer to wonder if the film franchise plans to reduce the Weasly family from 9 to 7.<br/><br/>As excited as I was with the casting of Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, I felt that Yate simply did not do her justice. Yes she was vile, but not in the bureaucratic evil way Rowling depicted her in the novel. She simpered, but I just did not get the feeling that she took malicious pleasure that she should have in what she did as the High Inquisitor.<br/><br/>The rumored St. Mungo's scene, while it may have been filmed, was disappointingly absent, with the film jumping from Mr. Weasly's attack in the ministry (although why he was in the Deapartment of Mysteries was never addressed) to Christmas dinner at the HQ and a lame ""Here's Daddy!"" from Mrs. Weasly.<br/><br/>Even more disappointing was the depiction of the Department of Mysteries. I entered the movie hoping for some wicked effects and bizarre magical elements, and was left with just the Hall of Prophesies and the mysterious doorway. To add insult to injury, the relationship between Sirius and Harry was never developed to the point where Harry would naturally feel devastated by the loss of his godfather. I felt as though their relationship was more vague friend of the family then Harry beginning to look to Sirius as a surrogate father figure.<br/><br/>Over all the continuity of the film felt too rushed and disjointed, as opposed to the more fluid Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of fire. Relationships between the characters felt forced, which I found odd, considering the fact that the cast has been working together for 7 years or so. If any of my personal suspicions and predictions for the future of Harry are accurate, this film has left out numerous key elements. That being the case, then films 6 and 7 will have to scramble to make up for what this film lacks. As Yates is slated to direct the next installment, I can only look to it with a feeling of dread, wondering how he will mangle the Half-Blood Prince."
"inzirilloc","10","542","823","11 July 2007"," Simply Put...Phenomenal (A Book-Reader's Review)
","OK. Yes stuff was left out. Yes some things were inaccurate. And yes, at times the story jumped around. But I'll tell you what, if that's the price to pay for being able to see fantastic literature on the big-screen...I'll take a few inconsistencies any day.<br/><br/>For having the task of taking 870 masterful pages and turning them into a 2.5 hour movie, David Yates did one heck of a job. This movie is a must-see, no matter how you look at it. For book-readers, sure you notice the absence of certain parts, but you finally get to see what you've imagined in your head for years take place in real-live motion on the screenand you know what, those few things left out, help you gain a better understanding anyway, because you have already read the in-between stuff. Then, in the same breath, this is a great movie for non-book-readers as well. For those HP fans who take the lighter approach of skipping the books and simply following along by the moviesyou won't know what you're missing anyway. The biggest complaints about this movie will be from book-readers who wanted a 10-hour long, word-for-word re-creation of the book. Other than that, there is nothing to complain about. Acting was great, story-line was great, and the special effects were flawless.<br/><br/>(Slight Spoiler In This Paragraph) Being a book-reader, I knew heading in that I would have to be prepared to accept substantial cuts from all that takes place in the book. However, the parts that Yates chose to focus on, were by far, the most important ones; and the way in which he did it, left me speechless. Yates was clearly at his best at the movie's climactic ending. When reading those last few chapters, when Harry is at the Ministry, and there is the great battle, the book reads like a whirlwind. Everything is happening at once: death-eaters here, death-eaters there, Sirius finally getting the chance to fight, Moody kicking ass, Ginny going on a tear and straight-up owning people. And you try to picture in your head what all this would look likea million things going on at once, and trying to picture how wizards and witches really ""fight"" each other. Somehow, someway, Yates was able to create that fast-paced, action-packed, confusion, and then all of a sudden, like an orchestra going flat after their last booming note, Sirius Black is gonejust like in the book. This was the hardest part for me to swallow when reading the book, as tears ran down my cheeks, not only because Sirius was my favorite character, but because you go from such a ""high"" of seeing the Order save the day, to the unbelievable ""low"" of seeing Harry's godfather simply fade away. This is an emotion and thought process which was excellently portrayed in the film. Ironically enough, Yates was only warming up.<br/><br/>As for the Dumbledore/Voldemort showdown, I don't think that it could have been done better. In a Star Wars type fashion, Harry is being tempted by Voldemort to release his anger, to have his revenge on Bellatrix Lestrange, to have a taste of the dark side. And as we sit there fearing for confused, helpless Harry, we see a green fire of hope, and more like Master Yoda than any other fictional character, Albus Dumbledore appears and engages Voldemort in a wizard-duel that puts Gandalf and Sarumon to shame.<br/><br/>The way the movie engaged the audience and got their emotion kicking is a great film-making talent not found in many movies anymore. Think of the way Yates made you HATE Umbridge, just like the book. The way you felt bad for Snape when you saw his hidden past, just like the book. And think of the best two lines of the movie where you felt comfort, confidence, and safety on Harry's part. The first of these lines was Sirius Black to Lucius Malfoy: when the death-eaters are over-whelming the kids, Sirius appears behind Lucius with a firm, ""get away from my godson."" Then once again, when Harry is alone with Voldemort, Dumbledore appears and almost as if to initiate the duel, says, ""It was a mistake for you to come here tonight, Tom."" Overall, the movie was fantastic. The best of the fiveby far. You just have to put aside the gaping holes of chapters that were left out, and look at what was done well. For the book-readers, imagine if you were forced to take only 400 of the 870 pages out of the bookyou would take the most important ones that relate to the plot. So as much as the ""prefect storyline"" and the ""Harry/Cho drama"" and all that other stuff is a great read, the big screen simply doesn't allow enough time for it. As for the non-book-readerspick up the books and get busy. Because as great as a job that Yates did with the moviethe woman he got the story from, Ms. Rowling, might just be one of the greatest authors of our time.<br/><br/>Now go spend 10 bucks and enjoy the show!"
"juliebug04","8","255","405","11 July 2007"," Separate the film from the book, and you will be impressed
","I actually was lucky enough to see this at a sneak preview on Monday. The ""experience"" was lousy, but the film was good...IF you take it as a separate entity from the series of books. If you separate the film from the book, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>For the negative...there were, of course, MANY things that were omitted from the film. As a huge fan of the books, I still must be realistic. I knew there would be a lot of information left out. There were a few things that I felt could have made the story richer if they had been included, but I won't go into detail so I don't give away any of the film's changes. There were a few changes that made me frown at times, but as the story played out, it did make the film flow well. One of their worst casting decisions, Michael Gambon, was actually tolerable in this one, for the most part. I am NOT a fan of his portrayal of Dumbledore, but I guess he worked for this film simply because, for the majority of the story, he is supposed to be acting somewhat aloof towards Harry. That worked for him. I miss the subtlety that Richard Harris brought to that role, and, while he wasn't dreadful in this one, I still believe that there are countless other well known actors in the UK that could have done this role better justice. There wasn't enough Molly or Hagrid for me though. I love both of those characters.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the special effects were very well done. The thestrals were marvelous--eerie, but strangely peaceful creatures. Evanna Lynch could not have been more spot on as Luna. Her voice, mannerisms and demeanor were amazing. My only complaint about her was that she wasn't on screen enough. :o) Imelda Staunton, as Umbridge, and Helena Bonham Carter, as Bella, have to be two of the BEST casting decisions that they have with regard to these films. They were SO incredible. I was actually quite impressed with Dan, Rupert and Emma as well. They have come quite far in their acting abilities. They have finally achieved the art of saying a lot without necessarily opening their mouths. The scene in the common room following the kiss between Harry and Cho was hysterical. Kreacher and Grawp were great additions to the films. Fred and George's exit was very well done, albeit slightly different. The film, if taken by itself, was really good. Unfortunately, it's a lot different from the book. But, as I'm doing a film review and not a comparison, I'll give it 8 out of 10, because I was highly entertained.<br/><br/>Our ""sneak preview"" was interrupted in the middle due to a problem with the film, and I think we still missed some of it. We lined up 3 hours before the movie was supposed to begin, it started late, it was interrupted in the middle for over 30 minutes, we were wanded for metal and electronics every time we went in or out...I think we'll just wait until opening week next time. It's crowded, but a lot less trouble.<br/><br/>We are actually going to see it again."

","Within the first 5 minutes you can tell the series has undergone a dramatic tone shift and I have to say I think thats appropriate since Voldemorts return at the end of Goblet of Fire means that it's time to put aside childish things. The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.<br/><br/>Gone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold, a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far, even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little ""fun"" in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back, it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.<br/><br/>This (in the movie world at least) is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.<br/><br/>Harry now has some serious mental scars (as well as his actual one of course) since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban, followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside, crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about re-ordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.<br/><br/>She wasn't quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bitter/sweet twist, all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that ""stab you in the back"" thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.<br/><br/>It is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can't put my finger on what wasn't in the movie (I read it a while ago now) it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas, mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There's a pace here we haven't seen before, a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it's new clothes well. I'm eagerly anticipating what's next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince (last I heard anyway) and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.<br/><br/>The characters all look much older than they're supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it's favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them, they're coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That's also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good, Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it's Harris I'm picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange (must get that from hubby Tim Burton) who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn't in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn't in the book. The line about Snape being in the order, if you missed it you wouldn't even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.<br/><br/>Kreacher was well done I though, coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.<br/><br/>All in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.<br/><br/>Now I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later...."
"braniac33","1","150","242","11 July 2007"," Never been so disappointed in my life
","Yates, be ashamed. Goldenberg, be ashamed. This is the worst HP movie a die hard fan had to sit through. To start off, just because the movie is an adaptation of the book does not mean it should leave out entire story lines, change others, and expose only those that will glitter and impress those who have not read the book. Lord of the Rings... ring a bell, followers of the book... did it stray as much from the books as OOTP did? Now for serious talk, whoever decided that Grawp should look like a 20' middle-aged man with Down's Syndrome should be tortured for the rest of their life. Not only did Grawp look slow, but behaved, moved, and got the audience's sympathy NOT how the book describes him at all. And how about entire chunks of the book thrown away for a cheap (but likely profitable) movie? How about being 3/4 through the book in 60 minutes? How about Kreacher, 2 scenes? How about Sirius' mother's portrait? How about Quidditch? How about the Patronus charm being ""very advanced magic"" yet the director felt every character needed an animal? How about classes, wizard clothing, Diagon Alley... is Hogwart's set in London now for some reason? How about Harry is the only one that does lines in Umbridge's office (so as to isolate him further from his friends in his loneliness)? How about Firenze taking over Divination, showing that it is not a lost art and course? How about Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes, the twins' decision making, the money Harry gave them to open up their shop? How about knowing the names of the escaped convicts, was it going to cost too much to PRINT 10 names of the villains who are in the finale on the Prophet? I realize this is a film ""based"" on the book, but to be able to say that the movie should reflect at least 50% of the book, if the craptacular disappointment duo of Yates/Goldenberg sign on for Half Blood Prince, I hope I am not alone in wishing them to buy a few extra letter openers for the ""angry"" mail they will certainly receive. If another duo appears, my advice is to stick to the book, even Mel Gibson did that...<br/><br/>To Ms. J.K. Rowling, I sincerely hope you did not have the final decision on the final cut of this film... it utterly destroys the imagery/ plot you so carefully grew and pruned in the minds of innumerable people, young and old."
"fraserstewart","1","98","158","1 August 2007"," Who ruined Harry Potter?
","I have read and enjoyed all 7 Harry potter novels, and I watched and enjoyed the first 2 films, Azkaban and GOF were OK but not good. This however was awful, and when I say awful I really mean awful. I was genuinely on the verge of walking out of the theatre after about 30 minutes, the only reason I sat through this was because of my wife.<br/><br/>I will say that Dolores Umbridge and Sirius Black were really good. Harry Potter however was dreadful. Daniel Radcliffe seems to have forgotten how to act on his way through puberty. I mean he was excellent in the first two films so why was this so awful? He spent two hours literally panting and moaning, it was like he had been told to tense every muscle in his whole body and stay like that for every scene.<br/><br/>Then there was Dumbledore and trust me Michael Gambon cannot do Dumbledore. After Trelawny is fired and he tells Umbridge quite calmly that she can stay in the castle he then proceeds to shout at the students, ""Don't you all have studying to do?"", that was one of my biggest wtf moments.<br/><br/>Percy doesn't speak at all, and Malfoy has literally one line in the whole film. How about explaining that Umbridge was the one who set the Dementors on Harry in the first place, and then they actually changed how the Dementors looked, I mean film 3 got it spot on. Then there was just ridiculous stuff like a Dementor strangling Harry, so he stabs it in the eye with his wand? Then there was Fred and George leaving Hogwarts, the whole reason that they caused a big scene and commotion was so that Harry could use Umbridges fire in her office and find out about Sirius. How about Kreacher lying to Harry? How about revealing that Snape DID go and find out about Sirius and was merely pretending to be ignorant to Umbridge? My biggest disappointment however by far was the end fight scene's between the death eaters and the Order of the Phoenix, in particular Dumbledore and Voldemort. Bellatrix does not kill Sirius with the Avada Kedavra curse, she stuns him into one of those weird curtained doors, and then he disappears. The fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort was basically a giant light show where the cgi people were probably told ""Go to town, let your imagination run wild"".<br/><br/>How about Dumbledore taunting Voldemort by calling him Tom all the time, and avoiding his killing curses rather than fighting back? How about Dumbledore being shown to be far more powerful than Riddle and choosing for reasons that I can't remember now not to kill him? The other thing about Dumbledore as well is that he appears to dissaparate from Hogwarts which Hermione says repeatedly throughout the books is not possible.<br/><br/>I probably haven't covered everything, but these films definitely went downhill big time after Chamber of Secrets. You leave the cinema feeling like all you saw was lots of clips strung together, and that loads of things were missing, and it all happened in a massive rush, you don't get that sense of satisfaction that you should get after watching a good film. Whether you've read the book or not, I would say avoid at all costs, and if you haven't read the book, then buy the book and read it, it will give you infinitely more pleasure that the torture you have to suffer to watch this film."

","I love the Harry Potter books, and I've always liked the movies. That's why I was very excited to go see the latest installment of the series. However the movie did not at all live up to my expectations; to me it felt rushed and choppy. I realize that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a very long book, but so was The Goblet of Fire and I enjoyed it's movie adaptation a lot. In this movie seemed as though the director merely had a check list of scenes that he needed to but in the movie put no thought into connecting them. The speed and choppiness of the movie took away from the characters. It was just events and there was hardly any character development at all. Which was a shame because the young cast continues to get better, and there were some amazing acting veterans (Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter etc.) In my opinion if the director had slowed everything down, only a little, he could've added a lot more (character development, humor, fluidity) However, despite by prier comments, the movie was not terrible. It did have it's good moments, but I think it could have been done a lot better."

","I feel cheated. I really do. Too much omitted this time.<br/><br/>WARNING: DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE or READ THE BOOK.<br/><br/>Firstly, Harry stabbed the dementor in the eye with his wand! What?! Secondly, did anyone find Kingsley Shacklebolt's hat mildly unnecessary? Just asking. Then, there's the complete omission of Hermoine's and Ron's elevation to prefect, AND of Harry becoming captain of the Quidditch team. In fact, there was no Quidditch at all. Frowny faces abound. They skipped the visit to St. Mungo's, and it would've been funny to see Gilderoy Lockhart again. It also seemed like the Weasley brothers' grand exit was stolen from them. The fireworks were cool, but there was none of the flair, there was no speech, and there was (yet again) no Peeves. Sad times. And then, despite all these omissions, they find time to have a scene of everyone from the DA in detention writing lines with blood-ink quills, which never even happens in the book. Booo. However, through all this, there was one glimmer of hope: The fight in the Ministry. ""The battle at the Ministry will make it all better,"" I said to myself. Not so! I mean, sure, it was good looking, but the entire Hall of Prophecy collapsing? Surely the shelves in that kind of room are sturdier than that. The distinct lack of almost ALL of the Department of Mysteries? Where was the brain room? Where was the hummingbird in the hourglass? And most importantly, where was the prophecy?! We get a snippet of it, but it comes out before the thing even breaks. And now we come to the saddest part: Sirius's death. (I told you, you shouldn't be reading if you haven't seen/read it already.) It was definitely as sad as it should've been, but it wasn't nearly as abrupt as it was in the book. It's shocking because of its suddenness. It becomes more real that way; it shocks the reader as much as it does Harry. It just didn't seem jarring enough. Also, the young wizards were casting nonverbally, which will (presumably) create confusion when Harry duels Snape in Half-Blood Prince. Oh, and the Priori Incantatum thing with Voldemort and Dumbledore? What?<br/><br/>I will say that Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange were perfect for their roles, and the thestrals were very cool. The acting was all extremely well done, the content just left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>But what do I know? It's hard to write movies. I just wish the film has included more of the important, meaningful content."
"writinginfaith","10","40","61","15 July 2007"," Order of the Phoenix is about the Real World
","Why do Harry Potter movies give me, but not the children, nightmares? I've been wondering this for the past few years. Today, watching Movie No. 5, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Warner Bros., 2007), I got my answer. Simply: Harry's world is the real world. As Harry and his friends mature, the line between the world of wizardry, magic, and Hogwarts and the world of self-centered, manipulative, cruel adults thins to the point of almost magical invisibility.<br/><br/>Fantasy literature has since the beginning of time been about mediating and making sense of the real world; Harry Potter is part of this tradition.<br/><br/>Indeed, one of the movie's first big special effects embodies this idea. As the movie opens, Harry is the subject of a smear campaign that Valdemore has cooked up because darkness works tirelessly to triumph over the light; when his friends come to rescue him from the suburban horror show known as his adoptive family, they take him to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a place that doesn't exist until a row of Georgian homes stretches out to reveal it. It's there, but the neighbors are unaware of it. They have no idea their building grew a house that the wizards and witches of the world can solve an internal problem. Such is life; how seldom do we know the inner workings, the coping mechanisms, the interior life of the people around us? In The Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter again does battle with evil to bring home the theme that when you fight, you fight well with and for your friends and to the death if necessary. Truth and goodness--call if love, if you want--are worth the trouble. The Gothic idiom of Harry Potter brilliantly takes the challenges Harry faces out of the present on one level even though these are very clearly 21st century characters facing contemporary challenges. Alongside the power of goodness over evil theme is the theme of the power of the imagination to find solutions to problems that are the same in every generation: politics, power games, jealousy, stupidity, growing up.<br/><br/>Always in Harry Potter is the clear distinction between the good guys and the bad ones right alongside the good kids and the annoying kids, who could very well become evil people if they so choose. They are tragic because they don't understand the long-range consequences of their petty cruelties--but then, as we learn in this movie, even the good kids are capable of petty cruelties that break souls. Always there is Snape, the middling Hogwarts employee who is not clearly good but not clearly bad but capable of both (until fate forces his hand in Book 6).<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling doesn't let anybody off of the hook of responsibility for their choices. But she does present the internal struggle for goodness and justice for the mess that it can be. Just as the Gothic world of Hogwarts helps Harry and his friends mediate the real world, so Rowling helps her readers see the world for what it is. This is a world that can give me nightmares, though not my daughter and my nephews. Perhaps because all they really need is an honest story."

","Well I just saw OotP, and the only actors I would keep would be Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham-Carter, Gary Oldman, George Harris, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis and Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>The rest just plain sucked.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe had better buck his ideas up if he thinks that acting is a career. Wooden just wasn't the word. In the book you can sense his anger, frustration and pain. The only pain I sensed was having to put up with another scene with him in. As an example his line 'Get behind me' sounded more as if he was standing in a lunch queue at school. Where oh where had his feelings for Sirius gone? By the time he was getting on the train to go home it was like he had never even met him. Weird. He will be the next Mark Hamill or Macauly Culkin. No talent.<br/><br/>As for Emma Watson, well she managed to deliver the lines but that was about it. Where was the feeling and understanding when she describes how Cho was feeling to Harry and Ron? It came across so well in the book, she managed to make it really dull and uninteresting. Radcliffe's response of 'wet' was hurried and forced out as though lunch had just been called and he wanted to be first in the queue.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint actually has started to show a bit of character, but was given too little to do. I think the only thing he really mucked up was the 'Who are you? and what have you done with Hermione Granger?' line. Having said that the response from Emma Watson was limp. Mind you he was the pick of the 'students'.<br/><br/>Matthew Lewis as Neville will never get a job outside this franchise on the strength of that performance. The Phelps twins were OK but again had too little to do. Same for Evanna Lynch. She looked like she knew something about acting and was actually believable as Luna, but she had far too little to work with.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes was as malevolent as a tea cup, and Imelda Staunton was about as frightening as wet paint.<br/><br/>Michael Gambon sucks as Dumbldore, he has never had the quiet calm that comes over in the books. He would be better as the sorting hat.<br/><br/>Natalia Tena needed more lines..... She never had a chance with the material she was given, and seemed to be there because she was in the book and to give the CGi guys some more chances to show off. More pointless window dressing.<br/><br/>Maggie Smith had an indifferent outing as McGonnagall. I've come to expect better of her.<br/><br/>As did Robbie Coltrane. He never came across as Hagrid like the first films, but he must have had ooh, nearly five minutes on screen.<br/><br/>Richard Leaf was just plain rubbish as Dawlish. He looked like a used car salesman. I was fully expecting him to try and sell Dumbledore a used Ford. I know he had hardly any screen time, but.....<br/><br/>As for Grawp, I thought I had gone into Shrek the third by mistake. Where did the ugly, brutal giant go? I half expected Donkey or Princess Fiona to appear...<br/><br/>There was much talk of the film being darker. Well darker sets would have covered it, the characters were as frothy as ever, hardly ever showing any of the strain that is apparent in the books.<br/><br/>Except for David Thewlis, he looked excellent as the haggard Lupin and performed his 'down at heal' role very well.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman shone out again as Severus Snape, except they had cut out some of his better lines from the book.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman was better than I expected, but could have done with more screen time. He never got to show brooding Sirius, nor did he get his best one liner either. 'Come on cousin, you can do better than that!' Jason Isaacs again led from the front, he is the very epitome of the elder Malfoy, and exudes a sinister feel that makes his character very believable. He should have been given the Lord Voldemort part. I could actually believe I was going to die if he was Lord Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes, well I think I just ordered a Latte didn't I? First time performers Helena Bonham-Carter was exceptional, but again needed more screen time.<br/><br/>George Harris was excellent as Shackbolt, he had confidence and presence, something that so many lacked. His costume and manner were perfect, and his voice, just brilliant.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson again impressed me with his over the top Moody. He seems just as bonkers as the character in the book.<br/><br/>Overall the film was less than impressive, if that is the best David Yates can do he should not take the next film.<br/><br/>I try to go to the movies at least twice a week. This was one of those films where I found myself looking at my watch halfway through thinking is it nearly over yet? I would have to say one to one and a half stars at best. Over-hyped, and now full of overpaid teenagers who just cannot act. You could excuse the first two or maybe three films, but now they really should be starting to show some craft and talent."
"sebfar","1","44","71","14 July 2007"," A huge disappointment for fans and newcomers alike
","I simply do not understand how anyone could have enjoyed this movie. As a standalone work without reference to the book it was dull, yet glitzy, incomprehensible drivel. It became almost impossible for someone who had not read the texts to understand a thing, especially for one who had not before seen the films. Many characters were never introduced and there was no significant character development nor was there real motivation for actions given.<br/><br/>-Some spoilers here, but not substantial ones for the book reader-<br/><br/>For the book reader the film was one disappointment or incongruity after another. Many completely unnecessary changes were made, some with no real impact (eg Harry never seeing Snape's past in the pensieve; rather, only after using the Protego charm), as well as some causing mild damage. An example of this would be using Cho as a leak for the DA and omitting her friend, hardly an improvement since the extra character could not have been less developed than Cho. Further, the idea of Umbridge having used Veritaserum to coerce Cho removes any justification for Harry's continued dislike of her, in the coming films. <br/><br/>A third type of change was simply ridiculous, namely those pandering to senseless cliché. The idea of Voldemort attempting to convince Harry to use the Cruciatus curse on Belatrix, releasing his anger, hearkened far too strongly to Star Wars to be a valuable addition. One half expected Voldemort to announce that Harry was his son!<br/><br/>-End of spoiler content-<br/><br/>All in all the title is interesting neither for its merit as a film in and of itself nor as a transliteration of the novels; rather, it is a cheap and senseless attempt to cash in on a franchise being worn to dust by over-commercialisation."
"itamtodd","2","49","80","12 July 2007"," Too Short, Too Little, TOO LATE!
","THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! CAUTION!!!<br/><br/>Fist off I must admit that I have watched the previous movies too many times to count Since I watched the last movie I have read the books (I had not read them before this movie). This book was the turning point for me in the whole Harry Potter series. In my opinion the story goes from good to excellent in OOTP. With that said, I had some pretty big expectations for this movie, some of which where realized.<br/><br/>The high points of the movie where seeing the fruition of some of the more lovable elements of the book such as Weasley's Wheezes, Tonks, Askaban, Kretcher, and the OOTP Head Quarters. It was fun to see the characters but it was hard to see such main characters like Tonks totally be ignored by the story. I mean I had such hope when she was pulling faces at the dinner table then after that, nothing. <br/><br/>The movie really just cut too many corners to the point that it did not look as amazing as it could have been. I mean the ministry of magic looked like a hallway and that's it, Sirius' family apparently lived in the connect-a-house projects, and Cho was border line illiterate! I don't think that movies have to follow the books exactly, for example, I think Lord of the Rings did an awesome job at condensing one of the most complex and awesome stories of our time into 12hrs of movie. But the movies do have to make sense.<br/><br/>I asked my wife after the movie (she has not read any HP books) if it made sense (because he continuity and back-story of the movie was not easy to follow for me) and she said yes. I just worry that the movies are so out of control at this point that peeves, Hermione & Ron's Prefect Status, Percy going bad, Quidditch, the Dursley's, Trelawny, etc All those stories are now so corrupted and twisted by screen writes and directors that they can not (in my imagination) be reasonably recovered.<br/><br/>My Suggestions:<br/><br/>1. If your going to make us wait two years between movies at least put in enough film to cover the subject. Why not do a 2 part (or dare I say 3) part movie. If you need help spending your production time wisely see Peter Jackson. (Really I know that this would never happen, but hey) 2. Try and get the story back on track. Some how. 3. Lets see the actors! (Really Lupin, Snape, Hagrid, McGonagall, did you have another gig? Were where they?"
"JamMcnight9","2","71","120","11 July 2007"," A Huge Disappointment
","When I first saw the previews for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I was giddy because i actually thought that OOTP would be magical, amazing, and action-packed. How ignorant i was. Now i know it is a 870 page book but if a fantasy movie based on a book is going to be done right, it calls for a longer movie or the possibility of doing a part two. Trying to cram all this information in two hours makes the audience member feel incredibly stuffed and congested. The cameras were too fast, actors spoke their lines too fast. Probably the greatest example is the scene where Severus gets his pants pulled down by James. A great scene in the book but turned into five seconds of incoherence in the movie. Uncle Vernon is a yeller, plain and simple. He did not shout once in OOTP. And when did Dudley become a gangster? Why did Flitwick, who looked normal in the first two films, become a guy with black hair and moustache? That's not Flitwick and his arm pump is not something he would do (although i must admit it was hilarious). George and Fred deserved a bigger finish. Sure the fireworks were OK, but in the book how the were cornered and they grab their brooms, talk to peeves, and escape. That was a finish. Now i understand that the films are becoming darker and more sinister and stuff. And because they're so creative, they make the set and the movie more visually darker to convey this metaphor. However, as an audience member, i want to see the faces of the actors and set. Having the centaur scene with no lines and unable to see things clearly makes it look disorientated and confusing. Actors and actresses that make a grand appearance in the book would get more time in the movie. If i didn't read the books and saw Tonks doing her pig and duck thing i would seriously be like ""WTF?"" Seriously, people who are not die-hard fans need to be explained things. You would think they would explain the prophecy a bit better with Neville and all, but no they couldn't take the time to do that. They just made silly mistakes. Poking a dementor in the eye when it is choking you? Seriously now. And what happened to Quidditch? It was action packed and amazing in the first two films, but yet again, they succeeded in taking away the magic that made the first two films fabulous. I believed the final battle would be breath-taking but was I robbed on that notion. Like the movie, the prophecy room was tight and overcrowded. No brain room? And it wasn't avada kedarva that killed sirius. However, i grow tired of complaining about this movie. Hopefully people will just read the book instead, which unlike the movie, is good."
"stace_spot","9","367","680","28 June 2007"," Amazing movie put forth by a stellar cast!
","Once again, I believe that the series is only getting better with each progressive movie. I attended a preview screening tonight and was completely blown away by the movie. While quite a bit of detail was lost in the movie, how can you really expect a three hour movie to capture what takes Rowling hundreds of pages to explain? This said, Yates did a great job capturing the spirit of the book, and he had me on my seat from the first scene all the way through the end of the movie. I cried, I laughed, and I am pretty sure there were a few times where I couldn't breathe from the tension.<br/><br/>What really made the movie for me was the talent of the actors. As expected, the older cast members deliver some of the best acting England has to offer. Sidenote: there is something about Emma Thompson where every time she cries in a movie, I start tearing up myself. I was especially impressed with how much Daniel, Emma (Watson), and Rupert have improved their acting since the last movie. Having come from seeing Daniel in Equus two weeks ago, I was expecting a lot from him. Even after seeing him display more intensity than I thought possible on stage, he surprised me in Phoenix. His emotions were so raw and genuine that I literally got goosebumps.<br/><br/>Well done to the cast and crew! I can't wait for the next one!!"
"kingtrio9","9","183","330","11 July 2007"," JK's biggest book to the screen, mission impossible? Mission accomplished!!!
","For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word ""how"". How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.<br/><br/>This seemingly impossible task is well accomplished by astute summation of plot and concentration of action. Also, the heart and soul of the book, i.e. the thematic spirit of the story and Rowling's shining gift for characterization are given the fullest support in this film more so than in any previous HP movie.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix basically involves Harry being persecuted by the government for telling a truth they refuse to believe all while dealing with the same feelings of teen angst and emerging love that any ordinary teen finds stressful and consuming. Only through the love and dedication of family and especially friends does Harry come across the means to fight back against the government, elude his enemies and make some sense of his emotional turmoil.<br/><br/>Most reader's will come out of the theater saying ""I wish they had shown this or that."" However, all will leave satisfied that they have been treated to a faithful rendering brilliantly acted and directed. All the HP movies are a ""good watch"" but in this one we get a great movie.<br/><br/>We have the advantage of going to our HP movies with a non-reader and she was, to say the least, blown away and pronounced it a near classic. My daughter and myself have read and reread the books many times over and came out limp from exhilaration, our keen anticipation very much fulfilled.<br/><br/>A few highlights: The acting is best ever. The three principles push themselves to a new level. My favorite new characters were Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge, excellent (you'll love to hate her) and Natalia Tena as Tonks. Natalia is sheer delight. She is the penultimate punk rock witch girl(think Dead Milkmen here). And Helena Bonham Carter is in her medium (she played the witch Morganna in the movie Merlin) as the dangerous and demented Bellatrix LeStrange.<br/><br/>Battle scenes: breathtaking. Commraderie: The only HP that actually caused me to get teary so heartfelt are the portrayals of friendship and family.<br/><br/>See the film knowing that unless you want a 10hour movie some things are going to have to go. Leave having enjoyed a film that takes the beans and water and instead of a nice large coffee treats one to a perfectly concentrated, most artfully brewed and extremely tasty espresso. It has been said before but truth is truth: BEST YET!"
"jenn-dipardo","1","65","112","12 July 2007"," Why change the book ?
","First of all, i want to comment on the high points of the movie. I think the acting was great, the characters looked great, and the way they played out their parts were great. I like how Bellatrix looked and acted, it really gave you the feel for the type of character she is. On another note, the parts they cut out were parts most people were probably excited for. The circular room not being there? Honestly, why cut out one of the most interesting parts of the movie? The brain room, and the other rooms were important keys to the excitement of the movie. Also the fact that none of the children were hurt like in the book was a little overrated. Yes, this is a child's movie, but including an unconscious Hermione, Neville's broken nose, Ron being attacked by the brains and Ginny's broken ankle wouldn't have been too disgusting. Also the fight at the end between Dumbledore and Voldemort was cheap because it did not happen like it should have in the book. Neville and Harry should have been the only people in the veil room when the Death eaters were threatening for the prophecy and Bellatrix didn't even use Crucio on Neville like she does in the book to get the prophecy. The prophecy wasn't supposed to be heard till the 6th book. It was supposed to say the prophecy when it breaks. Siruis' death went way too fast, Harry didn't even mourn it. And what was up with the absence of the two way mirrors? That was such an emotional, important part of the story. Knowing that if he would have used the mirror instead of rushing out. Why was there no Marietta? In the book Cho never told, Hermione jinxed the list to put boils on the persons face. There was no dating between Harry and Cho. There was no DA coins to tell of the meetings. How are they going to do the 6th movie where Malfoy says ""i used Grangers idea with the coin, like the DA used to talk with the death eaters without being intercepted"" if there was no coins! And Harry breaking into Snapes mind instead of dipping his head into the penseive was stupid. Not to mention they cut the memory way too short. And didn't even have Lily stick up for him. It was cheap. <br/><br/>They changed too many things, it made the movie not worth buying. They had at LEAST an hour of time left to add things in. I would have rather have sat there for another hour, for a more detailed movie. They jumped around too much. Not only that, they need to keep ONE director, instead of switching like every movie. <br/><br/>Thanks, Jenn"
"Cocacolaguy912-2","10","229","435","11 July 2007"," Best out of the five, but if you are only going to focus on the plot problems, don't bother because your whining will only give the rest of us headaches...
","Longest Book. Shortest movie.<br/><br/>That simple fact is pretty annoying...I mean how can they compact such a complex book into 138 minutes? They don't. They can't. And to try would be suicidal film making, doing nothing but making a big mess out of the film.<br/><br/>So let me tell you right now, if you insist on the plot adaptation being great, don't bother to see this movie. Don't feel guilty or disloyal.<br/><br/>But if you can ignore that fact that scenes are left out, you may rather enjoy this film, as did I.<br/><br/>The acting is just wonderful. A plethora of veteran, English actors only means good things. Whether it be Danielle Radcliffe with his surprisingly good display of disgust and hope, or Ralph Fiennes with his ingeniously frightening demeanor, or even Imelda Staunton with her deadly, torturous personality...you are bound to be awed by the cast.<br/><br/>Technical Aspects are also wonderful. Everything from the special effects, which are in my opinion incredible, to the cinematography, which make the unfathomably stunning set pieces look even more beautiful.<br/><br/>And since I insist on being a jerk and making fun of people who pay attention to the plot, let's talk about it. The plot, as you may of guessed, is fine with me. It's consistent. The movie went by fast but it didn't seem to just ""skip along"" which I believe is a negative trait possessed by the 4th one. They did leave out quite a lot of things, arguably some things that they could have easily included without making the film ""a mess"". But they didn't, and there is nothing I can do about it. I don't care enough to point my finger and say ""the movie was terrible because...and this event happened at the beginning...when...and so..."" You get my point.<br/><br/>In short, I feel they did a great job. Again, yes, they took out a lot, and it is technically the worst adaptation when compared to the other four, but then again it is a very complex book, and I feel they made the right decisions. It is obvious they weren't lazy.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10, and will stand by my opinion it is the best out of the five films, easily."
"andwhatroses","4","43","75","11 July 2007"," two thumbs down
","I am the biggest Potter fan that I know, and i can honestly say that i HATED this movie. The acting was a touch better and the effects were up to their normal standard, but the complex, involved plot that the novel provides was completely butchered on screen. I do understand that they cannot include every detail of an 800+ page book, but certain obvious details, such as Lily Evans in Snape's memory, any mention of Neville's inclusion in the prophecy, the two-way mirror from Sirius, the locket in Grimmauld Place, Regulus Black...these details are important to future plots. They SHOULD make an appearance. The story doesn't make any sense without them. The memory itself, my favorite scene in all six books so far, is all of twenty seconds and the only characters you see clearly are James and Severus. Bellatrix says Avada Kedavra to kill Sirius. There is a reason JK Rowling did not specify the name of that jet of light that killed Sirius, and by putting the no-returns-possible Avada Kedavra on it squashes any sort of believable return from him in future. While still visually appealing, and though it hurts to type it, the film is, overall, terrible. You can't make excuses for the plot-moving details that were left on the cutting room floor."
"mantaray_books","6","45","79","11 July 2007"," A ""Cliff Notes"" version of the book
","I've been eagerly awaiting this episode, thinking it was going to be much more action-packed or incorporating some of the more juicy bits of narrative from the over-800 page book. I ought to have known going in that, at 2:18 running time, the movie was too short. Even considering the tweaking that needed to be done to incorporate information differently than the book presents it (like by-passing the house elves storyline), at least a half-hour more could've been left in to really build up the story. The scenes we do see are well acted, there are obvious clues alluding to the final installment, and the special effects are dazzling. But one leaves the theater breathless and disoriented as if one ate a rich meal too quickly. Especially exasperating considering we had to sit through 20 minutes of TV commercials and coming attractions--I would've paid extra to see another 20 minutes of movie instead."
"jonk-20","2","47","83","11 July 2007"," Yet again the movie disappointed me
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix surpassed even my lowest expectations for the film. The movies have been steadily declining since the third movie. It's not that they're bad just standing alone, but as they are based on the phenomenal books by J K Rowling they should at least try to stick somewhat close to them. This however almost never happens, it's as though the director just wants to make his film and get his money, it doesn't do the books justice in the least. I left the theater fuming because of all the changes made to the books. I'm not naive, I understand that a lot must be taken out to fit the time length but good God they could have shortened the 10 minute broom ride in the beginning and used it to make the confrontation in Dumbledore's office a little more accurate, or they could have added the rest of the rooms in the Department of Mysteries which were noticeably absent. Those were the 2 parts of the films that I was actually looking forward to seeing but was yet again disappointed. Instead of hexing every person trying to take him to Azkaban,as is written, Dumbledore simply grabs Fawkes the phoenix and disappears...ooh wow wonderful...God! Also, the Department of Mysteries was almost a joke in itself...apart from the missing rooms the fight between the students/Order and the eaters was also sub par. I just saw flashes of wands as the people just flew around attempting to kill each other, it was an incoherent mess. There are other major flaws in the movies but i don't have to time or patience to discuss them at the moment. If you are going to see the movie and haven't read the books or aren't extremely familiar with them, then the movie will probably be very good to you, however if you are like me, and have read the books multiple times, lower your expectations for the film and grit your teeth, you'll probably leave disappointed."

I have just returned home from the 12:01 showing of the film and I can't believe that I will never get those two hours of my life back. I had my reservations about some of the actors chosen to play the characters (Umbridge, Tonks, Luna) but these portrayals were not bad, Tonks because you really have no idea who she is, she is only in 2 scenes. Trelawney was sacked before Christmas, all Weasley products were banned by a decree, (apparently Umbridge was way ahead of us all because Weasley products don't really come out until book 6)Grimmauld place is never cleaned during the holidays, so the locket that is so crucial to book 7 never shows itself as being in the house, I could go on and on. It makes me wonder if anyone at Warner Bros has read the book, and how in the world JKR let this movie be made. On the other hand, 3 of the people who went with me had never read the books and they thought that the movie was great, action packed."

It was not a terrible movie, but it was definitely the worst adapation yet and very fast paced and under explained. To the person who has not read the books, and only seen the movies they may be lost/easily confused as to what is happening. I expected that they would leave out many things, and I had already forgiven them for that before I entered the theatre. What bothered me the most was the fact that they couldn't seem to set on a mood. It seemed like the movie was confused as to whether it was supposed to be a comedy or a drama. They added in American one line humour, changed some of the plot lines around, and failed to make Harry seem more than a cardboard person. The CGI effects are amazing, the soundtrack is great and will put you in the mood. However, be warned that : Quidditch was taken out of the movie, Draco was reduced to a cameo appearance, Hermoine is unlike herself, and it seemed to drag on towards the end."

The Grand Hall was pathetic, and it seems roughly 50 students attend Hogwarts now.<br/><br/>The scenes were pasted together in clumsy montages that you assume must surely end sometime. They don't. The movie jumps from one area to the next. Obviously, some things need to be left out of the movie, but =everything! Where was Quidditch? Where was the rest on the Pensieve scene? Where were the classes and the students and the people? We saw more of the Muggle World than the Wizarding one! Where did the money go? Those special effects were definitely sub-par for what we've come to expect. Grawp looked far too cartoon-like, and, good gods, don't get me started on the pathetic blue-screen.<br/><br/>I just sat through +2 hours of Harry being angst-ridden. Granted, that happened in the book, but that wasn't all that happened in the book. It had redeeming qualities, but apparently those needed to be left out.<br/><br/>HBP is, by far, my favorite book of the series.

I'm sure I didn't read that in the book. <br/><br/>They didn't show Ron and Hermione getting Prefects <br/><br/>After the Fight Dumbledore didn't tell Harry all about the prophecy. That was a big mistake. How are they going to explain why Voldemort went after Harry and why Prof. Trelawney is such an important Character <br/><br/>But most importantly what about the Quidditch. About how Ron gets on the team. This obviously means they don't plan to do Quidditch again. They can't, unless they find a way to write Ron in. <br/><br/>The thing I missed most were things like the classes, especially Hagrids. It had no sense of time. It was like they had just taken out bits of the main plot and stuck them together. Where were the exams especially the practical exams.<br/><br/>Now for the good things: <br/><br/>Luna; She was perfect.

The screen version is a mess from A to Z, beginning with having no definable story, wooden acting, and throwing Rowling's message of GOOD vs EVIL in the trash.<br/><br/>Lord Vandermort is still alive, you see, and Harry knows this, but before he can convince others to take action a new teacher takes charge of Hogwart's, throwing traditional school values away such as confronting evil. She reminds us of today's liberal teachers who hammer their agenda at the kids and deal with dissent via detention and other Nazi-like decrees. Such a character cries out for a face-off and rejection by the students, but the plot is so poor that.........<br/><br/>Harry, Hermione and Ron lead some of the brave students to the Order of the Phoenix --- which is no more than a secret room at Hogwart's, lined with bookcases full of old books; but devoid of any defined Code of Honor or any such thing to tell what Phoenix was all about.<br/><br/>The acting is wooden and dreadful, beginning with Dumbledor but is pervasive through the entire cast. I have a long standing crush on Hermione as played by Emma Watson; but Miss Watson is given almost no opportunity to portray Hermione's strong character; instead reduced to A Team-like walks alongside Harry and Ron. Her dialog is way shorter than my review. Rupert Grint --- I don't recall Ron as having a word of dialog. Harry kisses an Asian girl with Hermione and Ron watching. We get no indication whether Hermione cares, or whether she and Ron are now a pair.<br/><br/>By using way-too-familiar tricks such as swooping zoom lens swipes and a ""wall of noise"" style musical score, the film tries to convey that a story, some sort of conflict, is going on; but nothing is happening.<br/><br/>Another thing is the magic --- which is undefined in terms of purpose or limits. Whenever the filmmakers lose confidence in their plot-starved storytelling they rely on suddenly smashing glass and other noisy nonsense --- in no way like other Potter films where you knew the how and why.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't believe for one second that 11,500 moviegoers input a score of 10 for Order of Phoenix. Too often recently it's obvious of studio meddling to spoil honest input to the IMDb website. Studios have been buying good reviews in newspapers for decades; it just makes sense they'd corrupt input to this site. Order of the Phoenix is a dreadful trashing of J K Rowling and no real Harry Potter fan would score this mess a 10. As a Security person, I have no idea how to prevent studio feed into these ratings -- still allowing you and me access; but shame on them."

","With their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>At this point in the series, the story takes a decidedly darker and more sinister turn. This could be because of the subject matter: the students spend less time in class and more time preparing for real world evil. It could also be the introduction of a new crew. Not only has the director changed (again) but the screenplay has a new hand, making the very feel somewhat off. I have not read the books, but I get the impression a great deal was left out to account for time and to make the plot run smoother.<br/><br/>The best addition to this film from previously ones is Luna Lovegood. She was apparently in the books for a while as a minor character but did not come on to the movies until now. Her role is fairly small, but important, and her character adds the one bit of lightness to this script (aside from possibly the Weasley's pranks). They cast the perfect actress.<br/><br/>What really stands out about this film is how political it is. Parallels could be made between this and the rise of fascism or McCarthyism. There is talk of order, obedience, conformity, the need for a government to have a firm hand and to protect its own butt when damaging information comes to light. We know from the previous film that Voldemort is back, and the Ministry of Magic likely knows it, too. But they go out of their way to deny this and blame other people for terrible acts that have occurred. This political act of protecting a reputation slows down the process of preparing for Voldemort and stands in the way of clearing Sirius Black's name. The outcome could have been much improved and lives could have been spared if the government was simply honest.<br/><br/>I believe this to be the weakest film up to this point. I did not care for the shift in spirit (the opening seemed more like a drama than a fantasy film). And i did not like feeling like parts were missing. The plot was almost made too simply, especially compared to prior episodes where mysteries had to be solved. There was no twist or surprise here, just a throwaway film to get you to the next one."
"hugh-g-rctin","7","56","105","14 July 2007"," Nothing like the book but a decent enough movie
","So many great parts were skipped over, rushed with ridiculous cliché transition scenes, or simply changed because, apparently, it's impossible to include everything. But what can anyone reasonably expect? <br/><br/>I went into this expecting exactly what I saw, it's still just a tad annoying hearing people talk about how impossible it would be to follow the book. It's not impossible at all. Look at the matrix 2&3, look at pirates of the caribbean 2&3, look at LOTR (it's all one continuous story). Lots of ""stories"" have had to be split up into multiple films and they all worked great. It's just a tad short-sighted to say it wouldn't work with a harry potter film. I think a lot of what people enjoy is looking at the wizard world, seeing cool looking spells, and generally learning more about everything to do with the harry potter universe. You don't get much of that when a 26 hour read is condensed into a 2.5 hour film. I personally would love to see more of the ""boring"" parts of the book simply because it's interesting seeing a high-budget Hollywood interpretation of what was in the book. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't be the least bit disappointed if the film-makers simply came out and said ""this book is too long to put into a single film with out leaving out a lot of the book and changing a lot of other parts, so we're releasing it in two films."" It's completely understandable. It's an 800 page book! LOTR books were only 400-600 pages and the films were considerably longer than any of the harry potter films.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a decent enough movie though. Great special effects, good enough acting (I wouldn't go so far as to say it was amazing). I'd say it's basically a standard high-budget film. Entertaining to watch, well worth my $10 so I could come and complain how it was nothing like the book :)"

","I, like millions of other people, am a hard-core Harry Potter fan. After seeing the Fourth movie (which, in my opinion, was the weakest yet) I was a bit optimistic when I stepped foot into the private screening for this film. I feared that it was follow the steps of it's proceeder. BOY WAS I WRONG!!!! Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is absolutely amazing! Filled with eye-popping special effects, great acting (Daniel captured Harry's feelings and emotions with pitch perfect accuracy) a great cast, and wonderful cinematography! This film has a Prisoner of Azkaban feel to it, but is MUCH darker.<br/><br/>The climax of the film in the Ministry of Magic--although brief--is Movie Magic at its best!!! Prepare yourselves for one of the most exciting moments out of the WHOLE series!!!! Overall, I was not disappointed. There ARE some differences from the book, but that will slide off your shoulders once you see this masterpiece. **** out of ****!"
"sullibrandon","5","13","20","12 July 2007"," The Magic is Gone
","In Order of the Phoenix, David Yates gives us a bland spectacle that lacks any real magic or character development and features a disjointed storyline and over-the-top acting. I reasonably enjoyed the book, even though it was over long and nothing really happened, but I didn't really like the movie, and as I'll show you, most of that has nothing to do with the book.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Harry at home in Privet Drive, morosely sitting on a swing and making angst-ridden faces. This didn't bode well. It didn't help anymore when Dudley waddled along with his friends and stuttered out lines that seemed to be read from a cue card offscreen. After a brief fight and chase the two are assaulted by a couple of poorly-animated Dementors that have gotten a pointless makeover since the third movie. They have lost much of their threat and seem just to be vapor wisps of CGI floating around. I asked myself, ""What has happened to Harry Potter?"" Soon Harry is whisked off to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, where the Order of the Phoenix, a group dedicated to fighting Voldemort since his return, resides. Eventually he goes off to school. All of this happens within 20 minutes, which is actually a good thing. Rowling takes 200 pages to get to the school and spends a lot of time dithering on fanciful descriptions of things, but David Yates takes us straight to Hogwarts. If only he had done it in an understandable manner.<br/><br/>The thing that Order struggles most with is finding a central story other than simply Harry. In a movie called ""The Order of the Phoenix"" you would think that it would feature the Order more than anything else, yet most of the people in the order get very little screen time. Namely Lupin, Arthur, and Sirius. It is clear from the beginning that this film is going to be about Harry and not much else. It even screws this up, though, as Harry's first crush and girlfriend is merely included because it was featured in the book. We feel none of the fleeting romance that was hinted at in the previous movie. The kiss between Harry and Cho was cheered for, of course, but other than, it was kind of anti-climactic, and nothing ever really came of it. You see Harry and Cho hang out once after that, but she is quickly shrugged aside as if the director said, ""Okay, now that we've got that in, let's move on to the main story.""<br/><br/>The two best actors in this movie are unquestionably Daniel Radcliffe and Imelda Staunton. Radcliffe gives us his best performance since Prisoner of Azkaban, brilliantly conveying Harry's inner struggle as he approaches his destiny and realizes what he ultimately must do. The screenplay doesn't give him much quality to work with, but practically everything he touches turns to gold. The only person in this film who exceeds him is Imelda Staunton, who plays Dolores Umbridge. Every single line she utters is a wonderful combination of evil and innocence, joy and anger, pain and pleasure. Her character, unfortunately, comes to an unceremonial and disappointing end, but right up until her last breath before she is carried offscreen, Staunton does an amazing job. Alan Rickman (Snape) of course is astounding, but he doesn't show up often enough. David Thewlis (Lupin) is also incredibly accomplished - his first line in the movie had me practically cheering, as most every bit of acting before that had seemed dull and forced. Maggie Smith (McGonagall) effortlessly masters whatever scene she's in. Rupert Grint (Ron) shares great friendship chemistry with Harry. Emma Watson (Hermione) tries way too hard and every line she utters sounds forced. Her scenes with Radcliffe and Grint carry none of the ease of previous outings. Michael Gambon only reminded me of how excellent Richard Harris was. Admittedly, no one could have been better than Harris. The effortless presence that he carried, the humble glory, the slightly insane wisdom, the endearing fatherly quality, and the awe and respect he instilled in others could be felt with every single micro-second that he was on screen. Gambon, at first, seemed like a good choice.Now, he seems more like a raggedy bum than a wise old wizard. He does have his moments, and it's clear Gambon is still an excellent actor, but he better get his act together or people are going to wish HE would keel over so that a better actor could replace HIM.<br/><br/>Even given all these faults, I might have been able to accept the film better if the effects had been up to par, but sadly, this is not the case at all. The finale is pretty spectacular, and the special effects there are some of the best I've seen this year - we finally get to see true magic battled out in a grand and uncontrollable fight scene. Everything else, though, falls far too short of the standards set by the previous four films. Even Goblet of Fire was passable because of the great special effects (the dragon looked completely realistic). But this one just seems lazy. Everything is dark, dreary, and boring. Where's the movie-making special effects magic that the series has become known for? This movie, if nothing else, succeeds as a good transition - taking us away from the fun and fanciful feel from the first four and bringing us closer to the dark world that we must enter if we are to see this series through to the end. I didn't like most of the film, but it's worth a matinée if you're a Potter fan, and don't worry - you'll only have to wait a year and a half for the next one. Unfortunately, the same director is lined up for the next movie, so here's hoping that a better book will translate into a better film."
"the_nameless_hax0r","1","27","47","11 July 2007"," Worse even than Fracture
","The scriptwriter for this movie should be made to cut a switch for himself to be whipped with. The dramatic scenes were terribly done, and the transitions from sad scenes to happy and back were completely disjointed. Had it been but a half-hour shorter the movie would have turned into a series of unconnected sketches. Every scene was cut far shorter than it needed to be to convey all its information, and there was little transitional material. The action scenes were shot in a manner that reminded me of concert cameramen from the 60s, with almost every shot zoomed in so they could make the ""special effects"" large flashes of color, instead of something requiring effort.<br/><br/>One thing requires special attention. In a good-vs.-evil type of plot, evil can either be a perpetual enemy, with people born good or evil and the two sides fighting standard battles to the death, or a seductive temptress which must be resisted by good people to avoid becoming evil. Harry Potter, of course, takes the former course - except this movie, which for no apparent reason added two or three scenes of Harry being tempted by evil, including one with Voldemort actually encouraging Harry like a devil-on-your-shoulder from a fairy tale.<br/><br/>Don't see this movie. It's plenty long enough to waste an obscene amount of your time, but still half the length it would need to hold itself together."
"jeremiahgood","1","31","55","11 July 2007"," Waste of MONEY!!!!
","This movie could not have been more of a let down! I wasn't expecting much from this film, I have grown to understand the movies can not be as detailed as the books, but really. This film should have been the Empire Strikes Back of the series, with a few great bits of action and lots and lots of set up with a OK pay off that left you counting the days till the next film. Instead we get a VERY VERY VERY watered down version of the story, with changes so people with a short attention span don't have to remember anything about this film for the next one. At least with the last 4 films the story was the underscore to the action or special effects, with this one none of that came across. This film turned into a disjointed grouping of odd scenes with nothing really to 1. set the time line of the over all film and 2. does nothing to forward the ongoing story of good vs. evil.<br/><br/>The basic story is Harry is a whinny 15 year old who no one believes, does not listen to anyone, and wants to be all EMO about it till he screws up and leads everyone into Voldemort's trap. While in the actual book all of this is about 250 of the 900+ pages but in the film version it is turned into about 10 minutes of a 2 hour 18 minute film. The key scenes from the book are some what included in some way even if the story that should have been told as part that scene is put some place and some time else. The wrap up, which has been done very well in the last 4 films at the end with a slap in the face to help everyone understand what they just saw, is done in such a hap-hazard in the very start, of what should have been, a great battle that you don't even remember what was said.<br/><br/>The only 3 things I would say that did help this movie were 3 of the new characters, which were all very under used. Dolores Umbridge who is done perfectly in this film as the condescending new DADA teacher, which they really missed out on not going deeper with her (which I am sure is because she is only in this one book) because she could have stolen the film. Luna Lovegood who, to my surprise, did come across almost better then she did in the books as the ""out there"" 4th year Ravenclaw, but was used as a narrative character to explain plot holes and be background filler with Neville and Ginny rather then be one of the stand out characters that they all should have been. But the character that made the best transition from book to film had to be Kreacher, which falls right behind the story as my biggest let down in the film because he was so under used (only 2 scenes) and was never really explained to the audience of what his reason for being was. Those 3 almost make up for the complete loss of purpose for characters such as Tonks, Bellatrix Lestrange, and even Grawp. But can not even start to make up for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the book DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!!!! If you have never took the time to read the books and only see the films, take my advice READ THE BOOKS!"
"bradskynoon","6","64","125","12 July 2007"," its OK, but don't expect too much
","Pretty much what you'd expect, I wanted to like it but found it hard to.<br/><br/>It wasn't a bad film and I'm not sure how people who haven't read it will find it, but there's too much cut from the book.<br/><br/>There were quite a few cuts that I didn't miss at all but there was time and space for a few scenes which would have helped move the story along.<br/><br/>Out go the quidditch and st mungos and the giants and most of grimmuld place and most of the climax in the dept of mysteries. And time is spent focusing on the kid's relationships and such. (Apparently). It seemed to be on Harry 95% of the film.<br/><br/>With SO much character development in the book there was always going to be a problem to condense it, but like the last film it moves so fast it feels like a 2 hour long montage and seems to just hint at whats going on while assuming you've probably read it and can fill in the blanks yourself.<br/><br/>I have read it - and I struggled to get into the movie.<br/><br/>It never quite finds its place and just serves as a visual feast for fans.<br/><br/>Some good gags and a lot of missed opportunities, LOTS, and some big continuity errors."

","There were previous editions of the franchise that I liked. One had a real rhythm; another leveraged architecture in a truly competent way.<br/><br/>I suppose if you are invested in the books, this one advances the story a bit: some few revelations; another battle, another death; another new character. But I am not invested in the books. I'm invested in the cinematic adventure that comes from a film that is well made. This one isn't, and it cannot be blamed on the choppy nature of the source material.<br/><br/>The effects are decidedly cheaper, and in some spots even bad. There's an encounter between the three ""children"" and a giant. Its handled the way it would have been in the fifties or before. Watch as the girl is picked up, then put down; see how awkwardly the camera moves so that it is never looking where you might so that it doesn't have to show something difficult.<br/><br/>The effects, by the way are wildly uneven. We all know that projects like this job out scenes to dozens of subcontractors all over the planet. Each one uses a different set of tools, a different notion of how the camera behaves and frames, a different belief in the cosmology of magic and an often radically different set of artistic values. So some special effects scenes are honky bad as mentioned. Some of the better ones (there's a fireworks scene) belong in a different movie and surely a different world.<br/><br/>And of course since the director is weak, the older characters played by veteran actors are incoherent. Each is left to create their own character and inhabit their own world. Can anyone believe that the characters played by Helena Bonham Carter and Emma Thompson could exist in the same dramatic world? Can anyone believe that Rickman and Gambon were ever in the same universe in terms of how they were allowed to see themselves?<br/><br/>The director is weak because the producers are so frippin rigid and dumb that any talented director refused the offer. Rumors are that a score were approached.<br/><br/>So far as the scenes, there were only two that I found tolerable. One was a fireworks scene. It was more cartoonish than we have seen in any Potter movie so far, but at least it was dimensional. The second is a few seconds in the final battle where thirty foot corridors of shelves collapse and the globes on those break and fall, or fall and break. Its a static shot, but well imagined. <br/><br/>Except for those moments, you'll be checking your watch. There's no magic, and we just don't care about these now unattractive people.<br/><br/>If you get your kicks from making fun at inept governments with a hint that the screwups may be motivated by conspiracy beyond stupidity -- and notions that an assistant (here white) and mouthpiece is a woman who lives in a fantasy world who explains reality away, you'll find that here. But not in an interesting way.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the first Harry Potter movie directed by David Yates. Some fans love Yates and his different style, but there are people who don't like him, myself included. Sure, he's the one responsible for my favourite half of the series, where Harry is growing up and everything is darker. But in the movies the characters aren't as deep and the darkness feels more like a colour scheme than a change in the story telling.<br/><br/>Yates's style chooses action over the story - which makes no sense when considering what the novel was like. Order of the Phoenix had very little action, but it explored wonderfully, for example, Harry after seeing Voldemort returning and seeing Cedric Diggory being brutally murdered. In the movie you can see it bothers Harry, he is incredibly angry, but that's that. If you haven't read the book it only seems like Harry is having his puberty and therefore a bit moody, even if you could claim he has a case of PTSD. <br/><br/>There are many emotional scenes in the novel that weren't included in the movie. They were completely forgotten or replaced by something really, really weird, apart from few that were important to the plot - they saved the scenes that were important when looking at this one movie, but ignored the story as a whole, and they seemed to figure character development was not that important. Harry Potter series is not seven separate stories it's one story in seven parts. <br/><br/>At this point it's clear the filmmakers didn't care about the story as much as making the movies and making fans watch them and just get through the whole series. <br/><br/>But it's lovely to see the film allowing few characters develop properly: like Neville during the DA. They tried to fake Ginny developing as well by only showing us that she is indeed amazing with spells. Still the filmmakers have forgotten to give her any sort of personality. I love her in the books but in movies she's just an empty husk - skillful of course, but she's not as interesting as in the books. ' Order of Phoenix is over-simplified and is trying to force a story into a film form in the easiest way possible. Yes, sure, they didn't have so much time to focus on the stories individually considering the stars were growing up but still, this is ridiculous."

","Well, let me put it this way, it's 2 1/2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.<br/><br/>There was soooo much detail left out. The scenes were choppy, seemingly unconnected; nothing was explained. There wasn't any character development. It's as if all they (the filmmakers) were concerned about was getting the gist of it, on film.<br/><br/>It wasn't well established, the horrible summer Harry was having....how angry and isolated he was feeling....how he was hiding under the window outside in the grass trying to listen to the news....the tension between Harry, Hermione and Ron, when they all reunited for the first time at the Order HQ's... nothing about the Prefects had been mentioned.<br/><br/>The Dursleys in the book, threatened to kick Harry out until Dumbledore sent the screaming letter to the aunt reminding her of her vow.<br/><br/>The Order itself was not fully established either. The history of the house at 12 Grimmauld Place and the screaming portraits of Sirius Black's mother.<br/><br/>Professor Umberidge was a rich and nasty character that they didn't fully develop or exploit. How she kept Harry from playing Quidditch - in fact Quidditch wasn't even mentioned and this was the first introduction (in the book) where Ron played for the team and how his confidence affected his playing.....<br/><br/>The Threstrals and how they've always been a part of the school - not used at all - just a mere side note....not to mention, that there wasn't any reference whatsoever to how the others who had not seen death, how they were coping with riding the animals they couldn't see.<br/><br/>There was absolutely no reference to the Pensieve which Harry got caught sneaking a peak at Snapes memories....had that been established, it would have gone a long way to explain why Snape was so P.O.'d about Harry having witnessed his torment at the hands of Harry's father when they were in school.<br/><br/>In fact I would say that nothing about the story, or the characters in the story was explored at any length whatsoever. True enough, the story is getting darker, but in the book, there were plenty of comical moments, not so much in the film.<br/><br/>The relationship with Cho wasn't developed or explored at all, what about when they all went into town and Harry and Cho had the date at the sweets shop, and how she got ticked off when Harry had said he'd meet with Herminone.<br/><br/>And it wasn't Cho that squealed, it was her friend, Marietta AND it (the movie) didn't go into hardly any development of the D.A.<br/><br/>The D.A. and how it came about, the fact that calling it Dumbledore's Army was in jest.<br/><br/>The twins and the development of their characters and how they were testing things out for their jokes shop never took place. Without any mention of Quidditch and how they had received lifetime bans from playing Quidditch, their decision to leave school before their seventh year didn't seem to have much of a basis. What a waste too, there wasn't nearly enough madness and mayhem shown in the movie that the twins caused as their final farewell to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>The hospital, St. Mungo's and the introduction of Neville Longbottom's storyline was completely left out. I think this was a grave injustice to the plot, as it goes to give more background to Harry later on that it could have been either him or Neville. Again, no character development.<br/><br/>There was absolutely no use of Gary Oldman or Emma Thompson or Maggie Smith, even Alan Rickman seemed like set dressing. Such a waste of wonderful etraordinary talent.<br/><br/>The story of Professor Trelawny and why Dumbledore kept her around because she was the one who foretold of the prophecy and Dumbledore was the one who filled in the gaps about the rest of the prophecy as he was one of the two witnesses.<br/><br/>I just wanted to quote my mother, who is a dedicated Harry Potter fan ""The action was good, but there was no storyline."" That's the bottom line. No storyline, whatsoever, which is utterly disappointing, given how rich, engaging, with multi-layered complexities the actual story in novel form is.<br/><br/>Honestly, if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have known what the hell was going on....there wasn't any continuity, the story didn't flow.<br/><br/>If I were J.K. Rowling, I'd be mightily P.O.'d at how they'd butchered my fantastical tale of the boy wizard. - But that's just my opinion."

","Well, for me it was a pretty great movie. I am too, a huge book fan. But I know that cinema and literature are two well respected but totally different arts. The narrative in both has to be managed differently so the message can get to the spectators. So I understand the challenged it is to adapt a novel and turn it into a script. <br/><br/>My solution is to enjoy the movie for what it is and what is made of. If I am going to compare it harshly I'll do it in its own gender: with the rest of the Harry potter films. This is a movie that along with the goblet of fire helps us experience the evolution in the characters. The kids are growing and now they turned into teenagers, who have to deal with so many issues.<br/><br/>The visuals: are great, but at times they seem to have changed effects that had been used in previous movies. To me that's a mistake, as a movie spectator, no matter how the direction changes I always want to see certain connection between movies that will keep me believing that no matter who is behind it, this is always a Harry potter sequel. ***Spoilers*** Two effects that changed a lot were the dementors and Sirius talking to Harry through the fire in the chimney. Still, that final battle is really impressive.<br/><br/>***spoilers** The actors: The old actors seem to be giving a lot and that's great. The new actors showed quite potential for the characters. Dolores: is pretty convincing as a despicable just plain odious teacher. Tonks: is sweet in a way and funny in other, to me that said well about her. Bellatrix: I think she was my favorite. She had this crazy, detestable glow. Although her intervention was small, I don't think anybody was left with doubts about her personality or her further importance in the story. Finally, Luna: sweet, strange, not comprehended, sometimes creepy. But her addition to the gang was progressive and well assumed. I think Voldemort is amazing! His intervention in the goblet of fire and now in this movie just makes me see that Ralph Fiennes couldn't be more perfect. <br/><br/>The music: ¿Honestly? At times I almost hated the music. I just beg for john Williams to get back in the sequel. I'm sorry but the music in this movie was just plain, sometimes even dull. It was nothing compared to the previous four. If they are going to change Williams, they should do it for someone in the same high category. <br/><br/>I have to admit that my favorite movies are goblet of fire and in second place Prisoner of Azkaban. But order of phoenix gave out great tools to continue to experience the wonders that come up ahead in the lives of these amazing characters. I loved the movie getting darker, and I always think that creativity and having the guts to dare to give new aspects into each of the movies are some of the qualities a Harry potter director should have to put it together. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I adore the books, J.K Rowling is a genius. But separately I like to see a well assembled story that will make me experience something as amazing as the Harry potter world. Order of phoenix is great, impressive and emotional. Of course I found stuff I didn't like, but I found stuff I loved, I'm looking forward to the next."

I have read the book, slightly disappointed due to plot editing. I want to share several points of this movie, so i'll start with bad ones.<br/><br/>---FLAWS--- <br/><br/>1) BAD EDITING/SCREENPLAY. Well.. i found it a bit brain-teaser. I think there are SO MUCH things you are going to miss. Anyone who hasn't read the book will going to say ""Why is that""? ""Is that really this?"" I don't really understanded the story"". Prophecies were very briefly described (thanks!, for even describing it). They have made a simple story complicated at some places. I think that was too bad editing. Totally out-of momentum. Several amazing scenes were cut. I want to say, WHY? They have edited. It have been AMESOME if they have made it over 145 minutes or so. Too bad. :-(<br/><br/>2) MOVIE IS PACED FAST AT CLIMAX. Yeah. That was bad. The whole effect of the climax was put down. Moreover, the battle at the prophecy room was too short. The whole climax battle finished up in (speculatively) 15 or 16 minutes. <br/><br/>3) OTHER CHARACTERS LOOKED LIKE EXTRAS. The whole film is based on Harry's point of view, which caused this. Ron and Hermione didn't played any vital role, they looked like as an extras at some points. <br/><br/>4) LESS Screen time. Again, this bad point is produced by runtime. The film is just 138 minutes (without credits). Bellatrix, Dursleys, McGonagal, Snape all had a short screen time and some few scenes. <br/><br/>All the above flaws, big flaws. But still its Harry Potter. Lets look at this movie's +points.<br/><br/>---PLUS-POINTS--- <br/><br/>1) AWESOME ACTING. All of them did an amazing job. Specially Imelda Saunton, Helena Bonham Carter and Daniel Radcliffe. Superb. Umbridge was painfully bad as well as hilarious. Daniel has improved a lot... a lot. Now I think casting of Dan is Sorcerer's Stone was right. And Helena Bonham Carter must be given a Oscar. She had less screen time as Bellatrix, but what I see was totally mind-blowing. She was cruel and looked true fanatic. Other cast also did their job quite well, specially Alan Rickman (again less screen time), Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson (yes, I cried when Trelawney was sacked). Kids did their job as 'more than average'. Gambon has improved a bit, but he still has a long way to go. <br/><br/>2) MUSIC. Well, I want to say music is just superb. It is not of John Williams' level, but It was way better than Goblet's music.<br/><br/>4) SPECIAL EFFECTS. Mind-blowing. Each Potter film is just awe-inspiring in the SFX Field. Most notable- Dementor's Attack, Weasley's exit, Centaur's attack, Thestrals (and Kreacher, which was just for few seconds), Umbridge's Decree explosion, and whole battle (totally breathe-taking moments at the climax). I think this movie accio's an Oscar for Special Effects.<br/><br/>5) GOOD JOB DONE AT OTHER TECHINICAL FIELDS. Other fields, like cinematography, sound-effects, choreography of battle was just of top level.<br/><br/>6) IMAX 3-D. I don't know whether it is a plus-point or not, but IMAX makes this movie an epic. If you watch it in IMAX 3-D than sure you'll remember this movie for ages and you'll give it a 10 on 10... IMAX 3-D is just magic!<br/><br/>Overall, it is surprisingly best movie (I mean Potter movie) so far with some flaws. Not an epic, an awe-awe-some like LOTR-3, But it is way better than Spider-Man 3 and Sherk 3. It is even better than POTC 3. Obviously best movie summer and Potter movie so far. If you are planning to go to watch any other film, I must suggest you if you miss it than you'll be the most unlucky person. Final Note- GO AND SEE IT.."
"sackjigler","9","55","112","11 July 2007"," Loved it
","I have not yet read any of these books but find myself very much engaged in the films. That being said, im not the best judge to the faithfulness of movie to book. However, I can say this, I loved this film. In my opinion it did go with less of the magic, which really made you feel what the kids were going through. The pacing is very good, slow in some parts, but overall good. The performances are much better this time around and it has quite a few stand up and clap moments. It is much better written and directed than the previous efforts, although azkaban is still my favorite, this would have to be second. The ending felt a little rushed and I wish there was more voldemort, but these are very little gripes for a great film truly pushing the limitations of children's story. It really makes you drool for the next picture, especially if you do not read the books. I really hope harry becomes this amazing wizard like it keeps promising and the final battle is full fledged amazing. We will see. Anyway, it's a beautiful film with great performances and dazzling special effects. This one really steers toward an older crowd and I feel younger children might get bored with it, but not us older kids. I don't want to spoil this for everyone, so ill just sum it up by saying that I don't feel this series is losing steam, just gearing up for an amazing finale, and if this transitional film has anything to say about it, I can't wait to see where it goes."
"jhha-2","1","20","36","12 July 2007"," It Stunk miserably
","I thought this was the second worst movie in the series (number 3 being the worst). I know it is not possible to put the whole book into a movie but they left out some pretty important stuff. No quidditch, no prefects, no St. Mungos, etc. Also, why could they not follow the same timeline at least. Snape giving Occlumency lessons before holiday break. I think they could have gotten a little closer to the book. The bad thing is that because of all the stuff they left out, I don't see how HBP could possibly be a good movie. If you watch the movies and don't read the books, you are truly missing out on the story. The movies after 1 and 2 have not done the richness and depth of Rowling's story any justice."
"gallifrey23","2","8","12","27 July 2007"," AVADA KEDAVRA to this Muggle filth
","I LOVE the Harry Potter series; this was my favorite book so you can imagine my excitement when the movie came out. After reading some of the reviews I feel like I missed something because my excitement quickly turned into frustration as I spent most of the movie pulling at my hair and yelling at the screen. I cannot believe that it took 2 years to create a movie that strayed so far from the book that to call it Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is false advertising. <br/><br/>I am a realist and forgiving when it comes to the time constraints the movie creators are dealing with. Turning an 875 page book into a 2.5 hour movie is quite a feat, it's just too bad that it was just a waste. I sat through the movie waiting and hoping that something good would come. I told myself that as horrible as the movie is, the ministry will be the saving grace of the movie, sorry, just as Harry notes in the graveyard scene in the 4th movie, his mother was not there to save him this time, just as there is absolutely nothing in the Muggle or Wizarding world that could have saved this movie. <br/><br/>There are so many time-line inconsistencies as well as inconsistencies with actual events. When I read the book I hoped that all of the brilliant parts of this book would be included in this movie, even though I knew they wouldn't be so you can imagine my surprise when I saw that a young James and Young Sirius had been cast, yes! They're going to do the memory. Well it was like most everything in the movie, disappointing. The best part about this movie was Lucius Malfoy's outfit.<br/><br/>Here are just a few questions: 1) why is it that Dudley seemed like he was doped up on something? 2) Where was the script, most of the time you are sitting and watching while listening to music, as beautiful as the soundtrack is, I can listen to that later? 3) Where were Dumbledore's glasses? 4) Where were Voldermort's sleeves?, can we say too much skin?. 5) Why did we see so little of Bellatrix, McGonagall, and Snape? 6) Where was the ""baby headed"" Death Eater? 7) Priori Incantatum?? I thought that could only happen with twin cores that was a cheap, pathetic way of doing such a powerful part of the story, but what do I know? <br/><br/>To the writers of the movie, FYI the script has already been written, READ IT! I will continue to vent about this movie but I leave with this, in the Dark Lord's words ""I confess myself disappointed."""
"jws1272","1","15","26","15 July 2007"," Harry Potter and the Abysmal Waste of Talent
","I have discovered tonight one of the reasons that I normally DON'T pay full price to see movies! I have just returned from seeing the latest Harry Potter movie adaptation, and suffice to say, I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! The Hollywood movie machine just keeps making progressively worse adaptations of J.K. Rowling's beloved books. I don't know who's making the decisions about this franchise, but whoever they are, obviously never read any of the books, or just doesn't CARE. I mean, who let this slipshod, hacked-up, cinematic Dungbomb get through? For those of you who ""just see the movies"", and have never read the books, or at least THIS one, you may or may not be disappointed. Those of you who complain that the ""movies are just too long"" will be happy, as this is the SHORTEST of all the HP adaptations yet. (Frankly, I just think that America's attention span in general is just TOO DAMN SHORT!) However, therein lies one of the reasons it was so awful. The general spirit of the book, that of The Ministry of Magic trying to quash rumors of Lord Voldemort's return, and the subsequent rebellion by Harry and company, is kept alive, but only to a certain point. I went into the movie expecting a whole hell of a lot more for my movie-going dollar than I got. I even had just finished rereading the book to refresh my mind on all the points of the plot, most of which were just.....not there! <br/><br/>The movie's tone retains the darkness that was brought into the franchise in the third film. (Thank you, Alfonso Cuaron.) The special effects, makeup, and production design teams bring the world of Hogwarts to life with their usual sparkling results. First-time film director David Yates gets spot-on performances from the entire cast. (I still think that the Harry Potter franchise is one of the most perfectly cast in cinema.) Daniel Radcliffe turns in his usual well-done performance as the seemingly always put-upon Harry. HP newcomer Imelda Staunton is PERFECT as the Ministry of Magic's iron fist in Hogwarts, the deplorable Dolores Umbridge. Ironically enough, Staunton's performance was about the only GOOD thing about the movie. The rest of the cast, however, are almost reduced to extended cameos, as little screen time as they're given. Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley and Emma Watson's Hermione Granger could almost be part of the scenery, as could all the other members of ""Dumbledore's Army,"" including Evanna Lynch's performance as new character Luna Lovegood. The ""Order of the Phoenix"" referred to in the title might as well be just a boarding house for people who don't like the Ministry of Magic, for the little we see of it or its members. You'd think that the school year at Hogwarts lasted 2 months, for all we see of the classes! This movie is a waste of a whole lot of actors who've been in BETTER movies, including earlier chapters in this franchise. Aside from Radcliffe's Harry and Staunton's Dolores Umbridge, the rest of the cast might as well almost not be there for most of the movie.<br/><br/>I think a good bit of the blame for this movie being so awful should go to the producers who let this movie get made into the mess that it is. MOST OF ALL, though, I place blame on the hacked-up screenplay by Michael Goldenberg. As not only a Harry Potter fan and reader in general, but also a knowledgeable movie buff, I do realize that SOME parts of every book must be excised from a movie adaptation for sake of continuity and time. This is one of those cases, however, where they took out TOO MUCH! Certain parts of the book which would have made the movie more cohesive have either been omitted, changed, or just plain hacked to shreds!! Goldenberg's script takes the soul out of the movie, and leaves you wanting too much for more. He took a beloved young adult novel, took a chainsaw to it, and put together what was left! This was like watching a bad ""Cliff's Notes"" version! I left the theatre thinking, ""Where's the rest of it?"" I mean, the only other movie adaptation that I can say was as BAD as this one, was last year's tragically done adaptation of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. (I only hope that more mercy is shown by the makers of the upcoming version of Angels & Demons.) Michael Goldenberg's screenplay isn't even a SHADOW of its source material, for what little was left in. I think that a severe injustice has been done to Rowling's work, and let's hope that in years to come, this will be a lesson to filmmakers as how NOT to do an adaptation! If this is where the Harry Potter movie franchise is going, count me OUT for Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows! Never has the phrase ""based on the novel by...."" been ABUSED in such a manner!"
"Tatiana19","1","28","54","26 July 2007"," Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix rolling around in its grave
","It was by far the most disappointing movie-related experience of my life. I wouldn't even go as far as saying that this film was movie based. It was, perhaps, inspired by a book, who knows.<br/><br/>The storyline is rushed and empty. They cut off everything relevant to the plot, and leave everything that's due to impress those who have not read the books in.<br/><br/>They INVENT passages, just to fit in some of the extremely over the top special effects they want to impress us with. That's just underestimating the public.<br/><br/>Not only did they cut many great stuff out, they changed almost every scene. It was like they were trying to show things you get the feeling of after reading the whole book in about thirty seconds, so they had to do it super-obvious for it to show. Most scenes felt ridiculous, over the top and childish.<br/><br/>And, the plot being so rushed, you can't get inside the story, not even remotely in the same way as with the books. I felt like a million miles away, and left the cinema utterly disappointed.<br/><br/>Sure, they made tons of money, but at the cost of murdering a great book, a book in which the Harry Potter series goes from being great, interesting, kids novels about a boy with magical powers, to be an excellent series for all ages, that sure, dwells on the topic of magic, but that is also about human relationships, the characters' personalities, and teenagers' feelings. The book with more character development in the series, and you barely get to hear their names. Absolutely NO character development, but oh sure, they find time for all those irrelevant passages with a shot at winning them a prize for special effects.<br/><br/>Dumbledore's character, again, immensely disappointing, but that we are used to by now. You don't even get the glimpse of the absolutely calm, cold-headed and love-is-the-most-important-magic-of-all Dumbledore. Michael Gambon should read the books ASAP if he wants to continue portraying this magnificent character.<br/><br/>The only plus of this movie is the casting, which I thought was excellent. Luna was absolutely amazing, everything I had imagined and expected. Bellatrix was also pretty good, and Daniel was surprising. There are a couple of scenes that left me awe-struck.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that calling this movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is false advertising."
"Prichards12345","4","9","14","16 July 2007"," Tries hard, but lacks the charm of the other Potters
","In some ways the film makers were on a hiding to nothing with Order of The Phoenix; it's the least interesting, most over-blown of Rowling's usually wonderful books, in which Harry spends most of his time skulking around and shouting at people. Discovering his father was a bit of a school bully doesn't help much, I suppose.<br/><br/>But somewhere along the way the film's creators also lost the charm of the Potter Universe - it all feels a little ""ho-hum, we've been here before."" Most of the major supporting characters have little more than cameo appearances, and the film fills its 138 minute running time with talky, static, move-the-plot-along scenes. We're told things on several occasions when we should be shown them, and the whole enterprise has a grainy, washed-out look, rather like looking at a drab wall paper pattern. The three leads are okay, but nothing special. Daniel Ratcliffe still looks like he's reaching for his lines on occasion, and Rupert Grint seemingly can't get through his fast enough.<br/><br/>But it isn't all bad - Imelda Staunton gives the best performance in the series so far as that monstrosity in pink, Delores Umbridge. The film opens and ends well (even if the spell-duel climax is somewhat confusing). And there's some likable humour from Filch to brighten things up now and again. Gary Oldman is also fine as Sirius Black and the Death-eater escape from Azkaban is well realised.<br/><br/>All in all not as good as the previous films in the series - you can see the film makers straining for effect and the end result is merely a sequence of not very well linked scenes, some good, some bad, some indifferent. Let us hope that the superior Half-Blood Prince gets better treatment."

Nevertheless i went to go and see the film and boy what a disappointment.<br/><br/>They made key vital errors. <br/><br/>1) Harry returning to the Order : In the book it tells of a big argument that occurs between Harry, Ron and Hermionie. It is played in five seconds and it was a huge let down.<br/><br/>2) Order Meeting In the book, the Order is explained properly i.e. the sort of work that they do etc. Again here it was rushed.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours but i will go to my biggest disappointment<br/><br/>HARRY V DUMBLEDORE In the book, Harry and Albus spend ages talking about the year gone by. Albus gives detailed answers as to why he has kept his distance, he explains about the Prophecy etc. This scene was a ten second scene that was rushed majorley.<br/><br/>This is my favourite book but most hated film.<br/><br/>WARNING - TO DIE HARD HARRY POTTER FANS, THIS IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT, AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
"monica_d","5","19","35","11 July 2007"," Impressive... but not as amazing as the book
","As many other people are saying, the movie was impressive, but not as impressive as the book. I understand that it is nearly impossible to fit certain details into the movie, but I felt that there were some of vital importance that were left out. For example, Hermione and Ron becoming prefects was a big deal in the book, at least as I remember it. Didn't that create some of the turmoil between the three that was clearly shown in the movie? I could list many other things that the director left out, but although they may not have been the most important details that JK provides in the book, everything connected back to each other. I felt that the movie was choppy and switched from scene to scene without really detailing how the characters got there. I was extremely disappointed with the plot line at the end of the movie, at the Ministry, because they did leave out all the battles that Harry and friends face before he and Dumbledore battle Voldemort. I don't know about you, but I was interested in seeing how the movie would portray Ron being attacked by a vat of brains. I thought the effects were great during that whole part, but I was annoyed that they revealed the prophecy to Harry in the presence of his friends. In the book, he doesn't learn what the prophecy says until after wards, when he and Dumbledore finally meet in his office. This also unleashes a problem for the 6th movie, because in the book, no one knows if Harry really is ""The Chosen One"", except for Dumbledore, and Ron and Hermione, who he tells later.<br/><br/>Besides the movie not being nearly as riveting as the book, the scenes were portrayed well and I was impressed by the effects in this particular movie. The new characters were perfect for their parts, Luna and Umbridge couldn't have been played any better (although I had always pictured the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher to be a little bit fatter). All of the acting impressed me, especially Daniel Radcliffe. He truly captured the essence of Harry's emotions in this movie, which I don't think has been up to par before.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give it a 50%, just because I'm in love with the books. The Deathly Hollows is the premiere I'm truly waiting for!"

Harry and his army is in the biggest battle yet between Lord Voldermout and his deadly Death-Eathers... Absoutley outstanding special effects, the quality of the acting was 100/100, the script was mind-blowing and the casting was top-notch!!!

","I was pretty much excited about this installments as by now I've become a fan of Harry Potter. The movie though didn't stand on my expectations. It has plot holes and things are left unexplained mostly. Rushing the things just offers us to wonder. People are saying that the book is lengthy and therefore they were not able to accommodate things properly in the short duration of movie. Nonetheless its still a good movie and you won't wanna miss it. Well no comments on vfx which is always appealing and a treat. So again its visually good and screenplay is good as well. Yes you will find yourself waiting for the next eventually."
"beebbop_lfc","1","4","5","28 February 2009"," Misses most of the book out!!!
","I love the Harry Potter series and I have to be dragged away from them, so this film came as a big disappointment.<br/><br/>The film missed out lots of the book and changed key parts that matter to the rest of the series. What about Quidditch? This is when Ron goes through all his nervous moments. What about the whole Weasleys Wizard Wheezes? That was a brilliant chapter in the book when they left but it was barely touched in this awful film. Why don't they tell the audience that it was Professor Umbridge that set the Dementors on Harry? Now I get started onto the acting, many of the actors are brilliant. Alan Rickman as Snape, Rupert Grint as Ron, Gary Oldman as Sirius, Julie Walters as Mrs Weasley, Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid to name a few. But some of the others need to read the books, Daniel Radcliffe was brilliant as Harry Potter in the first two films but he's gone downhill. Dumbledore, when Richard Harris portrayed him, he got it spot on, calm but serious. What does Michael Gambon do? Portray him as a grumpy old man who shouts at the students when Professor Trelawney has been sacked. Dumbledore would never do that. As for Emma Watson, again great in the first to films but now I don't see her as Hermione, she is a bit too uptight and although Hermione does break the rules she wouldn't say: 'I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules.' It's just so un-hermione ish in my book.<br/><br/>So that's my rant over. I just hope the next film is better because it is one of my favourite books. Please note that everything in this comment is from my own opinion and I know that other people will have different opinions."
"PizzicatoFishCrouch","8","33","68","14 July 2007"," Not without its flaws, but highly entertaining.
","After his fourth traumatic year at Hogwarts that ended with a showdown with the franchise's very own Mr Bad, Lord Voldemort, it doesn't seem too much for Harry Potter to be asking for a peaceful Summer. However, he doesn't get such a wish  from the opening scene in which Harry and his despised cousin Dudley have close encounters of the life-threatening kind with two dementors in an underground passage, it is clear that Voldemort has unfinished business with the scarred lad, and that he has every intention of finishing it. Plus, nearly everyone in Harry's school believe him to be a liar, Professor Dumbledore refuses to look him in the eye, his friends don't understand him, and, on top of that, Harry must grapple with the skills required in mastering his first kiss. My, my, aren't teenage lives complicated?!<br/><br/>A word of warning. This is not a film for the uninitiated. If ""patronum"", ""Avada Kedavra"" and ""ministry of Magic"" sound like code to you, then best avoid watching this. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix makes no attempt to guide the newbies along the story (and rightly so, because any attempt at that would detract from the film and patronize its viewers). To fully comprehend the plot, you must have seen the four previous films as well as read the book from which this film is based.<br/><br/>The film itself is a wonderful jumble of goods, bads, and uglies. There is plenty to enjoy here, starting with the flawless turn from Imelda Staunton as the sadistic Dolores Umbridge. The woman who we are so used to seeing in roles as the sweet old lady, whether it be in Shakespeare in Love, or her Oscar-nominated turn in Vera Drake, her performance here is a shock and a half. Kitted out from head to toe in pink and sporting a sugary air, we soon find that Umbridge, whose methods of punishment include using quills that protract blood on her students, is anything but sweet. Staunton captures Umbridge's ruthless oiliness perfectly; never before has evil been such fun to watch.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint is also a joy. His ginger hair, large blue eyes, bumbling demeanour and spot-on comedy timing make him the true star of the show, and every scene that he features in benefits as a result of his appearance. Simply put, he is Godly. Sadly, the other two teen stars are nowhere near as good as Grint; Radcliffe, who gave an adequate performance in the West End's Equus, is back to his shoddy self here with an array of overreaching facial expressions and laughable deliveries of his lines. He is most embarrassing of all in the lead-up to kissing Cho Chang, in which everyone in my cinema was collapsing with laughter at his ""performance."" But it gets even worst, for Emma Watson, aspiring Cambridge student, World Peace Representative (probably) and general object of annoyance to average, frumpy teenage girls such as myself, gave a performance that was so awful, it damn near lost me the will to live. She just couldn't portray any of her emotions convincingly, and just settled for saying the lines that were written for her. Whereas Hermione was one of my favourite characters in the book due to her kindness, knowledge and appreciation for others' feelings, Emma's presentation of Hermione makes her insufferable and punch-worthy. It ain't good.<br/><br/>The two ""actors"" aside, my main other foible with this film was how it cut/altered some very important details of the book. For example, in the book, it is Kreacher who betrays Sirius and puts him in danger. The appearance of Snape's past as a hated and bullied student is also poorly put together and left to linger rather than properly dealt with. The Cho Chang storyline is pitiful, whereas in the book, we had been led to see that she wasn't all that she had cracked up to be as a person, in the film, she is the sketchiest of sketches and written off practically before she has begun. In terms of 2007 releases, only Pirates of the Caribbean III had more plot holes than this.<br/><br/>That said, I had a huge amount of fun in the 2 and a half hours that this film played, with three newcomers to this movie, Yates (director), Michael Goldenberg (screenwriter) and Hooper (composer). The direction was apt, not perfect, but acceptable. The score was acceptable. The visual effects were stunning, especially in the climactic finale between Dumbeldore's Army and Voldemort's Deatheaters, led by Jason Isaacs, where an entire storeroom containing shelved globes containing prophecies, one of which concerns Harry. It is here that Helena Bonham Carter emerges as Bellatrix Lestrange, one of the final and greatest joys of the film. Laughing manically and sporting long hair greasier than a Professor Snape-Cristiano Ronaldo mixup, she makes the most of her limited screen time to deliver one of the best performances in all the Harry Potter movies. Utterly haunting.<br/><br/>Thus, verily I say, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a worthwhile outing. If you can put up with the abomination commonly known as ""Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson trying to act"", as well as the slightly pretentious over-editing of Harry's dream sequences, not to mention the ten thousand odd plot holes, then you should venture out to the cinema to see this. Not capital film-making, but, as I'm yet to see Ratatouille and The Simpsons movie, about as good as you'll get this Summer from the cinema."
"andy-1186","7","48","104","4 July 2007"," Imelda steals the show
","Overall, not a bad film, especially the opening sequence which'll have you quivering behind the seat in front! Great effects as always.<br/><br/>For me, Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge completely steals the show. Her character was fantastically well observed - the odd little hysterical titters of laughter she gave had superb comedic timing. Helena Bonham Carter had a star turn too as Belatrix - she's completely bonkers and HBC totally did her justice! Loved it!<br/><br/>For me, both their successes stood out conspicuously when compared to the horrendously awkward acting from the younger members of the cast. Sorry(!) but there were so many cringe worthy moments (especially the more intimate ones) where you kept begging the director to cut away from the acting. Tighter editing could have prevented these distracting moments from constantly reminding me I was watching actors on a set.<br/><br/>Hermione (Emma Watson), Luna (Evanna Lynch) , and Cho (Katie Leung) were the main culprits, with Daniel Radcliff not falling far behind. Okay, I know they're supposed to be awkward teenagers in the story, but hey! My suspicion is that these poor kids feel so caught up in the huge franchise that is HP that the pressure to perform must be enormous. Couple that with the screenplay's stilted dialogue, and being surrounded by what must have been a huge crew with them all staring at you, it's hardly a surprise that a few cracks were shown. Still, you'd have thought the editing might have been able to get around it.<br/><br/>These cringes aside, I enjoyed the film. Also, a huge congrats to all those involved in the hard work that obviously went into the post production too."

Although Sirius is *supposedly* one of the main characters in OotP, it turned out that the movie maker either didn't know how to write the screenplay about him or lacked the skill of depicting multiple story lines, that Sirius looked like an EXTRA character. Harry's godfather? That's just a way to call someone. Black's rebellion son? Not shown. One of the Order's central figure? How brief. What the heck.<br/><br/>3. Also an EXTRA is Bellatrix. It looks like an EXTRA kills another EXTRA and it's got nothing to do with the film theme. Till this point, we can induce that the producer, the director or at least the playwrights just don't like the Blacks.<br/><br/>4. No sense of time passing. When it's like still at the beginning of the new term, suddenly Christmas comes.<br/><br/>5. How can the students penetrate into the Ministry so easily? Seems like when they flew to London and went into the phone booth and then they were inside  deep inside.<br/><br/>6. Dumbledore is still some Gandalf!<br/><br/>7. The first three quarters is so draggy and yet it tells so little story. And then the last quarter is too packed, and many necessary details are not shown. Believe me, I almost yawned when I was entertained by the Harry-Cho romance.<br/><br/>8. Parts of the plot are not well linked to one another. How to say a scattered plot?<br/><br/>9. The title is 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'. Yet, where is the Order of the Phoenix? What we can see is 'Harry Potter and Dolores Umbridge' or 'Harry Potter and His Stupidity'.<br/><br/>10. The Weasley boys (Ron, Fred and George) are as adorable as usual. So is Hermione. And so is Neville. But not Harry. In fact I like the Harry in the first 4 movies more than in the books, partly because what I dislike him is his thoughts, which can't be well shown in movies. And in this fifth movie, his negative personalities go to surface. He is angry about friends. He feels self-important. He shouts to friends and Dumbledore. He thinks the whole world is owing him some great debt. He is such a Mary Sue. Well, he IS a Mary Sue in the books, but not much a one in the first four movies; and now, at last, he becomes one in the fifth film.<br/><br/>Now I understand how blissful a non-HP-book-reader is.<br/><br/>Well, the magic scenes are awesome. The music is great. But hey, although they are necessary, they are not the main points. We can watch video games for better scenes and we can listen to OST for the music; why we go to cinema?<br/><br/>I hope the next HP movie would get better. Well, good or bad, when the time comes, we all go to watch it anyway, isn't it?"
"eowynsdouble-2","Null","25","50","11 July 2007"," Editing and Plot holes aside, it was amazing!
","Out of five stars . . . I'd give OotP four of them. The movie is very emotional, not just because of what Harry is going through, but because the movie really tries, I think, to pull the audience into Harry's emotions so that you can connect with him more and really feel what he's feeling. They use very quick, brief flashbacks from previous movies to help achieve this and it's done really well. It's incredibly ingenious and I loved it.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the editing. It is really choppy in some areas. However, I think they made it choppy on purpose in order to visually get the movie's psychological point across: Voldemort is infiltrating Harry's mind and causing him to have these disturbing dreams and thoughts. Harry's afraid he might be ""going bad."" And the choppy editing is really a great visual for this. I liked the choppy editing in some places, where I felt it was appropriate. But there were other areas where I didn't like it, where I wanted the editing to be smoother. But it may just be a personal taste. <br/><br/>There were also a few moments in the movie where I really wished the camera would have stayed in place for a few more seconds before jumping to another scene.<br/><br/>The movie was very fast paced at times, but I was able to look past it mainly because OotP is a HUGE book and the filmmakers really did a great job overall condensing the movie. They make up for the fast pace by putting in several little moments from the book that only book readers would appreciate (like Tonks tripping on the Umbrella stand). As usual, there are some things in the movie that non-book fans will not understand because they are simply not explained.<br/><br/>Someone made a comment that they had laughed out loud more times watching OotP than while watching any other Potter movie. And I have to agree. There were also several moments were I couldn't help but let out a whoop. I've never cheered so much during a Potter movie . . . and I've certainly never cried so much. It's not the scene where Sirius dies. It's the scene where Harry is being possessed by Voldemort. I was sobbing. Literally sobbing in my seat. Everyone sitting next to me was crying as well, and I was crying so hard that I had to take off my glasses because I couldn't see.<br/><br/>I really liked the acting in this movie. I was hugely impressed by Dan (the possession scene! So incredibly well done!). Emma and Rupert have improved too. All three of them were very good. Kudos to the Phelps twins as well. I absolutely loved their performances.<br/><br/>And the adult actors are amazing as always. Hugs for Gary Oldman, who comes across perfectly as the caring surrogate father for Harry, but also as a man who never really recovered from his best friend's death. Alan Rickman is wonderful as always, consistently cruel and sarcastic yet absolutely hilarious. ""I think I may vomit"" he tells Harry after breaking into a sentimental memory of his.<br/><br/>I'm also impressed with what David Yates has done. I think he's a great director and I'm excited to see what he does with HBP.<br/><br/>All in all, I think OotP is a very good movie. I don't know if I would rank it above POA, but I would certainly rank it above SS and COS. I definitely need to see it again, and not at 2:00 in the morning. My only major complaint was the editing. If it wasn't for the editing, it would definitely be my favorite."
"sergage","1","12","21","22 July 2007"," Simly a puppet show!
","What was expected to blow me away, like the 3rd and 4th films did, turned out to be the worst movie experience I've had since the passion of the Christ. And let me make what I think absolutely clear: It is NOT OK that they've altered so much from the book. They could have stuck with the book without necessarily facing too much screen time. There was much cut out from Goblet Of Fire but it didn't prevent it from bringing as much magic to the screen as humanly possible.<br/><br/>To be more specific, the film was a complete mess, a sequence of things taken from the book, pointlessly altered and badly organized on film. It seemed that they had focused on completely the wrong things. It was as if Yates had heard the story from someone, who heard it from his barber, who heard it from the postman, who heard from someone else, who heard someone talking about it...<br/><br/>If I hadn't read the book, I would have no idea what this movie is about. Is it about some boy with a magic stick who's getting in trouble at school all the time and some maniac with his gang trying to kill him and his schoolmates, or is it about a boy wizard named Harry Potter, who's got a mysterious scar on his forehead, a mystical bond with his nemesis since a year of age - Lord Voldemort, the darkest wizard the magical community has ever known? What about The Prophecy? What about Dumbledore and his concern and care? What about The Order? Where's the danger? Where's the emotion? Where's the MAGIC? And bring John Williams back! Or at least Patrick Doyle.<br/><br/>P.S. I trash this movie completely and I don't regret doing so, because what they've done with the book and the story and the world of Harry Potter is unforgivable. And the worst thing is that they've chosen the same David Yates to direct the next two films (or one, I'm not sure). I hope they reconsider before it's too late."
"redsoxmb545-1","9","17","32","26 July 2007"," 'Phoenix' May Be Best 'Potter' Yet!
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the 5th installment out of 7 in the story of Harry Potter. With the release of this film as well as the final literary installment of the series, 'Potter 'has received a great abundance of exposure (as if it needed it). In 'Phoenix', Harry and Dumbeldore are targeted by the Ministry of Magic after claiming (correctly) that the dark Lord Voldemort has been reborn. A sadistic member of the Ministry is installed in Hogwarts who slowly takes over the entire school. Meanwhile, a secret organization, the Order of the Phoenix, recruits Harry, and prepares for the Dark Lord's return. As the story gets darker, the films get better. This film (while it was not the best book in the series), is quite possibly the 'Potter' film yet. The teenage as well as adult cast excel while visuals and special effects are nothing less than top notch. While the film did do a good job making a page 896 book into a 2 hour and 15 minute movie, I do wish that it could have been longer to include more details and sub-plots which were cut either in post production or during the writing process. The explosive finale is incredible and will cast a spell on you throughout. 'Phoenix' is a must see for any 'Potter' fan, while others will still find it an enjoyable ride."

","This film was pathetic totally compared to the rest! the plot was thin, the acting dull, the delivery poor and the style the director/producer has chosen created a waste of time watching this movie.<br/><br/>The graphics poorly utilised and all together a waste of money making and waste of my time watching and the cinema ticket.<br/><br/>I appreciate that this book was very long and could in no way be created like Lords of the Rings in parts, however it should have been given more thought and consideration. It just seems that now that its a global phenomenon anything will do and less work needs to be done. Thats the wrong mentality to have.<br/><br/>The characters were kept within their shells and not allowed to show more of themselves. It would have been nice to see one of the characters stick out and play something thats not expected from them.<br/><br/>Apparently there was suppose to be so much new jokes attempted yet whilst watching the movie in full cinema showing there was only one person laughing and he was doing that throughout... NO DOUBT ON HOW STUPID THIS FILM WAS.<br/><br/>As students we are disruptive and do not take to any abuse yet in this film students were assaulted and they just took it... without any powers I would have sorted her out and if i had powers like them all i would expect her body to be in shreds.<br/><br/>the most liveliest character to waken me up and given me a good laugh was Evanna Lynch ... Luna Lovegood she gets a 1 the film gets nothing and no one else gets anything. she was cracking as the deranged new student. everyone else i cannot stand and think should be hanged, well if you cant do that maroon them to somewhere like Antarctica were they wont be seen.<br/><br/>no sympathy for anybody as no one earned it.<br/><br/>bury this film and say don't exist cos i have been told by book readers that the film does not do the book justice in the least."
"ryanniklas","5","11","19","11 July 2007"," As the series grow darker, Harry grows older, and in this new installment, adaptation is nicely done but lame visuals.
","As a die-hard Harry Potter fan, I can't help but say I left the movie feeling a little disappointed. No, it was not because of the cut scenes that were in the book, but the visuals itself was bad. Acting, I was impressed with. Imelda Stauton as Dolores Umbridge was wicked, and she added a bit of light humor to the dark movie. Evanna Lynch, her first on-screen performance, does a truly believable job as Luna Lovegood, balancing well with her bizarre ways and her light-hearted ways. Helena Bonham Carter, as the psycho Bellatrix Lestrange, proves that she had fun portraying an evil person. Despite her short time on-screen, she leaves us with a haunting effect. The story, I'm not complaining. It was well paced, (not fast nor slow)and I enjoyed the tender moments between Harry and Sirius. The screenplay did not take us right into the action, but had built the momentum for the final sequence. I'm not going to reveal anything, but the final sequence (included scenes with Voldemort vs. Dumbledore, and the gang in the Hall of Prophecy) was visually and actively stunning, but I wished the action was a tad bit longer. The part of the screenplay that disappointed me was Harry venturing through Snapes' mind, where we see a brief look at James Potter, Harry's father, which not well shot at all. Now, the visuals. The howler/envelope at the beginning for Harry, telling him he had done underage magic in the presence of a Muggle, was the fakest thing I had ever saw. The howler looked like it had come out a Blue Clues show, for it was so... aminated, so unrealistic. I remember being so distracted by the fake thing I even didn't hear what it said. Next, the giant, another fake-ish creature in the movie, I mean, seriously, it looked like it was plucked out of a cartoon show. And the centaurs, you know what, let's not get started on that one. Warner Bros. is an extremely successful movie company, and a lot of money went into this movie, and yet they provide us with sloppy CGI. On the other hand, the thestral were impressive, not what I had pictured at all, but will do. The scenes with Harry teaching the DA was well done, to my relief. It had humor, ambition, visually stunning spells, and us viewing Harry maturing as he teaches others. Despite sloppy scenes and visuals, I did sort of like this movie, for its darkness, for the final sequence, for Imelda Stauton, Evanna Lynch and Helena Bonham Carter, and for its steady pace."

The lines are awful, and all that happy clapping... fx. when Mr. Weasley returns from hospital is just annoying... What made me most angry was the way thinks were changed... fx.

"Mainframed","1","19","37","11 July 2007"," If you have never seen a movie, don't make an exception for this one!
","When I walked out of the theater, somebody behind me said, and I quote: ""All in all, another good film."" Personally I think this film is an approach to what Rowling means with the agony of the cruciatus curse: You'd rather die than going through this much pain any longer! I felt violated and never wanted to inflict physical pain on someone (preferably the director of this pile of nose-pulk) more than after seeing this film. It would probably have been better if Daniel Radcliffe at least tried to remember anything from his acting classes (though I seriously doubt he has ever taken them), and would at least show SOME interest in the art of acting. Furthermore, this movie makes me wish for an early death of Harry Potter in the books. If he can die right at the beginning of number 7, that would be swell! We can watch Daniel Radcliffe die in the film, and maybe (and that is a huge maybe) enjoy the remainder of the film. The character development has been incredibly bad from the first movie on. But in this part, they have hit an ultimate low. I went to the theater without any expectations. It is something like a miracle to experience that the people responsible for this pile of garbage have been able to crush even the complete absence of expectations. They can crush emptiness as it were. Along with Alan Rickman, this last thing is worth applauding. Alan, you're great! Your performance in comparison with the other actors in this film makes you a God! (which after out-acting Kevin Costner you of course already were, but now you're an even bigger god, you're like, THE GOD of acting). But than again, everything in comparison with... makes it godlike! Team of Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix, go die! (except for you, Alan, you know I love you, you God you)"
"Leofwine_draca","3","5","7","3 August 2016"," Choppy vignettes don't make a film
","I used to like the HARRY POTTER movies and books – the first three at least. They were everything I expected from children's entertainment. Then the books started getting longer, it was obvious Rowling was only doing them for the money, and I personally believe they should have ended with the fourth book, as the last three add absolutely nothing to the storyline apart from extraneous detail. The same goes with the films.<br/><br/>The first two were fluffy entertainment, the third was my favourite and I hated the fourth because they'd changed so much. This film, the fifth in the series, is the worst yet, a total artistic failure. The reason is totally down to Rowling. The fifth book is overlong and bloated at nearly a thousand pages; much of what happens is totally irrelevant and utterly pointless. The filmmakers were left with the difficult decision of what to leave out and what to put in, and it's this choice that scuppers them.<br/><br/>We're left with a series of vignettes snipped from the pages. There are a couple of scenes here, a couple of scenes there, and the majority of the supporting cast members get about five lines. The likes of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, David Thewlis, Robert Hardy, Richard Griffiths, Brendan Gleeson, Helena Bonham Carter, and Ralph Fiennes are all totally wasted in blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameos. The central trio of Harry, Hermione and Ron are unappealing and face no character progression other than silly, goes-nowhere romance for Harry.<br/><br/>Two actors come out of this well – Gary Oldman seems to be enjoying himself as Sirius and Imelda Staunton is hissably evil as the new teacher – but other than them, nobody gets a chance here. The film looks pretty, for sure, and there's no faulting the special effects, but in the end this is a whole lot of sound and fury that signifies nothing. At the end, the story has progressed no further than it had at the beginning other than in a few minor points."
"Imperatrixx","5","5","7","31 July 2007"," Disappointed
","I am so strongly disappointed at this movie that I can't even bear in words. Although I had expected this, as no previous movie was any match to the real book, I really wanted more.<br/><br/>I went to see it with my boyfriend, to whom I've bee praising the books for a few years now and he still thinks I'm coo-coo because none of the movies proved the contrary. I know it's hard to fit a huge book into a couple of hours of a movie, that's why it was all so fast, so confusing, so full of details that were presented too fast as to really take them in. Even my boyfriend, who hasn't read the books, said that he felt missing details everywhere.<br/><br/>What I love and always have loved about the books is that neither Harry nor any of his friends were really that omniscient. They all discovered things as they went and we discovered them alongside them. As the movie is concerned, however, I  a book reader  felt so much like an outsider that I can only imagine how the non-readers felt. It's like every character knew all that was going around but none of them was taking the time to explain it to us, watchers. As an example: the family link between Sirius, Nymphadora, Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange seemed quite important to me. Yet it's not mentioned even briefly in the movie, although Harry and Sirius do carry a conversation regarding Sirius' family tree. Friends have asked me who was the hot, purple haired lass or the hysterical dark haired witch who sends Sirius through the arch thingy. This means that people didn't really get the important ideas. Firenze, the centaur was left out, all the awesome rooms of the Ministry were discarded, the Death Arch wasn't well explained, the Order facing the Death Eaters was a very confusing scene and regarding the prophecy I think they should have told who made it. And I also think they should have focused on the most important aspect, which was not the fact the ""neither can live while the other survives"" but the fact that Harry is a marked man, because Voldemort himself marked him as his equal.<br/><br/>Also I didn't feel any emotional links at all between the characters. There's plenty of seemingly pointless action and facts, people doing things for unexplainable reasons, special effects, but no feeling whatsoever. I didn't understand from the movie why Harry was so upset at Ron and Hermione for not sending him news, I didn't understand clearly why Dumbledore acted as he did, Kreacher's part was also discarded as well as Harry's confusion and disappointment at his teenage father, after peaking into Snape's memories. Harry didn't seem at all shattered after Sirius' death, they never highlighted how much Sirius meant ho Harry and they never said that Sirius left him Twelve, Grimmauld's Place as heirloom. Harry didn't seem at all troubled that he had such a huge responsibility on his shoulders, that he was not a regular boy but one with a huge mission to accomplish. Also the conversation between Harry and Dumbledore, in the end, was far less revealing. I missed Dumbledore's kind, fatherly attitude, I missed him telling Harry that he kept the truth away from him only to protect him, that he didn't want to burden his youth with such a horrible truth. And, most of all, I missed that heartbreaking moment when Dumbledore tells Harry, with tears in his eyes, that he never thought he's have such a wonderful person in his care. The immense link between Harry and his headmaster is barely noticeable.<br/><br/>This reminded me of the ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" movie, where the amazing friendship of James Potter and his school friends is presented in a terribly hasty, laconic manner that really doesn't do justice to the whole story and that doesn't let any of the strong emotions break through to the viewers.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie shouldn't only be intended for people who have read the book and already know the facts. Everyone should be able to understand what it's all about and should be able to enjoy the full thrills of the story. And even for those who have read the books, it's quite disappointing. It's too bad, because the actors were very well chosen (although I preferred Richard Harris as Dumbledore, by far, God rest his soul) and they deserved a better movie."

By far this is the best Harry Potter movie of the series, it has everything, humor, action and adventure, suspense and mystery and some moments of drama too. A film that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Its story is excellent, the first part is kinda slow but it gets better when it came the time to fight for Harry Potter and all his friends, the plot convince me to the fullest and with a great adaptation from the book, there's some parts from the same book that doesn't appear on the film, but its comprehensible because they do it that way so that the movie won't lose rhythm and turn boring to watch. Everyone from the cast gives excellent performances, specially Daniel Radcliffe and Ralph Fiennes as Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort respectively, Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter all three are excellent in their roles that gives the necessary support to the leading ones, just one complaint, I expected to see more of Cho Chang I think that her participation was to short. The direction of David Yates is simply wonderful he gives the movie a dark enjoyable vision and a good rhythm that never falls. The makeup is great specially on Lord Voldemort and the CG effects were just awesome. In conclusion this 5th Harry Potter movie was very entertaining for people of all ages and a must see for everyone."

I had to answer plenty of questions afterwards to my friends (that haven't ever read the books) about this movie. I felt that there were many, very important parts missing from this movie.

Just plain wrong. She didn't avada kadavra him. She stunned him and he fell into the door. * The prophecies. No ""ghostly apparitions"" were present. The ball just formed a face and spoke. And it did so in the company of the entire Potter team. * The DA being ratted out (Cho didn't do it, damn it.)<br/><br/>All in all... definitely my least favorite of the movies. It's so sad.

"tomm098","1","8","13","5 August 2007"," Not bad, but not good, and too short
","This movie, put simply, was made for anyone that has NOT read the books. The plot was really just small snippets of major plot points, with their only purpose, to lead us into the intense final battle scenes. The fight scenes were part of the movie that were done quite well.<br/><br/>The movie lacked any kind of somewhat complex structure. It dismissed many scenes which i think made the books what they are. The movie showed no smaller details and missed out many scenes, for example, the Harry/Ginny growing relationship, Harry/Chos relationship(besides from a kiss), the fountain fight, nothing is mentioned about prefects, quidditch, N.E.W.T.S, Harry's aspiration to become an auror, Hagrids fight against thugs, valentine, Fred and Georges joke shop and Sirius's 2-way mirror. Nor was Harrys anger scene in Dumbledores office included, which gave reason for the whole book, it was instead cut down to a very brief scene in which nothing was revealed about Sirius's death.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was probably a let down for 'Harry Potter' fans or anyone who had read the book. However, it had its moments and the fight scenes and large sets were quite amazing. Another positive was the casting, with all cast members acting well. However these positives do NOT make up for the plot holes. It definitely had an issue with length and was way too short. For these final books they should be around the 200+ minute mark. I would happily even sit through a 5 hour movie. Anything to see the book transformed into the movie successfully.<br/><br/>It was barely worth seeing, and frustrating."

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a faithful Harry Potter fan. I have been in line at midnight on several occasions and am not afraid to admit it. This movie has ruined Harry Potter for many people in my life who left the theater utterly confused. It also didn't make me happy that I had to sit and explain certain things from the movie for over an hour. I understand that this is a long book to be condensed into a movie. I give the directors credit for condensing. They could have had another hour of my time without a care. This was the most wasted two hours I have ever spent in my entire life.

","Speaking as someone who has never read any of the books but has gotten more and more hooked on the whole Harry Potter mystic by reading up on it in on different websites, I thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix. Sometimes maybe its best if you haven't read the books before seeing the movie. I saw the Lord Of The Rings trilogy after having read the books many times and things were changed and things left out and I was a little critical myself but I still loved them.Lets face it if they wanted to stuff the amt of material the author wrote into one movie ,youd have to make two movies for each book. I've enjoyed each Harry Potter movie and eventually I will read the books to get the whole story but Id rather not do it yet since its so refreshing to not know what is going to happen going in.Its hard though with the net not getting spoilers everywhere so I will try not to followed the Deathly Hallows spoilers when the book comes out.Of course it will be 3 yrs before the final movie comes out. Now back to OOP - it was fantastic, the acting was good especially Dan Radcliffe ,such a range of expression and emotion on his face and the beautiful Emma Watson returns as a fierce Hermione. She really has punch. I loved the final battle at the end with the Death Eaters and of course Dumbledore vs Voldemort. It was sad seeing the fate of one of the main characters whom many fans have enjoyed. Hmm I wonder if that character will return in HBP or DH. All in all a grand time . I cant wait till HBP comes out next yr but we will have to wait until near Xmas time. And then 2 yrs after that what a wait that will be until DH comes out. See you at the movies.Cheers"
"the-mail-man","4","8","13","12 July 2007"," The Best Book! The Worst Movie!
","I strongly believe this movie is a case of watch the film then read the book to get your epic experience of JK Rowling's Harry Potter adventure. I like many thought if done properly this movie would almost be like what The Empire Strikes Back did for Star Wars, boy were we wrong! From the Start, The Film is rushed into play with a scramble of scenes to set the (to fast) pace for this adventure, along the way shortly into the film undersized scenarios and many disjointed plots creep onto screen, whilst some capture the book for a split second, others become irrelevant to the point of why were they even shown? The change in screenplay writer and the Editing along with the direction of this film is very much lacking and it begins to feel more like a made for T.V movie than a box office Blockbuster. PLEASE Bring back Steve Kloves! Many people in my theater who were egger to see HP5 Order of The Phoenix became lost with plot and were trying to understand what was going on, as the entire cast looked like Extras except for Harry? <br/><br/>The Pace of the film is deliberately rushed forth to try and capture the story and even with some high tech special effects it failed miserably. Some of the Special Effects and scale is amazing, however the fight scenes are rather rushed not to involving at all and a little confusing in the end, even the Dementors look rushed from post production and some places like the Train Station at the end and parts of Hogwarts look cheap and nasty and don't flow at all with any of the previous movies. Some of the storyline gags ILM are famous for were not really present and the director had so many missed opportunities form the story including Doxys, Sirius Black's Mother and even Dobby The Elf (1st scene HP2 Chamber of secrets). ILM ands the FX crews need credit, but they did fail to deliver the Magic under direction in this movie, a real tragedy. <br/><br/>I disagree with a lot of people that say this film could have never have been done to justice; it is a massive cope out. True the film is 40 mins too short on screen, but a REAL special edition DVD would go a long way to restoring the mismatched storyline to this film. We can only pray that HP7 Deathly Hollows runs this long because it's going to need it. Some simple gesture and film technique would have blended this story a lot better than the scramble of scenes which filled the screen. The most upsetting part of the film is the climatic Wizard Battle, which lacked scope, really never got started and was by far the worst ending on screen for any of the HP Books. I can not stress enough that JK Rowling's Order of The Phoenix Novel is by far the best Book to date in this franchise and that the film does not do any justice to detail. Warner Bros have a hit and missed badly with the fights scenes and HP6 the Half Blood Prince DOES NOT have the same depth this story has. Yes we all know sacrifices are made to storytelling with flaws on the big screen, but in my opinion HP4 The Goblet of Fire was put on screen way better than this. <br/><br/>Inclosing, the movie is a bit of a disaster but you're going to absolutely love this book that will not disappoint you at all! So go and read it after the movie -not before it!"

","i do not understand how anyone who claims to be a ""die-hard fan of the novels"" could regard this movie with anything other than disappointment. from this point on there will be spoilers so if you haven't seen it yet, read no further.<br/><br/>the movie was doomed from the beginning. first of all the park that harry was in looked like it was in the middle of nowhere. harry and Dudley had their conversation alone and not in front of Dudley's friends like in the movie. the Dementors looked completely different than in the prisoner of Azkaban. Mrs. Figg wasn't angry like she was supposed to be. and Mudungus was not even mentioned.<br/><br/>along with cutting out some very important details, there were things that were completely different than the book. for example, in the movie Cho was the one who was responsible for Umbridge finding out about the D.A. when in the book it was her friend. anyone who has read the books should know that the parts that they left out of this movie are extremely important not only for the plot of this story, but also for the development of characters for the next movie. <br/><br/>the part that annoys me the most is that they went to the trouble of putting Kreacher in this movie, but they cut out the most important part that he played. Kreacher was responsible for harry going to the ministry of magic. in the book, after harry has his vision of Sirius at the ministry with Voldemort, he goes to the fireplace and tries to contact Sirius to see if it is true. Kreacher tells him that Sirius is gone even though he wasn't. what was the point of putting Kreacher in the movie if they cut that entire part out.<br/><br/>Quidditch was completely cut out. there wasn't even a small scene of a game. the cut out the part where Ron and Hermione and Draco were made prefects. actually Draco wasn't in more than three scenes. he is such an important character in the sixth book and they are supposed to build up to that. everyone in the fifth movie seemed like secondary characters. <br/><br/>Trelawney had just a small role as well when she was one of the most important characters in the fifth book. Neville was also cut drastically in the movie. the wizard hospital, the fight between Bellatrix and harry, the swamp that the Weasley twins left, all of that was cut out as well. <br/><br/>the prophecy, which was the most important part of the book, was mentioned but it seemed as though the director wanted to focus more on special effects and fight scenes than on the actual story. <br/><br/>there is so much more, but i will let someone else discuss it."
"goals3721","Null","14","26","10 July 2007"," A complete and utter disappointment: An obvious terrible adaptation but by itself just a bad movie
","I at first scanned the other comment titles before writing this an i'm baffled as to how many people actually thought this movie was good. I on the other hand found the movie to be anything but that. Yes, I am a hardcore book reader but i must say this first. I have come to terms with the fact that the movies are not the books and so from there i say that the 1 and 2 weren't bad adaptations and 3 and 4 were decent movies minus my feelings about the book. As movie alone they can stand on their own but this movie is a different story.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is very confusing even if you have read the books. It jumps around a lot and the shots are done very oddly. It also feels really rushed. I was sitting there watching this thinking this is going so fast. All this important stuff happens and it's just whizzing by without even a chance to acknowledge anything. The movie as a whole is set up like a bunch of different scenes with really odd or random transitions here and there. The movie does not flow right. The best way to explain it is like a strobe light. You're seeing somethings but you're not seeing everything you're only getting glimpses. Anytime it felt like it got into a scene that was important it shifted again.<br/><br/>Aside from the direction of the movie some of the scenes and i mean big scenes like ones they did use were so lack luster. The big battle in the department of mysteries was meh. It could have been so good and it was just so short and kinda whatever. That also includes the battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort in the entry to the Ministry of Magic which that scene seemed ackward and too long for what they were trying to accomplish. All the jumping around that occurs in this movie make it difficult for anyone who has never read the books to get an actual grasp on it. You need to have read the books to draws some connecting paths in your head to get it.<br/><br/>OK i think that's it for my feelings on the movie away from the book so if you're not into the books or feel whatever about how it's an adaptation than ignore this part of my review. FROM HERE ON IT DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!! be forewarned.<br/><br/>OK my fellow avid HP readers. Lets begins with the stupidity that this movie had. Yes i'm away that this book is over 800 pages and that they can't fit it all in but there's probably about and hour of this movie total full of things that just did not occur! You've got 800 pages to work with there is no reason to create so much it's done for you!!!! A major major disappointment for me was Snape's memory scene. It is like 5 seconds (literally maybe a tad longer maybe 10 secs) and it's very static like. You can barely make out who's who; except for Snape and James otherwise you're out of luck. The battle scene is so crappy. They don't show any other the other rooms they just all randomly end up in the room with the veil. Things in that are completely not possible in at hogwarts happen in this movie. The biggest i would say has to be that Umbridge breaks into the Room of Requirement while the DA is practicing. Anyone with half a brain knows that you can't get in unless with the same desire and purpose for the room. HELLO book 6 harry can't get into it to catch draco so how could umbridge break it down?! And then i guess there's just lots of little things that just drove me nuts. Hagrid and Ginny basically don't exist in this movie (Ginny more so) Bill and Charlie STILL never introduced. The Hogwarts Express is called Hogwarts Railways. Ron and Hermoine are mentioned to been have made prefect nor does it show on their robes. And more little bits and pieces like that that just don't add up. There's so much in this movie that is added that is unnecessary that they could have given that time to developing the plot better. As a final thing, the whole book harry's very angry it's teen angst time like a billion with magic and in the movie he's completely just emo kid like the worlds ending very rarely getting angry. And then at the end when he should be depressed because of Sirius he's happy and whatever when he leaves when he should be devastated. I dunno there's so many things about this movie that drive me nuts. It could have been so good and yet they decided to go a different route leaving the book fans disappointed and movie fans confused."
"Mrowe","4","6","9","27 July 2007"," Very disappointed
","There were so many crucial plot elements for the next two films that were glossed over, that I wonder how they can ever recover. Mundungus Fletcher was the first glaring omission. Yes, he doesn't add too much to this plot, but he is crucial for later films. They didn't spend enough time at Grimmauld Place. Kreacher, RAB, Phineas Nigellus Black, the locket - all are critical to the next two installments. The omission of the new prefects, Harry missing the Quidditch matches, both of these contribute to Harry's state of mind throughout the story. Fred and George experimenting on the first-years, and the goal of opening their own shop? Gone. Their spectacular exit and the long term repercussions? Gone. The Department of Mysteries apparently only includes prophecies. And snake bites aren't really all that dangerous. Harry sneaking into Snape's pensieve? Gone. The OWL's? Apparently just another test. Oh I could go on and on. There was so much wrong with this movie, I fear for the next two."

","First let's get this out of the way: this movie looks fantastic. The visual effects are top notch with realistic looking fireworks and spell casting.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie will be an extreme let down to fans of the book. Too much is changed and too many plots have been completely altered such as Cho being the one to rat out the D.A. and the complete omission of Ron and Hermione becoming Perfects, revelation of Twelany being the one who created the prophecy between Harry and Lord Voldemort, and the omission of Ron being the Keeper for Griffindor.<br/><br/>I also felt that if you didn't read the book, you couldn't understand the plot of the movie. Too much was happening too fast that they omitted any sort of plot. The only really cool part of this movie is the climatic wizarding duel between the D.A. and the Death Eaters and Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>I'm throughly disappointed with this movie and wish that the director of the first movie had continued directing all of them."

","The above heading might be a bit misleading. it birth in books was no mean feat---Rowling clearly dipped into a pool of immeasurable imagination to spring seven consecutive stories upon us in a rather short time. But where the books have begun to fail, and where this film triumphs, is in INDEPENDENCE.<br/><br/>Watch any of the previous films out of order and you'll be more vexed than Ron Weasley. They depend on one another to fully articulate their characters' situations and general characteristics. Plots spill over onto one another. non-fans were put off.<br/><br/>That's where this little beauty wins out. Unlike the previous four, this one feels like a movie, rather than a well-made but verily similar segment of one long film. It has a beginning and end. Its feelings are worn on its sleeve. the acting has actually reached applaudible standards, especially with the younger cast (Daniel really has matured as an actor---though God knows Hermione could be a better-acted character. All that eager breathlessness makes my head hurt!).<br/><br/>Fiennes too, excels at bringing magic to the show. Despite his relatively small part in a large (2hr 30min) story, he sticks in the mind as much as his character does within the confines of potter's brain. the ""background cast""---Snape, Dumbledore etc finally seem to do more than tell Harry what to do, they are part of the overall tapestry and instrumental in...nope, you have to see it.<br/><br/>The plot itself exceeds the book's reach by cutting out unwanted and rather unnecessary fat. Gone are the endless expeditionary scenes and moments of Potter complaining and moping. The fans may not like it but us, the general audience, appreciate a film with bite and briskness, which this has in spades.<br/><br/>As for the climax---it seems there was some last-minute editing. One can't help but wonder if the DVD will contain extra scenes of magic-war. This is no criticism, though. It is truly the best end to a Potter film yet, and without giving anything away, clearly hints at the chaos and truly dark proceedings that await in Film Six.<br/><br/>Go see."

","The Order of the Phoenix movie was horrible. I have never been more disappointed with something to do with Harry Potter.<br/><br/>There were so many good things said about it... I believed John and Melissa of Pottercast, and I believed Jo Rowling. How was she able to sit there and say in the Jonathon Ross interview that this was the best movie yet and that she was really happy with it? It's unbelievable. That movie made me sort of ashamed to love Harry Potter as much as I do. It made me wonder about her and about how much she actually cares about the fans, and how much she really cares about the money. And I would practically slap someone for saying that about her before this.<br/><br/>When the movie ended and a few people clapped, I just said ""bullshit."" It was bullshit the way they butchered and twisted the plot of the fifth book. Why did they even bother making a movie like that? This wouldn't have been so devastating for me if it weren't for the fact that the series is ending. No more books, but at least we had the last two movies to look forward to. But after this travesty of a movie, I have very little hope for the next two.<br/><br/>I'm mad at Jo for letting them do this to her story, I'm mad at the actors for taking part it it, but mostly I am mad at the director David Yates for doing this to my favorite book of the series and for signing on the for last two. All I can say for that is, at least he's not the one writing the seventh book. I still have that.<br/><br/>I'm not going into the specific things that bothered my in the movie. I am probably going to see it again before I do that. I imagine that after I see it one or two more times it won't bother me as much and I may even like it a bit more, but this is my reaction from the initial shock. Because it wasn't supposed to be like that. I went into that theater fully expecting to be blown away. And not in the way it ended up blowing."

","While this isn't the worst adaptation of the books to movies in my opinion - that goes to PoA - this is a very close second. I think the acting was great, the directing fine & special effects spectacular, except for the dementors: why did we need to change them from their earlier wonderfully-creepy look? Unfortunately, I think the screenplay was abysmal, & I'm ever-so grateful that Steve Kloves is back for HBP! I understand that, this being the longest of the books to date, there were bound to be many omissions. I can (grudgingly) accept that. However, when integral plot points are completely altered (Cho Chang is the snitch?!?) I have a HUGE problem with it.<br/><br/>I'm quite surprised that Michael Goldenberg did such a horrible job on this screenplay, since I've liked all the other movies for which he was screenwriter. I don't know if it's simply that I'm ""used"" to Steve Kloves' writing personality with these films, or if it was just too much information to condense into a 138 minute movie, but either way, I hope I live to see the day when this movie AND PoA both get redone properly.<br/><br/>I know I'm not the first to say this & won't be the last, but I feel these books should be turned into 3-4 hour movies, akin to the LoTR trilogy. Any of us who read & re-read these books, who spend an entire weekend reading each new book that comes out, would easily accept a movie double in length of the current ones."
"rowdy8711","7","12","22","11 July 2007"," Surprisingly Bad. (SPOILERS)
","The Order of The Phoenix book was my favorite. However, the movie failed to impress me. I felt like putting an almost 900 page book into two hours and eighteen minutes is horrible. The single reason I am giving this movie a 7 out of 10 is because the climax was putrid. In all the other Harry Potter films the story starts off small and slowly leads up to the dramatic climax. For the order of the phoenix, the climax is the fight scene between Voldemort's death eaters, and the Order of the Phoenix. However, in the film the climax is only two minutes long. In the book, it described in detail, the fight scene in which harry, his friends, and members of the order took on the ministry. I was so EXCITED to see that fight and I became disappointed when it only lasted a few seconds. I would've love to see Tonks battle Bellatrix Lestrange. The thing I really wanted to see was how Ron, Neville, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, got away from Umbridge and her ""army."" I thought the director spent too much time concentrating on Umbridge, and Dumbledore's army. The climax wasn't exciting like the other films. I did however, really enjoy the acting. When I read the book, I had a picture in my mind about what Umbridge was like, and it was exact. She was portrayed impeccably. Same thing with Luna Lovegood. I guess my expectations are getting higher, and higher. And my expectations weren't met."

","To be honest I didn't have very high hopes for this film. However, that kind of situation can usually allow for one to be impressed. This, however, was not the case.<br/><br/>To say that it may have been the most difficult book of the seven to put to screen is really not that much of an understatement. It is by far the longest, and had the most going on throughout the book, with the Ministry turning into a full-blown cover-up organization and Harry and co. just trying to survive the bashing of Harry in the tabloids. Cue the worst possible script imaginable.<br/><br/>I can't be nice about this. I watched this movie by myself, which means I wasn't going to be influenced by friends or family. That said, this movie was ridiculous (and not in a good way). I felt like the movie was on light speed. It blew by from plot point to plot point to plot point so quickly that half the characters received the most minimal of screen time, including Alan Rickman's Snape, who looked shocked every time he actually got to say something, as half of his screen time involved no speaking, just standing around. Sirius was even further abused. He would look longingly at Harry as though he wished he had time amongst the cascades of events in the movie to just talk to him. Pathetic. Then, as if it couldn't GET ANY WORSE, Ginny is not even in the movie. I've watched it twice now, but she's not even present for any kind of role at all outside of her sitting at the table in the Weasley's house. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't the future WIFE of Harry Potter get a little more CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT than that?!<br/><br/>Well, typically, the answer would be yes, but character development was at an all-time low in this one, as the ENTIRE chapter on the O.W.L.'s which was very tense and interesting, was replaced with one exam seen, proctored by Umbridge and spruced up with some unimpressive CGI mischief. In addition, as the characters moved from event to event to event, they always seemed to be out of breath, and I couldn't tell if it was from all the running they were constantly doing or the breakneck pace of the movie. Everyone just kind of popped up to ask what was going on or, in the case of several characters, including Sirius, who had been my all-time favorite character in the series, just as enemy fodder. To me, every character in this movie felt like a throwaway, and when your movie is full of garbage, the best it can be is a garbage can.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are plenty of people who just liked the movie because it looks good. However, I'm not simply drawn to shiny things, I need some actual substance in my movies, so for me, this is honestly one of the worst movies ever made."

"ccthemovieman-1","6","17","34","17 December 2007"," Humorous, But Hard To Follow If You Haven't Read The Book
","If you scan the first hundred reviews of this movie on this website, I think you'll see the words ""disappointed"" and ""disappointment"" more than any other adjectives. I, too, found it the same. I have not read any of the books, but I've seen - and enjoyed - the four previous movies, so I expected to full enjoy this one.<br/><br/>This film disappointed me because (1) - I felt the story was nothing I could make a lot of sense out of, since I hadn't read the 800 or 900-page book. If one didn't read the book and knew this story, it was easy to get lost about a number of things in here. The screenplay was ""choppy,"" hard to follow in spots. Some of the things, like the death of Sirius Black, happened so fast I didn't know exactly what happened. This was just too uneven and rushed to keep us non-HP readers interested, story-wise; (2) - Harry wasn't the nice little kid throughout most of it, and he admitted it - that he was angry most of the time. Well, I agree, and he wasn't fun to watch, as he had been in the other films. I am used to a good-kid HP, not an angry teen; (3) - His two closest buddies, Ron and Hermione, looked like they mailed in their roles, especially Ron who looked like he was half-asleep during the film. (Maybe he was pouting because he had so few lines, who knows? I wouldn't blame him, frankly.); (4) I get tired of filmmakers giving us the rebel-as-hero and authority figure-as-villain. Enough is enough on that theme, which is so heavy-handedly presented here it becomes ludicrous. (5) If you are going to have a major villain, SHOW him, don't hide him for 99 percent of the film, which is what they did here with Voldemort.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I DID get enjoyment out of all the little special effects, many of which were humorous and always fun to watch. I got a kick out of many of the new faces in the film, and it also was fun to see some characters we had seen only in perhaps one previous film, such as Emma Thompson's teacher role. I also thought the music was outstanding: the best I've heard in the five Potter films. I wonder how many others appreciated it in here?<br/><br/>All in all, it was visually fun to watch and hear, as all the HP movies have been, but the story was just not entertaining as much as the others."

","To whom it may concern, I also reviewed 'HP and the Goblet of Fire' and gave it 8 stars. Read it if you like because I sort of touch on the same issues here.<br/><br/>As we know, the first few Potter films were widely criticised for being absolutely stuffed with everything from the books. As the books got longer, though, it would be inevitable that heavy trimming would have to be done. They did well with 'Goblet of Fire.' They didn't do well here.<br/><br/>Remember the threesome scene in 'A Clockwork Orange?' The mechanical and acrobatic sex captured as if it was in fast-forward? This is what this movie is like. The whole name of the game here is expediency and efficiency. A lot of the major scenes from the book are here except they are whittled down to the shortest time possible and include only a couple of lines. There's no build up or pleasure. Potter has his Arthur Weasley vision and 30 seconds later Shacklebolt is saying 'You can't deny, Dumbledore's got style.' Yet nearly everything stylish about Dumbledore's escape in the scene has been cut. All the fun has been drained out just so everything can be crammed in. The task of trying to balance making a good movie and put in everything essential to the whole Potter mythology has clearly taken its toll. Though I was able to keep up, the casual movie-goer by now is going to be hard-pressed keeping up with all the talk about prophecies, floo-networks and Padfoots.<br/><br/>So because of the overriding tone of speed, slash and burn, I couldn't enjoy the story, and therefore, the film. As for the good points: This is a major franchise movie and the money put into it clearly shows. Art direction like the Ministry of Magic and the Department of Mysteries is glorious to behold, but even here, there is a sense of overkill. The duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort would have been much better if it was like in the book but here its a huge amount of flashing sparks. As for the acting, all the main actors are quite comfortable in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe has improved a lot though I don't think he'll ever entirely banish the wood from his performances. What is most pleasing about the entire film is the new characters. Imelda Staunton is most entertaining as Dolores Umbridge, and the chick who plays Luna Lovegood did her perfectly. I smiled every time she was on screen. And Helena Bonham Carter has a lot of fun as deranged sexy death eater Bellatrix Lestrange. Marry me, Ms. Carter, I'll be good to you.<br/><br/>4/10. Don't bother seeing it. And good luck to the people who have to put the 6th and 7th books on the screen. They'll need it."

","I was very pleased with this movie; in contrast to the other books, I found Order of the Phoenix as a book pretty dull and forgettable. But I felt the movie really brought it to life and narrowed it down into a much more succinct story. Some people would see this as a negative and others will think it is a positive.<br/><br/>Emma Watson's acting, as previously mentioned, is a little forced, but at the same time it does suit the type of character she is playing, and overall it can be forgiven. I think the special effects used in the Department of Mysteries and the battle scene were fabulous, and the screenplay was excellent, particularly when you look at the screenplays from the first couple of films.<br/><br/>I know I really enjoyed this film and it far exceeded my expectations. While the movies will never match up to the sheer brilliance of the books, I think the Harry Potter films are 'bloody brilliant' as an additional outlet for fans and a great way to enjoy the stories in a new medium."

","Are you kidding me? After years of inspiring books and movies that keep getting better, the Harry Potter franchise has finally hit a snag.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie, I was with two people who hadn't read the book. At the end of the movie, my best friend turns to me and says, ""I liked it, but what was with the prophecy?"" WHAT WAS WITH THE PROPHECY?! Gosh, David Yates has no talent if he can't even make the main point of the book come across clear.<br/><br/>Also, with all of the missing pieces, and the pieces of the movie that were wrong, he's really set himself up for the next movie, that he's already been told he's directing. I watched Daniel Radcliffe on Jay Leno the day before I saw the movie, and he said that Yates had kept up the integrity of the other movies while adding his own spin. Well he certainly added his own spin, even if it was poorly made and had no continuity with the other movies. <br/><br/>Can you really have Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix with only 2 scenes concerning the Order? Honestly, Umbridge was an important part of the book, and I understand that, but she wasn't the main character. If you just go by the movie, you'd think that she was supposed to outshine Harry!! Also, did anyone else notice that Sirius died WRONG? There was no Firenze? Umbridge never almost caught Sirius in the fire? There was no Quiddich?!<br/><br/>I read that there was going to be no Quiddich before the movie came out, and even then I was outraged. With that being such an essential part of this book, with Harry's privileges being taken away, and Ginny having to become Seeker...Gosh, again, I blame it all on David Yates.<br/><br/>Luna Lovegood was the only remotely interesting new character this movie, and as much as I hate to admit it, Fred and George were boring. It's crazy when two of my favorite characters are boring in my eyes. Their leaving scene was completely messed up, and they leave at the wrong time, but HA! you'd never know that, since there was no real time progression in this movie.<br/><br/>This is just one super Harry Potter fan speaking about a movie that made her disappointed."

It has precisely the problem that I worried the first film would have: it seems designed for those who have already read the book. Those who haven't will be confused out of their mind. Necessary plot connections are left out, and the relevance of certain material is never explained. One pivotal scene even references a particular character's code name from the Marauder's Map, something that has never been mentioned before in the movie series and which will make no sense at all to non-readers. And yet, as a reader, I did enjoy the film. I once called the first Harry Potter movie a ""preview of the book,"" but this one fits that description much more.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is not the movie itself, but the gradual decline of the books. In ""Order of the Phoenix,"" the series lost much of its sense of fun as it got bogged down in the ongoing story. It contained a few elements I really liked, amidst pages of matters I found unappealing. What held it together was a wonderfully horrible villainess, Professor Umbridge, who functions as a satire of England's educational system. Even as an American, I can relate to the criticism of schoolteachers who favor theory over practice, preferring textbook assignments to practical skill-building. In the Harry Potter universe, that leaves the students in mortal peril, keeping them from learning the skills they need to protect themselves against Voldemort, the super-villain whom Umbridge, a puppet of the magical government, denies has returned. Harry creates a secret club to teach students how to defend themselves. All the while, Umbridge inflicts a reign of terror on the school, with harsh and sometimes painful punishments for anyone--student and teacher alike--who steps out of line.<br/><br/>At 870 pages, it is the longest Harry Potter book, and I believe it should have been cut down. The manner in which Harry languishes through the ordeal becomes monotonous, with long sections in which not much happens. By contrast, the movie is the shortest in the series so far, less than 2 hours and 15 minutes if you don't count the credits. I expected this condensation to benefit the film, but instead it makes the whole proceedings choppy. Just a few minutes of extra screen time could have substantially improved the coherence. It gives me a greater appreciation for how the third movie--still by far the best one--achieved the paradoxical effect of streamlining the story while seeming richer and fuller in some ways.<br/><br/>I have never heard of the director, David Yates, and I don't understand why he's already been chosen to direct the next Harry Potter film. The series has already had two skillful directors, Alfonso CuarÃ³n and Mike Newell, each brought on for just one film. Maybe Harry Potter directors face the same Catch-22 as James Bond actors, namely that anyone good enough for the job has better things to do in their career.<br/><br/>Yates makes a mixed impression at best. He gives the film some of the most unoriginal imagery the series has yet seen, drawing upon old horror movie conventions as Harry is haunted by dreams and visions of Voldemort. The technical credits show some lack of continuity with the previous films. A couple of creatures look different, and John Williams' charming score has been inexplicably replaced by a more generic one.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the performances are mostly quite good. Familiar cast members like Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, and Gary Oldman continue to bring warmth and style to their roles. Daniel Radcliffe maintains his natural, understated performance that goes well with the introspective tone of the story. Actors I have not admired as much, such as Rupert Grint as Harry's friend Ron, and Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, seem to have improved significantly. There are also some impressive newcomers to the series: Evanna Lynch as the flaky Luna Lovegood, Helena Bonham Carter as the Wicked Witch-like Bellatrix Lestrange, and Imelda Staunton, who seems to provide a perfect embodiment of the short and shrill Umbridge. The weakest link is Ralph Fiennes, whom I suspect spent no more than a day filming his scenes as Voldemort. He seems to disappear into the makeup, making me wonder what was the point of bringing such an esteemed actor to this role.<br/><br/>The movie has some nice touches that weren't in the book, such as Umbridge's office being lined with moving photographs of meowing cats (I suspect that Yates is a cat lover, like myself) and Filch crowding the walls with Umbridge's inquisitorial decrees. But my favorite scene from the book--Dumbledore's hilarious exit--is truncated here and considerably less effective. Other crucial scenes seem to have no purpose except for setting up what is to come in the later films. Overall, this is the worst Harry Potter adaptation to date."
"Alexandria-7","1","17","35","11 July 2007"," A disappointment...
","I was extremely depressed by the way this movie turned out. I, being one who read and appreciated the story in the book, was forced to compare it constantly to the movie. The movie lacked significant parts of the book, parts that do end up in later texts, such as Siruis' two-way mirror, Ron and Hermione being prefects, and Neville being able to see Thestrals and hear the voices from the arch, while Ron and Hermione can not, which they made viewers believe that Neville could not..<br/><br/>I cannot view this movie as a good movie, without a book, because it randomly inserted parts of the book, such as the title of the D.A. which is first mentioned by Dumbledore when he was under question by the Ministry, expecting the viewers to have read the book.<br/><br/>The young witches and wizards are also seen using spells without verbally announcing the spells, an ability that they learn in a later book. Also, the D.A. uses the spell Levicorpus, a spell introduced in HBP, and important to the discovery of the identity of the Half Blood Prince. A minor complaint that happened to urk me, as does the lack of the words SNEAK in pimples across the betrayers nose(from the book.) My biggest problem with the movie? The lack of integration of the parts. All of the Occlumency lessons occurred around the same time, the D.A. meetings were in a short time frame, and the decrees were all announced in about 15 minutes. The film had important moments in short bursts, not a slow, well-timed introductions that would keep the audience interested in those particular parts of the movie, while simultaneously showing them a new situation.<br/><br/>The film bounced around to various scenes, without connective tissue. One minute the plot is focusing on Umbridge, then suddenly we see students in Hogsmede.<br/><br/>I will applaud the use of music, which was well-written and well-timed. I loved the visual effects, the movie was seen with Digital quality, the first movie in the theater to be so.<br/><br/>I am disappointed by the screenwriters lack of adaptive ability and the serious neglect of the director and producers to get the best story from a screenplay. What happened to the awesomeness that was the first movie (which only needed Hermione's trial in the Third floor corridor) and the second movie (the one that, in my opinion, what the most true to the original story)? Why did this franchise alienate the fans of the book?"
"kashlie","2","8","14","13 July 2007"," Not happy at all!
","Yes, the images were great, yes the movie had its moments, but overall, I was extremely disappointed and upset! Yes, it was a long book to cut down and fit in to two hours, but to completely change things??? To bring in things that didn't occur AT ALL in the book? If you have not read the books, then enjoy, I am sure it would be brilliant however it may be hard to follow, as nothing is really explained. Some of the changes work positively, upon reflection, but others clash with events in the Half Blood Prince, which if this goes ahead as a movie, the screenwriter will have one tough job ahead to make things right. See it, by all means. Fans of the book will understand this post once they have seen what I have. Shame shame shame."

"DonFishies","7","7","12","1 August 2007"," Haphazard film-making makes for a rather disappointing fifth part of the series
","Even though I am only a moderate fan of the books (meaning I have yet to finish the last book, despite having it since the day it came out), I usually look at the release of a new Harry Potter as something to get excited about. Even though the quality is not always spot-on, there is just something about them that allows them to feel wondrous and fantastical all at once. And even with their numerous problems (albeit, not as bad as those associated with The Lord of the Rings trilogy), they still end up being rather enjoyable. Sadly, I think the quality has really begun to slip, as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the first film since Philosopher's Stone that actually disappointed me as a film-goer and reader of the books.<br/><br/>I will not shed too much light on the plot (and the numerous subplots) that densely layer this fifth instalment, but suffice to say for those who have yet to venture through the book, will find Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) on thin ice with the wizarding world in regards to his accusations over the return of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). But as those close to him rally to fight against the Dark Lord, Harry just may have to face a few more problems than he probably would like to.<br/><br/>Going in, I knew Order of the Phoenix was going to be a challenging watch. The book is the longest of the entire series, and is probably the densest. I liked it when I first read it, but subsequent re-readings of mere selections from the book have proved tiresome, and quite long-winded. Much the same then, has to go for the film. There is quite a bit going on, but you never quite feel like you are truly experiencing a genuinely well written storyline. Yes, it does feel very in tune with being just part of the larger framework of an entire series, but at least the others (with the minor exception of Goblet of Fire), have attempted to stay fairly within itself and not completely determinant on the audience having seen the previous films in order to fully understand this one.<br/><br/>While Order of the Phoenix does pack in a whole lot more of the book than the previous film did, it does so at a price. Many of the key subplots and even key story lines have been compacted into sometimes lengthy montage sequences. And while this would not be a problem in any other movie, it quickly becomes irritating here for just how many times it is done as time progresses on. At one point, it would be safe to say two montages were split by a sheer two minute scene. And these were five-minute montages! I am certain that they could have either compacted some of these scenes even further, or just fleshed a few more out. It would have helped the characters and the story be so much more well rounded than it is.<br/><br/>What the film also does not do is improve upon the shallow and ultimately anti-climactic ending. Instead, as hard as it is to believe, it is made worse. The initial start of the build-up towards the finale is very well done, and very well realized, but right when the real heavy hitting elements begin to pop up, the film falters. Besides not looking anywhere near what J.K. Rowling's original written words described, it feels genuinely rushed, and almost a second thought. If I had not read the book, I probably would have found much of the sequence to be rather incoherent, and other parts just totally misplaced. It just does not seem to be as well made and polished as other scenes in the movie, and everything from the acting, to the special effects, to even the story itself, suffer as a result.<br/><br/>Speaking of special effects, what happened to them? In previous films, the artists and designers worked hard to make everything look so realistic and so well blended together that one would never realize the difference between reality and fantasy. But here, almost every effect (with a few minor exceptions, one being the awesome opening sequence of the finale) looks very haphazardly created, and with zero to no enthusiasm for what was being created. People look fake in a lot of scenes, and the totally CGI-rendered characters stand out as almost blatantly not real.<br/><br/>But then, that is what this film really stands out to me as: a blatant unenthusiastic romp through a very messy book. The performances are all very well done (with a brilliant standout being Imelda Staunton as the quintessentially evil Dolores Umbridge), even those with very miniscule roles. But they are the only thing holding this production together. Everything is very erratically designed, but nothing feels anywhere near as magical or as fantastical as those earlier films. It just lacks the genuine zest that has become accustomed to the Harry Potter films, and replaces it with a very dull sheet of blandness. Yes, this can be blamed on Rowling's flawed fifth book, but the last four films have had even their most boring pieces cleansed over into something that feels keenly tied to the fantasy elements of the books. Here, there is a more heightened sense of realism for the actors, and not much else. It feels devoid of any of the magic that made these films so popular in the first place. Pitch black darkness content-wise is nowhere near a viable excuse for poor film-making.<br/><br/>With its problems, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix still pulls through as being heartbreakingly average. The story is still there, and the performances are some of the best to date, but I cannot help but feel that the magic is sorely missing from this instalment.<br/><br/>7/10."
"HermioneFan2008","4","7","12","26 July 2007"," By far the worst movie in the series
","THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS--DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE READ ALL THE BOOKS.<br/><br/>I am very disappointed with this movie. As hundreds of people have already said, way too much was left out. For example, what about the actual Order of the Phoenix? The movie barely makes any mention of it yet that is the main point of the movie! Very little time is spent showing the Headquarters (Sirius Black's house) including the house-elf Kreacher. Kreacher played a very, very important role in sending Harry to the Ministry of Magic to ""rescue"" Sirius when he (Kreacher) lied about Sirius not being home. Kreacher lied upon the orders of his other master, Bellatrix Lestrange. I mean, Kreacher's loyalty to Bellatrix Lestrange is an essential point to include--especially as the storyline progresses with future movies. On that note, Kreacher also stole a locket in the book which will become important in the final movie. (The locket was one of the horcruxes.) To my recollection, Kreacher was shown a mere few seconds in the movie. A terrible mistake.<br/><br/>The blame for the missing scenes goes to the screenwriter. It was his first, and let us all hope LAST, Harry Potter script. I believe that Steve Kloves is coming back for ""The Half-Blood Prince"" and hopefully ""The Deathly Hallows"" as well. Content was very similar to the books on the first four movies because Kloves does a superb job with his scripts.<br/><br/>In changing topics, the acting performances were inferior to the previous movies. I blame this on the director (David Yates) because we have witnessed better performances from the actors in the other movies! I am a major Emma Watson fan, but I need to be honest in saying that she did a poor job in this movie delivering her lines. THIS IS NOT HER FAULT, THOUGH. The director is to blame--he should have done a better job coaching them into performing the scenes.<br/><br/>I am however pleased with the new characters, especially Umbridge. This is because we have no previous performances to compare with Umbridge or Lovegood so their performances appear very good without a contrast. A better evaluation of those characters will come in the next movie, but as of this post, David Yates is supposed to direct it as well. (That concerns me greatly.) Honestly, I recommend people to just skip this movie and read the book instead."
"aparajita_burjwal","10","12","24","14 July 2007"," HP 5 - The Best yet !
","I went through a lot of comments on IMDb & realized that most of the people who were disappointed with the film had one common reason to give - It did not match up to the book i.e Many important scenes were left out.<br/><br/>We need to understand here that the comparison between the book and the film is absolutely baseless, They are two different forms of media, and express the Plot in different ways. You can't pick a common scene from both say 'Oh ! Harry wasn't supposed to scratch his nose here !'. Agreed, The films are based on the books, but the interpretation cannot be the same. The books have been developed & conceived by JKR ( Who is no less than a magician herself ), and the movies have been conceived by various directors, There is no way that all of them can have the same perception. In fact, We should rather separate the films from the books and appreciate them both. I am an Avid HP Books reader myself, but I enjoy both ( Films & Books ) without trying to intermingle the two perceptions & draw out differences & comparisons.<br/><br/>I must also give a standing ovation to Yates, who did an absolutely stunning job of compressing the huge book into a film of 2 hours. Considering the ever-increasing number of pages with each passing book, I think Yates did a Fantastic Job of building his storyline, keeping the limited runtime in mind.<br/><br/>Coming to the Film, Why I say that it is the best yet is because it captures the basic raw emotion of the book & gets the message across very well, Which primarily is that Voldermort's powers are expanding & the Magical world is not safe anymore. There is a distinct difference between the fifth one & the previous films. There is no laughter, no fooling around, No considering Magic as an extra-ordinary thing. The Magical World has now been entangled in an inevitable war against the Dark Forces, and they have to face it.<br/><br/>Casting has been done fabulously, Helena Carter ( Bellatrix Lestrange ) was great. She had that uncanny & wild look to her, which is what Bellatrix is all about. Imelda Staunton ( Umbridge ) was fantastic again. She fits into the role of Umbridge so effortlessly, that you cannot imagine anyone but her while reading the book again. Gary Oldman ( Sirius Black ) is great as usual. Ralph Fiennes is the ONLY Voldermort. He is simply excellent.<br/><br/>The main cast have done a stupendous job. Daniel Radcliffe has molded himself into the role of Harry, He has improved beyond my expectations. The Anguish, hurt & Pain has been expressed wonderfully by him, which is clearly visible when Sirius dies. Emma Watson & Rupert Grint were awesome as Hermione & Ron.<br/><br/>The Visual effects were great as usual, The ending was climatic, specially the dual between Voldermort & Dumbledore. I was sitting with my hands tightly clutching the armrests in the Hall during the scene. The entire sequence in the Department of Mysteries is visually stunning.<br/><br/>In the end, Watch this film without expecting your perception of the book to come true. Since Books came out before films, it is inevitable that most of the people form a solid picture in their minds while reading, and disliking the film because one's perception wasn't displayed on screen, is not grounds enough to reject it, IMO. 10/10 from my side ! Both the Film & The Book Rock !"
"AthenaPallas","10","6","10","27 August 2007"," Very very excellent movie
","A lot of people criticise this movie. Before I watched it I though I'll be disappointed but contrary was the case. Helena-Bonham Carter as Bellatrix was pretty fantastic, she did very good job. As well Evanna Lynch aka Luna Loved or Imelda Stunton aka Dolores Umbridge. But Jason Isaacs in the role of Lucius Malfoy will be for me the most fantastic person forever. You know I am deep-rooted fan of Jason/Lucius and I love him. I gotta say that he was the most handsome in The Order Of The Phoenix. My the most favorite scene was the one when Sirius says ""Get away from my godson!"" and punches Lucius (lol). Or when Harry says ""I've waited fourteen years"" and Lucius does the perfect sympathetic face and says ""I know"". If If I'd have to write my favorite scenes I would be here from dusk till dawn. As well Severus Snape is amazing. He is my second favorite character. But it's a shame he isn't in The Order Of The Phoenix more often. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are getting older but their performances are really good. By the way Voldemort was brilliant. I don't want to say that this movie is without mistakes. There are some. I think The Order Of The Phoenix is too short. I lack for Quidditch. Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy is really indispensable character. He is on the scene too little. Of course everyone confronts the movie with the book. Over these minute reservations, I want David Yates to shoot the 6th and the 7th part. Sorry for my English."
"Pozerski1","4","6","10","6 August 2007"," Great book.... poor movie
","Book was so full of information, it would be difficult if not impossible to make the transformation. They took out so much that most of movie I felt that I was witness to repeated inside jokes, because of all the material that was mentioned but not explained... I don't think the movie would make much sense if you hadn't read the book...<br/><br/>Important Minor characters like Moody and Tonks are very much neglected in this movie, and the good characters revenges in the end are not shown. For example: Fred and George leaving in the school in the book was quite a challenge for Umbridge in the book, and was quite satisfying, but in the movie it was a minor inconvenience for Umbridge<br/><br/>Hopefully they'll be able to be more accurate with the rest of the series.<br/><br/>Umbrige and Luna were well portrayed though!"

","I am a huge fan of the books. I own a popular fansite, snitchseeker.com, just so you know I'm more than an average fan.<br/><br/>At the same time, I have enjoyed the other movies, in spite of the many changes from the books.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I have been skeptical about this film since the announcement of the director, David Yates.<br/><br/>However, when two from my site's news team got early peeks of the film, they both had overwhelmingly positive reviews! (One slightly more positive than the other, but still!) If you want to read their positive reviews, go to snitchseeker.com and click the reviews links (one contains spoilers, one does not).<br/><br/>So I decided I would watch the film, completely unbiased - even excited about it!<br/><br/>** SPOILERS START HERE **<br/><br/>It starts out very well: Harry sitting on a swing in a small park, watching some kids playing, the kids and mums leave, Dudley and gang enter, Dudley teases Harry about crying for Cedric in his sleep, Harry gets mad and threatens Dudley with wand, the sky clouds up real quick, Dudley's gang flee the scene, rain begins to pour, Harry and Dudley run under an overpass for shelter, Dementors attack.<br/><br/>This is where it goes downhill.<br/><br/>I wonder if Yates has even read the book. He says he has, but maybe he only skimmed through it quickly. He certainly missed the details and nuances other directors have picked up.<br/><br/>Mrs. Figg was not in the slightest annoyed or frightened about the attack. She was casual, nonchalant, not really caring about Harry at all.<br/><br/>The Advanced Guard scene was hacked to bits with only the bare necessities remaining - and without Lupin. I swear, the entire affair is about 30 seconds long.<br/><br/>In the movie, the guard consisted of Tonks, Moody, Shacklebolt and a silent Elphias Doge. (Nice to see him!) However, it left out the other witches: Hestia Jones and Emmeline Vance. And no Lupin! Fine, I can live with that. But they arrive in Harry's bedroom, they don't explain anything, only say he is to come with them, and then it shows them lined up outside the house with their brooms and they take off! That's the whole scene!<br/><br/>On the positive side, they made the flight more interesting by soaring them through London rather than high up in the clouds.<br/><br/>The arrival at Grimmauld Place was done well enough. I liked seeing the houses magically stretch to make room for number 12. But the house was a MAJOR disappointment: No Mrs Black, no house-elf-heads on the walls, no disinfecting, no Buckbeak, no murderous ghouls, and hardly any Kreacher. While Lupin was present here, he had only one or two lines and Tonks had even less. Sirius Black gets all the dialog here.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the ""extendable ears"" and the twins apparating were cool and Mrs. Weasley was terrific. It was also nice to see Tonks changing her face a bit to resemble a pig and then a duck, with Ginny laughing at her.<br/><br/>After about three minutes of ""The Order"" we are whisked off on a speedy journey to the Ministry for Harry's trial. This was another major disappointment as it wasn't explained to the audience exactly what they were doing nor why they were traveling as muggles. I missed a line from Arthur along the lines of, ""Harry, we must travel as muggles this morning, using no magic because we want to give a good impression before your trial."" Instead we get a 5-second glimpse of their trip (a subway station and a sidewalk) and then the phone booth.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most disappointing of the whole film was the lackluster design of the Ministry of Magic. Supposedly a Governmental establishment and yet ALL of the walls and floors of this place are simply BLACK! It's just ridiculous! Not only that but it looks so small compared to how it read in the books. Supposedly 10 levels, my house looks bigger than this place.<br/><br/>Department of Mysteries? They only show the Hall of Prophesies and the Death Chamber (the room with the infamous veil). No exciting ROTATING ROOM (which you'd think would be a major part of this since it's even pictured on the cover of the US edition of the book!), no Time Room, Planet Room or Brain Room. Very, very sad.<br/><br/>I just realized this review is turning into an essay, and that's not the point here at IMDb. So let me finish off.<br/><br/>Here is the order in which I place the films (best to worst):<br/><br/>Goblet of Fire (9) :: Prisoner of Azkaban (more Marauders would have placed this on top) (8) :: Chamber of Secrets (7) :: Philosopher's Stone (better CGI would place this one higher) (7) :: Order of the Phoenix (6)<br/><br/>I fear for the end result of my second-favorite book so far: Half-Blood Prince. It's a shame Yates will be directing that one too. Let's hope the franchise ends with a bang by allowing another director in for Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! :)"

","I was shocked. The novel was so good and I don't see why they have to make a 2.5 hour movie for a novel as big as 800 pages. Not only many scenes were missing, the duals with the death eaters was awful. People flying every where and no real dueling with the wands for death eaters. They can glide as the dementors do... Oh I guess David Yates should be writing a new book instead. And the Dudley demented and a peck of owls chapters, it was complete mess! There was only one owl and the post was like a polite howler (really funny), and the acting of the artists on the screen was horrible. The occlumency classes were horrible and I did not like the dialog delivery myself. And the Sirius death and the emotions after that were real mess. It was cut short. And why was Kreacher present in the movie. His role was so cut short and I thought it was a waste of time. If J.K. Rowling wanted Kreacher to be there give the role some time on the screen. And finally Dumbledore's dual with Voldermort, this was as horrible as the other parts of the film. I wish the movie had been more than 3 hours. If this movie is like this I don't know what they make out of sixth book which I like it most of the series. I wish they don't make it as horrible as this part."

Although the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort was pretty cool. I thought that Tonks was done pretty well, but at first I was disappointed with Looney, however just her voice was creepy enough.

","By the time i saw the very first trailer for this movie, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I was completely amazed and I knew I needed to see it. When I seen the movie the first day it came out i was speechless. David Yates the director did a fantastic job on this movie and it is the best one in the whole series. Although the movie cut out some of the most important parts of the book, he made it even better adding great scenes that made the movie so good. Goldenburg, the screenwriter wanted to make it shorter because if he had put everything in the movie would end up being 3 to 3 and a half hours long. The sixth movie should be even better because Yates is directing this one as well and the original screenwriter Steve Kloves is coming back for this and hopefully the last movie as well. I have no problem with the screenwriter for the 5th movie but he cut out much and I love the 6th book so Im sure Kloves will do much better to put in all important scenes. But if you love Harry Potter and like the movies the YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!! It is the greatest one so far..."
"JAHbless","3","5","8","5 August 2007"," Disappointment.
","If they were going to chop up the whole book and use bits and pieces, then why didn't they use the correct story line? In the movie, all the events half were factual and half were fiction. Like for instance, the part where they met Luna -- they met her in the train in the book, but in the movie they met her when they were headed towards Hogwarts. I know they did it with the other movies, but this being the longest book, it should have had more parts into it. It was interesting, but I had hoped it would be much longer and much more detailed, based upon the book. Like, them cleaning up Sirus house, they spent so much time in his house in the book, but they barely showed that. Plus the Quidditch match, and Ron being on the team. I would have loved to see that."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a wonderful book that I thoroughly enjoyed. And so, I thought that the movie would be equally good, and I also thought this because the other movies were excellent. However, the 5th movie was absolutely awful. They left out so much in the movie that would have had a great impact that it was astonishing to me that it wasn't included.Why does the fifth Harry Potter film show so little feeling for its characters? Possibly because it is directed by David Yates, the fourth director to work on this series and the first with no experience on a Hollywood movie; most of his work so far has been in British television. Perhaps he was too busy learning the ropes of such a technically challenging film to keep his eye on the story's heart and soul. I do like Harry Potter movies, but this one...watch something else.

","Hey guys i dunno how i could see 8+ rating for this film..This film is not really worth that rating...i understand I'm being skeptical but no matter this film is completely off the book..I missed magic in this film..The story moves very slowly in the first half and moreover the duel at the ministry of magic was very disappointing...The whole shelf of prophecies smashing etc etc and where did the half moon spectacles of Dumbeldore gone??I was an ardent fan of movies and books of harry potter but this really brought the heck out of me...Luna was perfect for the story so is Imelda Staunton...At least the forthcoming movies should be made according to the book.."

","Evening descends on Hogwarts . Hagrid stares out of a window in his hut; Harry, Hermoine and Ron follow his gaze. A storm approaches, billowing ominously. Howling wind blows between the cracks in Hagrid's door, seeming to spread to the very edges of the wizarding world. Hagrid broods: ""It's happening again you three... just like last time."" Alas, I can only paraphrase, but Hagrid's warning captures a pervasive, unmistakable sense of impending doom. The characters - and the audience - begin to feel; to understand: Lord Voldemort has truly returned, and his campaign to terrorize the wizarding world - all over again - has begun.<br/><br/>Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts in this 5th installment of the 7 part story, and he has been forced to grow up. Rather than dwell on thoughts of this year's quidditch cup; or reminisce about the sweet, warm taste of butterbeer, or the latest, most whimsical magical spell in Charms, this year at Hogwarts shows Harry downcast...haunted (even tortured) by what happened in year four. Voldemort succeeded in deceiving Harry, regaining a physical body, and committing murder. Cedric Diggory, Harry's friend and Triwizard Tournament rival, was killed - without warning. As film 5 begins, the awful truth is made clear, the magical world Harry Potter loved since he first discovered it at 11 years of age, is not safe anymore.<br/><br/>This year Harry is blindsided by Cornelius Fudge - the Minister of Magic - who in an act of cowardice has gone to great lengths to deny Voldemort's return. He has created a smear campaign to discredit Harry, and anyone else that shows any support whatsoever for Harry's statements about Lord Voldemort being 'back' (particularly Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, who firmly believes Harry). Furthermore, Fudge sends his undersecretary - Dolores Umbrige - to Hogwarts as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Umbrige helps the Minister keep Hogwarts (the students, the faculty, even the curriculum) under the Minstry's firm (and eventually, complete) control. So insult (Harry being called a liar) is added to the injury (Harry's facing Voldemort, barely escaping, but losing a friend).<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the 5th installment of the Harry Potter films. I followed Harry Potter's story through JK Rowlings books (and Jim Dale's rich, layered narration), but my fondness for the story extended to its interpretations on film. All directors, for the most part, have done well (special fondness however, for Alfuono Cuaron's 'Prisoner of Azkaban'). But I must say, David Yates has taken the translation and interpretation of Harry's story in this 5th film to a whole new level of excellence, building a great sense of excitement for the two remaining installments in the series.<br/><br/>There is so much I enjoyed from this film! The performances were outstanding. Dan Radcliffe is maturing, and his emulation of Harry's internal trauma and external frustration is marvelous - he really did the character of Harry Potter a great service. Imelda Stuanton is a treasure as Dolores Umbrige. Her plastic smiles and 'hem hem's have to be seen to be believed (fans of the book will be delighted!) Imelda displays incredible range as an actress and captures the character of Dolores to a 't'. Also, my favorite female character from the book - Luna Lovegood - is a treat to watch! Evanna Lynch made Luna touch my heart on the screen as much as she does in the book! Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give their performances some great heart, and it is easy to see the sweet romance in Hermoine and Ron's future. I won't mention ALL the actors (everyone was good, basically), but can I just GUSH about how well Alan Rickman has captured the character of Severus Snape?!? Any fan of the books knows how important his character becomes to the conclusion of the Harry Potter story, but quite honestly, Snape has been a consistent pleasure to watch in ALL of the Harry Potter films. He barely speaks TEN FULL LINES of dialog in this installment, but I think he made almost every single line a cinema classic! And kudos also to Gary Oldman for bringing a real 'coolness' to Sirius Black.<br/><br/>There were funny moments scattered amidst the dark, and they felt very natural and well-timed. Many of the adult characters stay in the background, and the focus is kept on Harry and his friends fighting Voldemort (and Umbrige) in their own extra-special way. Harry starts to teach defensive spells to any and every student that believes his story, and it's very exciting seeing many seemingly background characters (most especially Neville Longbottom) suddenly grow in depth and importance. The Order of the Phoenix is introduced briefly, then kept hidden for much of the film, making a dramatic entrance in the film's final scenes (a thrilling face-off that occurs when Voldemort finally decides to come out and play.)<br/><br/>David Yates' direction really gives the film a sense of momentum and dread. Watching the film, you begin to realize the Potter story is about to get very grand, and very dark (thanks to David, the story feels dark already, and wonderfully so). The first paragraph of this comment was inspired from the tension I felt watching the film, as several adult characters would quietly confess to Harry: ""it feels like it did before..."" Yates grabs hold of that feeling and doesn't let it go for the entire film. Even after the jaw-dropping climax (Order of the Phoenix vs. Voldemort's Death Eaters; Dumbledore vs. Voldemort), you feel that this is not the end of troubles to come for Harry, Dumbledore et al...not even close. The war between good and evil has officially begun, and one side shall not live so long as the other side survives...."

","well ... went to the cinema today all geared up with ma friend .. who is, like me a huge harry potter fanatic.<br/><br/>we were really excited with high expectations but the film really came as an anti climax.<br/><br/>when it finished i just turned to my friend and said .. I cant decide if I like that or not ... and that feeling still stays.<br/><br/>what was there was good .. and i mean by the graphics and scenery but they're always good.<br/><br/>There was just too much missed out .. it was like they got all the main bits and chucked them together without any explanation to how the got there.<br/><br/>the scenes i was looking forward to the most weren't there and also the scene where harry and cho got together lasted forever ... and I'm not complaining as it was filmed very well but like i mentioned before there was just no explanation of how they got there .. and also no date on valentines day .. i was highly looking forward to seeing cho strop and storm out AND i wanted to see Rita skeeter all downtrodden to contrast with her high involvement in the previous film.<br/><br/>and Dobby? where has he gone? i loved him in the second film and this time they cut him out yet again by making Neville find the room of requirement, and he didn't even walk past 3 three times .. gawwwd and i also wanted to see Neville's parents .. in person rather then Neville just looking at the photo, i feel that would have brought tons more emotion to the film which had ... like Hermione said about Ron ... the emotional range of a teaspoon.<br/><br/>and gildroy Lockhart .. that would have been nice to see where he ended up and would have added a bit of humour...<br/><br/>the best thing about the film was Luna ... i myself have been obsessed with the character since i first read the fifth book and was worried that they wouldn't b able to find an actress suitable to make it as good as the character is in the book ... but they found the exact right person for the part ... she is amazing .. didn't put a foot wrong ..<br/><br/>I'm also highly impressed with the casting for Dolores umbridge ... she is also exactly how i imagined her =] but yes ... the crucial scene at the end was a bit of a let down ... i thought there would be more time spent on the actual DA fighting the death eaters.. the scenes were not long enough and it was like oh Sirius lets go bye ... with hardly any explanation in that either..<br/><br/>although the part where voldemort speaks from within harry near the end was powerful .. that was one of the only bits that touched me and the film could have been made half an hour longer and included all these bits .. even just in passing .. there are films .. for example lord of the rings which are longer .. but good because they include everything that is essential .. but this i feel was just a few important points chucked together with a bit of scenery ...<br/><br/>hugely disappointed cant wait for the final book ... they are sure never to disappoint thanks T"

","The movie is fantastic, but it is way to short It's like only the high lights from the book is in this movie, and it lives me whit a empty feeling when it's over I know that almost 900 pages would make a very long film, but then again, what true Potter fan would mind a move that last 3 + hour ;o)<br/><br/>When this is said I must say that this must be one of the best movies in the series so far, and the actors in kicking ass for real in this movie <br/><br/>The appearing of Evanna Lynch is a big plus for the movie, she is very good in the role of Luna Lovegood, I have read that she was pick from 15000 other girls applying for the role of Luna, I think they made the right choice in casting her.<br/><br/>Daniel is giving his best preforms yet in this movie I thing, that boy is really a good actor.<br/><br/>And we must not forget to complement Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley), she is also a big plus for this movie, not just Ron's little sister any more :o) And then as always there is Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) the again is perfect in there roles.<br/><br/>I wrote 10 big bright stars for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix <br/><br/>Now go see this movie!!!!!!<br/><br/>Best regards <br/><br/>Franck Ottossøn Denmark..."
"Pargeo","4","3","4","7 January 2017"," Amateurish and lame
","I hated this film deeply when it was released, today I decided I'd give it another go - alas, I still hate this film - even more than before. The reasons: 1) 'I feel more lonely than ever before'; 'I am sorry for you, cos you never knew love and friendship'; 'We've got something to fighting for' - these are just three lines the script writer (or whoever decided to put them into Harry's mouth) should be hanged, drawn and quartered. Or, at least, publicly ridiculed - for they transformed the Harry JKR wrote into Percy Weasley, for only Percy could've said these lines - cheesy, false and vomit-inducing. 2) I suspect David Yates loves Stanley Kubrick movies, especially The Shining (two little girls scene - immobile, in the centre of the frame) - for he used this approach to framing just too many times while shooting this film (and the subsequent Potter films shot by different DoPs, so it's definitely the director's fault.) While it's certainly served its purpose in the S Kubrick films, continuous usage of the same approach in HP is maddening, to say the least - it just destroys the natural flow of the narration! 3) Dolores Umbridge treatment - instead of pure evil (as described by JKR both in the book and in the subsequent interviews), Yates & Goldenberg made her quite an average power-loving bureaucrat, nothing special (conveniently forgetting the fact it was her who sent the Dementors to Harry) 4) Music - it seems disconnected from the narration and sometimes inappropriate (like re-using the Escaping from Privet Drive track for end credits. 5) Continuity & lack of logic: for ex., how come the Occlumency scene was put before Harry & Weasley's leaving Hogwarts for Grimmauld Place? Why did Sirius give Harry that Order of the Phoenix photograph at the station? It should've happened earlier. 6) Unnecessary 'heavy' special effects, like apparition of the Grimmauld Place house (making it appear like JKR described it would've been much more effective and cheaper to boot.) 7) Dialogues (in addition to what I wrote about those infamous Harry lines) - it seems like the scriptwriter took some of the lines directly from the book, but didn't bother (or just was unable) to make them sound logical in the context of the film, which resulted in, for ex., Umbridge's speech at the beginning-of-the-year feast (and Ron's reaction to it) stupid and illogical. <br/><br/>Certainly this was the worst Potter film. I fail to understand how Mr Yates managed to appropriate the filming rights for the entire Potter franchise after this."
"bredmom1","1","3","4","18 July 2009"," half blood prince stunk
","What was David Yates thinking when he directed Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, it didn't even follow the book. He took a perfectly great book and destroyed it. I would have never have recognized the movie if not for the title. They should have stayed with Chris Columbus as director at least he followed the book and didn't add stuff that never happened and cut stuff that did. David Yates should be ashamed of the job he did on this movie, I don't recommend it for anyone who loves the books to go see. I was extremely disappointed in the movie as a story. The only positive thing that can be said for the movie was that the graphics were good. To bad that he has anything to do with the last two. How badly will he destroy them?"
"fearfulofspiders","1","3","4","7 September 2008"," Terrible Adaptation, With Awful Direction and a Screenplay to Match...
","Easily the most-anticipated of all the Harry Potter books to be made into film was The Order of the Phoenix. It was a book that I read at a certain milestone in my life, and to finally see it in a movie theater was a treat.<br/><br/>However, this Harry Potter installment is so lackluster in story, and completely unfaithful to the source material, it is the biggest disappointment I've had to face in the cinema since the first X-Men movie.<br/><br/>The acting is okay. Radcliffe tends to go over-the-top a few times, especially near the end of the film in the Department of Mysteries. Gambon is still a somewhat okay replacement for Richard Harris, though the Dumbledore portrayed here is nothing like the one in the previous films. Grint and Watson are also treats. Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge is so great in her performance, that it is truly the only saving grace of the movie.<br/><br/>The music this go around is weak. Compared to the beautiful and haunting score created by John Williams, the music for The Order of the Phoenix is anything but enjoyable or deep.<br/><br/>Michael Goldenberg's screenplay is not only weak in terms of delivering a satisfying movie with a good pace and character development, it is also one of the worst adaptations of a novel I have come across in years. Omissions are inevitable, but there's a clear line between what ""should be"" and what ""shouldn't be"". The series as a whole up to this point has left out so much information, it's no wonder why the final book has been split into two parts. The subtle stuff that leads up to the finale is completely omitted or wrongly placed in the film -- Dumbledore does not explain the prophecy. Sirius's fate would be confusing to the average audience member, and the tension between characters is incorrectly written to the point where I'm surprised no one is burning Harry Potter DVDs instead of the books. I'm not a purist, I just have a better understanding as to what needed to be included for the next and final (two) movie(s). THERE IS, ALSO, NO CONTINUITY -- they introduce the Daily Prophet as a device to incorporate montage sequences to make the film go by faster.<br/><br/>The special effects are mediocre compared to The Goblet of Fire, and the Department of Mysteries is not realized to its full potential. The Ministry of Magic was excellent however, and nicely realized.<br/><br/>All in all, as a fan and not a purist, Harry Potter has shown no magic or charm in this fifth installment, and as a story, there's no character development, faithfulness, nor pace. This is just one big rush job. I highly do not recommend it to any fan of the books or to an average viewer. The film goes all over the place, loosing focus of what is to come in the future, all equaling to the biggest disappointment of 2007, hands down."
"Tarvu117","5","3","4","30 July 2007"," This is why content should not be removed for Cinema releases...
","The Film started quickly and badly and also ended that way. The story was a poor parody of the film and missed out many key plot developments and the characters which brought them about.<br/><br/>It Begins with Dudders taunting Harry, In the Book he only does this in private to him and otherwise is scared of Harry. Harry also whips his wand out in front of Dudley's friends, which he is smart enough not to do in front of muggles. It is also in this scene I noticed Harry wearing converse, and converse continue to crop up throughout the entire film both on and off actor's feet. Maybe some kind of sell-out marketing deal by Warner Brothers? We'll never know. The Dementor attack, originally in an alleyway, features a formless patronus charm by Harry and a different appearance for the Dementors to that of the third Film. Mrs Figg lacked the aggression she should have had in the scene and Mundungus Fletcher failed to be mentioned (Unlike Kreacher, he was cut despite the difficulties it could create in the last film's adaptation).<br/><br/>The commotion at Privet drive was also skipped, including (annoyingly) Petunia's knowledge of Dementors and the howler she should have got from Dumbledore, instead, Harry was not told to leave home and the only howler was from the Ministry to him (quite unlike an official letter to inform Harry he was to be expelled). The Advanced Guard was a few wizards and witches short and ultimately flew straight through the Capital, when in the book Moody was very set on avoiding traveling where they could be seen easily and put a disillusionment charm on Harry as a further precaution.<br/><br/>Moving on past this, the pacing of events is immediately terrible. The time spent at Grimmauld place is very short lived and devoid of Phineas Nigellus and Mrs Black, though Kreacher's appearance was welcome. The scene on the Hogwarts Express and the recognition of Sirius by Lucius Malfoy (not to mention Ron and Hermione becoming Prefects) was all left out, but the narrative of Sirius being hunted was almost entirely skipped and the introduction of Luna was relocated to include the Threstrals as well.<br/><br/>One very outstanding mistake is a recent Ordinary Boy's song being played in the background of a scene at Hogwarts. Seeing as this film ought to be taking place 12 years ago. A few of the D.A.'s spells had the wrong effects as well.<br/><br/>However, the new characters of Luna Lovegood and Dolores Umbridge were portrayed remarkably well, stealing the scenes they wound up in whether they ought to have happened or not.<br/><br/>Harry's relationship with Cho Chang is also cut down hideously to a stolen kiss and loss of interest when she is substituted in for her friend Marietta as the ""sneak"" in Dumbledore's Army. Ginny Weasley's Character development is similarly cut short, as the book featured contrasts between her and Cho, foretelling her eventual relationship and Family with Harry.<br/><br/>Like the fourth film, House Elfs were given a miss. The SPEW organization was omitted from The Goblet of Fire and still in The Order of the Phoenix, as was the Part played by Dobby in finding the room of requirement for the DA. It seems as if poor Winky will never find the Big Screen! When reading the book I always imagined the O.W.L.s to be said Owls, feeling that saying the letters like that is impractical. Talking of which, the Weasley twin's escape was completely wrong, the Fireworks were meant to not go out but fly around the school for hours, causing increasing chaos when attempts were made to remove them. The Twins were also meant to only get on there Brooms after confronting Umbridge and the Film left out their swamp, which always stuck in my mind as important. The technicality of Ron, Hermione and Ginny riding Threstrals never cropped up, though they didn't complain too much in the book. I also missed their entry into the Ministry itself, where in the book they are issued with Guest badges stating that they are on a rescue mission.<br/><br/>The Department of Mysteries, however lacking in Brains as it was, had the best parts of the film. The Room of Prophecies may have lacked continuity, but the action was to the book and very good. Yates's realization of magical dueling was magical, yet, the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort was good, but did not meet up to the book. Dumbledore is not so powerful that he can block Avada Kedavra! His use of the Statues in the Atrium and Fawkes's regenerative ability to protect Himself and Harry reflected the qualities of person he had that Voldemort had not, compassion for all magical creatures. They also used apparition extensively while dueling in the book, though the conjuration of powerful magic wordlessly in the duel is magnificent.<br/><br/>After the Climax, the Film ended abruptly, without the Dumbledore explaining everything to Harry, or even Kreacher's betrayal. I was expecting Harry to interrogate Nearly Headless Nick about Ghosts after talking to Luna at the end, but it ended without stopping at the last two chapters it seems.<br/><br/>I suppose they do have time restrictions and this is the largest book of the series after all, but I wouldn't complain if they could at least release extended versions of the Film on DVD. Hopefully the last two films will be better, the continuity errors can be blamed on rushed production, but I've read the 7th book, and I'll be deeply offended if they cut ANY of that book.<br/><br/>Despite my Whining, it IS a Harry Potter Film and has a cream of fine British Actors at its disposal."
"cmolison","6","3","4","30 July 2007"," Good but confusing
","First the good: This movie had great special effects, especially the fight scene at the end with Dumbledoor and Voldemort. I also liked most of the performances, especially some of the newer characters (Delores and Luna).<br/><br/>Overall, however, the story was hard to follow. Very choppy.<br/><br/>Sirius Black's death was done so poorly it was practically anti-climactic. Without reading the book, you would have had a hard time telling what was really happening.<br/><br/>This movie kind of felt like it was just a transition - just filling some space between 4 and 6. Not on par with the other HP films."
"udontknowmeanyway","3","3","4","20 July 2007"," worst one so far
","I admit the shortening was not done that bad, we got a nice whole story, but some things were just missing. Seriously, I can understand that they can't do the whole book exactly like it is, but there are some little things that are important, perhaps not for the plot of this movie, but for the two coming up, like Ginny having a boyfriend (as for her ""giving up"" on Harry), or Ron and Hermione being prefects. Of course it may be, that these things seem only important to me.. whatever, I missed these things,although not as much as I missed Quidditch, which did not occur at all =( OK, I CAN see, that it is not really sufficient for the whole story, and takes precious time away, but I can still miss it, right? And what was that about the completely different Dementors? I mean, OK, different director, different style, but this? They weren't even hooded... So I didn't like the dementors, but I really liked the Ministry of Magic, the Atrium looked fabulous, I just loved that scene, although that big Fudge picture was a bit funny. (perhaps a bit too dictator-like..) The worst scene was the one in the Department of Mysteries. I was really disappointed by that scene. They really should have done that circular room and at least some of the other rooms as well. I don't care tooooo much about the other things I missed, but this really sucked. I mean, how could they leave out that room of time, the Death Eater with the baby face, the brains in the tank? And of course, my favourite, Ron behaving strange, laughing about everything, and calling out something like ""Look, there are brains in there. Brains... Accio brain!"" and actually summoning a brain. And not just the Department itself, but Sirius' death.. THAT really was the worst part of the scene. They actually managed to do it so badly, that I felt absolutely nothing about seeing one of my favourite characters die (I cried a LOT when I read the book) and like that wasn't enough, they even make you forget about his death in less than a minute, as no one really seems to care about it. So they really did a bad job on the end, which is really really bad, because it's THE END, and even if you enjoyed the movie until then, you go out of the cinema with that horrible ending on your mind and end up hating the whole movie, just like I did."
"carmen464","3","3","4","18 July 2007"," Hated it, hated the Director & most importantly hated the Screenwriter **SPOILER**
","Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I've read all the books, many times, and watched every film with baited breathe. This was my least favorite movie, but not only that, I truly hated it! **Please excuse my spelling of the names, I am writing fast and have no time to check**<br/><br/>This was a terrible rendition! It FELT long and yet they raced through the important things like the prophecy for example. People who don't follow the books don't understand just how important this prophecy is, the entire series revolves around it! We don't learn it was Trelawney who predicted it, we don't learn that Snape overheard it and ran to Voldemort which is what got Harry's parents killed. I mean, am I wrong? This is important!<br/><br/>I also think that it was a very bad move to speed through the beginning of the film. Sure we see Harry's depressed, but how is that different from any summer with the Dursleys?? We don't get the full feeling of alienation that Harry feels with being ignored by Dumbledore, left out of the loop and then having Hermoine and Ron become prefects and him not! He is completely and utterly alone, and we don't see that really. Are we supposed to accept the two line conversation exchanged he has with Ron and Hermoine? (HP ""You couldn't have put that in a letter?"" R&H ""Dumbledore made us promise not to.""<br/><br/>Some other small notes: -We don't get introduced to Sirius' mom, the painting, which could have allowed for a little comic relief. -As would have the scene with the lot trying to climb onto animals they can't see! (Thestrals?) -In fact, that whole scene gave me whiplash! On campus-On Thestrals-Phone booth-Department of Mysteries. I mean, jeez! -We barely saw anyone we liked; Prof. McGonagall is in it just a couple of brief times as is Dumbledore, Hagrid, Lupin and Sirius. All we got was Umbridge which did NOT give us the comic relief they clearly tried to give us. -No mention of H&R being prefects, as well as Malfoy. And in fact, Malfoy was barely in it! His discourse with HP team is good, why didn't we have more? -When Sirius died, it isn't even clear that it's what's happened. There is no explanation of the arch so why would we assume that arch=death? Incidentally, very convenient that the group ""fell"" into the room with the arch!<br/><br/>I know there was way more I had to say, but I wanted to take a few days to let myself reflect. I am very disappointed. I didn't like the director and I hated the screenplay. I am so happy that they got Steve Kloves to write the HBP screenplay, because I may have not watched it otherwise. He may not have been perfect but a 10 compared to Goldenberg. I am very upset that we have to watch David Yates take another attempt at directing in HBP, praying that he doesn't butcher that one as well (Note to Yates: fire your editor!). I was really looking forward to this movie, they killed my summer. It is the first HP film that I will only watch once and will not buy the DVD."
"numbrunettee","1","4","6","12 December 2007"," What the hell?
","This movie, by far, has been the WORST movie yet. Everything was left out! I was very disappointed in this movie. I almost went back to the store and demanded my money back! You left out OVER half of the book and didn't even give correct details. Professor Umbridge DID NOT get the information about Dumbledore's Army (D.A.) from Cho. She got it from her friends. And they were not all in the Room of Requirement when this information was acquired. This was a disgrace to Harry Potter fans. I for one, hope that the next two movies will contain more and accurate details. But it will not make up for what a horrible job you did on this one. You would have been better off not making it in the first place. I do hope you re make the movie. But I doubt anyone will buy that one after what they saw this time. I am highly disappointed."
"monkyman2013","1","4","6","11 December 2007"," where to begin?
","alrighty then. Really, where to begin? There were so many things wrong with this film, they were way off the plot in the book. so many things they didn't put in from the book, or made up things that weren't in the book. they need to find a decent director and stick with them...because Yates just isn't doing his job very well at all, one thing i did notice about 2/3 or 3/4 through the movie, Hermione found harry and Ron, and she said ""hagrid is back!""..the only problem with that was that they NEVER mentioned that he was gone, or if they did i was asleep. there was no quidditch, which was a huge disappointment for me because quidditch is a part of harry and the action of the games make the movie experience better. the fight in the department of mysteries was done very badly if you ask me. when exactly did the ""evil"" characters start floating around being followed by tails of dark smoke, and the ""good"" characters having bright lights underneath them at all times? and Voldemort flying without a broom? i don't recall that from the book, but yet again maybe i am mistaken. I hated this movie, it was by far the worst ""adaptation"" yet. it was very choppy, and i told people that if they hadn't read the book..that they wouldn't understand what is happening. so much left out, could have been a lot better, David Yates...you should look into a different field of work. 'nuff said"
"rugbygimp","2","10","20","12 July 2007"," Highly Disappointed!
","I have to admit, the much anticipated, long awaited Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix movie was a major disappointment. Especially considering that I had re-read the novel recently to re-familiarize myself with the story line. It's funny that the longest book in the series produced the shortest movie, and while the fifth was my least favorite book, I had some expectations for the movie...<br/><br/>***SPOILERS - DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT WASN'T IN THE MOVIE!*** Now I realize it was only a two and a bit hour movie so cuts need to be made (I don't however accept that the book can not be done justice in that amount of time) but they CUT SO MUCH OUT... nothing about the promise (howler) made between Dumbledore and Petunia, the stuff about the order was light at best (which amuses me since it's the FRIKKIN TITLE OF THE MOVIE), there was really no classes or schooling AT ALL (which is the magical part of the stories and a MAJOR part of the fifth novel being OWL exam time), there was nothing about the hospital, or Ron and Hermione's jump to Prefects, verrry little about Kreacher and his part in the whole thing, no Quidditch, the Weasley brothers' grand exit (while funny) was lame, the entire thing with the centaurs was amiss (the audience had no idea what was going on), Firenze taking over Divination and the wisdom he instill (and trouble it causes with other Centaurs) all missing! Nothing about Neville and Harry sharing the birthdays and even the possibility of the prophecy, nothing about the pensieve, nothing about the overtaking of Umbridge before Fred and George left, the two-way mirror from Sirius didn't exist, the locket in Grimmauld Place (crutial in the 6th book) did not appear, the fight scene and the stuff about the prophecy was so rushed and out of sequence that it was rather boring for the most part, and Sirius' death was bland and lacked solid emotion. There is so much more they left out but you'll have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>The plot was so incredibly rushed (had no sense of time), very much out of sequence, and there were many things in the movie that didn't actually happen in the book. The scenes were also choppy and seemingly unconnected. The major characters were merely window dressings (i.e. Snape, McGonigall, Trelawny, Sirius, etc) and the acting was abysmal. Though as a saving grace I loved Luna's character, Bellatrix, and even Tonks (for what little we see of her). At a few points my husband and I were actually bored with the movie.<br/><br/>It was, sadly, disappointing. We presume that if you hadn't read the book it would pass as a decent enough plot line, but those die-hard fans (which most who see the movie are) will find a lot of holes in the plot that are just disheartening.<br/><br/>I was fairly disappointed to say the least, then again I am of the mindset that when you adapt a well known novel to film, you better make a good job of it. As one person commented ""It is a book fan's nightmare."" This was sloppy in my opinion"
"BB550","5","44","116","11 July 2007"," Reading this will save you time and money, stick to the books and save yourself from the disappointment
","Firstly I would like to state that I am a huge fan of the books, as well as the films, even though some of the previous film installments could have been much better they were still enjoyable to watch. However in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, director David Yates and writer Michael Goldenberg took the deepest Harry Potter book and made an absolute mockery of it. It felt as if David Yates was terrified by how much story there was in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that he simply didn't know what to do with it. So, in order to compress this story into a mere 2 hour and 18 minutes, Yates cuts more story lines from the OotP than you can imagine and the ones he leaves are either constricted and rewritten or done with mini-montages adding to the lacking connection to the book. There are no transitions in this film whatsoever leaving no representation of time passing other than when Christmas comes. This also causes the viewer to feel as if they miss numerous parts of the movie as the scenes jump sporadically. With this film being so ridiculously short, the characters that we have grown accustomed to reading and seeing are barely visible throughout the film. This causes OotP to lack the ""Hogwarts"" feel that the other films possessed which allowed viewers to feel they were a part of what was happening on screen. Nearly all of the scenes that made this story relatable were cut, such as moments at Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. This takes the teenage amusement out of the story. It Prevents the trio from encountering their adolescent troubles with the absence of these scenes. Almost less amusing are the action scenes in this film. They are brief and left me yawning in my seat as it too strayed from the books. Though I would love nothing more to sit here and go into these matters further, this film has already wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life and I wish to waste no more by writing about it. In short it felt like I was watching a hastily assembled Michael Bay film, but without any stylized action to keep me mildly entertained. This film was poorly constructed and had no finesse. Not only was this the worst installment of the Harry Potter film franchise, it was one of the most disappointing and despicable attempts at film-making I have ever seen."
"adsti3","4","13","28","12 July 2007"," Virtually no interest for non-devotees of the book series.
","The action in this movie is completely mechanized and the plot only serves us to move us from point A to point B (more like point A.001, actually) in the Potter saga, unlike in previous films where the plots themselves had arcs of their own and the revelations, such as they were, were actually dramatic.<br/><br/>Characters and plot devices are introduced and not developed at all--Nymphadora Tonks? Do we even learn who the hell she is? Also we get hints of Ginny Weasley's unrequited love for Harry, which contributed nothing to the plot and I assume will never again be revisited.<br/><br/>The only remotely ""fun"" aspect of the movie was the introduction of Luna Lovegood, who, along with Umbridge's outfits and noises, provides the only comic relief in an otherwise joyless affair.<br/><br/>But does this movie even have to work on its own, or can it be considered a ""success"" if it puts pretty pictures to the words with which the fans of the books are so familiar? Lynch's _Dune_ was panned for being worthless to the casual viewer. Now I know how those critics felt."
"hans_gerlsma","3","23","56","11 July 2007"," A world of pain!
","I wasn't a big fan of Goblet of Fire and went to Order of the Phoenix with the illusion that it could only be better than its predecessor. Now that I have seen the movie it depresses me that I have been wrong to have nourished this hope. The acting has reached a new low. Daniel Radcliffe manages to mess up every scene he has. Because the movie is more about Harry Potter than about actions, the scenes that Daniel has are many and shortly in the movie become too much too handle. There were moments when I buried my head in my hands out of awkwardness for the shame full performance I was being presented. Ron is also being portrayed badly, but has the luck of being off-screen most of the times. The Hermione moments are being force fed with a lethal high dose of girl power which ruined the performance of Emma Watson whose was not bad (at least not compared to the rest). As for most of the other characters, (with the exception of Snape) there is not much screen time for them, but they manage to ruin these brief moments with out of character performances. The leader of this gang of hoodlums is Michael Gambon whose performance hasn't managed to make us forget the late great Richard Harris, but make us miss him with every second Michael Gambon is on screen. Gambon has turned Dumbledore into a unstable loon who threats his enemies with more kindness than his students. The character who stand out positively are Snape (brilliant as always), Voldemort (as steady as in Goblet of Fire), Luna (she breathes Luna without trying), Lucius and Bellatrix who do not stand out, neither positive or negative. The script is impossible to follow for someone who hasn't read the book and confusing for those who have. The scene hopping is worse than Goblet of Fire, although the newspaper montages have been done well. The movie rushes through the huge storyline and the few action scenes which could have boosted the movie are not spectacular and over before you know it. There is no time for emotions because the moments have passed and become incomprehensible seconds later, leaving the viewer confused and busy trying to catch up again. Actions from characters are illogical and in conflict with the books, most of the time backed up with special effects which are illogical and in conflict with the books. The rather small amount of special effects (compared to the other Potter movies) manage to turn out disappointing and make you wonder if they have the right people behind this, because other movies have managed to show believable special effects. All in all a disappointment and new dept in the Harry Potter movie franchise."

","OK so I am a huge fans of all the Harry Potter books, but then again i am not super obsessed with everything Harry Potter (no Quiditch Sheets on my bed).<br/><br/>Anyway I never really liked most of the HP movies I enjoyed them for sure but they were not ""fantastic films"" just adaptations of the most popular book series in history (no offense lotr fans). And I came to expect a little disappointment from these films.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this film, the crown jewel if you will of a movie series with sub par films. I went in with the hopes of seeing great special effects, great experienced actors such as Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman in well cast parts. And above all a Harry Potter movie that finally lives up to the book.<br/><br/>I must say I was extremely disappointed, there was so much content cut that if you never read the books you probably never would have followed any of the plot. Also besides Radcliff ever other character has very limited screen time, instead of growing character development and waiting for the audience to laugh at a joke, we were zipped off again to another scene. To me it didn't feel like a movie or a HP book it felt like a mess of editing scenes from different parts of the book together, there was no flow, no life, just Danielle Radcliffe as Harry Potter for 2 hours and 18 minutes."
"RuSs2008","5","9","18","10 July 2007"," Unlimited potential is met with limited results
","First off this movie has met every requirement for a summer blockbuster. The movie has bad acting, which can only be blamed on the director because they cast is a very talented one containing several Oscar winners, cheesy dialogue, a poorly written story that leaves even non Harry Potter readers asking why and what happened. The last thing is the special effect which could have been some of the best ever. But they weren't . With companies like ILM revolutionizing the special effects industry, as seen with Transformers, we must ask ourselves what did they do to Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Key elements were left out of the screenplay which establishes the plot is the future books and movies alike. The inconsistencies in the movie can only be blamed on a hurried and poorly written screenplay. The low points cause an attention laps and the high points are like an answer to our prayers, but these few high points do not make up for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Several key action sequences from the book were left out because of length restrictions and caused the seriousness of the book to be lost in translation or left on the editing room floor. With more coherent senses involving the magic of Harry Potter a fun and entertaining movie can be created. The confrontations between characters in the books created an atmosphere that had the public wanting more but the movie does not provide for the need of the viewers, but for the wallets of some high corporate executive.<br/><br/>The climax is reached with mixed reviews on how the movie could have been better up to this point if a different director would have been used, and it serves as a small amount of redemption for the horrors that has already committed. Some of the final battle effects are in the realm of super cheesy and inadequate for a scene of such anticipation. The length is something else that must be brought into question. It is just long enough to get the viewers attention but not enough to cause the viewer to see the magic the Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron brought to the series.<br/><br/>In short the magic and that made the Harry Potter books and the movie series fun and entertaining is gone. The movie was not dark enough to truly relate to the book and to show the progression that Harry needs to go through to have a climatic duel with the dark lord in the final movie Deathly Hallows. If I was Ms. Rowling I would be ashamed of what someone turned her amazing book into only to make a quick buck. The bottom line is that this movie can and will only be surpassed by Half Blood Prince as a magic less failure if a new director and new imagination is not found.<br/><br/>I do not believe I have included any spoilers in my comment and if I have I am sorry."
"MovieFanGuyy","1","23","58","9 July 2007"," Yet another tiring, and repetitive adventure with Harry Potter, this series feels like it's running out of steam!
","This review contains some spoilers.<br/><br/>Warner Brothers highly anticipated Order of the Phoenix, had it's U.S. premiere in Los Angeles several days ago, and like many other industry insiders, I was given a peak of this film at Warner Brothers studios.<br/><br/>Now granted, I am not a fan of the books, since I have never read one. Could care less about what Hogwarts stands for, and don't see what the big fuss over an extremely deformed creature named Voldemort is all about and how ""scary"" the guy is supposed to be. I came into this film as an audience member and that's it.<br/><br/>When we begin the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter is being picked on by his cousin Dudley and his friends and is summarily attacked by a dementor. Harry is attacked by the dementors, and Harry fights them off again. (Didn't we already see this in the third film?) And, Harry is sent off to a wizard's court, where he is to be expelled from the wizarding school for destroying the Dementor in front of his cousin, when Harry's mentor, the shabbily dressed Dumbledore pleads with the Minstry of Magic to let Harry go back to school.<br/><br/>Then Harry is taken to the house of his godfather, Sirius Black, played by the fabulous Gary Oldman, where Harry meets the Order of the Phoenix, an group of wizards formed by Dumbledore, determined to fight off Harry's adversary Voldemort and his group of KKK dressed bad wizards called Death Eaters.<br/><br/>For two and a half hours, we get the same repetitive storyline as we did in the four previous Harry Potter films, except in this film, we get very little excitement until the end of the film, where Harry Potter and a large group of students he organized, called Dumbledore's Army fights off Voldemort and his group of wizards. The ending really didn't challenge me at all, and more frustrated myself and other members of the audience who were not as familiar with the events of the books as other people in the public are.<br/><br/>We get new characters including one of the most irritating private school teachers all dressed in pink. I just wanted to roll my eyes. The acting from most is serviceable but the film's talky plot line could bore some viewers over the two and a half hour course of the film.<br/><br/>Judging the film as a movie not as a book, The Order of the Phoenix felt like a rushed, and talkative film with very little excitement, except for the death of one of the prominent characters at the end of the only real action sequence in the film. <br/><br/>Many will be disappointed at the lack of action and exciting sequences in this film, as it is definitely the slowest film of these movies yet. The reaction was mixed at best, those familiar with the books seemed to follow the events better than those who have not read the books. In my opinion, films should stand on their own, even if you have not read the books, and so far, none of the Harry Potter films have been able to convert those who are not as familiar with the events of the books. <br/><br/>In the past I have not been kind with my reviews of the Harry Potter movies because they have not been able to truly explain to the film going public why they should invest their emotions into characters that seem so lifeless. I should have cried at the death of one of the characters, but by the end, I didn't care, I didn't have any emotional attachment to any of the characters like a good movie should have. By the end of the film, Harry Potter and his friends in the wizarding world are right back to where they were at the beginning of the film which is that Harry Potter has finally convinced everyone that his enemy Lord Voldemort is back.<br/><br/>It didn't need to take a boring, and talky two and a half hour movie to get that simple point across. This film feels simply like the Harry Potter films are seriously running out of steam before the last book hits stores. Once again, the Warner Brothers studio delivers a disappointing Harry Potter film. <br/><br/>Yet again, we are treated to the same wizard and their wands duel that occurred in Goblet of Fire. I was ready to yawn at the end of the film along with the rest of the audience.<br/><br/>In the end Harry tells his friends while boarding a train, ""We have something worth fighting for"" Haven't we already gone down this path, just kill off Voldemort and get on with it. As the saying goes, get on with the story already. I don't know how many people have much interest left for anymore Harry Potter movies, I know I don't."
"claudio_carvalho","7","6","11","24 November 2007"," Another Entertaining Adventure
","After defending himself and Dudley Dursley with magic from an attack of the Dementors, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent to a hearing and found not guilty from the accusation of inappropriate use of magic in front of humans. Then he returns to Hogwarts and finds that most people do not believe that Voldemort is back. Further, the Ministry of Magic has assigned the annoying and despicable Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to change the directions in the school affecting the lives of the teachers and mainly the students. She suspends the practical course of self-defense spells, and Harry Potter and his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ronnie (Rupert Grint) form a clandestine group to learn magic with Harry Potter. Meanwhile Harry Potter has horrible visions and nightmares and Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) tells him that he is mentally connected to the Dark Lord, teaching him how to defend from an intrusion in his mind.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is another entertaining adventure of this young witch and his friends. The top-notch cast, with most of the best British actors and actresses, introduces the stunning Imelda Staunton in the role of a very nasty character and she is amazingly perfect. Contradictorily, the weakest name in these Harry Potter films is the hero and lead actor Daniel Radcliffe, but unfortunately there is no other way to handle the situation. The special effects are state of art and very impressive. My daughter is a big fan of Harry Potter, she reads all his books immediately after the release, and I imagine how difficult is to write an adaptation to the cinema of such number of pages. But for those like me that have not read the book, it works very well. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Harry Potter e a Ordem do Fênix"" (""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"")"
"wildcandykitty","3","8","16","12 July 2007"," The Movie barely followed the book!!
","I do not understand how so much of the book could have been changed. It seemed like the writer and director just tried to create their own story line and only used a few bits and pieces from the book. For instance (don't read if you do not want to know details from the movie): 1) Ron and Hermione are not selected as Prefects in the movie. Prefects are supposed to be chosen during the fifth year. Percy, Ron's older brother, was Prefect. 2) When Professor Trelawney was fired Dumbledore brought Firenze, a centaur, as the new divination Professor. Firenz working for the Humans puts the other centaurs in an uproar (none of this was in the movie). 3) Neville Longbottom never found the room of requirement. It was Dobby that told Harry about the Room. 4) The prophecy never spoke to Harry. The prophesy got broken during the fighting and only Dumbledore knew what it really said.<br/><br/>There are many more I just can't think at the moment. The movie also left out so incredibly much stuff. A good example is Ron and Ginny playing on the Quidditch team. Ginny takes over Harry's position as seeker when Harry gets a lifetime ban from quidditch by Umbridge. <br/><br/>It does not seem right that of all the Harry Potter Books this one is the longest but is the shortest movie so far. From what I gather the people that have not read the book said that the movie was good, but there were so many plot holes that they were confused. <br/><br/>In my opinion this was the worst Harry Potter movie. Maybe if I had not just reread the book I would have enjoyed it. All the things the director took upon himself to change just to me made the movie horrible. <br/><br/>I suggest to anyone that was confused by the movie, read the book. The book is so much better and explains everything."
"Sittingdowninpoppies","10","12","27","11 July 2007"," Blimey Harry! Since when did you pick up acting?
","I thought it was brilliant. (although I am MUCH more anticipating DH -i can not sleep waiting for it's release~!! :<) <br/><br/>I will review for you all in my opinion: <br/><br/>ACTING:<br/><br/>Although two of the trio, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, seemed to not have developed much from the previous chapter, it is apparent that Daniel Radcliffe (ms?) has managed to develop nicely. I was absolutely thrilled w/ his excellent performance. He really managed to capture the mood of the whole movie (JKR's Harry). Other characters were all pretty good, too many and not enough film time to really analyze them though. I will talk about new actors though: uh. The actress who plays Umbridge is spot on ~ absolutely 100% how I envisioned her. Evanna Lynch was also surprisingly perfect for her part. Tonks was good and cheerful... though not in it hardly enough. The actress who played Bellatrix was quite good ~ scary as heck. I'm finding it hard to name others. 9.5/10 <br/><br/>BOOK TO FILM:<br/><br/>Mostly everything was represent well in the movie that needed to be. I was only upset about the OWL exams being skipped and a couple of other things (spoilers) which were not covered up towards the end. The mood of the movie was perfectly parallel to that of the book. However, Ginny was NOT used enough!! What the Heck?! Can't the directors learn? All she said in this one were spells (which she performed very well btw), although she was in a heck of a lot of it... just hanging around. I was upset at the lack of Quiditch - apparently it has been ditched. 9/10 <br/><br/>SCORE:<br/><br/>The music flowed perfectly with every scene, however I was kind of annoyed with the mysterious nonsense they were playing in Grimauld Place at the beginning. That was the only real odd thing i found about the music. ~ Harry Potter's score is always exceptional. 9.75/10 <br/><br/>STORYLINE: <br/><br/>Well, this is not just a 'how the movie fits in with the book' review. The stand alone script was very smooth and effective as well. Numerous humorous lines were added to serve as a method of easing the depressing mood(as following the book's mood), so that the audience didn't feel as tense. Also, the flow was elegant and managed to flow along a current of progression. However, the Stand Alone value of this movie is Highly lowered granted the fact that the series has taken a turn more-so towards actual continuation unlike displayed in the first 3 pictures. So, perhaps one of the reasons I can't sleep after seeing this (3:20 in the morning), is because I WANT MORE!!! 9.25/10 <br/><br/>CGI/SETTINGS:<br/><br/>Spectacular special effects (though not up to par with other summer contestant, Transformers), they managed to create a very realistic, fictional world along with the amazing scenery~ of which is immediately displayed by the fields near the Dursley's living area. Kreacher looked perfectly tuned. Fireworks were beautifully thrown amiss a gorgeous interior of Hogwarts, and Alas! Spells were gorgeously cast as Harry flew his way through Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix! 9.75/10<br/><br/>Overall: 9.5<br/><br/>GIVE ME DEATHLY HALLOWS OR GIVE ME DEATH ITSELF!"
"dunedain-1","3","22","56","11 July 2007"," A movie full of magic, but with little heart
","First off let me say that as a die hard Potterholic, I tried to like this film, honestly I did. Now, that being said, this was the closest I've ever come in my entire life to walking out on a film, and for those who know me that is really saying something. The first half of the film was simply put, horrendous. The movie begins as a collage of mis-matched scenes accompanied by stilted dialogue, which is followed by a tolerable second and confusing third act with a disappointing finale. I don't know if it was the script they were given, or perhaps the direction of David Yates, but the actors seemed incredibly uncomfortable in their characters for most of the movie. I don't know what happened with Michael Goldenberg, or how he confused exclamation marks in the novel for simple periods in the screenplay. At times it seemed that all Harry would do in the book was scream and yell, yet he quietly delivers his lines with little to no anger, only a tired reservation in the movies. The Weasley twins even go so far as to poke fun at Harry for shouting, which was supposed to be funny, but only leaves you confused as to what ""shouting"" they're referencing.<br/><br/>The only bright spots in the black hole that was this film were Evanna Lynch's inspired performance as ""Loony"" Luna Lovegood, and Imelda Staunton as deliciously evil Dolores Umbridge. Gary Oldman is at long last given room to stretch his legs as Sirius Black, making you wish that he were given more to work with than what the script allowed him because he was simply magic in this role.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to comment on Michael Gambon, who typically delivers the horrendous, and completely uncharacteristic performance of Dumbledore that I have come to expect from him in these movies. The end of this movie leaves us with more questions than answers. When did Dudley become a gangster? Why doesn't Uncle Vernon shout at Harry (which is all he's supposed to do)? Where is Aunt Petunia's Howler? Where is the closure for Harry concerning Cho Chang? Why are the entire D.A. writing lines with the Blood Quill? What the hell is up with Seamus Finnigan and his Wild West showdown type argument with Harry? Why the hell are things from book 6 being referenced in this movie when they haven't even happened yet? Did Harry just poke a Dementor in the eye with his wand? They don't even have eyes, how is that possible? What is this madness!?! Madness? This is Harry Potter!! Or at least Warner's sad counterfeit of it.<br/><br/>It seems that ever since Chris Columbus's inspired adaptations of the first two books, the series has steadily gotten worse and worse, straying further and further away from its source material. Yes Columbus's movies were greatly flawed, but that can easily be forgiven since they possessed that sense of wonderment and heart that every movie since has been sorely lacking. It seems that each director since has been more concerned with leaving his own mark on the series rather than ensuring that the heart of the story remains intact in the transition from book to screen. Sadly the coming of each new director has been like a Dementor's whisper, each time drawing a little bit more soul out of Harry's body, and I fear that soon he'll have none left.<br/><br/>""Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy."" These were Dumbledore's words to Harry, but they can equally apply to Warner Bros. It's just disappointing that they chose to do what was easy and turned Harry Potter into a faint shadow of what it could've been."

","I am one of the biggest Harry Potter book fans on the planet, and have bought each and every one of the wizard's fantasies since the 1990s, from Philosopher's Stone, to Half Blood Prince. I even have my deposit slip for the Deathly Hollows on the 21st.<br/><br/>The books started out as a slow but interesting set of books for children, and exploded into one of the most popular children books series since The Chronciles of Narnia.<br/><br/>Then in 2001, Warner Brothers decided to make a series of films based on the Harry Potter book series, and every kid around the world waited in anticipation.<br/><br/>Both of Chris Columbus Harry Potter films, The Philosopher's Stone, and The Chamber of Secrets were interesting takes on the storyline of Harry Potter, and both were huge hits at the cinema.<br/><br/>Then in 2004, Columbus decided to hand off the director's reins to another director, Alfonso Cuoron, the director of 1993's A Little Princess who brought a different take on the Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>2005 came and went and director Mike Newell took on the reigns of The Goblet of Fire, which is for many fans, the best book of the series.<br/><br/>Now we have the fifth book being made into a movie, The Order of the Phoenix, being directed by British television director, David Yates.<br/><br/>My problem, as well as those for hundreds of millions of Harry Potter fans around the world is that for the last three movies, far too many details have been eliminated from the book.<br/><br/>This time around, one of the most crucial elements of the Harry Potter storyline has been cut, and Quidditch is completely missing, that's what makes the books stand out from other fantasy books in the first place. It's elements like this which frustrates many fans of the book series like myself. It's as if Warner Brothers sold out to the highest bidder and made the films more as a commodity rather than taking what is special about the books in the first place.<br/><br/>The ending, rather than being exciting, is simply a video game inspired duel between the students of Hogwarts, also known at Dumbledore's army, against Lord Voldemort and his nasty Death Eaters, then of course, out of nowhere does the top wizard himself Dumbledore show up to fight up Voldemort so that he can run away again. By the end of this film, we are right back to where we started, and it feels as if the audience just wasted two and a half hours of it's time.<br/><br/>This my friends equates to the cliff notes method of film-making which is to take tidbits of a book and see if it sticks together. It didn't work in either Prisonser of Azkaban and The Goblet Of Fire, and it unfortunately definitely doesn't work in Order Of The Phoenix either.<br/><br/>Watching the film in frustration though all the talky elements, and yes, this film is the talkiest of the Harry Potter films, with very little action, except at the end.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that many Harry Potter fantatics will enjoy this, but, then again many people will buy any product, even if it's second rate, with the Harry Potter name attached to it.<br/><br/>All I can say is that I hope someday that Warner Brothers can make a film that is worthy of the name Harry Potter, but this my friends, is not it."
"TheHOYT","7","10","22","11 July 2007"," Yates, Goldenberg and Hooper try, but come up short with Order
","When I think of the great fantasy movie franchises I think of two of the greatest: Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Both (in my humble opinion) excelled due to one crucial element: continuity. Unfortunately, for the Harry Potter movies this element is lacking, and as a result the franchise suffers.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the first thing I noticed about this latest installment of the Potter franchise was the score, which was sorely lacking. The John Williams Harry Potter theme has become one of the most iconic film scores in history. However, the new composer for this film (Nicholas Hooper) seems to feel other wise, as he has completely changed the musical tone of the series. As a result of this decision the 'feel' of this film is very much different from the first four, and this is not a good thing. My advice to Hooper: ""If it isn't broken, don't try and fix it."" When I learned that Steve Kloves was not slated to adapt J.K. Rowling's ""Order of the Phoenix"" I knew that the film would suffer. The film OOTP is extremely convoluted and choppy. However, I don't blame the new screenwriter Michael Goldenberg. I must admit it would be hard to jump into a franchise such as Harry Potter and attempt to adapt the longest novel of the series into a feature film. I see that Kloves (imdb.com) is slated to adapt 'The Half-blood Prince.' Hopefully having a movie off won't cramp his style.<br/><br/>And finally we come to the director, newcomer to the series David Yates. I actually feel that he was able to coax some good performances out of his actors; the number of winces at Dan Radcliffe's acting was considerably less this time out. Nevertheless, being given a hack job of a scrip like this one would be difficult for any director to navigate. I feel for him. I look forward to see what he can do for ""The Half-blood Prince,"" which is a dialog driven story that will fit his style.<br/><br/>End Notes, My personal gripes: The name of the movie is ""The Order of the Phoenix,"" so I'd like to see more of the order. The final battle in the Department of Mysteries was way to short. Serious's death was very anti-climactic, and not how it was described in the book. I'd have liked more dialogue between Dumbledore and Voldemort."

But some things were down right changed or weaken because of things being left out. People left out of this movie, Rita, victor. Things that were changed, Fred and George's products were not explained. It was never explained that they were starting a store with the seed money harry gave them. The fireworks they set off in the movie didn't damage the roof of hogwarts. They swamp they created and teachers, not fixing anything that the brothers did was left out. It seems like they are being written out of the movie. Umbridge's Fireplace seen is different then the book. The centaur is not brought in to teach divination. THe battle with that LV drastically changed, I mean this was a huge action scene in the book, no shield, no phoenix, and no statue. They should fire this director and get a new one.<br/><br/>My advice wait until DVD. The movie was made for people that don't read the books."
"BadMrKitty","7","7","14","11 July 2007"," Harry Potter movies no longer good for book fans.
","Let me first preface my comments by saying that above all I am a fan of the Harry Potter books. And until now, I was a fan of the movies as well. But Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a book fan's nightmare. Not only are the most pivotal emotional scenes robbed of meaning (Snape's worst memory, Dumbledore's office scene at the end), but basic themes from the book are crushed into powder finer than the glass shards from the climactic, yet mostly garish final battle sequence. The best line in the movie is lifted directly from the book (Hermione's line about Ron's emotional range). Perhaps most atrocious of all is the constant innuendo towards a Harry/Hermione romantic attachment. I understand that Dan Radcliffe/Emma Watson is a more desirable on screen couple for movie marketers, but the sixth book dispels any chance of that, so what is it doing in movie 5. Most disappointing of all was the Dumbledore/Voldemort duel. The book version is filled with banter and new and interesting magic. The movie version relies on wowing us with shiny particle effects which were no doubt expensive.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm rambling. Perhaps this film will prove itself upon subsequent viewings. As the filmmakers apparently believe, anything's possible. There were some shining moments. A brief moment between Harry and Sirius fighting side by side in the Death chamber was excellent. The DA was fully realized and wonderfully done throughout. Imelda Staunton and her collection of kitten china was priceless.<br/><br/>In all honesty, ten more minutes of dialog and some different editing would have made this movie far better. Another half-hour and it would have been better still. But alas, for me, the magic is gone."

","I was so looking forward to this installment of the Harry Potter series. I enjoyed this book immensely and just knew that it would make for a great movie. Well, was I ever wrong! The first mistake was in the choice of director. David Yates might be good at directing TV shows or crime dramas, but he totally screwed this up. Can we say welcome to the Imelda Staunton Show? Were they sleeping together or what? I mean REALLY! And yes, I understand the need to compress a very long book into a workable movie script, but there were so very many important plot points that were either totally ignored or else so changed as to be unrecognizable. Would it have been so difficult to work in that Ron and Hermione were PREFECTS? Did they have to make Cho the traitor - I mean what is one more small part (Marietta) in a movie that consisted of small parts - except for Imelda Staunton's part! I didn't even recognize Mark Williams for heaven sake! I thought they had gotten an actor who kinda maybe looked like him! And whose idea was the revolting...i mean revolving Daily Prophet???? Show the damn thing once and get on with the movie!! That was simply a waste of time and made most of the audience dizzy.<br/><br/>And another thing - why waste so much money on the set for the Ministry of Magic. It didn't look anything like it should have - maybe they could have afforded a better director and screenwriter if they had been a bit less over the top on the sets??? Where was Malfoy? Where were most of the members of the Order? You saw them for a couple of seconds and then they disappeared! I saw this movie on the day it came out - the theater was half-empty - doesn't this tell you something?? And now to find out that this MUGGLE is going to be directing the next movie too??? I thought Alfonzo Curzon was the worst thing that could possibly happen to the series...boy oh boy was I wrong!"
"GreenMan1966","3","5","9","11 July 2007"," Truly Disappointing
","So while I wasn't amongst the insane group of fans that waited up for Midnight showings, I did wait in line today to see Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix with a lot of optimism and excitement based on my love of the book, the series, and some really great trailers.<br/><br/>My disappointment began as early as the opening scenes, and can be mostly attributed to poor acting and horribly bad casting. <br/><br/>The continuing travesty of miscasting is exemplified by Michael Gambon, series replacement for Richard Harris's brilliant portrayal of Albus Dumbledore. Gambon continues to almost single-handedly destroy the entire series. His lack of acting skill and any real understanding of the depth and playfulness of the character is truly appalling. In OOTP he is not nearly as bad as he was in Goblet of Fire but that is due mostly to his having less screen time. Can we please remove the ornament from his beard as well?<br/><br/>Due to severe space limitation I will only add a few words to each portrayal of character by actor and/or a note about the casting.<br/><br/>Vernon Dursley - Richard Griffiths continues to overact and gets worse with each film. Petunia Dursley - Fiona Shaw is moderately more tolerable here than previously - her worst by far was the first film. Severus Snape - Alan Rickman continues his brilliance despite hard limitations on screen time and screenplay adaptations. Sybill Trelawney - Emma Thompson continues to grace the screen with acting brilliance and humility to submit to such a small role. Minerva McGonagall - Maggie Smith, like Alan Rickman, holds these films together - she deserved much more room in this screenplay adaptation. Mrs Figg - Kathryn Hunter, BY FAR the worst new portrayal, is terrible and horribly miscast. Luna Lovegood - while Evanna Lynch is getting some critical praise, I think it is undeserved and that she is also miscast. Molly Weasley - Julie Walters has so much potential to be a great Molly but has never quite grasped the worrisome mother hen nature of the character. Her costuming in this new film is just embarrassing instead of funny. Arthur Weasley - Mark Williams is again underwhelming, and is only worth mentioning because his hair stylist did an even more humiliating job here than in GOF. Nymphadora Tonks - newcomer Natalia Tena is another severely miscast actor - do these casting directors even READ the books? Alastor Moody - Brendan Gleeson is again brilliant and a great fit. Bellatrix Lestrange - Helena Bonham Carter is just about right, hard to tell with such a shortened film adaptation and limited screen time. Sirius Black - Gary Oldman is a competent Sirius and shows us a bit more here than he did in POA. Voldemort - Ralph Fiennes is brilliant and as much a gift to the series as Rickman, Thompson, Smith and Coltrane are. Dolores Umbridge - Imelda Staunton is perhaps Oscar-nomination worthy in perhaps the clearest understanding and portrayal of a Rowling character since Richard Harris' Dumbledore. <br/><br/>I could go on and on, but am out of room. I thank God that I have the books and my own imagination to fill in the gaps of the movies and the poor casting and performances. You may have noticed that I have made no comment about Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville or Ginny. I just don't have room, but think basically that all 5 are doing well and are pretty well cast. Daniel has been better in previous films but still does well here. Rupert is doing much better and is past his hiccup overact in GOF's early scene. Emma is vastly improved and we're just blocking out how poorly she did in the first film. Matthew is finally getting to show us more than physical comedy. I can't wait to see how Bonnie Wright (the actress playing Ginny) breaks out in the next 2 films. She has definite potential."
"LeChadwickMcKay","3","5","9","11 July 2007"," How can you call this amazing?
","Seeing the midnight show like i have before every other Harry Potter movie, i never thought i would be so disappointed. Every aspect of the book was either changed, not in the movie or crammed into 10 seconds of dialouge. The whole movie seemed rushed and trying to catch up with itself.The blatant use of unnecessary computer graphics was bland and uninteresting. The fight scenes at the end were fabricated and had little meaning to them. Sirius died the wrong way and before i could emotionally react. I also believe that harry was begging to be killed under the cruciatus curse.<br/><br/>The cinematography was terrible, with no valid shots to make Hogwarts look anything like it used to in the previous movies. It seemed like the insides were no bigger than a boring set.<br/><br/>You think with all the money and great ideas from the wonderful book they could have produced something more substantial. I could have handled a three hour movie if it needed that long to be a great movie.<br/><br/>Anyone who is a Harry Potter fan and calls this ""Amazing"" or the ""Best Harry Potter yet!"" don't you have a little higher expectations?"

","First of all, I would like to say that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite of all of J.K Rowling's masterful books thus far. Which is why I was extremely nervous to watch the movie, for fear that it would not live up to my expectations. However, I was pleasantly surprised as soon as the movie began. Through this movie, the new director has managed to maintain the darkness and political satire of the novel and portray it in a way that was not only fun but beautiful to watch on screen. Despite the fact that there were many parts of the book that were cut out of the movie, I was left feeling utterly fulfilled. While the first two films were extremely precise and technical, they lacked the magic that the audience feels while reading the books. This movie brought back that feeling for me and allowed me to become completely immersed in the characters and their journey through adulthood. The details simply don't matter when watching the important movie, it's all about the tone, and this one was full of darkness, much like the book. Ron and Herminor, played by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, were extremely lovable in this film in their everlasting pursuit to stand by their best friend. They add many funny extras to the movie, as does the PERFECT Luna Lovegood. Professor Umbridge, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Alan Rickman were also stunning in their roles. Please go watch this film! Don't listen to any bad reviews, they simply aren't true."

","All the other Harry Potter movies nearly followed the book and were like each other, but Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix was absolutely horrible. It didn't follow the book, and it was unlike all the other movies. In the third movie, the dementors looked like they had black cloaks over them, but in this movie, they had faces and looked like they were wearing normal clothes; they didn't even have the hoods that were mentioned in the book. And, the carriages didn't look the same as they did in the fourth movie; in the fourth movie, there were roofs for the carriages, but in this movie, the carriages didn't have roofs. In the book, Professor Umbridge and Harry were supposed to be super friendly with each other, but in the movie, Harry was super rude to Professor Umbridge, and Professor Umbridge was mean to him. There was absolutely no quidditch, Creecher was barely shown, and when Sirius died, it was supposed to be really, really sad, but it barely looked like that. I admit, I did cry when he died and it showed Harry ""screaming,"" but when I read the book and learned that Sirius died, I cried more. This movie was nothing I expected it to be; so much was taken out from the book! In the first, second, third, and fourth movies, it pretty much followed the book, but this movie did nothing of the sort. 1/10 stars!"
"angusledge","3","20","54","11 July 2007"," Did not live up on any level
","This movie did not live up to any of the hype that the trailer or the book created.<br/><br/>Acting; For so called professional actors/actresses, Danial, Rupert, Emma did not show any ability as actors to portray true emotions instead using common techniques used by amateurs (such as rhythmical phrasing). This is not completely the fault of the actors, it is partly from having not had the proper training, acting in a movie is well and good but without basic training, they are picking up bad habits that hinder there character portrayals.<br/><br/>Special effects/ Direction; For a movie that has the creative freedom to create any visual effects that it chooses, they use the same effects that they use for a specific spells in other movies. also for direction and editing creating a movie that people do not fall asleep in is generally a major point however for some reason this movie movie extremely slow while not covering a great deal of story line.<br/><br/>While I might sound like a Potter hater I am quite the opposite, I love the harry potter book story but I feel that the movies have let the fans down again, and the director for the next two movies should think about trying to follow the story more."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","9","6","12","11 July 2007"," Daniel Radcliffe finally grows into the role of Harry Potter and gives the performance of his career. Yates is the best director the series has had.
","There is no doubt that Harry Potter is an iconic character of a generation, and it would be very easy for filmmakers to go 'typical Hollywood' on the film adaptations and coast through for the sake of money. It is remarkable, however, to witness the awesome dedication from people such as David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, and especially the young Daniel Radcliffe. The crew of these films work so hard to preserve the magic and brilliance of JK Rowling's novels, and it really shows on screen in the brilliant performances, beautiful sets, and masterful direction.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is growing up fast, and now he must deal with enemies both inside and outside the walls of Hogwarts. Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) return is being ignored by the Ministry of Magic, and the Ministry's distrust of Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is most evident when a high ranking official (Imelda Staunton) is placed in Hogwarts as a teacher. Add on that Harry's feelings of alienation and loneliness may get the best of him, and you realize that the wizarding world is taking on a dark tone, and that things may no longer be safe for our heroes.<br/><br/>David Yates has, in my opinion, crafted the finest directorial job of any of the films, finishing just ahead of Alfonso Cuaron's brilliant take on 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. What I like most about Yates is his uncanny ability to retain the spirit of the novel (which is the longest of all), while making a movie that is, not only the shortest, but the only one that doesn't drag, despite the decreased amount of action in comparison to its predecessor, 'Goblet of Fire'. Yates' biggest strength is in his ability to procure good performances across the board, as this is the most well acted out of all the Potter films. Daniel Radcliffe gives the best performance of the series thus far with his great take on a conflicted, vulnerable, and emotionally fragile Harry Potter. It is at this point that we see Harry transition from young boy to young adult. Harry is growing up, just like Radcliffe, who almost effortlessly expresses that. Kudos must always go to Mr. Alan Rickman for giving probably the most loyal and spot on performance as Severus Snape, the scene stealing Potions master. Even in reduced screen time, Rickman gives another award worthy performance. Special mention must also be made for Imelda Staunton and Ralph Fiennes, who are positively scary in their roles as Dolores Umbridge and Lord Voldemort, respectively. Fiennes could have used more screen time, however you can definitely feel the tension between him and Radcliffe as hero and villain despite the lack of screen time. Helena Bonham Carter steals the show in a brief role as Voldemort's most sadistic and loyal follower Bellatrix Lestrange. The most surprising has to be the fine performance from newcomer Evanna Lynch as dreamy and 'out there' student Luna Lovegood. She is simply wonderful as the character, and it should come as no surprise that the character is her favorite. I also feel the need to applaud Gary Oldman for his wonderful portrayal of Sirius Black, a fan favorite. He provides both the fatherly warmth and the brotherly charm given off by Sirius in the novels very well. Also reprising their roles well are Maggie Smith, Mark Williams, David Thewlis, Jason Isaacs, and Julie Walters.<br/><br/>As with any big budget production, the Harry Potter films always boast outstanding special effects and production design. I believe one of the biggest Oscar snubs in 2007 was not giving Stuart Craig a nomination for his brilliant sets, especially Umbridge's office, the Ministry of Magic, the Department of Mysteries, and the Room of Requirement. The sets are beautiful, and are one of the main reasons it's so easy to escape into the magical wizarding world. The special effects, usually a strong point of the Potter films, take a turn for the worse in some scenes, while in others, they are brilliant. This is the fact that the film's post production is rushed showing itself. The centaurs and the giant Grawp (Tony Maudsley) are the weakest point of the visuals, while all the special effects such as magic spells, fireworks, and the climactic Ministry of Magic battle, are simply brilliantly done. Michael Goldenberg's script is good, but there are some flaws and continuity errors, but for the most part it sets the stage for a great adaptation. There are also some editing flaws, but it doesn't really detract from the story. Order of the Phoenix also has the distinction of straying the furthest from the plot, cutting subplots and slightly changing the roles of Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis, who is also great) and Cho Chang (Katie Leung...not so much).<br/><br/>All in all, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix can stand alone as a decent political/mystery thriller, that serves as a bridge between the novels from child's play to the supreme darkness that is come in the final 2 installments (however, the final chapter in the story, Deathly Hallows, will be 2 films). It is a great movie that the fans will love a lot more than the critics think. For sure, 'Order' gets better every time you watch it."

","Given only two hours they managed to fit most of the important parts into the movie, character development was a letdown the movie lacked the meat of the book concentrationg too much on umbridge and less on the Order, Tonks was barley there the fight in ministry mad DA look weak and barley able to hold their own, where the book actually had some good wizard dueling not just a lot of flying smoke and the da scrambling for their lives. Neville got nothing but a look from Beletrix. Umbrige is easy to hate and a one book character, there should have been more effort on main characters, Luna was played wonderfully to character but what about Cho betraying the DA and no relationship at all between tonks and Sirius i guess in the next movie shell cry a lot but anyone who has not read the book will not have a clue why. all and all Read the Book watch the movie to get a little visual help, but don't be surprised if the next 2 movies aren't bare of important details as the books get longer and longer"
"Taker1228","4","21","58","11 July 2007"," Order of the Pheonix by name only....
","This movie was absolutely terrible in my personal opinion. As a fan of the book series, I felt I deserved much more that what was delivered to me for my $8.50. There were too many problems to name, so I'll throw a few out there. 1. The first Harry Potter book was just over 300 pages in length. The movie was roughly 152 minutes according to the DVD in front of me at this moment. The fifth book was 870 pages. The movie was, according to IMDb, ""Runtime: 138 min "". Anyone else notice a problem with this? I certainly did. So much more could have been done. 2. Things in the book did not make it into the movie. This would normally be OK. This kind of thing happens all of the time in movies. The problem I have? Things were added in that were not from the book. When it comes to what should and should not be in the movie, parts from the book should be the first thing added in, not taken away. 3. Not only were things missing, but some major things were missing. Members of the Order (from the book) made no appearances what so ever. Those who made the cut played little role. Quidditch played no role in the film while it played quite a bit into the book. What about Ron's problems with Quidditch? The movie focused purely on Harry, and not on the supporting characters. 4. Mixing and matching. The major points that were from the book appeared in a different order in the film as compared to the movie. Scenes that occurred around the middle of the book occurred early in the movie. Some parts from the book were moved around. <br/><br/>Overall, it was like they took the book, cut out all of the pages, added their own to the pile, and then pasted it all into an order that they saw fitting. You'll notice however, that the film did in fact get a 4 from me. You may ask why. That answer is simple. The soundtrack and special effects were amazing. Fight scenes were rather enjoyable, and the music was wonderful. Really, I think the people responsible for these things should have been the only one to receive any recognition. So if you've read and enjoyed the books, this movie really isn't for you. If you've read the books, enjoyed them, but are there for special effects, you may enjoy it. If you've never read the books and your knowledge is based purely on the movies, you'll probably find this one an enjoyable addition to the series."
"Robert_duder","9","4","7","29 July 2007"," Perhaps a tiny slip in the so far increasingly brilliant series...but so far it's been absolutely breath taking
","I would not for a minute tell you that Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix was not worth seeing or that as many critics have stated Harry Potter had ""lost it's magic,"" fact is Order Of The Phoenix continues and achieves what few else if any film series has ever carried out and that's the continuity of absolute epic brilliance. So far from the very first film this series has only gotten better and better with maturity and story and part of that is the brilliance of the author of the original stories (which I have not read yet and likely won't until the films are behind me.) J.K. Rowling is so involved in these films and insists on absolute authority on each character and what makes it in the film and certainly if anyone knows how to bring her amazing and epic story to life it would be her. Order Of The Phoenix I 'think' is the bridge between everything from Hogwarts in the beginning unraveling to lead up to the epic ending of this series. Being the bridge can't be easy and probably doesn't fulfill some of the previous installments glory but it's still very important and still has some incredible scenes including an absolutely breath taking battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore that is easily on the top ten list next to Vadar and Skywalker, or anything from Lord Of The Rings. It's simply stunning!! The film does start out a little slower than most and yet seems to rush through everything but I understand The Order of The Phoenix is a massive book (in fact the longest in the series---870 pages) and that alone is enough to understand why there might have been a struggle to jam everything into this film that they possibly could and I have no doubt they did a stellar job but it still might have seemed slightly rushed and maybe a little incomplete. One of the most amazing aspects of the films to this point has been the incredible ensemble cast which sadly and unfortunately (but perhaps necessarily) leaves them in the back seat (especially the teachers and professors and adult characters.) However we do get far more from the students, from Harry himself and his best friends are still on the forefront. It was just sad to not have the more adult characters around more (especially Hagrid.) <br/><br/>I won't go into too much detail about the already existing cast. After five films this cast will go into history as some of the greatest character actors in this epic series. Brendan Gleeson, Maggie Smith (always been one of my favorites since day one of this series), Alan Rickman, Warwick Davis, Emma Thompson, and of course Robbie Coltrane. They all make their appearances in different lengths but for the most part they are further in the background then ever before especially Coltrane and they are all so amazing. The core three (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) have their characters down to a fine art and no one else could ever replace them case closed. Ralph Fiennes is deadly brilliant as the evil Voldemort. New additions to the cast in this round is the annoyingly over bearing Dolores Umbridge played very well by recent Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton. She is a clever additional villainess so to speak who impedes the children in their battle against Voldemort and attempts a mass and hostile take over of their beloved Hogwarts. Staunton is a valuable and hopefully returnable character to the series. Evanna Lynch is the slightly odd but seemingly powerful ally Luna Lovegood who does an absolutely amazing job playing the seemingly spinny but very friendly classmate to Harry. I hope she too returns because she also fits right into this cast. Gary Oldman also returns doing an amazing job in his role as Sirius Black.<br/><br/>Order Of The Phoenix isn't quite as visually stunning as some of the previous films. They unfortunately don't find time to play a Quiditch game and there isn't quite as many beautiful creatures (the addition of Hagrid's giant half brother is very cool---would like to have seen more of him) and the mysterious centaurs in the shadowy forest were also quite stunning. Some of the views were brilliant but still overall this film seemed to focus far more on Harry and his struggles with Dolores Umbridge and his mind being controlled by Voldemort rather than going for the stunning visuals that were featured so prominently in it's predecessors. Still with everything being said although not the best in the series...to be this good and have this caliber of a film in the fifth installment is unprecedented and Order Of The Phoenix still has numerous scenes that have to be seen. It's brilliant and I wished I could have seen it on the IMAX especially with the added 3D content. This series is just amazing. 9/10"
"ladyljd","1","4","7","14 July 2007"," Please don't waste your time! **** SPOILER WARNING!! ****
","Well, I just returned from seeing it and I must confess only two words come to mind: astoundingly bad. I mean, really, how can you spend all that time, effort and money only to produce something like this? I'm sad to say this movie made me feel absolutely NOTHING. It is a soulless, emotionless empty shell. For me, nothing demonstrates this film's emptiness better than the post dementor attack scene with Mrs. Figg. The actor was obviously directed to behave as if nothing unusual has happened as opposed to the wild terror the character shows in the book.<br/><br/>Sure, this isn't a big deal on its own but the scene is then quickly followed by a fly-by of all the major London muggle landmarks with absolutely no regard for magical secrecy. Surly the director is saying to us 'who cares about the book' very early on, isn't he? It would have taken, what, 10 seconds to do a concealing charm before they took off? Oh well. I already knew about the ridiculous changes made to the Occlumancy (no pensieve) and Snape's Worst Memory (no underpants or Lily) so I was expecting that disappointment. However I had no idea Snape's screen time would be so limited. To me this backs up my theory on how JKR will make Snape both evil and a non-entity in DH.<br/><br/>And I believe Luna's last lines foreshadow Sirius coming back in DH which will be yet another poor JKR decision. All in all, I really can't think of one positive thing to say about this film. Except for how nice the music was. As I was apologizing to the two friends I dragged to see this mess, we stayed through the closing credits due to the wonderful end title score."

","Overall, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was not a great movie.<br/><br/>The special effects were fantastic and the director did a good job with capturing the feel of a living world of magic and adventure, but the movie was dense with terrible one-liners and it was also unbelievably predictable. Some of the lines were so poorly-written that only a child could see past their embarrassing stupidity.<br/><br/>If you're interested in seeing more than a cool magic spell and don't want to spend over two hours watching a movie that you can already predict the ending before seeing it then don't waste your time."
"markwoo","5","4","7","12 July 2007"," A bit of a drag
","One always knew that, as the length of the HP books increased, turning them into films was going to get harder. So to be fair, one must remember that the Order of the Phoenix is a heavily padded book lacking the tautness of the first three novels as well as their clever plots. With the Goblet of Fire one still had an excellent plot but the padding had begun.<br/><br/>Thus it is no surprise that first four films got better and better. They also showed a steady progression into the battle between good and evil, with each one being 'darker' than its predecessors. I had hoped this film would continue that trend and to a limited extent it did, it was certainly gloomy. Sadly though, here one has a film that despite having some exciting interludes, ultimately did not deliver. We already knew from HP and the Goblet of Fire that Lord Voldemort was back; this film left me thinking 'so what?' Where were the real surprises? There weren't any.<br/><br/>Where was the climax? There really wasn't one because nothing was answered properly.<br/><br/>What one can see is that the switch of screenwriters from Steve Kloves (SK) to Michael Goldenberg (MG) was a big mistake. SK understood the essentials of the first four novels and put together excellent screenplays with the author. With MG, I think the main problem is that the screenplay tried too hard to stick to the book, with the result that so much was left out, the plot seemed full of holes (perhaps the author had something to do with this as well).<br/><br/>Looking to the future I am greatly relieved to note that SK is back as screenwriter for the Half Blood Prince and I really hope he will write the screenplay for the Deathly Hallows and we can forget about the Order of the Phoenix because that is what this film is; FORGETTABLE."

","I was actually very disappointed in this movie. It did not seem to have the same chemistry between the actors as the previous movies. Many of the main characters only had bit parts. There was too much Harry and not enough of the others. What makes a movie great is all the subplots. The previous movies had them but not this one. It made for a long and almost boring in parts movie. The previous movies I have watched again and again. This one I fell asleep three times, and will probably not bother watching again. Sorry, I love the Harry Potter cast, just like to see more of the others and not all just Harry. This book was the longest book in the series so why did they make it the shortest movie in series? I agree about the acting of the main three being better. Radcliff has really improved. He is really putting emotion into acting now. A few subplots that involved the other actors would of improved this movie."

","Television director David Yates makes his first foray into cinema with the latest Harry Potter entry and does so with decidedly mediocre results. Although he does show some stylistic restraint at appropriate times, his handling of narrative elements leaves something to be desired. Also, his movie is literally just too dark, which seems to be an unfortunate trend of recent comic book films (Spiderman, Superman, and of course Batman) that pose as serious-minded and penetrating ventures into the human psyche but are actually just as shallow as their predecessors. The darkness of the new HP adds little to the story and is too literal-minded. But more to the point, it is entirely inappropriate for the IMAX DMR 3-D format.<br/><br/>The whole point of IMAX is spectacle. Harry Potter certainly has its share of spectacle, but since Yates directed this film for general theatre distribution, he doesn't take advantage of the IMAX format very well, and he completely wastes the 3-D technology. As mentioned above, this movie's visual darkness makes a giant-screen format futile. What difference does a giant screen make if you can't see anything? What good are giant shadows? Of course I exaggerate, and indeed some well-lit scenes come off very well on IMAX, but when the vast majority of the footage on screen is cast in shadow because of the director's hackneyed attempt at giving the movie a more dramatic look, you just have to scratch your head and wonder why they bothered to use the big screen technology at all.<br/><br/>As for the 3-D technology, in HP it is pointless. For 3-D to be effective a movie needs to be brightly lit with long takes. Choppy editing and dimly lit scenarios don't offer much to the viewer to enjoy. How can you enjoy the depth of the format if most of what you see on screen is darkness? How can you enjoy the eye-popping effects if you're constantly adjusting your eyes to a new shot.<br/><br/>It seems reformatting Harry Potter for IMAX DMR 3-D was an afterthought, and Yates changed little to accommodate the technology. One could hardly blame him, though. Yate's stylistic choices are nothing if not consistent. That he refrained from comprising his vision for an exhibition format only a fraction of the viewers would enjoy is probably commendable. The blame should go to whoever decided to make only the climax in 3-D rather than the entire movie. It's distracting to the viewers and the director. It added so little to the experience and was poorly handled. The 3-D technology they have can be quite effective. But IMAX has to showcase that technology in films that can take advantage of that. Otherwise audiences are just going to be disappointed and they'll leave the theatre not knowing what they're missing."

The Pirates - At World's End had 168 minutes of runtime, and OotP with 138 left a Lot more story untold!<br/><br/>I wanted MORE of the New Characters - Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is truly a Lovable Hit! Please give her MORE Screen Time and Dialogue! Natalia Tena as Nymphodora Tonks was also great to watch, but don't expect to understand her Shape-Shifting Facial Contortions if you didn't read the book! Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of Bellatrix Lestrange was predictably evil, as those who saw her in ""Fight Club"" would know she could. Maybe it's hard to mention Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, because it's so easy to Hate the Character from her first appearance in the Trial.<br/><br/>I really missed a lot of scenes from the book, like St Mungo's, where we should have been introduced to Neville Longbottom's parents in a more graphic way. The Battles were Graphic, but not at all as Detailed as I had imagined, like all scenes from the Ministry of Magic. So even if you saw the Movie FIRST, you Still MUST Read the Book to get it All.<br/><br/>I just got out of the IMAX Theatre less than an hour ago. It's amazing how much of this plot could be compacted in to 2 hours of screen time - and still leave me wanting MORE MORE MORE!"
"chris_n_malone","6","12","30","12 July 2007"," Don't set your hopes too high
","Let me preface this by saying that I've never read any of the books.<br/><br/>I thought that this film lacked a storyline, spent far too much time on a new character, and scratched the surface on a main character's past (but didn't go deep enough). I also thought that the media over-hyped the movie's 'darkness.' A final criticism is that the charades played near the start of the film could have been done much quicker and set up the storyline just the same. The biggest positive is that you learn a little about one of the main characters and by the end of the film you feel like Harry's character has gone through some progression. It wasn't a bad movie, but walking out of the theater I don't feel like the story had advanced much from the point where the 'Goblet of Fire' movie left off."

It was by far one of the movies on my top ten list. The graphics were awesome. I LOVED the threstrals. Harry's hair....a bit disappointing but the movie made up for that. Kreacher was Amazing. He looked exactly like I had pictured him. Even comparing it to the book is possible. It beats the rest of the films by a long shot. I LOVED the Harry Cho kissing scene and the look and film of the characters and their surroundings gave me shivers. The small bit that Bella was in the movie was awesome and Voldemort's scene had me at the edge of my seat. Overall, a damn good movie."
"cosmic_quest","7","5","10","17 July 2007"," Finally, an HP film worthy of the name
","While 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' isn't quite the epic that fans of the books had hoped the HP films would grow to be, it is a worthy film and joins 'Prisoner of Azkaban' as the most redeeming of the film series. OotP sees Harry, now aged fifteen and more a man than a child, entering his Fifth Year at Hogwarts. Although Ron and Hermione continue to provide unyielding friendship and support, our hero is bitter and jaded in the aftermath of Cedric Diggory's death and questions his role in bringing down destiny. In addition to his burdens, he also has to deal with the new harsh, unsympathetic DADA teacher Umbridge, appointed by the Ministry and determined to discredit Harry's claim that darkness stalks the wizarding world once more, and Voldemort plundering his mind through telepathic (leglimency, for fans) means.<br/><br/>As per usual, the adult cast of the film are exemplary and I think we expect no less from these British veterans. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon and Robbie Coltrane all succeed wonderfully in bringing their characters to life, despite the fact they still don't appear in enough scenes. Gary Oldman, as Black, and Remus Lupin, as Lupin, are both back again and continue to perform their roles well. Imelda Staunton was absolutely excellent as Umbridge, depicting the character as almost a manic mix of a smug Margaret Thatcher, a deranged Hyacinth Bucket and as obsessed with Minister of Magic as Anne Wilkes was of her favourite author in 'Misery'! In regards to the younger cast, Daniel Radcliffe continues to grow in his role. He still struggles a bit with Harry's darker emotions (in part, I believe, down to the fact that Radcliffe is more natural at comedy) but he is able to maintain the character's moodiness without making a mess. Emma Watson, unfortunately, remains in the 'over-acting' mode that left her performance in 'Goblet of Fire' so irritating. Someone needs to tell the girl to relax if she is to ever achieve a more natural performance. Rupert Grint definitely shines out. His laid-back, quiet nature works well in portraying Ron's loyalty to Harry and his determination to be there for his friends and family. New to the cast is Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, who depicted the character's dreamy, head-in-the-clouds manner to a T. Of the young cast, she is the one who most accurately brings her character to life.<br/><br/>Michael Goldenberg, the scriptwriter who steps in Steve Kloves' shoes in the first change to the scriptwriting role since PS, does an excellent job and I wish he could have stayed on for 'Half-Blood Prince'. He quite rightly focused the film primarily on the lead character, rather than the trio as a team, since OotP is very much Harry's story where he feels alone in the world as he struggles to accept his destiny. I have a feeling Kloves, who very obviously favours Hermione, wouldn't have been able to achieve this in his zeal to give his favourite screen-time.<br/><br/>Goldenberg also provides mature dialogue, that reflects on the characters' British-ness, and scenes that allow the viewers to both empathise and feel exasperated with Harry's moods (he cut down the number of tantrums Harry has, which works better in order to retain sympathy for the character). He's also toned down the selfishness of Sirius Black compared to the book and the depth of hatred between Snape and Harry/the Marauders. In a way, I think this does work better for the film otherwise-- without access to Harry's thoughts-- we'd be left wondering why he even bothers himself with Black.<br/><br/>Also new to the production team is David Yates, as the director, and what a welcome change he is. Yates, whose previous projects are British television dramas, is not so entrenched in Hollywood and this is what these films desperately needed to give them a bit of class expected from a British franchise. Too much dumbing down and pandering to small children and the shallow masses, in an attempt to turn these films into popcorn blockbusters, are what have prevented them from becoming as great as they could have been.<br/><br/>I did think the film should have ended on the darker note of the book instead of trying to deliver hope when Harry was feeling no such thing. In the book, after everything he'd been through, Harry was shown to be at his lowest ebb and this depression to his character wasn't retained in the film. I also felt a certain someone's death could have been better reflected on; I don't think Harry's grief, shock, anger and despair was properly portrayed. I also didn't like the light-hearted music during the scenes where Umbridge is taking firm control of the school. Her actions are meant to cruel and constricting, not humorous.<br/><br/>Overall, I think OotP provides hope for the HP films yet (a series that will have to carry the burden of continuing the hype since the final book is released on 21/07/07, meaning the interest in the franchise could wane if things aren't done properly). For the first time, I came out quite satisfied that nothing too essential had been missed out nor had characters been greatly mis-handled. The only reason I still favour PoA is because it focused more on the adult characters, who I prefer. Nevertheless, OotP is an enjoyable film that shows that HP isn't for children anymore (please don't bring your toddler to this as they will either end up bored or traumatised) and this has to be reflected in the tone of the script, the depiction of the characters and in the performances of the young cast. Sadly, with Kloves back in the seat for HBP, it's hard to know whether this vein with be maintained (especially since he might not be able to resist the temptation of focusing on the romance and Hermione scenes to the detriment of the actual plot)."
"super_rhi","1","5","10","13 July 2007"," Pathetic
","I saw the film on the day of release (12 July), and I was really excited about seeing it. I love the books and I love the films, but I hate the idea that the films came from the books, as they're nothing alike. The general ideas are the same, but the important parts are missing and Hermione gets all of Ron's lines! But let's get back to this film. It's the worst yet. As a film it's OK(ish), but as a film of a book it's terrible. HALF of the important things were missing and most of the characters are portrayed incorrectly. Also, what was going on with the filming? One part (I won't say which, or I might get accused of 'spoiling'), but one part, Harry's running and the camera man's running too, so the camera's shaking so much you can't actually see what's going on for a second! And the whole spinning paper thing? What was that about?! Rather pathetic, if you ask me. I really enjoyed the other films, even though they too leave out important parts that lead to the next films. I would also like to point out that Dumbledore suddenly has this Irish accent in film 3 (Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban), when he had no such thing in the first two! I'm glad they made the films as so many others who are too lazy to read the books have the story and excitement of Harry and his friends, but I wish they were better. There is so much room for improvement."
"macd7788","7","5","10","12 July 2007"," Movie vs. Book
","The movie obviously could not live up to the book so those who are die hard book fans, don't expect too much. The movie seemed very short and many great parts from the books were either left out or shortened greatly. To catch every detail from an 870 page book, the movie would have to be 12 hours long so I understand some things need to be cut out. However, there is no need for the fillers such as the bird paper airplane in the first defense against the dark arts class and the detention where every one is writing with the hand cutting pens. Instead could we see some Quidditch? Maybe St. Mungo's? Fred's and George's swamp? Or how about the Quibbler interview? And last but not least, the Prophecy explanation by Dumbledore at the end of the book? Why not add some more time onto the movie to put these things in. I just don't get why the longest book is the shortest movie. Although these things were cut out, I don't want to be a downer completely. The movie was still very fun and entertaining and the special effects were great.<br/><br/>Now the most ridiculous (I can't even think of a word that would express my anger fully) thing about the movies is the actor playing Dumbledore. Get rid of your stupid Hollywood ego and play the part you are supposed to play. Forget about trying to make it your own. This is not a role that should be tampered with. Richard Harris played the ideal Dumbledore as I saw in my mind in the books. There is no twinkle in his eye anymore, where's the tall hat, no half moon spectacles, and he certainly should not have the temper or attitude that is portrayed in the movies. I can say this honestly, for those of you who have read the books, when Snape fulfills his unbreakable vow to Draco, I will not be upset in the movie. I just can't express how disappointing it is to see this character completely different in the movies than who I adored so much in the books. There really needs to be a change of actor or a change of acting style, b/c I've seen the current Dumbledore outside of the Harry Potter series and he is a good actor.<br/><br/>All in all, I love the Harry Potter series and I would just like to see more accuracy from the movies. Go in with an open mind and you will enjoy the movie whether you've read the books or not. Can't wait for book 7!!"
"I_Am_The_Taylrus","9","5","10","11 July 2007"," Well, I Admit It, The Best Potter Film Yet! (SPOILERS)
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I have read every book, I have seen every movie, so I was definitely excited about the Order of the Phoenix coming out, but when I heard that it is only 138 minutes, the shortest Potter film, and it was the longest book, with 870 pages, I was a bit worried that this was going to be a mess of a movie. Fortunately, it was not. Sure, some scenes were rushed, and they left out some good scenes, but I was impressed by some aspects of the movie. For example, they left out the scene with Harry going into the Pensieve and discovering that his father was a jerk, but they included that when Harry gets into Snape's mind. There are small things like that that can make something interesting.<br/><br/>Here is the plot. Harry Potter begins his fifth year in Hogwarts with a some problems. Firstly, Lord Voldemort is back and the Ministry of Magic does not believe him. Secondly, the school has a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the sinister Dolores Umbridge, who wants to take over the school. Thirdly, Harry keeps having visions of Voldemort and fears that he is becoming him. Umbridge really is not a favorite of the students, and she does not like to talk about how to defend themselves. Instead, they read books. Harry then forms Dumbledore's Army, a secret club in which several students practice spells. Then, Harry has a vision of Ron Weasley's dad getting attacked by Voldemort's snake and saves his life. Harry then starts taking Occlumency lessons to block his mind is Voldemort attacks. After that, Harry has a vision of his godfather, Sirius Black, getting tortured in the Department of Mysteries, and he wants to save him. Harry and his friends arrive in the Department of Mysteries, only to discover that the vision was a trap for Harry to get a certain Prophecy. Voldemort's minions, the Death Eaters, attack Harry and his friends. Then, Sirius and others members of the Order of the Phoenix come to rescue them. Sirius is killed, and Voldemort arrives to kill Harry. Then, Dumbledore comes and save Harry from Voldemort. Harry then discovers that he has to kill Voldemort, or Voldemort will kill him. Harry and everyone else flee the Department of Mysteries, and the year ends.<br/><br/>Overall, I do think that this is the greatest Harry Potter film yet and rightfully should be. David Yates did a fantastic job directing, the acting is wonderful, especially Imelda Staunton as Umbridge, who played the role of Umbridge absolutely perfectly. The visual effects are truly incredible. The music is quite good, too. The only major flaw is that they really rushed Sirius's death. He died in a snap. However, I do like the aftermath, when Bellatrix Lestrange, the one who killed him, runs, and Harry chased her. The shaky camera is great. Also, they left out some important things, like Ron joining the Quidditch team. In fact, they left Quidditch out completely. Anyway, with all that aside, though, this is a magnificent summer film.<br/><br/>9/10 <br/><br/>Recommended Films: Harry Potter 1, 2, 3, and 4."
"kevs06","7","5","10","11 July 2007"," HUGE disappointment
","OK, I am a really big Harry Potter fan, and for the movies I don't ask too much. I loved all of them and I have read all the books. First the movie starts well, It was faithful to the book and I was really enjoying it. Then the kids got to Hogwarts and Dolores Umbridge was introduced, Imelda Staunton was perfect. Then... I got really bored about the film, the problem is that all was happening like the book except that it was not as funny and entertaining. There was no action and I was expecting a huge battle between the Inquisitorial Squad and Dumbledore's Army. Umbrdige said GET THEM!! and nothing happened. I loved the conflicts about Harry's connection with Voldemort. And loved everything. Although some bits with Sirius were a bit dull. But the film got so bored that it got really repetitive. They talked and talked and then Harry goes to sleep and he has a nightmare, this happened so many times I lost count. I was expecting the big finale between lord Voldemort Death Eaters and the good guys. And when the battle started, boy, I was so disappointed. It last practically nothing and I couldn't believe it. I had seen the behind the scenes specials and what they have filmed was amazing! But in the movie there was really little of it and it seems stupid. The battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore was good but not enough to justify the rest of the battle scenes. Although the possession scene was actually pretty intense, excellent. In conclusion this film seemed like Star Wars Episode II, too many dialogs and trying to be funny and no action and at the end there was not enough. I am actually very worried about movie 6. I am hoping this film doesn't kill the franchise. 6/10<br/><br/>EDIT: After seeing it for second time (IMAX), I liked it a lot more. Although it still cant top prisoner of azkaban or Goblet of Fire. 7/10"
"DICK STEEL","10","10","25","11 July 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
","Finally, Harry Potter's gotten a decent clean cut hairstyle, compared to that ghastly shaggy dog manes that he spotted in the previous installment Goblet of Fire. The much touted scene here is The Kiss (about 1 hour into the movie), but seriously, that's much ado about nothing compared to what the rest of the movie has in store for audiences around the world. Just so you know, I've still not read any of the books by JK Rowling thus far, preferring to rely on cinematic magic to condense the ever increasing thickness of the novels into 2hrs and 10-20mins of full sensory invasion.<br/><br/>As a movie franchise installment, it doesn't waste time introducing characters or what's been done - either you know it, or you don't. So for those who have not watched Goblet of Fire, then please do, as Order of the Phoenix starts off pretty much from where the previous left off, with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) left haunted with his experience of battle with the dark Lord Voldermot (Ralph Fiennes, who also gained recent notoriety with his mile high exploits). Soon he finds himself devoid of friends, save for those loyal 2 - Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and plenty of pent up teenage angst of being unable to figure things out and make things right.<br/><br/>Yes, Harry's all grown up now, and instead of the usual teenage dalliances, he gets troubled with the ways of the world, of school politics, ministry politics, an evil Lord after his blood, and many more just to make him break. Even the staunch fatherly figures of godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seem so distant when he needed to reach out. Our boy wizard surely has his plate full.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the plot, I thought the movies have already developed a formula in presentation, and its predictability comes in the form of starting with the Muggles, then a little scuffle, before proceeding to Hogwarts for the semester, uncover a certain mystery, get tangled into that mystery, where solving it leads to a major fight sequence, followed finally with some resolution, yet having a reminder loom around that while the micro stuff have been attended to, the macro issue of his parentage, his scar, his affiliation with Voldermot, are still not addressed in its entirety, and satisfactorily.<br/><br/>Despite the structure, I've come to enjoy the franchised installments so far, as they play out like X-Files episodes - with mysteries that can be solved within the episode itself, yet having that long drawn conspiracy theories that continue to make you come back, just to learn whatever you can on new developments. As our characters grow (and actors grow in real world time), the story also develops and becomes more mature - gone are the cutesy antics in the earlier movies, and these get replaced by the darker themes, and in both mood and tone. Certain subplots do seem to get introduced quite haphazardly, but I suppose they're there as unmovable plot devices in order to stay true to the novel's actual plot development.<br/><br/>The supporting cast continue to grow, and the introduction of Imelda Staunton's Folores Umbridge will indeed incense anyone - the quintessential teacher from Hell. Fans of Hermione and Ron will perhaps rue that their idols somehow get lesser screen time, and spend most times in the background. But I thought that each time when they get together and the scene is just on our 3 buddies, you just can't help but feel for the camaraderie so strongly forged, given that they've spent years and 5 movies together already. There's a scene where they smiled (yes it's that simple), but somehow, it rung through as being so genuine, so heartwarming in spite of the story's contextual doom and gloom, it's like a beacon of hope that no worries, everything will be alright. That simple scene alone won me, that this is indeed a movie with important themes on love and friendship, that in the face of adversary, you just know who to count on.<br/><br/>Some may complain that the movie doesn't really feature much or new magic spells, but that I believe stays true to the storyline with many of Umbridge's unwarranted rules and regulations imposed on the student population. But when it's time to duke it out, I'd say the special effects were second to none, with the battles between the magic practitioners nothing less than spectacular, and since it's done by Industrial Light and Magic, then I'll state that they have been designed to be more intense that the Star Wars lightsabre fights - given of course we're dabbling in the realm of magic, where anything and everything goes, and to perfection as rendered in the movie - truly an awesome sight to behold when the masters settle it mano a mano.<br/><br/>I think this is the best Harry Potter movie so far (I've made mention that Goblet of Fire was, back in late 2005), even though it's still a cock tease. Guess we've got 10 days to find out what will really happen to the boy wizard, and thereafter, stay interested enough to want to watch the remaining two movies. I'd like to say that I can't wait (to read about the ending in Deathly Hallows, and for the last 2 movies to be made)."

"leojsivad","8","8","19","8 July 2007"," A solid movie, yet hardcore book fans might be disappointed...(SPOILERS ALERT)
","Let me first say, that this movie is very good. The acting is outstanding, and the scenery and environments are all very good. The movie itself is good, yet hardcore book fans may be disappointed with some aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, this movie is compressed into 2.5 hours. Not nearly enough time to tell the story of this particular book. There is one scene when Harry decides to infiltrate the Ministry of Magic, and it cuts directly to them inside the Ministry, with NO mention of how, or who helped them get inside. It cuts directly to the Hall of Prophecies.<br/><br/>Also, (BIG SPOILERS HERE DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT), the part where Sirius falls into the veil was very rushed and un-dramatic. The movie builds him up and you finally feel some sort of connection with him, and bam, hes gone, with little explanation with what happened.<br/><br/>There are also key plot points that are not mentioned at all, such as in the books, Harry casts the curse on Belletrix(SP?) at the end of the book, yet in the movie, we do not see this dark side of Harry as portrayed in the book. Perhaps it is the film trying to be kid friendly? I do not know, but it really leaves some of the good points of the book out.<br/><br/>The movie seems a bit rushed and altogether too short, yet this does not take away from the general enjoyment to be had from the film.<br/><br/>Go to see this movie for the good movie it is, not to compare with the book, and you will enjoy it."
"Elswet","6","3","5","24 July 2007"," What Was Done, Was Done Well, But HP5 Does Not Even BEGIN To Live Up To Its Potential!!
","I wanted to love it. I have anticipated this movie for several years, now, but I have to say I was terribly disappointed by this installment of the blockbuster Harry Potter franchise. This was one rich novel, and one horribly chopped-up film! It's almost as if the director was handed a few sequences and told, ""Make a movie,"" and the remaining 2/3 of the book were left unattended.<br/><br/>If you have no emotional investment in the franchise, and are simply a fan of the movies and not the novels, then this movie will be adequate in propelling the story into the next installment.<br/><br/>If you ARE a fan of the books; however, you will discover that 3/4 of the work is left to the book! This work is nothing more than a shadow of its literary self.<br/><br/>While the children are growing into fine young adults, and their performances are growing with them, the peripheral characters in this chapter are nothing better than lackluster, at best. As far as the kids go, I do have to interject that Dan Radcliffe has grown exponentially as an actor. He will have a brilliant career ahead of him, should he decide to follow this course. I can't wait to see where life leads him once the HP series is done and done. Emma's performances have grown over the years, as well. She seems more comfortable within her own skin, as Hermione, and Rup is growing up nicely. Dan, the world is your plum...just reach out and pluck it.<br/><br/>Bonnie Wright just can't seem to get a handle on Ginny Weasley. Her weak portrayal seems to make Ginny's character more and more superfluous, installment by installment. If it weren't for the known storyline and her momentary importance therein, I would say the movies would be better without her. Her performances when she was younger, were more convincing and felt more real.<br/><br/>Matthew Lewis is adequate as Neville. Frankly, I can't imagine anyone else who could portray the vacant look, wordless emoting, and complete lack of charisma any better than Matthew Lewis. If he didn't have at least SOME bearing on the outcome of Book 7, we don't seem to need his character, either. His character's presence and on screen time seem to be dwindling, rather than building; contrary to the books. Hopefully, if/when the time comes, he will be able to draw upon his experience as a child actor and enunciate around those prosthetic teeth! You can barely make out what he says! I'm also hoping he gets a grip on those bug eyes, and finds the ability to rise to the occasion, because in my opinion, he was much better an actor, when he was a younger boy. The ""actor"" he is now seems to be utterly out of place on the screen.<br/><br/>Regrettably, Tom Felton had VERY little screen time, and I can't say I remember a single line, if he even had one. Evanna Lynch, on the other hand, had plenty of lines, lots of charm, and nailed Luna Lovegood's character quite well. Here's hoping she can keep up the pretense, long enough to finish out the necessity of her character. <br/><br/>The Phelps twins got their shining moment, though not AS shining as one might expect due to the plethora of huge plot elements, etc. which were omitted, but it was adequate in its portrayal of the general feeling in Hogwarts at the time, though it did lack something, merely due to the writing, and in no way due to the twins themselves. They were awesome, as usual. <br/><br/>I hope the next screenplay includes their presence, as the book did. Maggie Smith's screen time (as compared to her character's word time in the novel) was significantly less than what I felt it should have been. The best scene of the SERIES involving Minerva McGonagal was LEFT OUT/CUT! But okay. They ""had"" to do that due to screen time obligations and contractual stipulations. I know. I know.<br/><br/>All in all, it was the hatchet job done on this work that brings it down in my opinion. Performance -wise, you'll get about what we've come to expect from most everyone but the trio who are improved, installment by installment. Otherwise, the enjoyment factor was lessened by a lack of continuity, and the adaptational quality was zilch. <br/><br/>Inconceivably, this installment enjoys a box office gross second only to the initial installment! Just goes to show you how few people read, and how there's no accounting for taste. Read the book. You'll enjoy that immensely more than this film editor's wet dream.<br/><br/>ALTHOUGH, what it DID show, it showed well.<br/><br/>It rates a 5.5/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"a-biegler","1","3","5","16 July 2007"," an appalling thoughtless rendition of a great book
","Simply put Yates absolutely butchered all the potential that this film held. This harry potter film is by far the worst film of the series, even toping my top three for worst book to movie films in history. I would say that all true harry potter fans will find this film absolutely despicable and appalling. ""Director"" yates turns this film into a cheap, tacky, and insulting rendition of the potter book. Throughout the film there are such blatant derivations from the crucial elements of the plot that it appears Yates has not even read the entire series. Harry potter is such a huge phenomenon in our present day that a competent director should have been assigned the honorary duty of creating this movie. Yates takes the wonderful work of JK Rowling and simply ignores he backbone and foundation of the magical world that she has created. He creates a movie of his own, apart from the story this movie is supposed to follow. Alright the very very basic elements of plot are there, but everything else is a disaster. He changes the power, characteristics, and personalities of numerous characters, simply disregards many elements that Rolwing has strategically placed in the novel (death eaters who can turn into black smoke and fly around??? are you serious?? this seems laughable to real potter fans im sure but it indeed happens throughout the entire film). And since when can wizards do magic with their non wand hand without a wand, or with their walking stick? And the dumbledor voldermort battle which should have been so easy to make stunning, powerful, even moving... it is completely mutilated, reminding me of the cheesiest movie of all time X-men 3, from which yates steals a move that he has voldermort use ( the glass). Yate's disregard of Rowland's work is appalling and it is unbelievable that for over a year the huge staff of this movie permitted such an atrocity and shameful attempt at a harry potter film continue. So my words of wisdom are thus: if you liked the book of the series do not see this movie for your own good. I would be amazed to find that Yates has even read all 6 books before making this terrible movie. Its a plottless, thoughtless, boring, cheezy, uninteresting, waste of life and money of a movie that will upset any true potter fans. a 10 year old fan could easily direct a much more satisfactory film than this piece. one word: ATROCIOUS"
"MattsMovieWatchingWorld","6","3","5","16 July 2007"," My Least Favorite HP Book Was Loads Better than the Movie.
","This Harry Potter movie was way too different from the other HP movies. I'm not sure who is the person that is the most to blame for this. It could be the director David Yates, who has never directed anything else that is recognizable. It could be the screenplaywright Michael Goldenberg, who is filling in for Steve Kloves, who is leaving this HP episode as the only one he's not screen writing. Or maybe J.K. Rowling herself, for writing books that are so varied in length, and for forcing the makers of the movies based on longer books to compress stuff and cut important stuff out.<br/><br/>One of my biggest complaints is that the shortest Harry Potter book turned out a movie that was still quite long. The second book was a bit longer, and the movie was a bit longer too. The third book was significantly longer, but the movie was significantly shorter. The fourth book was a lot longer, and the movie was only a bit longer. The fifth book is the longest of all, and the movie is the shortest of all. The first two movies, I predict, will always be my favorite two.<br/><br/>The third movie was the first time I was disappointed in a Potter movie, although I liked it a bit more the more I watched it. It had only one Quidditch match, the one in which Gryffindor loses, while both the other two in the book, in which Gryffindor wins, one of which is the Quidditch Final, were deleted. And it didn't mention the true identities of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, which irked me.<br/><br/>I heard long before the fourth movie was released that it would be two movies, which would have been good and also logical. But then I heard it would be a regular-length, single movie. The first nine chapters were covered in about ten minutes. There was no Quidditch in this one, but that was okay, because in the book, the Quidditch tournament was canceled for the Triwizard Tournament.<br/><br/>And now we have the fifth movie. The beginning was good. NO QUIDDITCH! although it's there in the book. Irked. Here's Dolores Umbridge, who is a downright, love-to-hate, bad witch. I hated her a lot more in the book, probably mainly because she bans Harry from a lifetime of Quidditch after a match. The fact that Ron and Hermione were prefects was not mentioned at all. Confused. A lot of the events were out of order, which was one thing that bothered me in the third movie, which I eventually mostly got over. I imagined being completely lost if I hadn't read the book. The plot, especially the climax, is significantly darker, but the movie is maybe a bit too dark, in maybe more disturbing a way than the book. The story, from beginning to end, was okay and a little bit redeeming, although it wasn't as enjoyable as the plots in the other books. The acting was good and okay, better than that in the fourth movie. Gary Oldman, who is a good actor, who plays Sirius Black, who didn't show up until the end of the third movie, who was only seen as ashes in a telefire and a voice narrating a letter in the fourth, was likable and an impressive actor in the fifth. Evanna Lynch, who is introduced as Luna Lovegood, was better than I imagined her in the book, although she didn't get to do everything she did in the book. Helena Bonham Carter was good as Bellatrix Lestrange, and whenever she appeared, it looked like a Tim Burton movie, which I'll say is a good thing.<br/><br/>The end credits didn't seem to fit. They looked like circus ad text.<br/><br/>Bring back John Williams! Nicholas Hooper was okay, and kind of kept the Harry Potter feel, but there was a moment in the end credits that screamed electric guitar, which wasn't pleasing to the ear.<br/><br/>It for a moment made me want to beg for a remake. But who knows how that would be possible? I only hope that I'll like this any more the more I watch it, like I did for the third.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I have been waiting this movie fore more than 1 year (when I read the book) & it's the worst thing anyone could direct starting from this story.<br/><br/>It is way under my expectations & under HP I-IV.<br/><br/>I consider that if I had seen the movie before reading the book, I wouldn't had understand anything. <br/><br/>The special effects are very poor; the story line that the book gives is hardly followed; watching this movie it's like listening to a resume made by a 9 years old child.......awful.<br/><br/>I am sorry if what I wrote is not entirely correct - grammatically; English is not my first language - but I think anyone can understand that this movie does not worth the money - save them & buy the book!"

","Granted... as someone who has read all the books countless times and listened to Jim Dale audiobooks too. I would have loved the movie to have everything that's in the book.... BUT that would have been a 12 to 15 hour movie and STILL not cover the fine points.<br/><br/>I think Yates and Goldenberg did a good job to cram it into 2:35. Yes, there were deviations from the book, to condense the scenes, to leave out unnecessary plot digressions, and add some action and imagination.<br/><br/>You must realize that the purpose of the movie is NOT to make book fans happy it is and always will be TO MAKE MONEY. Without this motivation there wouldn't be a movie in the first place. Plus, they need to take the audience into consideration, making Grawp passive bothered me, but it would appeal better to the 8 year old, I saw in the theater.<br/><br/>Finally, if other items deviated from the book, i.e. Mr. Weasly not having wacky clothing on, it's probably because NON-Readers of the book, wouldn't understand and explaining it would waste time that could be used for more important plot points.<br/><br/>If you REALLY want to know how hard a job Goldenberg had try writing a Readers Digest version of the OOTP in 50 pages. I guarantee it will disappoint far more than this movie."

","Well i guess i'll start with the pro's for the movie. Last night i went to the midnight opening of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and it was quite a thrill. The graphics i have to say were superb especially when Voldemort and Dumbledore fight in the ministry of magic and all the newspaper pictures, moving and what not.<br/><br/>But i must rain on it's graphic parade because the movie by no means served the book any justice. Things were out of order, such as Sirius showing harry the Black family tree on his Christmas holiday. It was supposed to be in the summer when they were cleaning the headquarters.<br/><br/>And then there's when hagrid returns. He was supposed to be back long before Trelawny got sacked, because everyone was worried about Umbridge choosing between them who to fire.<br/><br/>And they left out Quidditch entirely. The thing that is supposed to be so important to Harry. And by leaving out quidditch, they left out the fight between Harry, Fred, George, and Malfoy and also Harry, Fred and George getting their brooms taken away by Umbridge.<br/><br/>Then when hagrid showed them Grawp, it was only Harry and Hermione that he showed, because Rom was supposed to be playing Quidditch.<br/><br/>Also, Firenze teaching Divination, or just any mention of Firenze what so ever was no where to be seen.<br/><br/>And where was Dobby?<br/><br/>And where was Mrs. Black in Grimauld Place?<br/><br/>And where were the brains that strangled Ron in the Ministry of Magic?<br/><br/>And how was anyone who hasn't read the book to have any idea what the Hall of Prophecies was?<br/><br/>And the harry never gave the prophecy to Lucius Malfoy and he didn't actually hear the prophecy. Harry dropped it and Neville kicked it and it shattered, but it was too loud to hear.<br/><br/>And in the end, when harry is with dumbledore in his office, Why is their no mention of Neville Longbottom's connection to harry and voldemort?<br/><br/>And what happened to to St. Mungo's where we meet Gilderoy Lockheart again, and see Neville's Parents and Grandmother and Mr. Bode?<br/><br/>I could go on and on with all of this missed stuff. but i just want to ask, since this is the shortest Harry Potter film to date, why couldn't they have put in some more of the actual important things, or at least put everything else in the right order?<br/><br/>I feel sorry for the people who haven't read the books, because come next movie, they'll be completely lost."

","I was expecting a lot going into this movie. I've read every book but the fifth one, so I didn't really know what to expect as per plot. While the movie WAS very well choreographed and filmed, the acting just wasn't there. I feel like few too many people are looking at this movie for what it really is: a filler. Every 13 year old girl on the internet says it is the best movie yet, but I beg to differ. The emotional depth was lacking, and the set was poorly designed. I didn't feel like I was at Hogwarts, rather just a movie stage with Daniel Radcliffe doing a decent harry potter impersonation. Harry seemed angry the entire movie, but you never really get to understand why until the end. If you haven't read the book, you spend the entire movie wondering why he's so mad the entire time. Secondly, the plot progressed way too fast. Within the first fifteen minutes, Harry was already in the grand hall eating. Where's the setup? All in all, the movie acted out and felt like exactly what the book was supposed to be: a filler and guide for the sixth and seventh installments. If this movie is indicative of what the last two movies are going to be like, I think we are all going to be sorely disappointed."

"laci-5","7","16","46","5 July 2007"," I was expecting better
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not a bad movie. It's just... I think this was the first case when a HP movie could have been better than the book, as the book is simply too long; it has too many plot points that it has to tell as an exposition for the last two chapters; too many new characters etc. (don't get me wrong, I love all the HP books but I find OotP the weakest of them). This movie runs through the story which results in a very long hour of talking. After the unexpectedly dark, thrilling opening sequence it's all about talking maybe until 1:35 or something like that in the movie, which is actually necessary for the 7-book story but a bit...dare I say, boring. Yes, we can say it is more 'grown-up' but grown-up does not necessarily mean boring; even if politics take part in the conversation. As this is the shortest movie of the five, maybe this time they should have included some quidditch in ten minutes just for fun and excitement (the quidditch story line is, once again, totally missing); maybe there should have been a little more emphasis on the romantic part as well. We see all the necessary new characters like Tonks or Bellatrix but they get way too short time on-screen. During this talking part the director tries to add some momentum several times but usually fails; maybe it's all because of the mentioned 'too much plot, too many characters' problem. It should have become a kind of thriller but even the nightmare sequences can't help creating real tension. Then, in the last 30-40 minutes, action begins and while this action is not really awe-inspiring, it is on par with the spectacular action sequences of the previous movies. So... It's not a bad movie, it is functional and I am sure the next one will be better (partly because that has a much stronger story)."
"jbgerstn","1","35","116","11 July 2007"," Horrendous
","This movie felt like a series of trailers strung together to make a terrible movie. No scenes were elaborate, huge discrepancies with the books, and a low budget look came with it. This was the largest disappointment I have experienced at the movies, worse than the second Pirates of the Caribbean film. I would not recommend anybody see this movie, but the opposite. If you are excited for the final book, don't see this movie because it will kill your excitement for Harry Potter. Every character had a shredded role, leaving no emotional connection and everything from the previous films were altered to make a movie with no grasp on what Harry Potter is."
"pvandevelde","4","4","8","7 August 2007"," The actors are good, but the rest...
","Today I went to see Harry Potter 5,<br/><br/>Well, what to say,. After you see a good movie you've got to see a bad one? Lucky it's not the actors who do a bad job, but the book is just so big and the script covers only the absolute basics. This leave HP5 just a collection of loosely coherent scenes and gives the actors very little to work with.<br/><br/>It's normal for a movie to omit some thing from the book that's based on, or even use the book just as a general idea. Unfortunately the Harry potter series is omitting so much that even if you haven't read the book you'll notice that you're missing large chunks of the story. That while each Lord of the rings book is generally thicker that the average Harry Potter book and have got a more complex story, the LOTR movies are more coherent than the HP movies. You'll still notice that some parts are missing, but it's coherent. But this Harry Potter movie will be difficult following when you've not read the book.<br/><br/>So is it a marketing trick to make people buy the books and read them when they've not already done that? Or is it just a signal that the script needed rewriting and the movie a better director. I mean, when Peter Jackson is able to film Lord of the rings, why can't they make a decent Harry potter.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>Pim van de Velde"
"jmguevara17","10","4","8","23 July 2007"," Condensed Version
","I am a great fan of the books and the movies. My favorite movies are Order of the Phoenix and Prisoner of Azkaban. The first two movies are okay, better for smaller children, but seem to be propelled too much by Chris Colombus's simplistic view of the Potter world.<br/><br/>Order of the Phoenix is a great condensed version of the book. When I heard that the larges book was going to be the shortest movie, I was very wary. The Movie, however, eliminates a lot of the not so crucial portions of the book like SPEW. I'm not going to give away everything that the movie is lacking, but most missing portions are not missed at all. I did, however, miss Ron and his Quidich Successes."

Not for lack of acting or special effects, but everything else.<br/><br/>Wish we would've seen more of Tonks thats for sure and while the movie does have a few moments of laughter, they're too few, instead choosing to bore its viewers with dialogue that really didn't lead anywhere interesting.<br/><br/>Its an okay movie, definitely good enough to watch, but brings nothing new and everything, even if you haven't read the books, is very predictable."
"FMACDONALD","8","4","8","12 July 2007"," For A Film Based On A Terrible Book...Not Bad
","I've read the first 3 Harry Potter books. I usually see the movies first then read the books, otherwise I'll just nit pick the movies to death. Just ask anyone that was lucky enough to see any movie based on a comic book with me. My wife on the other hand is a Potter fanatic, and has read all 6 novels and is waiting with bated breath for the 7th and final book to come out.<br/><br/>I was nervous going into this film for a few reasons. The first being that the Potter films have done something most franchises don't usually do, they pulled off 4 great movies in a row. It was only a matter of time before they hit a speed bump. The second reason was I have yet to meet anybody that has read Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix (the 5th book and film in the series) and has had anything good to say about it. Then again most people I know have had Luke warm things to say about the 4th book (Goblet Of Fire) and that turned out to be my favorite of the film series. So was Order Of The Phoenix any good, seeing it was based on what is considered by die hard Potter fans to be a horrible book? Was it better than the last film?<br/><br/>The answer is surprisingly yes...and no. Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix is a good movie for a film based on a bad book, but however it's not as good as the last film (Goblet Of Fire) and the 3rd film (The Prisoner Of Azkaban) however it is better than the 1st film (The Scorceror's Stone. It's as good as the 2nd film (The Chamber Of Secrets) and that's not something to be ashamed of at all.<br/><br/>Like the 1st 4 films Order Of The Phoenix starts out with harry at the Dursley's. His Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudly still hate him and treat him like stuff you'd send down a toilet (actually i think that stuff might be treated batter). He is still troubled by the events in the last film that saw the return of the evil Lord Voldemort, and the murder of Cedric Diggery. He longs for a return to Hogwarts, but sadly realizes that this year at the School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry might not be a good one. The Ministry Of Magic has the people of the magic world convinced that Harry is a liar, as well as Dumbledore, and that Lord Voldemort has not returned, and this is just a cover up to the ""mysterious"" death of Diggery, and just a evil scheme for Dumbledore to try and take Cornelious Fudge's job as the Minister Of Magic.<br/><br/>The lies that have been printed in The Daily Prophet (The New York Times of the magic world) has turned some of Harry's good friends, like Shamus Finnigan, against him and most people believe that he has in fact gone crazy. The Ministry has also launched a full scale investigation into Hogwarts turning the school into more like a prison. In the meantime Voldemort is starting to gather an army, so Harry does the same to try and stop him, leading the School into sort of a civil war.<br/><br/>Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix is a very dark film, and would most likely produce the most scares for small children. Voldemort is still creepy looking as ever and the film has produced the best villain of all 5, in Delores Umbridge (Think Nure Ratchett in pink). It was also nice to see Gary Oldman return as Sirius Black, as well as returning characters ""Madeye"" Moody and R.J. Lupin. Plus once again Jason Isaacs proves why he should play every villain in every movie.<br/><br/>This latest installment sets up for what should be great final 2 movies, and has me eagerly awaiting the next film, Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince, a book which I have yet to hear anything bad about. Then again this is Hollywood, and leave it to them to make a great film based on a bad book, and a bad film based on a great book. For those of you who don't understand what I mean I've got three words for you...The Phantom Menace."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","8","11 July 2007"," By the book
","Those who have read number 5 of the Harry Potter series can see that director David Yates has rendered the events in the book in a faithful and orderly manner in this movie. He has lost no time in setting up the scene, the Order of the Phoenix in earnest preparation against the onslaught of evil and the final showdown between light and darkness not unlike what you see in the Narnia Chronicles. That however will take some time to come, two more movies, to be exact.<br/><br/>In the meantime, there is enough to keep the reader and movie audience interested. At a heavier level, there is the main plot line of Dolores Umbridge (played delightfully by Imelda Staunton), the government's (sorry, a slip, but that will do) agent coming to interfere with the educational process in Hogwart, the mind-struggle between Potter and Voldemont (and this is looking suspiciously like Isaac Asimov at work) through Snape's catalyst, and the final (for this movie) battle, which I think has not been given enough attention (I would like to see more of the action as depicted in the book). Pleasure can also be derived from lighter events such as Potter's magic lessons to his classmates, the episode of the gentle giant Grawp and Potter's first kiss.<br/><br/>There is of course the usual collection of actors a list of whose names looks like a ""Who's who"" in the British cinema scene. Potter's classmates have stayed much the same but Hermione seems to have lost a bit of her sharp edges, as Emma Watson grows into a young lady who can almost be described as sweet and nice. Of the new comers to this 5th installment, Staunton has stolen the entire show. But top-notch actor (I like the gender-neutral word) Helena Bonham Carter is miserably underused as Bellatrix Lestrange. A rookie chosen from over 15,000 girl, Evanna Lynch (who reminds me of wonderful AnnaSophia Robb in ""Bridge to Terabithia""), despite her little screen time, does make an impression playing Luna Lovegood. Unfortunately, moviegoers who wish to find out more about these two fascinating characters will have to resort to reading the book.<br/><br/>Potter fans (which I would imagine make up an overwhelming proportion of the audience) will no doubt enjoy the 138 minutes of competent rendering of ""The Order of the Phoenix"" to the giant screen, despite the fact that it lacks some of the cinematic flare we saw in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban""."
"yuwei-lin","1","6","14","12 July 2007"," Disappointing acting and poor editing
","Compared with Mike Newell's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, David Yates's Harry Potter is such a disaster. Its failure, in my opinion, is due to poor acting and disappointing editing. Daniel Radcliffe's acting is getting worse and worse; his poker facial expression and unnatural body language disengage the audience largely. Editing slows down the flow of the whole film while the acting of the cast is not strong enough to boost it up. I found the appearance of the Chinese woman 'Cho Chang' particularly vexing and unnecessary as well. Harry could have fall in love with other characters such as Ginny Weasley or Luna Lovegood. This Harry Potter simply cannot be more engaging even with Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge and Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange."
"aharmas","10","6","14","12 July 2007"," Much to Praise in This Outstanding Adaptation
","The Potter films have been getting better as they are released. Some of the subtleties that were notably absent from the first two entries are now very much in evidence, and unlike other series, the main actors have developed and grown into more assured professionals; a fact that is remarkable, considering that the young protagonists must hold their own against some classically trained actors. In particular, Daniel Radcliffe is so confident that he owns the screen with visual expressions that allows us to understand the growing pains of the character, his turmoil, and his ever increasing crisis.<br/><br/>Very much in evidence is Potter's frustrations as an intense smear campaign is underway to do everything that is possible to allow Voldermort to raise his armies again. As Dolores Umbridge makes a sensational and devastating appearance at Hogwarts, she manages to censure and stiffle the training of anyone who might lead to instability and support of a possible rebellion. Dolores is an instant villain, a blend of two styles, the solicitous hypocrite who is not afraid to be duplicitous and brags about having two sides. She's a frail old lady with a nasty streak.<br/><br/>The film shows the underground revolution that is brewing at Hogwarts out of desperation by Harry and his close friends. What takes plenty of description in the novel is succinctly presented in the film, as we see the evolution of evil, the dangers of censorship, and the ever brewing nastiness that will come back as Voldemort reappears.<br/><br/>The entire film is exciting and dark, quiet but threatening, and it explodes in all its glory during the last 1/2 hour as good now must confront evil, and Harry faces the demise of another close associate. The film is enhanced by a quiet and insistent score heightening the underground tensions that are part of the Potter world. There are the adolescent yearnings between Potter, Hermoine, and Ron, delightfully played by Watson and Grint. There are some amazing new entries, such as Evanna Lynch playing Lovegood and Natalie Tena, playing Nymphadora. I also appreciated the extra time given to Oldman, Smith, and Gambon, who can now show their characters' details a bit more.<br/><br/>Be ready to do some explaining to the younger ones about what is now happening in the Potter universe, where there is more emphasis on the preparations for the final battles, with some foreshadowing about what might be the final result. Words like prophecies and destiny are now carefully stressed in main parts of the plot. Is Potter going to survive? or Will he lose everything like his nemesis states?<br/><br/>It is a haunting and beautiful film, one that does no disservice to the prose of Rowlings, who has been inspired by other classic pieces, but now has created her own universe, which has now grown beautiful and real in the series of adaptations, the last of which is probably one of the finest and most powerful.<br/><br/>Expect amazing camera-work and special effect wizardry in the last section of the film. It is an instant classic."

"willcundallreview","7","2","3","10 July 2015"," Lots of talking but has it's fine points
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth instalment of our boy wizards adventures and this time, it's getting even more dark. Yes Harry is back again with his magic world right behind him, well actually that really isn't the case here. With the events that took place in the preceding film, Harry is up against seemingly everyone in this movie, and the angst of some of these teenagers is sky high too. I felt the movie is a good one, It's the kind of movie that after 10 times of watching kind of doesn't come off as well, but still is a very worthy watch.<br/><br/>Harry's year at Hogwarts is full of thrills but also a lot of fun, I didn't feel there was enough fighting of sorts or evenly spaced epic scenes, it is mostly confined to the beginning and the end with the middle being the funnier part. That said the fun parts are pretty funny and characters such as Neville Longbottom yet again step it up with Matthew Lewis becoming a regular feature to the gang. This is the first time I feel that Harry doesn't just need Ron and Hermione, he actually needs a lot of his fellow students and it makes it a much bigger film because of it.<br/><br/>The film doesn't go crazy with new additions, but it does conjure up quite a few. The most impressive and absolutely spot on of these is Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge who's annoying persona and very shall we say, unorthodox methods make for a more intriguing character and a hard one to play but done very well by Staunton. Gary Oldman is back in person for this one and he adds to the wealth of the cast, this is the biggest when it comes to showing off British acting talent and really shows it off in a bright light for all to see.<br/><br/>Now David Yates is brought in for this one and although I do think he does OK, I didn't think it was good enough. Now don't get me wrong I know a lot of people like him directing this but his ways are too obvious, the ways in which he makes some of the characters move or talk just seems fake, all in all though he is pretty good though. With Order of the Phoenix being such a huge book, it is a surprise that this is so short compared to what fans expected, but it works in it's favour, it tries not to dwell on certain parts too long and the sustained parts of talking would not have been good made even longer.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the effects used in this movie, the massive scenes are there and the epic scale of the movie and it's budget are plain to see, but it doesn't go over the top with special effects in the middle, creating a kind of movie that doesn't feel well, not real. Nicolas Hooper makes a nice score, it works well because it doesn't contain those sweet snippets of song so often seen in the first movies but doesn't go all dark on us either, he balances it nicely so that the scenes move nicely with the music and long periods of just the score can work well too.<br/><br/>I think Order of the Phoenix is not one of the best Harry Potter's, but does continue it's trend of just being consistent, may not make the book fans the happiest bunch with the amounts cut out, but this film is still as a movie, a fine entry into the franchise. Would recommend it to anyone, definitely one that even though is pretty dark stuff, can still be enjoyed by the whole family and importantly, even the little kids too."
"elshikh4","Null","2","3","30 April 2012"," No Fun !
","When I say, it's dare to say, among (Harry Potter)'s fans that I had no fun watching its series after part 2, it's more or less an unforgivable SIN!<br/><br/>But, honestly, these movies are so dark, dismal, full of talk more than action, and CGI more than drama. This one is no exception. It's another episode of the silly emptiness which cropped millions of Dollars, and still crops.<br/><br/>So what we have here? On the level of the dramatic progress of the series, if there was any, it's where we get to know that (Harry)'s father was bullying (Snape) back when they were young, (Harry) is mentoring the school's students to fight the evil, and (Sirius)'s character gets killed. On the level of drama of this movie apart, it's the speech against fascism portrayed through the character of professor (Dolores Umbridge), the matter of (Harry) seeing what's going on (Voldemort)'s mind, and (Harry)'s first love. So much for the fans, and too little for me!<br/><br/>The trial of (Harry) at the start didn't add anything to anything. The whole idea of the Order of the Phoenix itself, the movie's title, wasn't used well, rather looked unnecessary. The dialogue between the 3 leads was too weak; in fact, saying it so seriously made it even weaker! For no logical reason, (Dumbledore) this round seems nervous, and doesn't hear but himself. The way the twin rebel against professor (Umbridge) was visually good, but not that convincing. There was no relief, unless you think that (Hermoine)'s remark to Ron ""You eat too much"" is a comedy! And then, the dark side, or sides. Mark Adams, of The Sunday Mirror, called the movie ""A dark and delicious delight."", well, I agree on being ""a dark"" only Mr. Adams!<br/><br/>I know, it's not another Disney soft adventure; it's violent, so serious, fantasy. But Disney's or not, I can't bear it. For me, none is fun here. As a visual feast, it left me hungry, not satisfied. As for an action, I deem it not one in the first place, and the present sequences aren't great or memorable. And as a fantasy, it wins with pure imagination, however thrown in only some moments. Frankly, I enjoyed the parts where the old worker was nailing up (Umbridge)'s rules, as if he was nailing in the students' freedom's coffin, AND THAT WAS IT!<br/><br/>Near its end, I lost interest wholly, wanting to sleep as a better deed (actually I yawned a lot till that point!). In general, this movie is as the rest of the HP many sequels: so boring to follow, so dry to entertain.<br/><br/>Finally, other than my admitting that this belongs to the section of ""It's not for me"" movie, this series proves, in a way, that the kid of the 2000s prefers dark stories.

"atresphere","1","2","3","7 March 2008"," Harry potter was just terrible
","Harry Potter And the Order of the Phoenix was just terrible, everything almost EVERYTHING about it was bad. Apart from the last fight scene, the movie couldn't have been much worse. If Hollywood was planning on filming all the books they should have at LEAST kept the same director as the first two. But to me that really doesn't matter at all compared to the real problems it had. In the first to movies, Harry had a good length of hair, in a bowl cut. acceptable. Now his hair is always changing as well as Ron's and Hermione's. Can't it just be like LOTR where their hair is all the same through out the whole trilogy. I mean you can debate the fact that harry is growing up and his hair style is changing but it never changed in the first two movies though.<br/><br/>LOTR grows darker through out the trilogy, we can obviously tell that, that by mount doom everything is at it's darkest, but never really on the DVD covers does the mood change, NO. with HP there is a huge contrast between movies, each movie really shows it's contrast way to much. And I'm not just talking about the font of title of each movie, In part two the title, The Chamber of Secrets was a very bold gold font, now its a disgusting Grey slim front, very different from the others, I MEAN, POTCB never do that, OR LOTR. <br/><br/>The actor acting could be much better two, it sounds as though Hermione isn't really acting but just doing EXACTLY what the director tells her to do. there are lost of other things that i could say that make this movie a bad movie but i won't, cause it's just my opinion. that's all"
"barrettwinans","3","2","3","18 January 2008"," Worst Potter movie to date
","I am a big fan of J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter series. I have read all of the books of series (some of them twice). I am sorry to say that this movie falls far from the mark of what I am used to seeing. The special effects were sub par. The final fight scene in the ministry of magic was mediocre at best. It should have been twice as long and more detailed. The fight started and Sirius was dead in like 30 seconds. I would of liked to see more of him dueling before they killed him off. There was a few high points in this film. I was glad to see all of the original cast back.(minus Richard Harris the original Dumbledore).Also the actress they got to play Delores Umbridge was excellent. If you are planning to watch all the movies in the series than watch this if not don't waste your time."
"nieuwlekkerland","2","2","3","5 November 2007"," Poor Harry Potter. Poor J.K. Rowling.
","Don't get me wrong: I absolutely loved J.K. Rowlings books about the little orphan boy trying to accept his past and his future in a ruff world coated with magic. It is probably exactly that; the care and detail in which Rowling describes her characters, their emotional world and experiences, which have made even the grown ups standing in line for each new Potter release. Naturally it is not easy to reflect the incredibly detailed books in an approx. 2 hours length film. Despite this the first and second movie managed to capture the enchantment the concerning books mediated and the viewers were plunged into the dreams and hopes of Harry Potter and his friends and their adventures in a wizard society located in a muggles world. The third movie reflected the growing pains of HP and the other main characters, which are really the main issue in Rowlings books, very well and managed to spellbind the audience once again. The little children had given way to the young adults they where bound to grow into facing the world as it is, magic or no magic. Still, the movie, and the book, contained a great portion of humor and made it real treat for the public.<br/><br/>But then something happened. With the fourth movie the spell was slowly loosing grip of the audience. Harry Potter was turning into a big time production with a hissing number of special effects smothering the actual story. Suddenly it became all about 'Adventure' and 'Action' and the movie showed uncomfortable similarities like any other big 'young audience' production such as the slaughtered new version of Narnia.<br/><br/>The fifth and latest movie added 'Epic' to its vocabulary. With it, the final bits of magic are diminished to expensive special effects and fast scene cuts. The initial depth of the characters, and thus the story, has now completely vanished, leaving an empty superficial and completely uninteresting shell called 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'. Be ware, might you not have read the actual book, the huge gaps in the movie's story line, because of the o so bad editing, will leave you completely confused and disorientated after less than ten minutes and initiate a frustration for the rest of this 'Action slash Adventure' flick, filled with special effects and combined with 'Epic' scenes and camera slides failing to capture the public.<br/><br/>Both J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter deserve better than this evil treatment of Mr. Yates."
"billyray331","Null","2","3","27 August 2007"," Fantastic
","Usually, if a film series ever reaches a fifth installment, the franchise has long shown strain and popular interest is long gone. 'The Order of The Phoenix' is something of a miracle in several respects. It shows great imagination and no sign of fatigue or lack of ideas despite it being the fourth sequel. This is due almost exclusively to the novel's author. It also offers the audience a delicious peak into the minds of a radically talented writer and director.<br/><br/>A new man behind the camera, and a new man writing the words together tackle a labyrinthine story which is widely considered the most polar of the Potter novels. Some felt it was rich with amazing detail that peered into the young adolescent lives of its heroes. Others felt it was superfluous for the sake of being superfluous. One way or another, David Yates has created one fantastic film! Michael Goldenberg's script has somehow found a way to string together everything that makes the novel so terrific, while also weaving through the multiple bulky elements. He managed to explore certain characters and revelations while dealing with the constructs of film time limits. He condenses story elements wonderfully, but does so in a way that would please even the most die had of Potter fans. This is an Oscar caliber piece of writing.<br/><br/>Director David Yates also brings the best out of the actors, and gleefully dances through what should have been the most difficult film in the series so far. He makes it look easy. Consider the first shot in the film. The camera is perched high above an English suburb on the hottest of summer days. Young Harry Potter sits on an eerily staged swing set and a voice over the radio gives some small detail without too much information. Deep isolation rests in his eyes. We know he is a wizard. We know he can do great things. However, he is stuck in a scene from a David Gordon Green movie. This tells us early on that it won't all be about magic and wonderment, but also this character who is still essentially a kid.<br/><br/>Another scene featuring Arthur Weasley, demonstrates Yates' pure enjoyment with his material. Arthur is escorting Harry to The Ministry of Magic using the London underground. He gleefully steps off the escalator and with wide eyes; he enjoys everyone casually traveling to work. Nothing is said in the scene, but its message of character could not be more clear: he is in love with his surroundings. In Chris Columbus's hands there surly should have been a fake sounding monologue, but Yates assumes his audience is smarter than that.<br/><br/>New cast members also help bring about the very best from the story. Academy Award nominee Imelda Staunton is so perfect as Dolores Umbridge that it is nearly distracting, and Evanna Lynch gets many of the film's laughs as the ecstatically spacey Luna Lovegood. It's still Radcliff's show as Harry, and for the first time in the series he truly commands the screen, depending less on his wonderful supporting cast.<br/><br/>It's true the film is darker and less focused on the magical aspects in Harry's life, but at the same time it perfectly shows his desperation and the uncertainty of some very troubled times. You could say this is an allegory for our world, but that would be cheap. The fans of Harry are growing and so is he. The films in tern are also becoming more adult. There are no longer any of the ""gee, I'm a wizard"" moments, but now they are starting to realize that it will get a whole lot darker before it becomes bright.<br/><br/>The film never snags along the way, and when it concludes 2 hours and 20 minutes after it started, you get the feeling you have seen something great. Too much more, and the film would have been overlong. Removing any more, and it wouldn't have captured the essence of the work. The film finds its rut in a wonderful place of cinema heaven where talent is beaming ever so bright. No longer can the fans have word for word translations into film, but instead they will have to appreciate well planned and constructed movies, this may please adults more than children. 'The Order of the Phoenix' is truly a wonder of film-making, and represents what would be the best Potter film by far, had it not been for Alfonso Cuaron's 'The Prisoner of Azkaban.'"

"bertuzzi4420","7","2","3","31 July 2007"," An activity enjoyed by some.
","*SPOILERS WITHIN!* Spoilers for this movie and books 6 and 7! Although I did enjoy this movie I was dismayed at the brutal changes made within the movie that will impact following movies. Not to go into tiny details I wish to draw attention to two points.<br/><br/>First, after harry is made to make lines the other students in the DA are as well. How can harry show his hand to Scrimgeour with the same fortitude in ""The Half-Blood Prince"" when so many others have dealt with the same punishment. And why was it that Cho Chang was the one that gave them away and didn't become covered in a sneak visage? Second and most importantly, how were Umbridge and her crones able to break into the room of requirement (coincidently how the hell did Hermione know the name of the room when its secret is immense in the books?) and find everyone. In the deathly hallows the students are able to camp out in the room to evade their horrid teachers and aren't able to be followed in. This movie ensures that that plot line will be vacant from the film the deathly hallows.<br/><br/>I anticipated a mild ending with little of the ministry actually shown. I was greeted with what I expected, and it is a good job of the bare bones. What I wasn't thrilled with was the final scene where harry forces Voldemort out of his body/mind by feeling love. Voldemort was supposed to leave harry for that reason without harry knowing. He doesn't really embrace that idea until the deathly hallows. I was also pretty let down by Dumbledore's ""I will tell you everything"" speech. Where was it? I saw that chapter as one of the most important ones leading into the sixth book. An integral part of Harry's character development. But it was gone.<br/><br/>While it was definitely a quality movie, it did disappoint me quite a bit as an avid potter reader. The death of Richard Harris put a black mark over the series as Michael Gambon has no chance of recreating the character Harris put on screen. Harris portrayed the character of Dumbledore as if he were him. Gambon continues to portray an abrasive, thwarted, confused man, which couldn't be farther from the truth.<br/><br/>While it wont happen, it would have been nice to have made books 4-7 two movies each. Maybe then we could remember that this is a book/movie about a school, not just the young kids in it. Where are their school robes (after movie 2 they all started wearing muggle clothing) where's quidditch? A class other than defense against the dark arts? And just after harry gets a reprimand and hearing for using magic in front of a muggle they all decide to fly on broomsticks at sea level? I could continue to go on and on with mistakes and omissions, as is always the case with book movies, but if you can, watch the movie and then read the book. You'll be happier for it."
"jasonkaraipubrown","8","2","3","24 July 2007"," Lost its magic?.... nah i don't think so!
","An entertaining movie from the start, the acting from Daniel Radcliffe this time was much better than the other movies, You can see & feel that Harry has matured more & not only is he dealing with people not believing Vol... (He who must not be named) is back but also trying for the affections of a certain Ravenclaw.<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton is great as Umbridge, down to the little ""hmphf"" of hers. The scene where she slaps Harry! Ouch! <br/><br/>Ron, Hermione, Neville, etc are fine (Luna is great!) but wished there were more development on the teachers & other adult characters (Order of the Phoenix).<br/><br/>The Visual Effects were pretty impressive & the Ministry of magic was what i imagined it would look like from reading the book. The end battle was good but you wanted it to last for ages! <br/><br/>Some people are saying that the movie has lost its magic & wonder. We have been in the Harry potter world now for the last 4 Movies & 7 books & I think the magic is still there but its not taking centre stage this time. We know of the Wizards, Witches, brooms, Spell books, Giants, Owls, Wands, etc & this time its shown as things they use & cope with in their normal lives (for Potter universe that is). Feels like its making it a bit more real.<br/><br/>All in all its a fun entertaining movie, good sequel, with a lot of wonder & some of its magic too!"

Phoenix is my favourite of the Harry Potter books books but I must admit that this movie is my least favourite.<br/><br/>If you are able to judge it as a stand alone film then its not bad but too much was missed out to make it a convincing adaptation of the 5th novel.<br/><br/>Put it this way it was the first movie of the summer that I couldn't wait for it to end.<br/><br/>There are good performances from the usual cast and the characters of umbridge and bellatrix were perfectly cast, dan radcliffe is getting better with age and will probably go on to be a huge star once the potter films are finished.<br/><br/>Oh well will have to wait and see what they do with half blood prince which is more complex than this one."
"wondernat","8","2","3","22 July 2007"," Finally an adaptation worthy of Rowling's name!
","Note: this review is for those who already read the book! <br/><br/>Being an avid fan of the books, I was extremely appalled and disgusted by ""Goblet of Fire,"" a bit entertained by ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" and giggled at ""Chamber"" and ""Stone."" This, however, redeems Hollywood's greed, and is truly worthy to be attached to J.K. Rowling's name.<br/><br/>**Spoilers begin here** The movie begins with the dementors in Surrey, and everything is accurate (except that Harry's patronus didn't materialize - it was just a puff of smoke), right down to Mrs. Figg and the Order members coming to collect him on brooms. Number 12 Grimmauld Pl was a bit weird - I had pictured a mansion crammed inside the little gap between the houses, not a stretch/extension of an apartment building. Nevertheless, they got the creepiness of the Black house. Sirius and Harry's relationship was awesomely done; very caring and paternal. Unfortunately, neither Kreacher nor Dobby have any significant role in this movie, and now I'm particularly concerned as to how they'll convincingly explain the issue of the locket in ""Hallows."" The Wizengamut scene was done pretty well, and every single character (Fudge, Umbridge, Bones, Figgs, Potter and especially Dumbledore) were portrayed flawlessly.<br/><br/>The year at Hogwarts and Luna's introduction was very well made. The thestrals came right out of my imagination. A brief note should be added here that the actress who played Luna got her part down extremely well. It was the Luna we all had imagined.<br/><br/>The D.A. practices were done very well, and Staunton was a fabulous choice for Umbridge. Although she wasn't ""toady"" and fat the way Rowling had painted her for us, she still was extremely good and CREEPY. For those of you who want to see Fred & George's big fireworks bang, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! :D A note on Trelawney: in this movie, it is not clear whether she makes the prophecy, and Emma Thompson hardly has any playtime. Moreover, you never get to know that it was Snape who betrayed the Potters to Voldemort.<br/><br/>For those of you who wanted to see more of the ambiguity of James Potter's nature will be a wee bit disappointed, as Harry quickly finds out about the ""Snivellus"" incident when Snape's legillimency charm backfires when Harry blocks it. As such, the hatred between James and Severus isn't too well explored in this scene, but effective, nonetheless. Also, it is not Hannah Abbott (or whoever it was) who gives the D.A. away, it's Cho under Veritaserum.<br/><br/>Lastly, the battle at the Ministry of Magic was fantastic. The wand fight scenes were very well-choreographed, and Helena Bonham Carter was born to play Bellatrix Lestrange. Even Tonks, who barely had any screen time looked all bad ass. Although Sirius' death was completely different (Bella actually mutters the killing curse), it's quickly overshadowed by Dumbledore's and Voldemort's showdown. Even his possession of Harry was done extremely well, and in that scene, you finally get to see that Radcliffe can act.<br/><br/>Lastly, Grawp makes an appearance, Firenze and his dynamic with the centaurs isn't addressed, but it's an easily overlooked minor detail.<br/><br/>**Spoilers end here** In sum, there were changes, but they were so minor you can't really penalize the producers for it. Yates and Goldenberg did a fantastic job of capturing characters' meticulous details, i.e., Ginny's powerful hexes, Tonks' annoyance of her first name. The movie progressed so seamlessly, it was truly a worthy adaptation. Can't wait to see what Yates and Goldberg will do with ""Prince""!"
"a-wong-1","2","2","3","17 July 2007"," not the best of the 5 but the worst of the 5.
","Now, first of all, I am NOT one of those picky people who expect too much in a movie.. (I found Fantastic Four one of the best movies ever.. and others seemed to have hated it...) but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was not bearable at all.<br/><br/>1. I think that the producers actually counted on the people to read the book before watching the movie. I went with a friend that didn't read the book and she asked me at least 30 questions during the movie; as i have read the book. She got a little annoying but I looked at it from her point of view and i understood that if a person did not read the book, and walked into that movie theater they would sit there for 2 hours or so and not understand a thing.<br/><br/>2. The movie is called the Order of the Phoenix. Not only did the Order have only 5-10 minutes of screen time, they didn't explain at all what the Order of the Phoenix was.<br/><br/>3. They took out about half of the book's contents and put it into the movie. Hagrid only had about 10-15 minutes of screen time and so did Grawp. They also took out the part where Harry and the Weasleys visit Mungo's Hospital. That forced Neville to talk about his parents with Harry which i know that he usually wouldn't do. Also, they left out the part where Harry is published in the Quibbler, so the idea that everybody started to believe him was lost.. They took out a lot more, i am not going to list them all or i would be sitting here for about 30 minutes typing it up.<br/><br/>4. Acting was horrible. Im sorry to the actors/actresses but it was. I think Daniel did okay on Harry Potter. It wasn't bad. but i thought that Emma did a bit worst as usual on Hermione. She lost the clever way that she talked. Rupert Grint was alright, as he always was but there was so little screen time of him. There was almost no screen time of Hagrid, Lupin, Sirius, or Ginny or many other people so i don't know what exactly to say about them. I thought that Luna Lovegood was not bad. She was mysterious and freaky just like the Luna lovegood in the book. Nevile Longbottom was alright too. I thought that Katie did a bad job for Cho Chang. She wasn't the vulnerable Cho Chang that we knew, she was a sneak?! well anyways, i didn't think she was attractive or well played in the movie. I never liked the new Dumbledore either. He never portrayed Dumbledore as the calm, wise, smart wizard. In movies 3-5 he was too jumpy and alive. i did not like dolores umbridge at all. her part is so easy to play but the actress just destroyed it. My friend kept asking me ""she's not evil!"" oh yes her laugh and her ""ahem"" was very well done, but the overall acting was horrible. im sorry but it was. <br/><br/>5. At the end, when Dumbledore was dueling Voldemort, it didn't seem like Dumbledore would win. It was said in the book that Dumbledore could deflect Voldemort's curses with a simple flick of his wand. In the movie, Voldemort almost won! As i've said, the movie was way off the tracks.<br/><br/>6. Now onto the good things. not to sound perverted but the only good part in the movie was the kiss between Harry and Cho. And that wasn't good at all as Daniel hasn't had his first kiss yet. The other part that i enjoyed about the movie was when Voldemort was possessing Harry. It was very well shown how Harry fought him off. and the lines that he said to get rid of Voldemort was amazing. That part caught my attention.. a little too late thought as it was the end of the movie. I also liked the Weasley twin's departure even though some of the drama and the grandness of the it was left out. The visual effects were very well done, but like many other movies, i think that they were going overboard with the effects and that was all the cared about instead the actual plot.<br/><br/>Overall, i think it was not a good movie at all. as I've said before, i am NOT a picky person. I like all movies so if i say a movie is bad, all my friends know that it is REALLY bad. but i give 2 stars out of 10 for effort."

","This movie was not what I had expected, yes , the special effects were good. But i believe that the movie had lacked a proper backbone , because , I , being a BIG Harry Potter fan and have read the books, have come to believe that the audience that has not read the book may not have fully understand this movie entirely. The movie , I believe seemed to be a bit rushed because the plot that was created seemed to end very quickly, hence back to when I had said the movie was rushed.<br/><br/>The acting and special effects was superb but they were only there to satisfy the audience that has not read the book, the audience that has read the book i believe was kind of in disbelief. <br/><br/>Therefore I sincerely hope that the producers of the Harry Potter movies put more meaning into the next Harry Potter movies, not just special effects to take over our senses."

There is significant world-building, new elements to be added to the larger plot, and a satisfying wizardry action. Yet, Order of the Phoenix shines best by its use of character development.<br/><br/>Character development in this film is superb. The audience learns to hate Umbridge even more (great work by Imelda Staunton, btw) and love Sirius Black. We are introduced to just how sociopathic and murderous Bellatrix can be.

"nitro72","8","1","1","5 January 2019"," A Marked Improvement

"ElMaruecan82","7","1","1","26 November 2018"," Hogwarts united against the forces of evil... and oppressive bureaucracy?
","Looking back at the first films, I wonder if J.K. Rowling would have expanded the story so generously hadn't she been carried away by the success of the first books and their respective adaptations; probably getting new ideas with -this time- the cast members in mind and so many vehicles for new CGI ""wizardry"". Her 'baby' was undeniably caught in a virtuous circle and the fifth opus ""Order of Phoenix"" was no exception.<br/><br/>Although this chapter is a bit tougher to follow, it's all to the credit of a writer to be able to amplify such a promising material and make a coming-of-age story over the span of seven books. Naturally, the tone is likely to evolve as the kids approach adulthood and the inevitability of the final confrontation with the forces of evil (""Goblet of Fire"" gave us quite a foretaste). So if the enchantment fades away in favor of more sinister plots and subplots, maybe it's only a way for fantasy to echo reality and the loss of innocence induced by the passing of times.<br/><br/>Neville (Matthew Lewis) who was the butt of many jokes in the first stories, has nothing remotely comical about him anymore and Drago Malefoy (Tom Felton) goes from the spoiled cowardly brat to a dark young man who won't be played for laughs any longer. By contrast, the least blatant changes come from the leading trio whose evolution followed a more natural pace. And here they are in their fifth year at Hogwarts, which means they're pushing to 15, older than their counterparts but looking young enough to be believable teenagers. Eventually, the only one who's still played for laughs is Cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) shell-shocked after an impromptu visit from the Dementors (an eloquent symbolism as the attack is set in a playground).<br/><br/>Yet the tone of this Harry Potter isn't as ""dark"" as it seems, only puzzling. After using a magical spell to put the Dementors away, a mail announces he's been expelled from Hogwarts. I didn't decide to give much weight to that because intuitively, I felt it was only a set-up to a denser story. Even the reaction of Uncle Vernon proved that it wasn't intended to carry some gravitas (I have a chuckle just thinking of Richard Griffith's ecstatic grimace, as if he was holding a seizure). Still, that was a perplexing set-up.<br/><br/>Indeed, why wouldn't Harry Potter be trusted anymore? Wasn't that an obvious case of self-defense? Wasn't the Ministry of Magic overreacting a little? Why wouldn't they believe that You-Know-Who was back? Not to spoil the previous chapter but how did they think that 'incident' ever happened? Harry's judgment made me question the choices of Rowling to insert some comments against bureaucracy and political corruption in her universe, that's a level of maturity I didn't expect especially since it took time for the main plot to take its full shape.<br/><br/>So what strikes in ""Order of Phoenix"" is that new loosely structure tone, combined with several new faces and a storyline that demands a lot of patience and has gotten me lost several times. Obviously, the big shots of the Wizard worlds don't trust Voldemort's return and officially appoint Dolores Umbridge as the new teacher of you-know-what, officiously a ""mole"" determined to whip everyone in line. While she has the traits of Cinderella's godmother, Imella Staunton plays Umbridge as a combo between Nurse Ratched and a caricature of Margaret Thatcher with the pink outfit of Jackie Kennedy. Maybe too one-dimensional to be an endearing villain, she was a scene-stealing presence.<br/><br/>Speaking of the newcomers, there's the unbelievably sexy Natalia Tena Nymphadora Tonks (a name more fitted for a James Bond girl) and Evanna Lynch plays the dreamy blonde Luna Lovegood, a girl who seems to live in her own world and looks strange even by Hogwarts standards. Finally, there's Helena Bonham Carter who makes quite an entrance as the Death Eather cousin of Sirius Black: Bellatrix Lestrange. It's not much the way she looks than what she does in that film that would leave no skepticism about her status as a serious villain. There's a lot to digest in that film, as you can see, but from what I read, the book is the longest of the series, so the task of David Yates was rather Herculean.<br/><br/>And it's no wonder the result feels like such a maze of secrets, traps, chases, escapes and revelations, including a great one about Harry Potter's father, giving him more depth and humanity than the eternal sanctification that started from chapter one. One can easily lose his track in the film but I guess the best way to stay focused is just to follow Harry Potter, he IS the touchstone of the series, and never knows more than we do. Perhaps that's the best thing about the series, we know there are events that precede him, a lot of foreshadowing, but as long as we stay with him, answers will come sooner or later, with style or heavy drama.<br/><br/>Now of course, Harry's not the round little wizard with eyes getting wide after a successful magical trick, his personality has turned into something fully dimensional and far more complex than many franchise characters... he's not the protagonist of a rich universe, he's a universe by himself and maybe that's why he's often inclined to do the job alone, as if he felt his friends shouldn't venture in the same places than he, as if he had to carry alone the burden of being the ""chosen one"". But ""Order of Phoenix"" has this novelty (foreshadowed in the title) that this time, the game gets bigger... so they all work as a team, and not just a trio.<br/><br/>It's all about spreading the wealth and the film has the juice of a thrilling adventure movie, the score that goes with it and the climax that redeems a few little flaws."

","This film feels more like a collage of scenes, a series of puzzle pieces, thrown at the viewers faster than they can piece together, just leading up to a final confrontation. Pacing is a big issue, leaving fans feeling disjointed, and those new to the series confused as to what exactly is going on. As a Hollywood film, it deserves praise, bringing this amazing world to the big screen, telling a compelling tale, and keeping the viewers glued to their seats for the duration of the movie. Overall the continuity of the film felt too rushed and disjointed, as opposed to the more fluid Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of fire. Relationships between the characters felt forced, which I found odd, considering the fact that the cast has been working together for 7 years or so. There were numerous plot-holes which ruin the film for me as well. Despite the flaws, i find this film quite compelling and a pretty good film, and i believe that without the books, this film would have been heralded as a masterpiece. Many critics don't like this film because its not ""accurate"" to the books. As someone who doesn't care about that, i believe the film is a good one deserves to sit in the middle of the pack for me."

","The fifth film in the Harry Potter series, Order of the Phoenix was great cinema. Based on the book of the same name by J.K. Rowling and a script by Michael Goldenberg. David Yates stepped in as the third director of the series (where he stayed until the 8th film) and did a spectacular job. The tone of this installment is a bit darker than the previous, but that's to be expected.<br/><br/>This is also the installment that introduces Dolores Umbridge to Hogwarts; Imelda Staunton plays Umbridge, and does a great job. She makes us hate Umbridge almost more than we hate Voldemort! Eventually, she goes power mad and must be stopped. But how? Order of the Phoenix is very action and drama oriented."

"TheNabOwnzz","7","1","1","26 June 2018"," Like a firmly built bridge in connecting the series, but not very memorable on its own
","While it is a step up from the previous film, the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix still does not quite capture the figurative 'magic' that the first three ( Especially the third ).<br/><br/>In the Order of the Phoenix, like in the first two movies, a lot of the scenes seem to take place indoors and are mostly beautifully lit as opposed to the Goblet of Fire which thrived on digital outdoor backgrounds which mostly looked pretty ugly, and therefore the cinematography is a bit better once again, but still not as good as the sweeping shots of the green plains and mountains were in the Prisoner of Azkaban. Its narrative is, also unlike the first three, not really anything special in this one, as Harry gets falsely accused, keeps having nightmares about you know who ( Which also happened in the Goblet of Fire ), while a corrupt ministry of magic lackey is trying to take over Hogwarts, all in a very linear fashion. There is little of the mystery & surprise that the Chamber of Secrets or Prisoner of Azkaban had.<br/><br/>The camaraderie between the three main characters Ron, Harry & Hermione does fortunately seem to be back, after Ron's weird fits of jealousy and unprovoked anger seemed to come out of nowhere in the Goblet of Fire which severely damaged these ties with the audience. It is also admirable how much better Rupert Grint & Emma Watson have become as actors after maturing with age, although Daniel Radcliffe sadly seems to be stuck on his level, as he could never really pull off the conflicted & angry Harry Potter that he is supposed to be in the Order of the Phoenix. It is less amibitous than the Goblet of Fire, with a lot less new characters being introduced, and on the contrary to its predecessor, most of the new characters in this film are indeed interesting. Especially Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge puts in a phenomenal performance as one of the most hatred-inducing characters ever put to films. Her snobby, arrogant & know-it-all behavior which seemingly cannot be stopped by anyone will make the audience want to gouge her eyes out, which does in turn improve immersion into the film since you want to know her fate. Helena Bonham Carter is also quite the cast for the crazed Bellatrix Lestrange, who embodies her insanity perfectly. Evanna Lynch, while not seemingly such a great actress at this point, is however simply the perfect cast for her character Luna Lovegood as this character is supposed to be quite odd and eccentric in her own way.<br/><br/>The special effects are most of the time well made, with this film featuring another spell-clashing scene, like the Goblet of Fire. However, the forced way of including Voldemort in the later scene of the film seemed to be a bit out of place, and only there to convince the Minister that the dark lord is indeed back and regaining in strength, which furthermore feeds my throughts about this mostly being a filler in the series. Unlike in the Goblet of Fire, the death of a character in this one ( Sirius Black ) does tug at the heartstrings a bit, since in both this film and in Azkaban we create a bond with his character, since his fatherly role to Harry and brilliant performance by Gary Oldman created one of the best characters in the franchise. Which is ofcourse in stark contrast to the previous death of Cedric Driggory in Goblet of Fire who you don't care about so much. However, Harry's denial of Voldemort controlling his thoughts is quite lame ( I have friends and you don't, therefore i have something to live for...., not great writing there ).<br/><br/>While it introduces some good characters and features great camaraderie between its characters and has some emotional connection at the end, the relatively simple narrative and overly politically influenced plot do little to capture that magic that Harry Potter is famous for, and most of the time feels like a filler if nothing else. It will not go down as one of the best in the series, but it is still a solid continuation of it due to the strength of the bonding of its characters."

Nothing is explained. <br/><br/>The only reason anyone would watch this movie is because they are invested in the series. On its own, this movie isn't very good.

"zkonedog","6","1","1","6 March 2017"," Never Fully Captures The Epic Moments From the Book
","Though undoubtedly a bit drawn out, the novel version of ""Order of the Phoenix"" does contain its share of epic moments. I thought that this movie version would be an improvement, as it would be able to separate the ""wheat from the chaff"", so to speak, and keep the action flowing. What actually happens, however, is that the movie never slows down enough to savor those great moments, instead pushing forward relentlessly from beginning to end.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Phoenix"" begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) defending himself at the Ministry of Magic after using a Patronus Charm to defeat some Dementors near Privet Drive. Upon returning to Hogwarts, Harry discovers that the school is slowly being turned into a mouthpiece of Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) with the appointment of Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as a central figure. Soon, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), & Hermoine (Emma Watson) get some first-hand experience dealing with the ""politics of magic"", so to speak.<br/><br/>The film version of ""Phoenix"" is basically a class-A example of a movie not living up to the novel. It is just a little odd for this series considering that all the previous movies were very favorably toward their books' source materials. The trouble here is that director David Yates doesn't quite know when to ""slow down"" and savor the moment (or even what those right moments are).<br/><br/>For example (spoilers ahead)...<br/><br/>-Some very interesting material regarding why Harry must always stay with the Dursleys is completely excised. This was a key portion of the book that really ties up some loose story ends. -Also gone is a very touching ""Weasley is our King"" Quidditch angle from the book. Instead, Grint's Ron is given nothing to do in this one. -Umbridge is treated with a comical air instead of the malice she should personify. in fact, her first appearances in the Hogwarts halls are set to a sort of music video montage totally unbecoming of what her character should be. -The final climactic battle featuring Dumbledore (Micheal Gambon) and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) carries none of the gravitas of the novel (or even lives up to the Potter/Voldemort scenes at the end of ""Goblet of Fire). It just falls flat.<br/><br/>One thing that the movie does get right, however, is spending a least a bit more time (though still far less than the book) rounding out the auxiliary cast. The Weasley Twins (James & Oliver Phelps), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), & Cho Chang (Katie Lueng) get more screen time than ever before, while newcomer Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) is a great new addition to the cast.<br/><br/>Thus, while ""Order of the Phoenix"" isn't a terrible movie by any means, it is the first of the Potter movies to significantly be worse than its source-material novel. Too many key moments are missing, while the ones that do show up aren't allowed to be savored like they should."

","With the end of the last Harry Potter movie (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) being so tear jerking, you should brace yourself for darker themes in this movie. We will lose a most beloved character in this one and be introduced to the most hated person of all time. There is not a soul in this world that doesn't hat Umbridge, in facts in many polls she surpasses Voldemort himself to attain her title of most hated character ever. With the return of Voldemort in the last book things were bound to get tough for Harry but this movie is not about the good versus bad. It's about the love and the effect of war on the people we love. It's a story of the struggle that Harry Potter faces as the boy who lived. It's a brilliant watch like the rest of the Harry Potter movies. It's a must watch movie for everyone. Be sure you watch the previous movies thought to understand it. This movie was suggested by Flickstree site which i think is awesome."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is brought back to school where he faces a possible expulsion after using magic in the real world. Dumbledore (Jim McManus) comes to his defense and soon the two of them are warning people of the return of Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>As I've said in the reviews for the previous films, I haven't read any of the stories so I honestly can't compare the movie to the book. With that said, I did find the previous installment to be an extremely entertaining movie and certainly the best of the series to date. This fifth film is certainly a major step backwards and sadly there are way too many boring moments to make it a complete winner.<br/><br/>Again, perhaps I would have picked up on more things had I been familiar with the book but I personally found the majority of the first half to be quite boring without too many interesting things going on. I honestly thought there was very little character development and I thought too many of the scenes just kept dragging on with dialogue that just wasn't all that interesting or thrilling.<br/><br/>The film does finally pick up during its final act and this is where thing get really good. The final battles almost rival what we saw in the previous film and there's no question that they pack a lot of energy and excitement. They also benefit from some wonderful special effects that really put you in the middle of the action and blend perfectly well with the cast members. Speaking of the cast, a lot of talented actors keep getting added to the series and once again everyone is quite impressive. Regulars like Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and others return to their roles quite nicely and people like Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are of great value."

The Hospital, the strange rooms of the Ministry of Magic, various supporting cast returns and revelations etc. I could not wait. How frustrating it was to hear that we were going to have to wait for 2 years.

I know you can't have everything and it's very hard work the amount of effort that goes into these pictures. But there wasn't even an attempt to even mention large parts of the book. Even the huge, important total series-changing discussion between Harry and Dumbledore was so short and watered down, it might as well have just been left out altogether. The one thing that works is Imelda Staunton's insane performance of Dolores Umbridge, that evil b*tch in the book was executed so perfectly.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""Order of the Phoenix"" had really disappointed me.

"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","22 July 2014"," Arguably The Weakest Harry Potter Film.
","After the truly magical Prisoner of Azkaban & darkly fascinating Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix arrives as the fifth instalment in the 8-film series based on the novels by J.K. Rowling. And while its source material was the longest in the series, the movie is surprisingly short. And not just that, the film in itself is a major step down as the narration & presentation never really clicked this time.<br/><br/>Order of the Phoenix covers Harry Potter's 5th year at Hogwarts where he finds himself rebuffed by most as they refuse to believe his or Dumbledore's account that Lord Voldemort has returned. With the Ministry plotting to keep things under the table & assigning one of their own into Hogwarts' staff, Harry experiences one of his toughest years at the school while The Dark Lord desperately covets a secret weapon he didn't have the last time.<br/><br/>For a while in the Harry Potter franchise, the director's chair seemed just as jinxed as the Defence Against the Dark Arts post for we have David Yates taking over that role from Mike Newell. And Yates direction turns out to be really out of place as the film neither has the darkness nor the excitement of its predecessors. The screenplay leaves out exceptional amount of detail from the story & what's adapted isn't transitioned properly on the silver screen.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are a step down as well in comparison to the previous two chapters, at least. It looks remarkably average in every department, except the performances which I will talk about next. And even the score by Nicholas Hooper doesn't manage to evoke any sort of feeling. Still there are few moments that's well captured & captivating but for the majority of its runtime, Order of the Phoenix remains very stale & adds nothing special to the franchise.<br/><br/>As for the performances, the recurring cast has put their strong foot forward while the new additions are simply amazing. From the recurring cast, Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) & Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) are the standouts. Amongst the new cast, Evanna Lynch is bloody perfect as Luna Lovegood & so is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. And Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge manages to make viewers hate her quite effortlessly.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix has moments of highs & lows and manages to entertain in bits n pieces but it still feels highly inferior when compared to how much the last two sequels contributed to the saga. It was headed for a disaster but manages to correct itself by some extent during its third act. What I love most about it is obviously Luna & Bellatrix and if only the story was as intriguing as these two characters, then Order of the Phoenix today would've been hailed as the series' finest. Unfortunately, it's arguably the weakest."
"OllieSuave-007","6","1","1","24 June 2014"," Needed more of the Order of the Phoenix.
","Based on the book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, this is the fifth film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story where Harry and Albus Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities when authoritarian bureaucrat Dolores Umbridge takes over control of Hogwarts, all the while the threat of Dark Lord Voldemort returns full force. <br/><br/>Like the previous film, this story takes on a more darker tone and tense drama as we see more of the Dark Lord and more of Harry's struggles as his past and his enemies torment him. I think the actors did an OK performance in this one, but I thought Radcliffe overacted in his Harry role somewhat. I do like the Order of the Phoenix concept, which is comprised of a group of wizard rebels whose goal is to defeat Voldermort and his cohorts. The rebels include the brave Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and the unpredictable and crafty Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) - two of the better acting performances in the movie. The rest of the characters were a little bland, especially the Cho Chang character. The supposed love relationship between her and Harry was out of place for this movie, in my opinion, and is one of several scenes that distracted from the main plot. <br/><br/>The special effects were pretty good and the battle between Dumbledore and Snape was the highlight of the film, though, I do wished Dumbledore's powers were showcased more not just in this movie but in the rest of the trilogy, since he is the most powerful wizard of all. In addition, I didn't think the Order of the Phoenix was emphasized enough; they should have showcased the group more and each of the group's wizards purpose in the movie. Instead, the movie focused too much on Umbridge and the Hogwarts students. So, what resulted was another average Potter movie.<br/><br/>Grade C"

","I recently enjoyed ""The Order of the Phoenix"" while watching through all the Harry Potter films without having read the originating books. In a sense, it seems that it might be called ""Harry Potter does political thriller,"" and, as it turns out, Harry Potter does a pretty good political thriller. It means that the intriguing and vast fictional world that these take place in is sufficiently developed that its characters and situations can theoretically be dropped into all kinds of different story and the associated references can be assumed to be understood.<br/><br/>From the outset, and in keeping with plot developments concerning he return of the evil wizard Voldemort, this film is grim an bleak to a degree that its predecessors were not. This dire atmosphere, while not lending itself to the exuberance of the previous films, is evocative in a story involving so much back-room intrigue as the agent of danger and which explores its principles by dwelling so on past pains, especially in Harry Potter's case.<br/><br/>There is a good amount of mainly non-specific political allegory here, in the form on 1984-style manipulation of Harry's school by the reality-denying forces of the Ministry of Magic, and this is all very cleverly done, with rather darkly-humorous developments coming in the form of countless draconian announcements posted on the school's walls. This satirical political theme pairs well with the strain of discourse around Harry's doubt for his own goodness and the message that nobody is ever fully bad -- love and kindness being what redeems him from being like Voldemort. This shows a moral development of the very viewpoint of the series as a whole. Luna Lovegood is a charmingly eccentric new character, blithely unmindful of how she is denigrated by her fellows. Dolores Umbridge treads close to the line of over-the-top caricature but something in the performance brings the unsettlingness of her sweetness-and-light delivery of totalitarianism well.<br/><br/>This film is technically and in all aspects of production as good as its predecessors and the writing too is more subtle and as good if not better. However, in this new grimness it seems that there has been some loss of the sense of fun and wonder that permeated the earlier Harry Potters, making this no less a good movie but a somewhat less joyful one."

","I don't want to do it but I have to talk about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It is the 5th highest grossing movie from 2007 coming in at $292 million. I think we all know why Harry Potter was able to hit such a high number for 2007. Two words...Harry Potter. That's right. The franchise has now hit such dizzying levels that now no matter what author J.K. Rowling hands out it will be bought up and sought out in such high numbers so quickly that there is no stopping its success. This time out in the story we find Harry wrongly accused by the Ministry of Magic. Harry is coming into his teenage years and with that comes angst which even manifests against Dumbledore. Voldemort is stronger than ever and in an effort to squash him out again Harry and his posse of wizards form Dumbledore's Army. Well this leads to conflict as you can well imagine and does not sit well with Dolores Umbridge, the new Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts. With all this conflict around in combination with a 14 year standoff with Lord Voldemort it should be no surprise that all of this leads to a giant wizard face off of good and evil with loads of special effects. Daniel Radcliff along with his companions Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as the three main characters know this material well and their performances are right on par with what is expected. This is also not Ralph Fiennes first time in the ballpark as Voldemort and along with the rest of the cast of characters, they all play their parts with ease and comfort. They all look very comfortable in their skins this 5th time around. A shinning spot is actress Imelda Stauton as the Dark Arts Professor Dolores Umbridge. She is fresh and fascinating to watch. Where the movie lets us down is the script. There are some of our favorite characters that don't get a single word in the film. And shockingly some of the special effects, the ones over London especially, seem like 1970s film-making. I don't blame Rowling at all as she has given the screen writers more than enough material to work with. Because of them the movie is stale and it feels like most of the film is just filling us in on their series rather than making it new for us like the first time.

","I will never understand why studios take popular (in this case WILDLY POPULAR) books, and create movies with scripts that at best dumb down and leave out important details and characters, and at worst, totally eviscerate the plot with an insulting screenplay. This movie falls into the latter category. As a Potter series fan, this screenplay basically says we will throw what is the most commercial money grab--time compressed--second grader appealing film possible and for those who are looking to enjoy what they found most appealing about the books-- Get Bent; we don't care about what made these books so popular in the first place. I've now watched the movie several times over the last year and a half and dislike it more and more. To the point that I would rather not ever see it again. A good example of successful book adaptation can be seen with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. With the Potter films they had a perfect opportunity to have long running, detail dense, faithful adaptations. They even could've split a book such as should've been done here (which Tarantino and others have already proved to be commercially successful). Instead we find ourselves insulted with a half-assed attempt at resembling the source material. The best book in the series is reduced to the worst film. Shameful and one for fans of the books to avoid."

It was nearly all action throughout the whole movie and was very confusing for viewers who had not previously read the book.<br/><br/>I'm very disappointed that David Yates is directing the last three movies, as well as ""The Giver"" which is one of my favorite books. I'm hoping he'll improve in some way, which is doubtful, but what can you do.<br/><br/>-Faith Workman"
"cutigerbaseball24","2","1","1","19 July 2008"," I was disappointed by this movie
","I was really disappointed by this movie. I understand that the producers, screenplay, director, etc. cannot fit everything from the books into the movies. However, i thought that it was a little ridiculous that the longest book in the series (870 pages) is the shortest movie to date. I also believe that they took out a lot of important things in this movie (For example, what about the whole chapter The Lost Prophecy in the books, that scene was almost taken out of the movie all together-And it was a very important chapter in the book and for the movies, what about st.mungo's? things like harry fighting malfoy? what about giving actual justice to the department of mysteries-explaining the love room, the brains, going back to the time-turners, things like the end scene where Fawkes jumps in front of the killing course for dumbledore?). I know that I have very big expectations for the movies, but I really think that with this movie they really made a great mistake in taking out so much from the books. They are not really explaining much in the movies and I think that this makes the audience confused, those who have not read the books, and also endangers the understanding and completion of the next two books. And just a quick question: Why did they change the screenwriter for just this movie, but have Steve Kloves writing the script for the rest of the movies? It seems that the people behind this movie are always concerned about a budget and such, yet they make more then enough money to make 14 films, not seven. Honestly, I don't think that anyone would complain if the movies were five hours long. I thought that a positive of the film was the acting by, Helen Bonham carter, Gary oldman, and especially Jason Isaacs-those three actors I think do brilliantly in the film. As for Michael gambon, he is a terrible Dumbledore. Two more things, why did they change the appearance of Padfoot (Sirius as the dog) and the dementors? And who the hell is this nigel we introduced in the fourth film, they could have just stuck with the Creevy brothers."

","I'm crazy about the Harry Potter books, which can make my comment a little bias, since the book is usually better than the movie. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite Potter book and my least favorite Potter movie. I hated the pace of the movie. It tried to give the audience too much information at once. I was able to follow since I have read the books, but my friends and my family who haven't read the book did not understand much. I believe that the director is the very important in a film, because if the director sucks so does the actor. David Yates is not horrible but I don't think he has a great idea about the Harry Potter world. To me Harry Potter is much more magical and deep. I also think that the movie is way too dark. I understand that the book is also dark but this was just unpleasant. The adult actors were all amazing as usual, especially Umbridge. Daniel Radcliffe is not bad, neither is Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.<br/><br/>The film is annoying if you are a Harry Potter fan, because it does not capture the 5th book. I was very disappointed, but there is still hope for the next ones."
"tanweth","2","1","1","23 December 2007"," By far the worst of the Harry Potter movies
","Yes, the acting was excellent. Casting of Umbridge was excellent. The special fx likewise excellent.<br/><br/>But acting, casting and fx do not make a movie.<br/><br/>This movie can not stand alone and be enjoyed. If you haven't read the book(s), then the movie will make very little sense to you. It's disjointed, choppy, with little or no continuity, and simply doesn't make much sense.<br/><br/>For instance, the opening scene with Harry and Dudley was about the longest scene in the entire movie. Yet, there was nearly no follow up later in the movie as to how and why it happened.<br/><br/>The capture of the DA members made no sense either, unless you hadn't read the book. Then the means of entry into the Room of Requirement used in the movie is OK.<br/><br/>Or the veil in the ministry. What was that about? (You want to know, go read the book.) The betrayal of the DA breaks the continuity between Harry and Cho from previous stories and future references & possibilities.<br/><br/>Then, of course, what was the purpose of the DA in the first place? Wasn't it due to the OWLS? So was the DA successful or was it a failure? The last scene with the DA and Umbridge seems to say it was a failure.<br/><br/>Okay, so the biggest book of all is crammed into a short movie barely long enough to give the Reader's Digest version. Even so, the liberties taken in the movie, the choppy nature of the movie and the lack of continuity leaves this viewer cold.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that this director was going to be making the next movie as well. If he does, I will certainly wait until I find out if he botched the job again before rushing out and seeing the movie."
"phasermuse","6","1","1","13 December 2007"," No magic, no fun
","I saw HP and the Order of the Phoenix when it opened in theaters last year and now I have just finished watching the DVD of the film. I found the film quite disappointing. The script and the direction reminded me of old TV series. The ones where everyone stands around while the main character carries the load. Yes, there are fine actors in the movie and I am thankful for the few lines they spoke. This far down on the list of comments, I don't imagine anyone will be reading my remarks so I can babble on for a bit.<br/><br/>Many of the previous comments were disappointed with Michael Gambon as a substitute for Richard Harris. When he appears in the third film, I too, was disappointed because Richard Harris made an indelible impression as Professor Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is, however, a fine actor and I soon got past rejecting him as the Professor. There is a lot to ponder if (though unlikely) a viewer has not read the book(s). The editing was a bit jarring, but then I remember the book was difficult. It is the pivotal book in the series and the characters, who after all, are the most important part of the tale were not presented with any imagination and I did not get a picture of a young person moving closer to the age of serious and (frightening) responsibility. <br/><br/>I love Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling wrote a remarkable series. I dread that the same people are involved in the making of the Half-Blood Prince. I would have liked the films to live up to the books. Not that I expect word for word. Nothing like that. Just the marvelous revelations that took us with Harry Potter and company on the wonderful quest for adulthood."
"skallisjr","8","1","1","13 December 2007"," Complement to the Book
","Those who read the books first may be disappointed in the film. Those who haven't may be puzzled by some of the plot. But reading the book first makes some of the action in the film more understandable.<br/><br/>For starters: the dementor attack and what led up to it in the film came nowhere near what was in the book. More important, the aftermath of the attack just had the Dursleys learn that Harry apparently had been expelled from Hogwarts, and were absent to take Dudley to the hospital, never being told that Harry had to stay in the house when away from Hogwarts until his 17th birthday. Nor, to jump to the end of the film, did the Order members confront the Dursleys on how they were treating Harry.<br/><br/>Naturally, a book as long as ""Order of the Phoenix"" has to be truncated to squeeze the results into a 2.5-hour film. Yet some of the action would be just perplexing to those who haven't read the book. For example, it's been established that the vast majority of Hogwarts' students cannot see Thestrals, yet when Luna suggests that they can be used for transportation, there's no point of awkwardness (as in the book) where some of the students with Harry don't know how to mount invisible critters.<br/><br/>A critical event in the Harry Potter saga was when Harry gets one of Snape's memories while he was studying Occulimancy; however, in the film, *why* he was studying the discipline was a tad vague.<br/><br/>The basic thrust of the film plot is close enough to the book for transition to that of the book so that there can be a reasonable move to the next year's story (""Half-Blood Prince"").<br/><br/>Having said all of the above, the film is reasonably good in imagery. Visually, my favorite scene was Harry and the Order folk flying by broomstick to London and along the Thames after dark. I suspect the magical duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort was added for visual effect, but it was a little long.<br/><br/>A nice view, but better viewed after reading the book."
"tonyjackie","7","1","1","9 August 2007"," Another entertaining addition
","The fifth film in the Harry Potter series was always going to be the one that could have been a problem in my opinion.I say this because the book 'Order of the Phoenix' was very long and there were parts of it that were drawn out too much although it was still a good read.I am happy to report that I feel that the film makers got it just about right with what they left out of the book and left in the film.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with the plot as you probably know it already.Needless to say,the special effects are very good and the final face off between Lord Voldemort and Dumbledore is very well done and creates just the right level of tension and,importantly,it isn't overblown to the point of being ridiculous.The story flows pretty well although some of it does seem a little rushed at times.<br/><br/>Acting wise,Daniel Radcliffe gives his best performance yet as Harry.I also felt that Emma Watson was back to her best as Hermione.Rupert Grint wasn't really given that much to do to be honest and the same applies to Emma Thompson,Brendan Gleeson,David Thewliss,Alan Rickman,Julie Walters,Maggie Smith and Ralph Fiennes.It must be said that they are all very good with what they had to do.As for the newcomer's,Imelda Staunton scored as Dolores Umbridge and clearly had a ball playing her.Young Evanna Lynch does well as Luna Lovegood although she didn't always convince.Helena Bonham Carter makes a great impression as Bellatrix Lestrange but she only appears late on.I do feel that the best performance came from Gary Oldman as Syrius Black.He really seemed to become the character and I was impressed with the way he acted with just his facial expressions.He was very good in this,just as he usually is.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining movie in it's own right and keeps the epic tale of Harry Potter ticking along nicely."
"robmad7","2","1","1","19 July 2007"," Absolutely terrible
","I am a huge Harry Potter fan and had a lot of expectations coming into the theater tonight. Wow. When I left I felt angry and disappointed. I disagree with everything the director chose to do with this movie. Besides from the content omitted from the book that I think was crucial to having the story come alive with the detail that makes J.K. Rowling's series so fantastic, the whole feel of the movie was unlike any of the others. The hand held camera scenes were as distracting as the unnecessary flashes of excessive light. The swooping in scenes with newspaper headlines was pointless and hard to watch. I did't want to feel like I was on a roller coaster while trying to read a magazine (my sentiments towards the whole movie really), I wanted the director to put me in a magical world on the verge of a war. Instead, I was forced to watch Hogwarts lose some of its zeal in favor of the director's personal whims and license with the superb text of The Order of the Pheonix. Overall, I found this lackluster and a supreme failure given the story that it was trying to display. I hope the next movie deals with the book and story more than ease of writing in special effects and 'cool stunts' that are not in the book. A terrible chapter in an absolutely phenomenal series of both books and movies."
"thelawrences","2","1","1","17 July 2007"," like sitting under a cruciatus curse
","OK, I simply cannot understand all the glowing reviews! ""Separate the movie from the book...""????? Why in the world should someone have to separate a movie from the very book upon which it was supposedly based???? The reason I went to the movie was to see the things I loved about the book - except I didn't get to see them.<br/><br/>OotP has been my favorite of the books (except for perhaps the first one), and the majority of the stuff that made it so great was left out of the movie - or changed so drastically as to make it unrecognizable. Now, I'm the first one to admit that things must be cut in order to make the switch from book to movie, that's just the nature of things. But to take the very scenes that make the book special is just stupid - Fred & George's swamp, Umbridge supervising Harry's career counseling with McGonagall, Marietta with 'sneak' blistered across her forehead (in fact, they left Marietta out entirely, making Cho the villain), the fabulous chase through rooms in the ministry of magic before the battle scene, etc, etc. They did nothing to show how the 4 houses united with the teachers against Umbridge, nor did they show how fabulously the Room of Requirement was prepared for DA.<br/><br/>And on top of leaving things out, things were changed for no apparent reason at all. Harry & Dudley's confrontation occurs in an alley alone, not in the park with Duddikin's friends. The walk home is through the streets of suburbia - not a field of cheatgrass. Harry's patronus is supposed to be a fully formed stag (which is mentioned in the movie) but we don't see it - instead we see a wisp of cigarette smoke chase off the dementors in the tunnel (again, not an alley...) Why the changes? It wouldn't have made the movie any longer to make it the right way.<br/><br/>The movie was crap - I could have written a better screenplay - and I am *very* disappointed with Rowlings for allowing it.<br/><br/>Not only did I have to suffer through all this, the acting was sub-par in this movie, except perhaps by Helena Bonham-Carter, who was excellent."
"Criswell75","9","1","1","15 July 2007"," One of the best Potter films yet
","I wasn't sure whether slightly inexperienced director David Yates could pull it off; after all, he is an unknown. I wasn't sure whether I would like such a short movie adapted from such a long book. Granted, the movie could've been a little better, but I was satisfied with it, and by the end, I was ready to see it all over again.<br/><br/>""Order of the Phoenix"" is not like your typical Potter film (even the book is not exactly like your typical Potter story). It has emotional action, rather than physical action. It must have been daunting for the filmmakers taking on a project known for Quidditch matches and turning it into an emotional tour de force. The result: the most powerful Potter film made. I had never been exceptionally impressed with Daniel Radcliffe as an actor, but in this film, his acting commanded my respect and sympathy. He brought the distraught teen right from Rowling's pages to the cinema screen.<br/><br/>I must also comment that Nicholas Hooper's score for the film is one of the best in the Potter series, nearly rivaling John William's. Much livelier and gripping than Patrick Doyle's in ""Goblet of Fire"".<br/><br/>I liked how ""Order"" dealt with some of the teenage angst as well, such as love, emotional strife, and fighting. This film definitely did not overly focus on special effects. I was glad that there were a few comedic throw-ins here and there (most notably, Kingsley Shacklebolt's punchline to Cornelius Fudge).<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton was nearly brilliant, and her portrayal of Professor Umbridge was disgustingly delicious. I certainly hope she is nominated for an Oscar for this performance. In the book, I hated Umbridge passionately, but Staunton actually made me want to see more of her. That might be my only small complaint about Staunton: I didn't hate her character as much as when I read the novel. A great acting job, though, nonetheless.<br/><br/>Visually, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is stunning and beautiful, making Harry's world inviting. The headquarters for the Order, #12 Grimmauld Place, though, was not as seedy as I had imagined. I also preferred Alfonso Cuaron's version of the dementors in ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" than the ones in this movie.<br/><br/>Those hoping for some action will not be disappointed. The battle inside the Ministry of Magic is exciting, and the special effects here are incredible.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a treat for fans of the movies: it has a great action sequence, as well as an emotionally-driven plot that ""refined"" cinema lovers will accept. Yates and the crew should be commended for taking such a hard book to adapt to theaters and making it into such a fine picture. My only complaints are that the beginning was lacking something (I can't put my finger on it) and that Michael Gambon needs to stop being an angry Dumbledore (gosh, how I miss Richard Harris!)There were also some plot details that weren't addressed in the film, including something important about Neville, and the story was a little rushed. And Nearly Headless Nick needs to come back, even if it is only visually. I look forward to seeing more of this cast, especially Radcliffe, Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) and Evanna Lynch who played a likable, but strange, Luna Lovegood that fans of the books should appreciate. I hope Yates can refine his craft and make an even better film out of the 6th book... I can't wait."
"RCWjr","8","1","1","15 July 2007"," Older and even darker
","I thought the last two installments of the Potter films had been dark, but none, to include the fan-favorite 3rd film, has been this dark or this good.<br/><br/>I have seen many paid-critic reviews that are negative, asking where the ""magic"" had gone. Where the wonder had gone. Hello, but Harry is now in the years when childhood innocence has been replaced by teen angst. Harry is finding Hogwarts, and life in general, darker and more complicated; where friends are harder to find and enemies seemingly around every corner.<br/><br/>The character study this time around in regard to Harry is captured beautifully by Ratcliff. His acting talent has grown and matured through the years/films. A lot of the interacting between the three leads can be attributed to director David Yates. There is not as much fantasy this go around. In its place is a lot of drama, drama that comes with getting older and drama from the dangers that exist for Harry. Yates has brought about a reality in all the fantasy and it is exhibited the most (and best) in the relationship between the three leads.<br/><br/>Finally we get to see Dumbledore in action and he shows why he is the headmaster at Hogwarts. Also, we get more of Snape this time around, to include more back story on him. Both of these characters have been dismissed in the movies, in my opinion. Luscious Malfoy is more of a presence, again, something I have longed for since he was introduced in the 2nd film. Draco continues to be a throw-a-way character, but more so than any of the films since the 2nd, characters that I actually have been intrigued with are finally being fleshed out and/or given more time. <br/><br/>You can't throw praise to the film without mentioning Imedla Staunton's ""Deloris Umbridge"". Her character is fantastic! She makes you want to go through the screen and shake the pink out of her! <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes' Voldermort has about as much time as he had in Goblet of Fire. I can't wait to see him get even more time in the upcoming chapters. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved Evanna Lynch's wispy ""Luna Lovegood"". Her character, in my opinion, has more of a spark on screen with Ratcliff's ""Harry Potter"" than the one being forced with Katie Leung's ""Cho Chang"". Lynch and Ratcliff, to me, seemed to have far more chemistry than anything shown between he and Katie Leung. I am not familiar with the books, so I am not sure how these relationships are handled, but on film, to me, there is just no chemistry going on with Harry and Cho but overflowing between Harry and Luna. <br/><br/>Of all the films, I think this one probably requires a more vested interest in the characters. If you do not care for them, then all the goings on will be a bit boring to you. There isn't as much action or whimsy to entertain. Instead, there is a deeper understanding and reflection on Harry and his struggle with the mantle he was born to ascend to. For those not interested in that, this chapter may not be to your liking.<br/><br/>Great job, can't wait for the next chapter."
"zhypesmooth","9","1","1","13 July 2007"," Best One Yet: From the Acting to the CGI
","I am an avid fan of both the Harry Potter books and movies, and therefore I have quite a bit of experience in the world of Harry Potter when I say this: This is the best Harry Potter movie to date. On thing that David Yates seems to get that none of the other directors did is that the movie is ABOUT THE KIDS, how they interact, discover the miscarraiges of justice in the world, and make decisions based on who they are becoming as people. All in all, the best part of this great film was the acting from the kids' end. Student who have had fairly prevalent roles in the books finally got to exercise some sort of emotion, a notion that has been lost in the other movies due to a need to cram as much plot line in as possible. Finally, David Yates figured out the secret: Make a MOVIE out of Harry Potter, trim down the plot, create good and bad, and allow that actors to act and make a movie out of it, with special effects laying the foundation for the magic that they create. The film captured all of this deftly.<br/><br/>Another thing that I absolutely loved about this movie was the fact that it was done so artistically and with so much thought to reality. Even in the second best movie in the series (Prisoner of Azkaban), there was nothing that chained the story of the Harry's tragic life to the real world. This movie uses acting, costume design, set design, and especially camera work to make this REAL. One of the best moments in the movie was the whole opening sequence. Dudley was a true bully, not this caricature of some fat kid throwing 12 year olds into trash cans. The unsteady cam shots were perfect for the action sequences in real life, and yet they were properly NOT used for the magical dueling, which was the magical part of the movie. Yates created general contrast in this film, which makes it more like a movie with a plot line and less like a book on the screen.<br/><br/>All of this being said, there were serious portions of the plot line that were mangled in an attempt to trim the text, which was as thick as a California Redwood, though I loved every page. Some of the things that really bothered me were the absence of Sirius's two-way mirror (a hint for its true 'importance' in book 7?), Kreacher's whole plot line, and the lack of real animosity between Snape and Sirius, an element which, in retrospect, would have made the movie reallllly good. Hermoine's whole SPEW thing, for those of you who read the book, was a load of crap, and I'm glad they didn't include it. I was very pleased with the Occlumency scenes, as well as the whole Umbridge element and character (Immelda Staunton was positively BRILLIANT). As I have said, the best part of the film was the acting; the kids were great, and obviously the adults were spectacular, as Harry Potter is an excuse for practically every incredible character actor in Britain to get some easy money for fun. The kiss was frankly well timed and not awkward at all, all in the name of fun, and I really liked how the camera would pan to Ginny's contorted face every time Cho was mentioned (sorry for the spoiler, I found it amusing). Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the best Potter film yet, from top to bottom, and it Definitely did a good job of leading into the next film with that subtle feeling of growing hopelessness, as is conveyed so effectively in the book. 9 out of 10 stars... Bravo David Yates"
"trailstalker-1","1","14","43","19 July 2007"," I'm so very disappointed in this movie. It SUCKED.
","I am a fan of the series, both book and movie, and am incredibly disappointed in this movie. I was ready to walk out 15 minutes into it, but stayed hoping it would get better. It never did.<br/><br/>The director didn't seem to realize that HP is 'high fantasy' and went for a more contemporary 'realistic' style. BIG Mistake. It took the magic out of it and left nothing to enjoy - a shell of the series former glory. And I'm sick at heart to see that he's been rehired to ruin the next movie, The Half Blood Prince. It's a shame.<br/><br/>The movie is choppy. I don't know how anyone who hasn't recently read the book would be able to follow it. The script flat and boring. How anyone can make a flat/boring script from such wonderful original material is beyond me, but they managed it. The acting is not even close to the performances that have been turned in in the first four movies. It almost felt like they were phoning it in ... and not just one of the characters, but all of them ... with the exception of Fred and George (who I adored) and Umbridge (who I detested). I really missed being able to get 'inside' the movie with the characters and the magic. They never stayed in one place long enough to connect.<br/><br/>The camera work is all about 'weird angles and jumping around'. They have totally changed the flavor of the series ... and it's not a change for the better. It's not a matter of it getting darker, it's a matter of totally changing the style to something that does not fit within the entire body of the story from Book One/Movie One through to the end).<br/><br/>If TPTB are listening in, PLEASE dump this current director and go back to the one you had before (ANY of the ones you had before would be better). I would be a shame to ruin the rest of the series the way this movie has been butchered.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time or money on this one. Reread the books and enjoy the first 4 on DVD."

Perhaps another viewing will be more forgiving though."
"canvasassassin","1","5","12","26 July 2007"," I would have rather eaten crap right from the butt of a goat!
","I am a wholehearted, titillated Harry Potter fan. The first four movies were AWESOME! I have watched them over and over again. I have read all the books more than once. The Harry Potter series is without a doubt hands down the best literary series I have ever read. The movie adaptations of one-four were AMAZING, Great adaptations! All the actors were great as usual!<br/><br/>This fifth piece of crap was a waste of time and money! one of the worst book adaptations I have ever seen, worse than Misery! I understand that The Order of the Phoenix is a very long and detailed book, but for the love of Potter man, this movie SUCKED! I would have rather stood in line for an hour and paid ten bucks for someone to throw warm haggis in my face and then punch me in the ear.<br/><br/>It would have been nice to see a lot of scenes the way the happened in the book, Especially the final showdown in the Ministry of Magic. That wasn't even close. What was all that stuff that never happened in the book doing there. It was like watching some bad soap opera. <br/><br/>I pray David Yates can redeem himself on The Half Blood Prince, I'm doubtful.I can only hope for the love of the free world he is not directing book seven.This is not BBC T.V. it's a major motion picture. Michael Goldenberg needs to get a job doing something else, obviously he doesn't have the skill for adaptation and thats being nice. Steve Kloves however did a great job with the first one so I have full confidence in him adapting the sixth book.<br/><br/>So unfortunately for me my Harry Potter DVD series will be short movie number five, which doesn't even deserve to bear the Harry Potter name, because I won't spend a dime on that rubbish. Maybe I'll find it in the trash so the collection will look complete. I'll be using the disk for a reflector to keep the Deer out of the garden."
"Lea-Ralic","1","5","12","19 July 2007"," Who are you and what have you done to the plot?
","I have just come home from the premiere of the movie in Croatia, and i must say that this is a huge disappointment. No, huge is not the word - enormous.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that the movie was so incredibly boring that people actually amused themselves by making fun of it aloud (which as we all know can be extremely irritating when the movie makes any sense) - and the whole theater laughed with them. Just to show that i'm not the only one to be incredibly disappointed.<br/><br/>Before I get to the complete butchering of the plot, which deserves full attention, there are a few things i would like to say about the acting. I'm quite curious regarding the techniques, really - i mean, have they actually shoved brooms up their arses? Neither Harry, nor Ron, nor Hermione were anywhere near portraying their characters truthfully. Dumbledore was even stiffer, and Voldemort looks and acts like he is there for no apparent reason. Loona a.k.a. Evanna delivered the most credible performance, but it was crippled by her most-of-the-time-brainless dialog. Umbridge's main characteristic in the film was that she wears a lot of pink, which should say enough - however Imelda is not to be fully blamed for that, it's the script.<br/><br/>Back to the plot - or better, what's left of it. They managed to cut 90% of it out, and completely change the 10% they dealt with. When i started writing this comment i was prepared to write about everything that was left out, but i had since realized that it would be useless, seeing as it definitely wouldn't fit in the 1000 word maximum. I just keep remembering more and more of the very important parts they left out, and i just keep wondering how could anyone who hasn't read the book understand anything? They could have at least left the parts important for the future plot, but they decided on making the CGI team sweat a little more, and extended the mediocre action and flight scenes. The scenes changed much too fast, the lines weren't at all witty or funny (they didn't even try), and the in-between scenes with the articles from the Daily Prophet which are supposed to explain some things only make it that much harder to understand. The character development is virtually non-existent - even Harry seems shallow 2D and (i quote) ""with an emotional range of a teaspoon"". <br/><br/>There are a few thongs about this movie worth mentioning. Alan Rickman is the embodiment of Snape, and the CGI team did a pretty good job, and they paid a lot of attention to interior design and details. Music is amazing, as always, and really serves to put you in the mood - but the film is so boring that the mood soon turns to snoring. Loudly. <br/><br/>Seriously, if you've read the book(s) try to refrain from seeing this blasphemy. Just remember how you imagined it, how the story formed inside your own mind, and how the world of Harry Potter looks like to you. We all have different ideas about it, and it's important that they stay different - that is the beauty of books after all. It was a (good) book before it became a (bad) movie, after all."

Instead, it's like watching a rehash of previous Potter subplots, previous ingredients stirred into a new stew leading to a climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort that ends in a blaze of fireworks.<br/><br/>But the few ""big"" action scenes, while well staged with all the CGI effects bound to please the Potter fans, are hampered by a rather dull and listless storyline that has Potter looking at the dark center within himself as he plots how to avenge the dark forces trying to destroy him. And even the humor that is usually so much a part of these films is lacking, probably because EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT have so little do do with the main action.<br/><br/>But as a consolation, there are some striking performances, especially IMELDA STAUNTON as the overbearing and strict disciplinarian who injects a lot of humor into her wickedness. The film is fortunate to have her in a key role. Not much can be said for EMMA THOMPSON and MAGGIE SMITH who speak no more than a few lines, but ALAN RICKMAN and GARY OLDMAN at least have much more to do in supporting roles. Even the main villain of the piece, RALPH FIENNES as Lord Voldemort, has little actual screen time.<br/><br/>One big ingredient the film has going for it is the background score by Nicholas Hooper which gives zest to the action scenes and the proper mood to all the dark sequences--of which there are plenty. Some of the sets are richly detailed and atmospheric, but too much of the photography takes place in the dark.<br/><br/>Summing up: A so-so chapter in the Potter series. Hard to see why this one is proving to be such box-office gold when the story is less than satisfying."

"Gordon-11","Null","4","9","14 July 2007"," A delightful and gripping transformation of a boring book
","This film is about The Order of Phoenix, that was revived to fight against the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>I found the book really boring, tedious and full of unnecessary anger, so I was expecting a film that was similar. I am glad to report that I was wrong! The film adaptation is absolutely delightful. The pacing is right, the scenes are full of colours and magical happenings. The jokes are great, and gets the whole cinema giggling. The visual effects are stunning, especially the scene featuring moving terraced houses. I am also glad about the fact that Harry's anger is toned down a lot. Dolores Umbridge's character is so annoying, which means that her character development is excellent! Luna Lovegood is actually adorable in the film. I find this adaptation very enjoyable, and it is much better than the book!"
"girlzaggressive","9","4","9","13 July 2007"," The most interesting out of the five
","The most interesting so far.<br/><br/>The film has its fair share of symbolism, which helps when a lot of scenes have to be left out, so script writers has done a good job.<br/><br/>Special effects are great and the most realistic so far. Big scenes and environments that are made by computer exceeds my expectations.<br/><br/>Actors for new characters are well chosen, especially for Luna's role.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter"" fans will probably miss a lot of scenes that were in the books, but if you remember how everything developed in the book, you can just add or alter the scenes in your mind. As for those, who haven't read the book, they won't miss a thing and so will avoid annoyance that comes watching all screenings of the books that we read. The film will be more enjoyable if you leave the comparison to the book for after the movie.<br/><br/>One more thing I liked is that director made the whole Potter world more real and wizards, despite their magic and great stunts, are more human, than in other films, which were more fairy tales than dramas.<br/><br/>All in all, this is really worth seeing, however, for small children it will be hard to understand or even not interesting as I doubt they would enjoy or understand the book."
"HKKBubble","6","4","9","11 July 2007"," Some better than others
","I, like many others, are a huge Harry Potter fan. I read the books over and over again, check mugglenet whenever I can (which is always), see if there are any updates on JK's site, and see the movies first thing I can. I have read many reviews saying they absolutely loved it but I have to disagree. It was a mere disappointment to me. They had the longest book to create into a movie and made it the shortest of them all. They left out a lot and what they did put in they could have added more. I wished they would have put more into Snape's Worse Memory, and not have rushed the beginning.<br/><br/>They did do a wonderful job in casting, though. Luna was fabulous, they described her as having a dreamy voice in the book, and they nailed it in the movie. Bellatrix was exactly how I pictured her, although her high cheek bones do scare me a bit. Tonks was beautiful and she was in fact my favorite character.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie may be worth paying the ten dollars to go see it but don't get your hopes up to be seeing the best movie ever."
"kudos4kkms","8","4","9","11 July 2007"," Something Wicked This Way Comes
","Ask any long running television series cast how the show differed from beginning to end and they will all have the same answer: character dynamics. This movie was a reflection of just that. We have seen, since the first movie, these three actors become closer and more aware of the other's acting styles. In this film, that awareness shines through magnificently. We see comfortable actors. No longer are they the children we saw in the first few movies that seemed to be thrust together, acting hard to create false relationships. We see dynamics, people working off each other, people settling down into their magical niche. This allowed--of course--for the magic, that was intended to flow through every scene, to explode like Fred&George's firecrackers. The movie, itself was quite extraordinary (as it should be), packed full of priceless characters portrayed by uniquely successful actors (i.e. Imelda Staunton as Umbridge) and special effects that will have you cowering in your seat. 'Phoenix' delves into the dark side of this magical world and presents the evil that lies within both the main villain and the hero himself. Radcliffe does an impressive job during his scenes of intense pain and scrutiny, truly leading you to believe that he is suffering. Yet all of his efforts to seem shut off from the world are outshone by the lovely youngster Evanna Lynch who plays the aptly nicknamed 'Loony Lovegood'. Her melodious, vacant voice adds perfectly to this misunderstood character. Without anyone's knowledge it was this little part that kept the audiences intrigue, wondering when she would show up next. I'm much looking forward to seeing her in the next films. To end I say: David Yates' love for minimalist acting and staging paid off in these scenes, capturing the inner characteristics of each person in the movie (ex. After the Cho Kiss) and it also allowed for every battle and high tension moment to double in its hysteria and panic. I applaud this movie and I much enjoyed it."
"poojucu","8","4","9","11 July 2007"," Good movie, but it could have been so much better
","The fifth movie in the Harry Potter tale has been taken on a new journey with a new director and a new style, however after seeing it's debut tonight in the ACT I can't help but feel a little disappointed. <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is without a doubt better then the first four films. The Acting is better, the writing is better and not only that but the plot and characters are much more interesting too. However in saying this their is so much more that could have been to make this movie simply magic. <br/><br/>I am a big fan of the books that tell the tale of the young wizard, and so therefore I like the movie adaptations to provide the same enjoyment and the same magic that the books provide. <br/><br/>For me the fifth film just feels a little rushed. Their are key scenes in this movie that although are very good could have been so much better. For instance the Fred and George saga within the book lasts some time, as they build up for their illustrious exit from Hogwarts. In the movie however their journey ends very abruptly. The scene in which they make their movie is visually quite spectacular and also very enjoyable, but I just feel it could have been done better, done a little differently as too add that extra punch too the movie. <br/><br/>The climax to Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix once again was very good, but it just needed that extra bit of work. I remember hoping as I was watching it show a bit more of the wizards and the followers fighting each other, but they never did. The scene is done very well, its a cool fight but their just isn't enough of the other characters doing individual stuff. I like harry, but it would off added something if they had actually shown Lupin, Ron and some of the other wizards fighting a bit more. <br/><br/>This movie is very good, and I cannot deny that I enjoyed it a lot. Just maybe though they could have added something more to it, something that would have given it some extra kick, it is none the less definitely worth seeing."
"lani_pai","2","3","6","5 August 2007"," Film Failure
","Let's just ignore the books. Pretend they don't exist. Let's just pretend that the film was responsible for the creation of Harry Potter and the word of wizardom. It was still by far the worst film of the series thus far.<br/><br/>I went to see this film with my brother. I am an avid, passionate HP book fan whilst he hasn't even read the first one. It had fewer laughs than the previous movies which for me had been the first, second, third and fourth movies' salvation.<br/><br/>While some may argue that too much was cut out, in a sense, almost too much was left in. The film darted from event to event with little explanation with such dexterity that i almost had difficulty understanding what was happening. If they had removed more frills and only left the bare necessities in and explained them more, while it would have deviated more from the books, it would have been a better film in its own right. The film touched on a number of themes; government and media, the line between good and evil, generations, race relations etc. I would have liked to see one of these picked and explored a great deal more.<br/><br/>Aside from this, the acting ,while passable, was unextraordinary, Luna Lovegood being one of the sole highlights as well as an effectively infuriating Dolores Umbridge.<br/><br/>The one redeeming feature of this film was the cinematography which has come to be expected.<br/><br/>For me, the films can never surpass the books so they would stop trying and instead attempt to make a film that may stand on its own as a piece of work that explores the director's interpretation of the book. Fan of the books or not, this film is, in my opinion the worst so far which says something in its own right."
"nospam78","3","3","6","1 August 2007"," Rushed and disappointing
","I found this movie very disappointing and the weakest in the series so far. The exposition is very rushed and jerky, as if the director was checking plot points off a list and dashing through them as quickly as possible. Also, very annoyingly, he doesn't trust you to notice something he wants you to notice and has to beat you over the head with it, whether it's the Harry-Cho-Ginny triangle or a simple detail like Luna Lovegood being barefoot in the forest. Speaking of which, Evanna Lynch's performance was disappointing - Luna came across as more smug and self-satisfied than dreamy and unself-conscious like she should have been.<br/><br/>The other characters are predictable - Ron is clueless, Hermione is bossy and know-it-all etc. The only character showing any growth is Neville, and to a lesser extent Fred and George. Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge is the only real bright spot.<br/><br/>In his rush to get to the end, the director gives us none of what gave the book its characteristic flavor. None of Harry's inner turmoil is depicted - his awkward relationship with Cho, his growing alienation from Dumbledore etc. - and in particular the pivotal death of an important character is treated in a very offhand way. And although the climactic battle had dazzling special effects, there was no real heart in it - it hadn't been built up to with any sense of tension and overwhelming odds, and when it happened, it was just another plot point to be ticked off.<br/><br/>I suspect anyone who has not read the books will come away from this movie very confused, and not ready for the next episode. Considering the rich material he had to work with, the director really dropped the ball."
"aisteru35","4","3","6","16 July 2007"," easily the worst of the harry potter films
","rushed, chaotic and nonsensical (if you've not read the book). the editing is awful and the script is worse. went in with lowered expectations and were still disappointed. they seem to have taken all the connecting threads of the plot out and focused on the less important aspects of the core story. this movie could have been great in competent hands. instead, we get no character development, no idea of what's going on, no slowly building rebellion against umbridge, no tension and a particularly anti-climatic battle against death-eaters. in fact, you never really feel like harry and his friends are in danger in the ministry. you feel like, if harry hands over the prophecy, they will actually let them go. instead of killing them.<br/><br/>when i think of what this film could have been, especially if cuaron had been handed it, it's a bit saddening. why they thought an 870 page novel could or should be condensed into a 138 minute movie is beyond me. did they think kids who read a near 900 page novel wouldn't have the attention span to sit though a movie that was much more than 2 hours long?"
"steelmagnolia10808","Null","3","6","15 July 2007"," S.O.S Christopher Colombus!!!!
","If you haven't read *ANY* of the books you will be entertained. If you have seen any of the previous movies you will notice several venue inconsistencies. However, if you have read the book you will walk away feeling very robbed.<br/><br/>The actors did, as they always have done, a fantastic job. Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint continue their legacy of being perfection. The casting of Imelda Staunton as Umbridge was brilliant. You wanted to strangle her the moment you heard her cough for the first time. Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood was amazing, that girl really was made for the role.<br/><br/>In the case of the ever changing, and disappointing, face of the venues...what can I say? The Hogsmeade station was COMPLETELY different from the books not to mention the other movies, the first one (where the stages are set) in particular. The Room of Requirement, although appropriate, was also very different from the way it was described in the book (and those details, mind you, wouldn't have been hard to follow). Hog's Head was a far cry from the book, it looked more abandoned than grungy.<br/><br/>Just as everyone who has posted before me, I realize that condensing an 800 page novel into a two hour movie would be a daunting task..although the other movies managed to keep some of magic from within the books and AT LEAST have scene and plot connecting tissue. The choice of David Yates as director was a catastropihic error.<br/><br/>The movie was as if you were looking at flash cards and in the end..you better hope you found some underlying connection. There are obvious connections..the Dark Lord has returned which is why atrocities are occurring, Umbridge is headmaster which is why drastic changes are occurring..but the subtlety of the book, and the graceful way it moved from one scene (or plot change) to the next is lost. The film seemed VERY VERY rushed. It was as if they only had two hours to deal with and in that two hours they wanted to jam pack as much as possible, regardless of whether or not it flowed or seemed cohesive. They did however make sure they checked the major plot boxes. The way in which is was done is far from entertaining..it's disappointing.<br/><br/>There are things in the film that DON'T EVEN OCCUR in the book. Yet those scenes took up time in the movie in place of things that were left out that ACTUALLY happened.<br/><br/>Cho is not the snitch on Dumbledore's Army. Her friend, Marietta, who came along begrudgingly to the first meeting, was the snitch. Secondly, since in the movie they portrayed her as the snitch as an easier way to resolve removing the character from the plot line, she should've had ""SNEAK"" written across her face, courtesy of Hermonie's charm on the roster.<br/><br/>It is impossible to conceive that Dolores Umbridge could've forcefully broken into the Room of Requirement - as it goes against the lore of the room to begin with. Not much more I can say about that..aside from David Yates's brilliance is at its best yet again.<br/><br/>The members of Dumbledore's Army were never tasked to sit in the Great Hall and write lines. That ENTIRE scene never happened in the book. It would've been much cheaper (and kept with the book) to just add a few lines for Dumbledore rather than construct an entire fictitious scene.<br/><br/>The Weasley twin's exit should've had you standing infront of your chair yelling and cheering..instead it left you wondering when they were going to incorporate the scene with the swamp. I do admit that the dragon firework that chased Umbridge was brilliant, there could've been so much more than that.<br/><br/>We see poor Mr. Weasley bitten almost to death at the Department of Mysteries one second, and a quick flash later, he's in a wheelchair having Christmas dinner? Enough said.<br/><br/>The entire reason for the movie was the rekindling of the Order of the Pheonix in response of the second coming of Voldemort. In the movie, they seemed to take a back seat to Umbridge - who unfortunately seemed to be the entire reason for the movie ( which is completely incorrect). They just seemed to occasionally take up space at Grimmauld Place, and fight in the last battle scene..rather than do any reconnaissance or plan forming.<br/><br/>Lastly the last scene in the movie. The epic battle scene. It was nicely done I think, left a little to be desired, but still nicely done. Yet the entire reason why the Dark Lord lured Harry to the Department of Mysteries in the first place goes unexplained and cast aside like collateral damage. The prophecy orb was NEVER explained. Nothing ever explained *WHY* Voldemort wanted it in the first place. It is never discussed why it's anything of value to begin with. What makes this little tiny talking glowing orb a weapon in the first place? Why is it so valuable? What is it capable of? It just seems like David Yates used it as an excuse to make an epic battle scene, when the orb is the entire reason *for* the battle in the first place.<br/><br/>In closing, the *first* movie was completely and utterly magical, it left me breathless. It was also directed by Chris Colombus, who also directed the second film. This entire post is meant to be an S.O.S and an outcry to for help. Please reconsider and bring Chris Colombus back on board. He brought the magic to the screen. Save us Chris Colombus!"

","Wow.. I was extremely disappointed with this movie.. it was boring! The graphics and effects were good when they were used.... but I thought this movie was going to be SO MUCH BETTER. I'm so frustrated. Don't ask how but I never bothered to watch any of the trailers.. I never needed to, because the pure fact that it's Harry Potter I already knew I was going to see it. I have to admit there were parts that were very well done, but for some reason, this movie couldn't keep me entranced like the others did. I found myself checking the time every half hour or so just to see if I was getting closer to leaving. What's sad is, even though I thought this movie wasn't well done, I'm probably still going to buy it when it comes out so I can add it to my collection."
"ksbride","2","3","6","12 July 2007"," I had to have yawned at least seven times...
","Even before the halfway point of the movie, most of the audience had lost total interest, and began holding conversations amongst themselves. I kept asking myself, where's the action? The characters just kept talking and talking and talking. Pure exposition never makes for a good movie.<br/><br/>And finally, when we do reach the climactic wizard duel at the end, it is short and head-ache inducing. I had to squint my eyes in fear of seizing. There was no continuity between this movie, and the four that came before it. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an amazing movie. But this just ruined it for me. I loved the book, but I have no desire to see this movie ever again. It will not be joining my DVD collection when it is released to the public.<br/><br/>And what was with Dudley? Sheesh, that actor stunk."
"lordmandrake2000","3","3","6","12 July 2007"," Good special effects, excellent acting, terrible movie
","I went into the movie somewhat... hesitant. I am a purist, do the story right or not at all. The first movie was fairly close, but the quality has dropped off dramatically since then. This movie was no exception. As is often said ""The Devil is in the details"", well this movie lost them all. From the opening scene to the closing credits any resemblance this movie bore to the story that spawned it seemed accidental. Many major characters simply vanished, entirely. Other major characters might as well have. Ginny Weasley had three lines. I counted. Harry's righteous anger in the book came off portrayed as childish whining, any scene that should have appeared that might have explained... anything really never materialized, and for all intents and purposes every minor plot line that tied the book together was omitted from the movie that insults it's name.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the acting of newcomer Evanna Lynch was spot on. Her portrayal of Luna Lovegood was stellar. The acting of our returning favorites literally paled next to her characterization, how much of that was due to the horrid writing of the screenplay for the rest is something I am unwilling to speculate. I hated Umbridge, just as I was supposed to. Not the actress of course, she did quite well. Finally Jason Issacs returned to his love-to-despise role of Lucius and quite effortlessly stole the show for the forces of darkness from the much absent Voldemort.<br/><br/>If you go in looking for great special effects, decent acting and a couple of hours of air conditioned explosions you will love this movie.<br/><br/>However... If you wanted to see a half-decent adaptation of the story you loved... rather than the badly made outline of the cliff-notes, transcribed by drunken monkeys in the dark.... well you'll probably feel as I do."
"Jujumonki","5","3","6","12 July 2007"," I was disappointed...
","||Some spoilers I guess|| I'm not going to bother to write some huge long paragraph, but I really think they could've done better. Sure there were some parts that were hilarious (made more hilarious 'cause I went with my friends and stuff). But in total, they left out some of the parts I really liked (St. Mungos, and Firenze), and then they go and change some really important bits (Sirius' death).<br/><br/>Most of the characters seemed really bland, and the same that they have in the other movies. And I still don't like Dumbeldore's new actor; he's too much of a spaz unlike the actual book Dumbeldore, and the previous actor. Luna Lovegood was good, and I still loved Fred and George, and the HermionexRon parts were adorable (yeah sorry... They were...) (Even though I hate Rupert Grint...), and Dolores Umbridge was really good (and reminded me of one of my teachers), the rest wasn't very good.<br/><br/>So yeah, I didn't like it."
"KaoticKlown","10","3","6","12 July 2007"," The Best of them All!
","This movie had a crap load of money go into it...and boy is it noticeable! With stunning visual effects, fantastic sets, and even mesmerizing transitions, this movie is truly a work of art! Now, obviously, this movie doesn't involve everything the book does, but hopefully you can look past that and only see this as a great movie (i did). Quidditch is out of the movie, along with many other things from the book that Harry Potter fans should notice, but you should be able to let that go and enjoy the movie and the book as two different things.<br/><br/>The kids have become much better actors and actresses. Emma Watson, whom in my opinion was the weakest of the trio in the previous movie, has really improved. Rupert, whom I have always thought had the best performance of the three did not disappoint either. We can really start to see chemistry between Ron and Hermione and he performs it well, like when he attacked Grawp to try to save Hermione. Dan's performance was better as well. His reaction to Sirius's death was much better than I expected and he seemed to really embody the character.<br/><br/>The new people in the cast were also fantastic. Imelda Staunton, who plays Dolores Umbridge was so good at being evil. By the end of the movie she really had you hating her, which is the feeling you are suppose to have for this character. Evanna Lynch plays Luna Lovegood in her first movie role. If you have read the book, then you should agree, she is the PERFECT Luna! She really steals the show in every scene that she is in.<br/><br/>Now the effects of this movie are just great! The Weasley fireworks were fantastic (which was one of the best scenes in the movie). The final battle in the Department of Mysteries is just jaw dropping! It's just too good for words. It's an all out magical epic battle. This would definitely be worth seeing in IMAX 3D.<br/><br/>So in closing, i most certainly recommend this movie. It really doesn't matter if you have even read the book to understand what is going on, but it might be good to see the other movies first. You will definitely have a magical experience!"

The answer is simple, you hire a director who knows nothing about Harry and let him cut an awesome story into a made for TV movie. <br/><br/>Harsh? Read, Order of the Phoenix and Half Blooded Prince, then watch the movie. So much was left out that this movie almost reminded me of Anne Rice's 'Queen of the Damned' where in the movie they just decided to write a new story and put a famous name to it.<br/><br/>Good Parts: (yes there were good parts to it) Firstly, Tonks, Brilliant exactly what I pictured when I read the book!

I know the book was not up to par for die hards. <br/><br/>I guess the film could not get past that fact as well. <br/><br/>I really really hope the next one makes up for it.<br/><br/>Maybe they should rethink using the same director for the next one.<br/><br/>Im sure this film will gross mega bucks but I'd like to see anyone who has seen this film and have them honestly tell me it was better than any of the others.<br/><br/>If they did I know they were either lying or being paid off.

"Boricanator","8","3","6","11 July 2007"," The Darkness is its Strength, not its weakness
","---Most likely not real spoilers, but just in case---------------------<br/><br/>Before going to see the movie I kept hearing how certain people were complaining about the movie's darkness. Yet it was this darkness that compels the most.<br/><br/>Harry is going through many horrible experiences that are complemented by the troubles that come to all of us during this period of our lives. In this internal struggle Harry must make sure to remain good and preserve his own life. All the psychological elements that affect Harry, plus the experiences, creates the strongest challenge he has ever faced.<br/><br/>The drama that takes over the movie makes you forget, at least for a while, that this is a fantasy. The experiences we see Harry go through are so humane that it is hard for anybody not to relate at some point or another. The key element to the darkness is the element of temptation; how well is Harry able to resist them? These temptations, although having fantasy elements in it, are humane in the sense that they can be carried out in the ""muggle"" way, with the exception of the tools being used.<br/><br/>That is why the darkness is its greatest strength.<br/><br/>Aside from this strength, the movie has a lot of magic for kids and adults, without leaving the first out. There are amazing visuals which are very realistic, bound to impress even non-fans of magic.<br/><br/>The concept of a youth rebellion for a just cause is bound to attract the young and not worry the adults, they would specifically like it. Especially with the ""Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, teach a man how to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime"" concept applied.<br/><br/>Lady's and gentlemen, I give you the best Harry Potter to date!"

","Just saw Order of the Phoenix, and I thought David Yates did a brilliant job of translating Jo Rowling's book to the screen. Love the set design, and the acting was excellent. Imelda Staunton was perfect at the despicable Umbridge, as was Helena Bonham Carter in a tiny role as Bellatrix. Harry has become a bit of a lost soul in this movie, and Dan Radcliffe does an outstanding job of portraying him--he's really coming along as an actor. This is definitely the best movie of the series. I particularly liked that David Yates wasn't afraid cast off the tendency some of the earlier films had (Prisoner of Azkaban excepted) to portray the magical world in a very twee sort of way, and instead created a grown-up vision of magic--something that can be exciting but also hugely powerful and frightening. Can't wait to see what he does with Half Blood Prince."

","I saw this at midnight and let me tell you it was well worth the wait. The actors all did an amazing job! One nice thing about keeping all of the original actors, is that you get to see how they've grown up and progressed as actors. But in this movie the acting felt natural. Daniel Radcliffe captured the emotions of Harry, Rupert Grint was absolutely hilarious. Emma Watson was perfect as Hermione. The Phelps twins, made me laugh throughout the movie. When they interrupted the OWLS or when they kept apparating just to annoy their mother or surprise Harry. Gary Oldman, was incredible as Sirius Black. Evanna Lynch, was perfect for the role of Luna Lovegood. Evanna captured Luna's spacey quality and her incredible perceptiveness. Alan Rickman's portrayal of Snape was brilliant. Imelda Staunton's portrayal of Umbridge was just as evil as the character in the book. As a fan of the books I was more than pleased with acting, cinematography, and the special effects. Although several things were omitted and the battle in the Ministry of Magic was condensed a lot, I was spellbound (no pun intended). The only downside, the next movie won't be out until November of 2008. This movie is incredible and absolutely surpasses the previous movies."

Weak performances all round and the most noticeable fact was the total lack of music throughout the movie.I was always able to hear someone eating their popcorn or slurping on their soda and thats when i realised this little oddity.The only good thing bout the movie was that it was not too long and has been edited well.The special effects leave much to be desired.All in all it was just an average movie from which i didn't expect much and i guess it pretty much lived up to the expectation.Nothing big releasing for a while now i guess.Transformers and 300 have definitely been Hollywood's high points this year(yet to watch ratatouille). Let me just make this one thing clear.The only reason i'm giving this movie a 5 is because i gave spiderman 3 a 3on10 and HP was definitely better than spiderman3. Its not worth wasting the dough on the imax 3D screening cos there isn't anything great.I don't recommend the movie but its still OK if there's no other movie to watch."

","Let me start by saying that book 5 of J.K. Rowling's is my least favorite of the wonderful Harry Potter series. It's too long, with too much run-on writing, and it seemed to me that she had to manipulate Harry's personality to make the plot work, so much so that it often came off as contrived. That being said, the movie has gone a long way toward trimming the fat, and improving on the meandering of the book's nearly 900 pages. I'd have to say that, plot-wise, I enjoyed this Harry Potter more than any of the others. The new non-CGI characters, Dolores Umbridge, and Luna Lovegood, are transferred from the page to the screen with near perfection by Imelda Staunton and Evanna Lynch, respectively.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg had his work cut out for him trying to preserve the essential elements of the book without disappointing his audience. The results are mixed. Some subplots are completely missing, yet there is still so much crammed into the 2 hour and 20 minute running time that any viewer who hasn't read the book will be at a disadvantage when it comes to understanding what's going on. For this reason, the editing is sometimes jumpy and disjointed. You have to depend on your knowledge of the book to fill in the gaps. The end result is, much like the first two movies, an exposition of the essential aspects of the book for fans, as opposed to a movie that generates its own drama. That being said, Mr. Goldenberg improved on the book in several respects. Harry's motivation's are more understandable, his relationship with his almost-girlfriend is carried off well. The battle in the Department of Mysteries is more believable and less protracted.<br/><br/>The cinematography is grittier, the colors less saturated. The director, David Yates, has a nice sense of how to use the camera, sometimes up close and with a hand-held quality to give the action a, dare I say it, edgy feel; other times in long sweeping shots to convey scope and space. This is particularly effective during the last third of the film.<br/><br/>This installment in the Harry Potter pantheon will please Ms. Rowling's loyal readers. If you are one of them, go see it. Now that I've had my fix, I can manage to wait for Book 7!"
"aluragirl16","3","7","20","15 July 2007"," Another Flop
","I grew up reading these books. It got me through the boring days at school, thinking of what J.K. Rowling was going to write next. As the series went on I got more and more excited. My mom and I would always be at Borders at midnight, screaming for the next book. However, this movie has destroyed the magic spun so delicately by Rowling. The movies kept forgetting little details, and switching directors each movie has screwed this series up royally. The lack of attention to detail is abundant and was completely ignored so they could spit the movies out and make it easier for the people who are too lazy to read the books. This movie, at the beginning, was on a good track, leading everyone into the story as Harry Potter once again arrives at Hogwarts. But as the movie began to climb toward the climax, the film steadily declined. The storyline unwound, the characters and plot didn't make sense, and the messy attention to detail showed.<br/><br/>After loving the books, I'm planning on not attending the sixth or seventh movies, and am warning everyone who loved the books to be cautious when attending this movie."
"avid_moviewatcher","Null","10","32","11 July 2007"," The Worst Movie So Far
","I'm a huge HP fan, and I realise the need to cut half the book down when the pages just keep on increasing - however, was it just me or do these movies keep getting worse and worse? #1 was good, #2 was worse, etc,etc? The sheer annoyance generated by OotP has prompted me to comment, which is completely unprecedented. From the first 2 minutes into the scene with Dudley and the Dementors, you realise how pathetic the acting really is - without any depth, sensibility or charisma - even though obviously, Dudley is meant to be a fat dumb a**, Daniel Radcliffe gets paid to grunt and nod his head every so often, or yell pointlessly at a wall? Jeez! I don't know, but maybe the first 2 minutes just turned me off for the rest of the movie, which suffered from poor direction - while I realise this film is meant to be dark and building up towards the mood for future films/books, the direction was mediocre and pretentious at best, evinced on many occasions throughout the film - you hope that while you are watching it, it will get better, except it does nothing but sink you deeper into the abyss of crapness. Yes, go bag me out if you're a mindless HP zombie or a 3 year old kid."

","Yes! I cannot believe I have now seen all the Harry Potter films, at least for now ;). Well after watching the last four Harry Potter films, I was definitely interested in seeing where the story would lead us next. The Order of Phoenix was absolutely astonishing and without a doubt the best Harry Potter yet. See, my friends who read the books didn't get much of a kick out it like I did, but I think they were just comparing too much book to movie. Who knows? After reading the books, I'm sure I'd be like that too, but movie wise I thought this was a great movie to watch and a terrific film for the summer.<br/><br/>Harry is having extreme nightmares ever since the death of his fellow classmate, he knows Veldemort is on the loose and will do anything to stop him. But at Hogwarts no one believes him, especially the newest addition the professors, Delorus Umbridge, and this woman is here to make student's lives an absolute night mare. In the mean time Voldemort has plans for Harry and must get his hands on a prophecy that Harry has. Harry gathers classmates that finally believe him about Voldemort and join into an army that will end in the ultimate battle between good and evil.<br/><br/>The Order of Phoenix is a roller coaster ride of action and a great story. The actors were terrific and the movie had great effects with the best story yet. I cannot wait for the next Harry Potter film, I admit it, I'm hooked. I can't wait to start reading the books, I bought them today, I guess I'm on the band wagon of the Harry Potter fans, if you can't be them, join them, lol.<br/><br/>9/10"
"graemev","7","10","33","11 July 2007"," Worst movie of the series
","After seeing this film I am left wondering, who is this director? and why does he want to ruin the Harry Potter series? But it's not all his fault, the screenwriter has left out so much of the feel of the previous movies. The movie felt too short and didn't have enough of the ""wizarding world"" and it's atmosphere. The movie felt hollow because other than Harry himself, the other characters had little involvement and no character development besides their obvious age difference from the last movie. Important scenes were paced too fast and lost the intended impact. Special effects were good, but borrowed heavily from Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. I just hope this director does a better job of the next movie or the producers see the light and get a better screenwriter and director combination. Thumbsdown from me"
"vzverevitivich","2","4","10","6 August 2007"," Not Good
","No matter how you defend the omissions in the Order of The Phoenix film, it still falls flat. But my greatest objection is to the alternative interpretation to the ending, very confusing, unfullfilling, too much liberty taken. If no other part of the book could make it verbatim, the ending certainly should have. I'm very concerned with how the next two films will be handled with Yates still at helm, as I think he is directing next one, no word yet on final film.<br/><br/>I wonder how much power J.K. Rowling has in the film, I wouldn't have authorized his butchery. When I went to film with several who have never read the book, I was bombarded with questions the car ride home as the film omissions just left too many unexplained situations.<br/><br/>The previous films have been acceptable in their depictions, but this entry into the Harry Potter franchise was a severe disappointment. Titanic ran over 3 hours, with this book being the largest, I think Warner Bros. could have authorized the film to run over 3 hours. People would have watched."

","OK, I went to the midnight showing last night and let me tell you, this movie was freakin awesome! I was expecting more not so following the book story line, but thats far from what I got. They followed the book almost... ALMOST perfectly. There were even plenty of lines straight out of the book. (I know i've read it like 20 times). Imelda Staunton should get an award for her role as Umbridge. If you thought Umbrdige ticked you off and or scared you in the book. She'd make you want to choose Norman Bates in his mothers dress to watch your children than you would her. The battle scenes are awesome. You really get into them and it's just amazing. I'm trying my best not to really to ruin it for anyone. Overall, this movie is by far the best out of all 5 thats been made so far. David Yate's directing was amazing and our favorite Potter Actors have come so far, they've really grown into their roles.<br/><br/>(i put a possible spoiler warning just in case it slipped out, but in my opinion you should already know most about it if you've read the books if you haven't read the books then you're neglecting yourself of reading the greatest story ever told!)"

","I went to the press screening past Friday. I wasn't expecting too much. I only saw the first 2 movies, and I didn't think they were that great. The books are just much better. But I must say, this fifth movie is pretty good. But the biggest part of criticism I have on this title is that they left too much out. I understand that the book just has way too many subplots to put in the film. But still it's a shame. Like the relationship between Harry and Cho. They only appear together in only 2 scenes!<br/><br/>But there were also some good things. Like the attention for detail. Like the kitty plates on the walls of Umbride her walls. That getting us to Umbridge... She was played pretty well I have to be honest. Could be better. But still pretty nice. The only thing I didn't like is that you didn't get the feeling that the other teachers hate her as well, like you do in the books.<br/><br/>A lot of things were different that I imagined while reading the book, but the final fight scene, did match a little bit. That was pretty nicely done. Special effect there were pretty OK (could be better, but they are not that bad)<br/><br/>Well, pretty nice movie. Good book to film transfer. If you liked the previous movies, go see this. If you are a fan of the book. You can go see it... but be prepared for it to be a lot different than you imagined.<br/><br/>7/10"

"PoisonKeyblade","10","3","7","11 July 2007"," The Best Harry Potter to Date
","With the fifth Harry Potter film finally arriving, there were huge expectations that many were upholding. Would new director David Yates ruin the series or would he effectively translate the magnificent J. K. Rowling book to the screen? Who would play the loopy Luna Lovegood? Would the fifth film be sufficient in establishing a mature and dark mood? All these questions and more were answered, all with incredibly positive effects in the best film out of the whole series. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix translates perfectly on screen in the most flawless installment yet. Starring in the film are regulars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, and this time around they are joined by newcomer Evanna Lynch, and a supporting cast that can only be described as ""amazing"".<br/><br/>This time around (for anyone who hasn't read the books) Harry gets expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside of school, and he is taken to the House of Black where he awaits trial for his mistaken crime. He discovers that Dumbledore, Sirius, and others have formed a meeting group called 'The Order of the Phoenix' that has been around since his father and mother were still alive. Throughout the school year, Harry and friends must face many hardships, including the evil Professor Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher that may be much more than she appears.<br/><br/>The directing from David Yates is undoubtedly the best in the entire series. He uses the stylistics and darkness of Alfonso Cuaron coupled with the love for the material that Christopher Columbus so openly displayed. The picture seems more based around Harry this time around, which is fitting considering how dark and revolved around Harry that the book was. David Yates does an astounding job playing on each actor's strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>Which brings us to another point: the acting was, for the first time, completely powerful and great in every category. No longer do we have that strange inexperienced boy that Daniel Radcliffe once was; he is now a grown boy with amazing flexibility and skill as an actor. He plays Harry so well that sometimes you forget he is an actor. He does so well with Harry's transformation from innocent boy to testosterone-fueled teen who is desperate for answers. His performance was genius, and for once it was without a single flaw. While Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have far less screen time than they did in the previous film, they do wonders with their characters. It is so obvious that each of these actors has grown so perfectly into their roles that they can just act so flawlessly. The three newcomers are simply extraordinary. Evanna Lynch couldn't have been better as the insanely sweet and wickedly weird Luna Lovegood, and she does so well with her first big role. She wasn't exactly how I originally pictured Luna, but now I can't imagine her any differently. Imelda Staunton was simply outstanding as the vile Professor Umbridge; she is one of the most memorable villains in all of literature, and her hatred transports to the screen in all of its perfection and effectiveness. Although Helena Bonham Carter had very few scenes, she always manages to catch attention being the scene-stealer that she is. She plays the part of Bellatrix amazingly well, and her interactions with the other characters seem almost unreal. Gary Oldman was also great as Sirius, and his few scenes with Harry were magnificent. Matthew Lewis is emerging majorly in his breakout performance as Neville Longbottom, and this time is no exception. The supporting cast was all just so brilliant, and they really made the movie all the better.<br/><br/>As for how close this managed to be to the book I was actually surprised. Unlike with Goblet of Fire, they didn't completely slaughter it this time around. I mean sure, there were some really amazing things that were left out such as the whole 'Weasley is Our King' thing and many interactions that Harry has with Draco Malfoy, but for the most part, they mostly stick with the book and churn out an enchanting tale. Harry Potter is just as good as ever, only this time it's better. They did cut lots and lots out, but at the end of the day, what film based on a book DOESN'T cut things out? Sometime sacrifices must be made, and I think that the final product they ended up with was sufficient enough for me. Hopefully with David Yates returning to direct the sixth film it will end up half as good as this one.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the books, I was highly anticipating this film, and it did not disappoint me in any way. David Yates' direction is new, fresh, and surprisingly dark, and the action sequences and special effects are mind-blowing. This may just top Transformers as one of the best films of the summer, and possibly one of the best movies of all time. It was certainly by far the best Harry Potter film, that's for sure. A+"
"fdg_fornasini","10","3","7","11 July 2007"," So disappointed - HPOTP Review
","Okay, so I rarely write reviews for films on IMDb, but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix really disappointed me. There are just so many flaws and so many things that should've been changed before the movie was actually shown in theaters worldwide. But before I start, I had excellent expectations on the 5th movie of the series. People said this was the ""best Harry Potter yet"", the one with the best performances by the ensemble cast. So I was really happy when I read all these great reviews. But I started worrying when A) the soundtrack was getting horrible criticism (and, in my opinion, the soundtrack is one of the most important parts of a movie) B) I read that the movie was 2 hours and 18 minutes long. I started thinking that maybe IMDb made a typo. Did it perhaps mean 3 hours and 18 minutes? I just forgot about the fact and went into the theater happy that I was about to see...""the best Harry Potter yet"". Oh boy, how wrong was I. The movie started out with just the first 20 something notes to ""Hedwig's Theme"", the WB logo, and then the title logo. Okay, every movie has always begun like that. But then...everything was like a blur. The movie was just going so fast, at times I was afraid of blinking, thus losing a key scene of the film. So firstly, I'd say that the fact that this was the shortest movie made out of the longest HP book is a PROBLEM. Secondly, the actors. I mean: there is no character development in the movie. It's just one action after another. Hermione has always that stern, worried face. Ron has always a demented face. Harry is continuously mad. Seriously! Calm down people. This is a typical HP-movie dialogue. Hermione: ""Harry you don't get it! You don't get it! You are in danger Harry! You must be careful! Bla BLA BLA"" Harry: ""Don't touch me! Don't touch ME!"" (starts having convulsions) Ron: Incomprehensible boring babble. The movie completely loses the ambiance and the atmosphere that Rowling has so often emphasized in her books. Similarly, Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, and Steven Kloves excelled in re-creating the magical world on screen. Mike Newell did an okay job. Yates did a terrible job. If it wasn't for the fact that just about the entire production crew has remained the same in years, Yates probably would not be directing HBP. It follows that it is probably Goldenberg's fault that so many interesting sub-plots have been lost in favor of a rapid, fast-forward creation. Special effects somewhat save the day. Together with Stuart Craig's production design - which, by the way, is so similar to what I had imagined. I guess we could say that, had it not been for him, the director would have had a rough time playing around with the camera and trying to recreate the same, suspenseful conclusion that Rowling had thought of (i.e. the prophecy room, the ending scene in the ministry). Also, great actors such as Bonham Carter, and Staunton, as well as the stellar cast, save the day (apart from the main three). Thanks to them, the movie has a reason to exist. And finally, what really did NOT save the day was the music. Nicholas Hooper should be fired right NOW after what he has written for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It all sounds so empty, so badly orchestrated, so...NOTHING. Hooper's score resembles an unoriginal trailer/production music rather than a proper HARRY POTTER score. You know, Patrick Doyle had nonetheless tried to emulate Williams thus producing an exceptional score, which could've somewhat applied to an HP movie. But Hooper. Seriously. Everything's just a mess. How could the guys at WB even let him SCORE the next film! Are they nuts!? Whether it is the movie that just seems so rushed. Whether it is the director that seems to constantly use the same camera movements (i.e. the camera passing through glass) Whether it is the WAY-TOO-LONG kiss between Cho and Harry which felt embarrassing rather than romantic. Whether it is the dreadful score. Whether it is the incompetent screenwriter. Whether it is this thing or that thing, the movie entertains, but fails to deliver what Rowling had in mind. I'll buy it on DVD and keep it in my Harry Potter collection, hoping that some day, I'll have better opinions of it. But do not expect me to clap and cheer for Yates. I'm seriously thinking of creating a petition so that he does NOT return for the Half-Blood Prince. Watch it if you're going to go inside the theater with low expectations. Do not watch it if you hope to see the ""BEST HARRY POTTER YET"". Watch it if you want brainless fun, if you want a movie with suspense, comedy, drama, horror?, fantasy, etc. Do not watch it if you want a slightly more serious film, a better recreation of the Harry Potter world on the silver screen. A rushed-through film that should have been saved from the hands of the editors. What a let down. A fun let down. But still a let down.<br/><br/>(ps. The most boring credits in a HP film. At least Columbus' ones were clean, white on black credits. And What's with the CLICHé rotating newspapers!!) (pps. BRING - JOHN - WILLIAMS - BACK!!)"

","My 10 hour wait in line was ended in disappointment. From the first 5 min.s I could tell this wasn't going to be a very good movie. If you compare this movie to all of the others in the series, it has a completely different feel. It felt like a rough draft. Nothing transitioned well. The actual film footage was fantastic, but the way they placed it together made it hard to follow and very rocky. Don't even get me started on the fight scene and death. It was so short. 5 secs: Arrived. 5 secs: Looked. 5 secs: Fought. 5 secs: Death. 5 secs: Fight. 10 secs: Harry on the floor. I know there was a lot to put into this movie, and they accomplished getting all the main events, but it was just not put together properly. I think even 10 min more would have made this film so much better. The best way I can put it: They seem to have sent it out the rough draft. <br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>Luscious Malfroy looked so different.<br/><br/>Snape looked even uglier than usual, I guess that sticks more towards the book.<br/><br/>I'm happy they did the flashback with James and Snape.<br/><br/>I'm sad that they didn't put any info. about Neville and the Prophecy.<br/><br/>It seemed small characters got more screen time than characters like Ron and Hermione.

Will it be two hours next time?) Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson return to their roles as Harry, Ron and Hermione in which in this latest installment Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back and nobody believes Harry Potter's story, not even his own peers once he returns to school for his fifth year.

Harry Potter on the other hand has figured out that his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) was part of a group along with Harry's parents and families of the young hero's friends where he comes up with the group Dumbledore's Army to teach whoever wants to get rid of the evil that's heading their way to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Order of the Phoenix is spectacular entertainment from minute one where like Prisoner of Azkaban, you don't have to read the books or be a fan of the series.<br/><br/>This movie's for anybody."
"jussjames","10","3","7","11 July 2007"," Great For The Readers, Somewhat Harsh For The Watchers
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, though definitely the best adaptation of the Harry Potter Novels to date, assumes the fans know the book too many times. From the simple act of going to the Hog's Head (which was in Hogsmeade, as I had to tell a friend), to the cut ending dialog between Dumbledore and Harry, there was too many things that were cut that should have been kept. Especially since the longest book became the shortest movie.<br/><br/>However, there are many points that are better seen than read, especially near the climax of the book. The special effects were spectacular, and seem to get better with each release.<br/><br/>The cast, of course, shines in OotP. The trio are growing up, and are able to convey a much greater emotional range as the books expand the emotions conveyed. Alan Rickman shined as the greasy and mysterious Severus Snape, though it would have been nice to see more of him on screen. Gary Oldman finally gets much needed screen time with Harry, and excels in the role of Sirius Black. Michael Gambon does an excellent job portraying Dumbledore, though, I must admit, I still miss Richard Harris's portrayal. Newcomer Evanna Lynch's portrayal of Luna Lovegood was spot on and excellent. Imelda Staunton's portrayal of Dolores Umbridge was excellent, easing my worries after seeing the trailers. And finally, Ralph Ralph Fiennes was perfect and portrayed the evilness of the character far better than even in Goblet.<br/><br/>In summary, Order of the Phoenix is an excellent adaptation, though if you're a book loyalist, you may leave the theater with a bad taste in your mouth. The essence and plot of the book are portrayed excellently by David Yates, and the music is touching and fits the scenes well (Kudos to Nicholas Hooper in filling in the rather large shoes of John Williams). The movie was shorter than it should have been, but portrayed excellently in the time that was allotted. Definitely a must see."
"kevinjo2011","8","3","7","11 July 2007"," Great Movie- Gives the Book a Bad Name
","If you have read the Harry Potter books and loved them just as much as i have, you should probably agree that this was the worst Harry Potter film (COMPARED TO THE BOOKS), besides that I enjoyed it. When Harry and his friends finally reach the door in his dreams, they go directly into the Hall of Prophecies, though in the book they go through a variety of rooms, and that is a part I was most eager to see. The room with the brains, and the time room. Also in the book,almost everybody but Harry got injured in the battle, while in the film, no one gets injured. Also, in the film, they rearrange things and combine things that I don't think they should have. The sacking of Trelawney takes place almost directly when Umbridge becomes High Inquisitor, when in the books it doesn't take place until after Christmas. Also, they do not show the St. Mungo's scene at all, they do not even mention it, and they leave out the attack on Hagrid and McGonnagal. And the last thing that really upset me was the fact that in the book Bellatrix DOES NOT hit Sirius with Avada Kadavra, He only gets knocked into the veil. In the movie she does hit him with the killing curse, sending him into the veil. But I still believe Sirius is alive (LISTEN TO WHAT LUNA SAYS AT THE END!!!) Therefore, in my opinion, they film makers left out way too much, and I think for those who haven't read the book will find this movie hard to follow. Also I believe that this movie is way too short- 2 hours and 18 minutes, not enough time for an 870 page book. I enjoyed the movie but I think they were a great disappointment to those who read the books."
"segelb","4","3","7","11 July 2007"," Best Action, Worst Movie
","Yeah, sure there was action, but you cant get past the fact that they skipped so many key points, left in too many unnecessary scenes, and still made it over 2 hours. I would not recommend anyone to see this movie who has any knowledge of Harry Potter and the book, for they will be certainly disappointed. From the first deleted scene in the beginning when they skip the part about Harry being kicked out of the house and his aunt defending him, to the vast amount of information left out of the end, it was, all in all, just not a good movie.<br/><br/>The biggest mistake of the film was leaving out the complete explanation of the prophecy. Instead of having Dumbledore explain the prophecy at the end, the glass ball ""tells"" Harry the prophecy and leaves it at that. There is no mention of Neville being the other person the prophecy could have been about, and also no mention of Professor Trelawney making the prophecy.<br/><br/>Also, the fight scene at the end between was just ridiculous, and not in a good way. Sirius doesn't die the way the book says, and Voldemort and Harry don't duel. When the Order fights the Death Eaters, they are all flying around and stuff . There is no fight between Harry and Voldemort. Dumbledore comes in right away and pushes Harry away. There is no mention of Sirius leaving Harry any of his possessions, including the house elf or the two sided mirror. Never again should a TV director take on a multi-million dollar movie. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>And no Quidditch? Come on."

The story of Good vs. Authority (Imelda Staunton's spirited but ridiculous caricature of a Margaret Thatcher stick figure, zaftig as she may look here in ill-fitting clothes) is not only primitive, it's dangerous: even children need to know that real Evil is not that cardboard-cutout obvious, that Snidely Whiplash not a Macbeth makes. J.K. Rowling's writing is on the lazy side here.<br/><br/>And yet, strangely in case of such a youth-oriented film, it's a dark, scary story, not only with the continued (escalated?) all-around torture of Harry, but with the Ministry of Magic takeover of Hogwarts School playing out as totalitarian steamroller, a kind of ""1984"" without the dance numbers.<br/><br/>But first, director David Yates, cinematographer Slawomir Idziak, production designer Stuart Craig, and the throng of special-effects folks from ILM, MPC, Framestore CFC, Warner Bros., etc., etc. should get major kudos for one of the best-looking movies around. For every dumb broom-riding scene, there are some unforgettable visuals of majestic vistas, unending, rich interiors, a cataclysmic cascade of glass structures, and so on. A truly handsome production. Small touches, such as the demonstration that even wizards need Oyster Card on the Underground, are enjoyable.<br/><br/>The core cast comes through well: Daniel Radcliffe could easily do Harry in his sleep, but he is very much awake, Emma Watson's Hermione has some new angles (she allows herself a small thrill in facing danger), Rupert Grint's Ron is reliably innocuous.<br/><br/>Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is believably magical, Alan Rickman's Snape is once again on the cusp of malignant-looking beneficence (and we do learn something interesting from his past), but not all is well. Ralph Fiennes' noseless Voldemort is annoying, that magnificent duo of Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson get screen time of a few seconds, and Helena Bonham Carter's deranged turn is brief and rather ludicrous. It's actually more fun to watch lesser-known actors making the best of their moments at the periphery.<br/><br/>There is a lot to see, a lot to enjoy in ""Phoenix,"" but it's without a center, substance, heart."

","I am a die hard fan and was very anxious to see the longest book transferred into the shortest movie.<br/><br/>Luckily, I was able to see a sneak peek showing on the nearby Military base (I am a Navy daughter.) The movie is long, intense, and complicated: just like the book. Several subplots are cut, of course, but all in all, the movie was VERY fluid.<br/><br/>This movies heavily favors the Ron/Hermione ship and also indicates a Harry/Ginny romance (or lack thereof.)<br/><br/>Honestly, Harry/Hermione in the movies have been SQUASHED.<br/><br/>It is amazing/exciting to see the great lead characters together on the screen all at one time i.e. at Grimmauld place. The actors are EXCELLENT and the Trio have improved greatly since they were young.<br/><br/>Speaking of when they were young, I enjoyed the flashback seen throughout the film... I believed this added such a great continuity to the movies especially since the style of OOTP is VERY DIFFERENT from the others.<br/><br/>I feel the character are really who they should be at this point. I haven't been a fan of Movie!Hermione's girl power character, but in this one I feel that she's been toned down. Also, it's nice to see Rupert's portrayal fit more to the Book!Ron that we've all grown to love. <br/><br/>Evanna Lynch is crazy. Brilliantly crazy.<br/><br/>I am pleased with the style change, however; it is sort of like the jump between COS and POA.<br/><br/>Considering that OOTP was one of my least favorite books, this movie has became my favorite so far. Props to David Yates :)"
"Wetnun","4","5","15","16 July 2007"," Eh, amusing but not great...
","So while it is a continuation of the storyline watching this movie was like opening a book and reading 20 pages somewhere in the middle and then closing it again. While it had a ""plot"" it doesn't really grip you or make you want to see more. There is no dramatic build up and no ""cliff hangers"" to keep you wanting for more when it's done.<br/><br/>Off hand I'd suggest keeping your $10 and just buying the DVD and watching it in series with the other movies. Even then, unless you have the next one I don't know if I'd bother. It has it's shiny moments, but in the end felt like a filler episode in an Anime series.<br/><br/>I should mention that I haven't read the books and have only been watching the movies. So it doesn't matter if there are amazing books for me to compare it to or anything. The book series might be good, but I wouldn't know. So consider this a rather unbiased option of the movie as I tend to watch a lot of movies. :)"
"jrfreeman2006","2","4","11","11 July 2007"," I am so confused!
","The movie has nothing we haven't seen before. The visual effects and acting quality are nothing short of poor. It is at times hard to fallow along with the plot. It seems the director tried to use high points of drama and special effects to make up for a poor plot. If Harry Potter is supposed to be a block buster film you think with the large budget it received it could have come up with a decent plot and hire decent actors. I feel that if someone one tells you this film was good their trying to pull an early Halloween trick on you. In all there is nothing special. Just more high points of drama that attempt to cover up a poorly written script."
"princessmegz","1","2","4","16 November 2007"," completely absurd.
","I have tried in my mind's eye to separate the books from the movie - and I have found that it is simply impossible. Rowling did an absolutely amazing job on the books, and it is never reflected in any of the movies. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an 870 page book, however, apparently 138 minutes should account as a sufficient amount of time to place everything in the book that had any standing or was of any importance to the plot.<br/><br/>Firstly, in the alleyway with Dudley, Harry stabs a dementor in the eye. What?! Where on earth did this come from? I was never aware that you could ward off a dementor with a simple stab of the eye. Thusly, would it not have made sense for Harry to have done this during the third movie as well, instead of having to spend a great deal of time trying to learn and develop his own patronus?<br/><br/>There only seems to be one main character in this movie, which is Harry Potter. Hermione and Ron take a backseat to the ""we're supporting actors with one line each"". Seriously, Yates, give the two friends of Harry a little more screen time, they are important characters in the plot line, or have you not noticed? Ginny's character is not even explored throughout the entirety of the movie, and neither is Neville's. Neville turns out to be quite an important character in the series, especially in deathly hallows.<br/><br/>Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes? What kind of crap was that? A couple fireworks and Fred & George shouting out their new location in Diagon Alley. What happened to the actual fireworks that caused Umbridge her much-deserved stress? What happened to the smart remarks of certain teachers, who kept Umbridge quick on her feet, claiming they hadn't any idea of the authority they had when dealing with said fireworks? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SWAMP? That would have been the most amazing CG in any of the HP movies thus far, and hopefully in the rest of the series. I was totally amped for the swamp, and for Peeves. Speaking of, did they just simply decide to cut Peeves' from the series completely? I'm betting, since we haven't heard from the old poltergeist since Movie 2.<br/><br/>haha, what's with St. Mungo's anyways? No, Neville's parents being tortured to insanity by the Cruciatus Curse is not an important part of the movie. Exploring Neville would have made the movie all the more interesting, including explaining exactly what happened to Frank and Alice Longbottom so that Hermione and Ron know, and it's not just a secret with Harry. Does this not give reason for Neville's battles in Deathly Hallows? How his grandmother tells him that he is in fact his parents' son and to keep fighting? Yes, Neville is important in DH, but apparently it's not important to explore his background anymore than it was to see Arthur Weasley after he got his ""stitches"" and the complete isolation of Harry's personality. We skip from Harry's premonition to Arthur being wheeled in sitting in a wheelchair by Molly, who delivers the lame line of ""Daddy's home!"" (and I was so looking forward to seeing Mungo's and the Welcome Witch).<br/><br/>Then, making the plot only more awful, Harry hears the prophecy by Professor Trelawny in the Department of Mysteries, completely omitting the talk with Dumbledore at the end of the movie. In essence, this was quite an important talk, because it leads into the conversation of exactly WHY Harry is ""destined"" to kill Voldemort, or vice versa, because ""None can live while the other survives"", though Harry knows that because Voldemort simply listened to a<br/><br/>prophecy, he killed Harry's parents and tried to murder Harry as well, but he couldn't. Only by listening to a simple prophecy, Big V made himself his own enemy. By listening to a prophecy, he made his own destiny, when if he'd just left it alone, he wouldn't have failed.<br/><br/>There are a couple more plot sequences left out (or totally made up), such as: - the exploration of Luna Lovegood and Xenophilius Lovegood, as well as the interview by Rita Skeeter for the Quibbler, which was supposed to cause quite a riot under Umbridge's watch. - the random ""thestral feeding"" scene, which is nice, because Luna finally gets more than a couple of lines in. - where did the ten thousand ""educational decrees"" come from? including those like ""No PDA"". - nice try, Dumbledore's Army. The spell Levicorpus is not introduced until Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, where Harry reads the HBP's potions book and notices ""Levicorpus"", ""Liberacorpus"", ""Sectumsempra"", and the spell to cause a buzzing sensation in the ears when you need a muffled conversation. So nice try OotP, these spells are important to the plot of HBP more than OotP, especially in the chapter with Malfoy, Harry, Snape, and Moaning Myrtles Bathroom.<br/><br/>i'm sure there are more than a thousand scenes either cut or unnecessarily put into this catastrophe you could call a movie, but i figure it would be wasting time when real HP lovers know all of them. I do not plan on seeing the HBP or DH movies at all."

","I saw the movie on the premiere. It was great, but why was it only about 2 hours, couldn't they at least stretch it to 2 hours and 30 minute?<br/><br/>I have no problem seeing a film that is 3 hours.<br/><br/>It is so much stuff in these books that is left out, so much that also is funny and important part of the story. I think they should at least get minimum 2 1/2 hours of the next film and the last should be 3 hours or more. The last book I have just read, and it is so much stuff in it that is important, that I hope they make it 3 hours.<br/><br/>This 5th in the series was very exiting, but I missed some stuff.

"fi3r","9","2","4","11 August 2007"," Formidable Adaptation: book reader's review
","Unlike some of the previous Harry Potter (HP) films, mostly uncompromising adaptations which visualised but failed to deliver the charm of the books to the big screen, 'Order of the Phoenix' (OotP) is a film at heart, borrowing from the book but also improvising to recreate the full range of emotions experienced while reading the book. Where the previous films butchered the plot and subplots, often mishandled the crucial moments and overly stepped into banal territory, OotP is oddly satisfying to watch.<br/><br/>OotP, book five, is the thickest book of the entire series. While the first three books were short enough to be adapted to film without neglecting too much (with a honourable mention to 'Prizoner of Azkaban'), book four, the 'Goblet of Fire', fell into the pitfall of becoming a synopsis of the plot, essentially cataloguing the significant events and being notably 'empty'. Thankfully, this film avoids that very pitfall, delivering a fully functioning film that delivers a story full of wonder and adventure that is so characteristic of J. K. Rowling's creation.<br/><br/>Of particular improvement is the overall superior performance by the entire cast. While the adult characters have always been at least adequately portrayed, younger ones (including the main trio) have been mediocre. However, aging (I assume) seems to have greatly improved their performances. Radcliffe does a better-than-ever job of portraying Harry's troublesome journey through adolescence. Evanna Lynch, portraying the dreamy Luna Lovegood, also does an exceptional job and almost outshines her fellow school-mates. Also noteworthy is the near-perfect depiction of the horribly hateable, not to mention pink, Dolores Umbridge by Imelda Staunton. The rest of the Order members, even those that get little screen time, are also well done.<br/><br/>The film is an audio and visual feast. The CGI work is commendable: everything from thrilling magical duels to the unveiling of number 12, Grimmauld place and the adorable and funny Grawp. The soundtrack is also praiseworthy. The characteristic HP 'theme' from the first Chris Columbus film is not overused and the emotional sequences are well accompanied by emotive music. Even the depiction of simple elements such as London, Privet Drive and Hagrid's hut have been improved, making it all seems more realistic rather than pure fantasy to be forgotten upon leaving the cinema.<br/><br/>OotP is a very enjoyable film and many HP readers and non-readers alike are bound to be entertained. To the readers, my advice is to overlook the little 'issues' here and there and to simply enjoy it. Unfortunately, a few non-readers may find themselves confused. This is the intricate problem with adapting the complex book into a mere two hours and eight minutes, and only so much blame can be placed on the film creators. Either way, I strongly recommend you read the book(s) before watching the film. The books are and have always been far superior, and to watch the films first only spoils the books. Overall, this is a very formidable adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as the series becomes more mature, just like Harry, and darker, with the rise of Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to power. The best HP film so far, this one should not be missed."
"Love_Like_Winter_88","8","2","4","7 August 2007"," A good film, just don't read the book first!!
","Separate the book from the film, and this is a good movie as Harry Potter films go. I do have a few complaints (as expected as I read the book first) it moves way too fast, how on earth the non-readers keep up and have the slightest idea whats going on, I have no idea.<br/><br/>What happened to Ron and Hermione? They hardly have any lines, yes Harry is the main character but we love to see 'The Trio' together.. its just not the same with them floating around in the background.<br/><br/>Please can the 'New Dumbledore' act like Dumbledore. He's way too aggressive. I don't blame the actor.... but someone needs to sort this out!<br/><br/>Kreacher was hardly seen and his mumblings were not focused on enough, his character was not portrayed well which is important because of the up-coming films.<br/><br/>Sirius's death was disappointing. It happened quick and didn't really have much affect on the audience. It was a shock, yes, but not sad enough.<br/><br/>Most importantly... The Locket?? We didn't see it at all... Big boo-boo in my opinion as anyone who's read the final book will know. Which means they will have to alter the beginning of the final film somehow.<br/><br/>Just one more, the discovery of the Room Of Requirement was changed, which for me made it seem less special.<br/><br/>OK, I'm done with the bad points! There were plenty of good points also; the music, the effects, the kiss I thought was perfect...although many disagree! All in all I thought it was good (believe it or not!!) I understand they can't put everything in, but changing bits is just not on!"
"svw","7","2","4","3 August 2007"," Solid entertainment and well-laid foundations for a grande finale
","Yes people, it really is well worth seeing this film. For starters, it's totally Quidditch-free. Instead it offers darkly atmospheric spookiness and cleverly executed special effects. The real charm of this film is in the cameo roles. Natalia Tena is a little bit gorgeous as the tomboyish Nymphadora Tonks. Alan Rickman's Snape is magnificent as ever. Helena Bonham Carter virtually steals the movie in her tantalising few minutes on screen as the psychotic Bellatrix Lestrange. Imelda Staunton's relentless, sadistic and pink-clad Dolores Umbridge rules Hogwarts with an iron fist. Filch and Kreacher contribute a few well-judged sneers, and Mark Williams makes a pleasingly eccentric Arthur Weasley. It is extremely pleasant to see a gruff and masculine Rupert Grint just for once, and a low profile, chilled out Emma Watson. Admittedly Daniel Radcliffe's performance leaves something to be desired and Gary Oldman is surprisingly bland. However the parts add up to a pleasing whole, and the foundations are well laid for Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows. 7/10"
"hackinyeti","6","2","4","24 July 2007"," Decent, but no where near faithful to the book.
","First of all I want to slam the people who automatically vote 10's and 1's all the time, like its the greatest or worst movie of all time. I'm sorry, you should really see a lot more films and you'll be surprised that there are better and worse off films than this.<br/><br/>*Potential Spoilers?* OK. Now to my honest opinion. The movie was was ""meh"". Looking at it from a stand alone film, its typical Hollywood eye-candy. I'll admit that a lot of the stuff, such as Grawp, that are still pasty-looking and totally unbelievable, but it gets the point across, which I guess in the end is what really matters. With the fighting towards the end, is a bit lame, just people flicking their wands around with a CGI blast following it. The definitive CGI was in the duel towards the end between the great powers.<br/><br/>Everyone is complaining about the movie totally being watered down, and unfortunately it's too much. Being the shortest film and the longest book, that just doesn't correlate well to the screen. Along with being the shortest, I believe they could have thrown in more detail and still be fine within the usual 2 and half hour time limit. There are many minute details left out through this movie that, because they left them out,the following movies are not going to translate even worse.<br/><br/>The acting is what you can expect from any Potter film. However, as everyone has been saying that Umbridge steals the show, and she does... I about instantly started hating her and wanting to stick that quill, fill in the rest. Otherwise, no real gripes with performances.<br/><br/>Somebody commented on the fact that Hogwarts which seems almost too massive in other films, seems to be all of 2-3 rooms in this. I would just think that you would want a tad bit of continuity of atmosphere. Another subject being the Ministry, which I believe was fairly well done and looks rather believable. *End Spoilers*<br/><br/>Overall this movie lacks in plot, and timing, but makes up for staying on track for the most part and the acting. Not the best Potter, but it conveys the story to move it along."
"tanksmiley","2","2","4","23 July 2007"," I almost left
","This is the only movie that has ever made me consider leaving in the middle. If you have read the book, do not see this movie. It leaves out the most important things in the book, and adds others that are entirely unnecessary. For example, Ron and Hermione's promotion to prefects is left out, Harry, Fred, and George's banishment from quidditch is left out, and pretty much the whole department of mysteries is left out. This was my favorite book in the series, and I was looking forward to this movie more than any of the others. Now I feel cheated. What should have been an amazing display of action and character building turned into a confusing and unreliable portrayal of the book. For those who haven't seen the book, many characters are added without explanation as to who they are or what their importance is. My friend, who hadn't read the book, came out of the theater with many questions that could have easily been answered with adequate directing and screen writing. I'm sure taking an 800 page book and turning it into a two and a half hour movie is hard, but the amount of things left out was not worth cutting time. The only reason I didn't simply get up and leave the theater was because I was looking forward to the battle at the department of mysteries. I figured that the reason so many things were being left out was so that the end could be accurate and full of the interesting things that were in the book. Unfortunately, I was wrong, and I came out of the theater wishing I had never went in. No thumbs up for this one."
"davenportdesigns","8","2","4","22 July 2007"," Very Entertaining, yet Disappointing
","First off, let me start by saying I have not read all of the books. I picked up the first 3 and loved them, but have made a horrible habit of not keeping up with the series. Ignoring that fact, I still make it a point to see these movies as they make their way into the theaters.<br/><br/>Anyways, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, in a nut shell, was amazing. However, as my summary states, I was still somewhat disappointed with it. Mainly because of all the dialogue. The 4 movies prior to this one were crammed full of action, plot twists, etc., while this one was crammed full of talking. Now, I realize that this book apparently was leading up to events in the next novel (which I have not read so I can't spoil anything for you) but I was still expecting more.<br/><br/>Although I was disappointed with the lack of action, I was highly impressed with how dark they made this film seem. Luna seemed like the most morbid character they have yet to bring into the series. She did an amazing job.<br/><br/>The kids playing the roles in these films are doing a fantastic job. I don't think they could have cast a better team to portray these roles. Having said that, I do have a problem with one of the cast members. Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is fantastic actor, but not for a role like Dumbledore. I was under the impression that Dumbledore was to be somewhat laid-back and passive like he was first, played by Richard Harris. Gambon almost seems like he has TOO much energy for role.<br/><br/>All in all, I gave this movie an 8/10. Very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. Great for all ages!"
"SandyKay23","2","2","4","22 July 2007"," If you loved the book...don't see the movie!!
","Unbelievable!! I want my money back. The best thing about this movie was the popcorn! And this is coming from a mom/grandma of a true-blue Harry Potter Fan Family! We have every book...every set of unabridged CDs...every DVD. We have read them all...watched them all...listened to them all while traveling.<br/><br/>Hollywood has taken an extraordinary work of fiction, stripped it of its heart and soul--then attempted to salvage their bland, watered-down, flavorless film with some flashy, banal special effects. When the film ended, I sat there, stunned, disappointed beyond belief. It felt as though I had just watched a long, drawn-out series of crudely strewn together trailers! Afterwards, other fans expressed their astonishment and incredulity at this weak, hollowed out film version of the book.<br/><br/>What were Goldenberg...Yates...Warner Brothers...thinking when they slopped nearly 900 pages into 2 hrs and 18 minutes??? Wouldn't it have been worth an extra hour to salvage the heart of this extraordinary book? Not only have they done a terrible injustice to Rowling's brilliant fifth book in the HP series, but the unbelievable stripping of key elements and fundamental, even crucial details turned this film into an incoherent, disjointed waste of time.<br/><br/>It was fun to see the characters growing up, but even they seemed a bit confused as they kept getting lost in the confusion of the film. As disappointed as I was with the movie, I had to do a gut check later to remind myself that the actors had nothing to do with the bad screenplay.<br/><br/>I hope that since Steve Kloves will be returning to do the screenplay for the sixth book. that he will be able to bridge the gaps in this mess to the Half Blood Prince and give us something as worthwhile as he did in the first four films.<br/><br/>Warner Brothers??? Are you listening???"
"Baldrick44","10","2","4","17 July 2007"," The Best Potter flick so far
","The book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is unwieldy and cluttered, so much so that it is by far the most boring and weak of the books so far. However the movie has taken the ingredients of what could have been a great book and turned them into a great film by trimming off most of the excess fat.<br/><br/>The world of wizardry is in turmoil as Voldermort is seizing power once again. But rather than do something, the Ministry has chosen a stance of aggressive denial, where ideas about Voldemort's return are stamped out through the poisonous representative at Hogwarts Delores Umbridge ( a very unlikeable Imelda Staunton ) whist Voldemort recruits his former Death Eaters, including the insane Bellatrix Lestrange ( Helena Bonham Carter ).<br/><br/>This is a well-put together story; helped by the fantastic cast, all playing their part, particularly Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. But it is the two polar opposites in Snape ( Alan Rickman ) and Sirius ( Gary Oldman ) that steal the show, both of whom Harry shows very different sides of his personality to- and through which new revelations about their characters are unveiled. Their chemistry with Harry in their scenes together is remarkable.<br/><br/>Order of the Phoenix is a great film and it shows that sometimes films can be better than books, even in a massive book franchise like this."
"scattering_like_light","2","2","4","14 July 2007"," The most disappointing movie of the series so far...
","The good bits: Cinematography, lighting and set design is generally excellent, editing is snappy and effective, and Maggie Smith, Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman continue to put in strong(ish) performances, given the weak and dumbed-down script they are forced to work with.<br/><br/>Effects-wise, it lives up to its huge budget, but fireworks and fight scenes don't go on nearly long enough, and many opportunities have been missed for creating that all important Hogwarts and ministry atmosphere. Overhead castle fly-throughs are few and far between.<br/><br/>The less than good bits: This is not a good film, if you are a fan of the books. Some plot lines have been altered, changed, or dispensed with altogether. The film possesses very little of the books intricacies, detail, and charm that make it the phenomenal story it is.<br/><br/>With a few exceptions, the acting is more or less appalling throughout. This we might expect and forgive from actors of little to no experience, and perhaps some of the younger cast, but there is simply no excuse for some seriously 'phoned in' performances from Gambon, Staunton and Fiennes, none of whom appear to have even read the book in passing, and all demonstrate their almost complete lack of understanding about the roles they are playing again and again throughout the film.<br/><br/>Gambon, especially, puts in SUCH an inappropriate and intrinsically weak performance as Dumbledore that I am surprised he was ever asked back for more than one film. He gets successively worse in each one released. I would happily exchange a sense of continuity for using an actor that actually gave a damn about the performance they were giving.<br/><br/>Kreacher was also handled badly, though not in animation or rendering, both of which are excellent, but in voicing, and mannerisms, and the sheer tiny amount of screen time in which he features. Key plot points that should have centred round him are glossed over, ignored, and replaced by other events, and the film loses a great deal because of this.<br/><br/>Likewise, the centaur confrontation is delivered with almost no explanation for what is occurring, no dialogue, and consequently, their featuring in the film is another pointless excuse for a reasonable effects shot, and not much more. Likewise with Grawp, and Hagrid, both of whom are on screen so fleetingly that we wonder why they bothered.<br/><br/>Both Umbridge and Bellatrix are presented with far too much leaning towards comedy, when in fact both of these characters are dangerous psychotics who, in the books, are real and present threats to Harry's life and happiness and who should terrify, rather than amuse and divert.<br/><br/>Of course Dobby should have been there, so should Quidditch, The Quibbler article, and Kreachers deception, among other things, but all these are missed out, and the films re-hashing of the true plot makes it up as it goes along to fill these vital gaps. All very disappointing.<br/><br/>It also makes crucial mistakes like the guard party flying low over the Thames (as if this wouldn't attract Muggle attention and break the very same laws as those Harry is being hauled over hot coals by the ministry for)...<br/><br/>My advice is 'borrow the DVD from a friend when it comes out - it IS worth a look, though only for editing, lighting, sets and cinematography - for all else, read the book, which is an altogether more complete and enjoyable experience'. It also contains the actual plot, which is far superior to the 'vaguely related' screenplay we see here. Or better still - buy the audio books, in which Stephen Fry's 170+ vocal characterisations consistently surpass, if not entirely blow away the 'acting' we have on offer here.<br/><br/>I am afraid I must 'confess myself disappointed' that David Yates has already signed to do 'Half Blood Prince'. I rather dread what he might do, or leave out, with that."
"dealea","7","2","4","12 July 2007"," Everyone Deserves an Opinion
","Whoever said plot and missing parts of a story unimportant can be very wrong. Yes, this was a good movie with good action scenes. But that seems to be a major problem. It seems that too much time was spent on action scenes and special effects. I wanted more storyline fleshed out. I also had a problem with the choppiness of the film. Many of my friends agree that it needed more fluidity. Especially because of viewers, who do not read the book. Those who have not will have difficulties following the plot and story.<br/><br/>Here are just a few examples. The movie doesn't explain much and glances over meaningful moments that help you to understand the characters and the complications of real life. (SPOILER) ie. Harry's perception of his father. He goes from being horrified to learn that his father was not perfect and could be a bully to not seeming to care in the next scene. Also, seriously missing was that element of alienation that Harry felt in school that contrasted heavily with the earlier period of life where he was annoyingly hero worshiped by everyone.<br/><br/>Okay I will stop blathering on about my criticisms. This is definitely a must see for readers of the book despite its many lacking qualities, however, I highly advise non-readers to avoid the movie. By seeing the movie without reading the book you will miss out on so much of the story and its realistic edginess.<br/><br/>But then this is just one person's opinion."

","I can still remember the thrill of reading my first Harry Potter book. I was slow starter - the first three books were already out by then. What made the books so enthralling was that the magic was presented matter-of-fact and without fanfare which made it at once seem all the more believable and more exciting. While I haven't disliked any of the films and actually enjoyed parts of all them, this is the first Harry Potter movie that made me feel the magic all over again. Yes, there will be a lot of complaints about what was left out, but what was put in was way more important. For the first time, parts of the film are actually subtle and give you pause for thought. A single glance conveys the information from many pages of text. The cast is as fine as usual, but Imelda Staunton (Delores Umbridge) is brilliant!"

","There were many things left out of the movie, that made the book an interesting read. HOWEVER, I loved the movie because it stayed true to the central plot of the book and carried that theme throughout.<br/><br/>Movies, by nature, cannot incorporate every detail from a book when an adaptation is made. What they can do however, is put in the most important plot points and try to capture the essence of the book OoTP does this very well in my opinion. If you were to tell someone what the plot of the book was, the details you wouldn't forget, were those that made it into the movie--they moved the plot forward. The details and plot points that didn't make it in, while enriching in the book, would have added too many unnecessary details to the movie.<br/><br/>Why 9/10 and not 10/10? A few things: Harry's final talk with Dumbeldore should have been more explanatory--there was time, and in the book it explained some important series plot points. No ghosts...i like the ghosts; they help Hogwarts feel fantastic and add to the aura of magical wonder (I do not agree with those who say that the magic is gone, its just a different type of magic).<br/><br/>See the movie its definitely worth your time and money. Read the book its definitely worth your time and money. To blame the movie for not being exactly the same as the book is beyond silly and takes away from all that is good in the movie."
"shelleysharp","9","2","4","12 July 2007"," Oscar Prediction
","I feel this film is good on so many levels I wouldn't be surprised, like Return of the King, if it earns an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and Supporting Actress Imelda Staunton. Stands alone as a major motion picture, and not just a kid film. My daughter argues that she didn't feel enough character development, however, even in this coming of age book, the focus is on Harry's' inner turmoil and the theme that hardship and tragedy make you stronger. As more characters have been introduced by Rowling, it is Harry's growth and maturity that remain at the center of the story and I felt that Director David Yates captured this beautifully, along with some fine performances from Daniel Radcliff, Staunton, Alan Rickman, and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood."
"hcstrakna","5","2","4","12 July 2007"," Funny yet Disappointing
","I could not have been more excited to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I am a die hard Harry Potter fan, and have been waiting about a year for this film. The ads looked awesome, and that just added to the excitement.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>The beginning I think was rushed WAY too much. The actor who played Duddley was awful and they don't even explain how Mrs. Figg is a squib. They act like anyone who hasn't read the book is supposed to already know. There is no cleaning Sirius's house, and no Ron and Hermionie prefects. They skipped the entire train ride. There was very little dialog and characters that we thought were important were seen as extras. They spent half the time on the new headmaster and not enough on anything else. We don't see MR. Weasley in the hospital and I wouldn't have even realized that he'd really been attacked if I hadn't read the book. Snape's worst memory, a vitally important chapter, was by far my favorite part of the book was but a five second scene. There is no Harry being upset about people telling him he's like his father.<br/><br/>When they finally get to the department of mysteries, the whole place collapses. I don't recall that ever happening in the book. Sirius's death is bland. I was expecting to cry, but was actually more likely to laugh than anything. He gets Avada Kedevrad (sp?) and just falls through the veil. After that, they don't say anything about his death at all as if it never happened.<br/><br/>The parts that were good were the DA, detention, Fred and George, and the acting. Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable and very funny at times, but should have been about 30 minutes longer."
"bmoredlj","9","2","4","12 July 2007"," Rather (Love)Good Film
","I've been to a lot of blockbusters lately - Spider-Man 3, Pirates 3, Die Hard 4. But Harry Potter 5 was the first one whose line actually busted a block; going all the way around it by the time the doors opened for the 10:15 show at the Senator. I figured this show wouldn't be as hectic as the midnight showing, but since this was the first day the film was out, I should have known better. This was no ordinary line of moviegoers, either. Nearly half of them were sporting the usual magical garb.<br/><br/>So, the movie. It's odd-numbered, and so, like the first and third movies, I expected it to be good. I can say rather confidently that it was slightly better than good. It did an outstanding job of covering everything crucial to the saga, without feeling rushed or slow. The pace of the movie was very nice. The production design was almost telepathic; I found settings I had conjured in my mind while reading them respectfully recreated in even greater detail than even Rawling could have imagined.<br/><br/>This film could not cover everything in the book, but since I haven't read the book since it came out, nothing stood out as conspicuously missing. The infamous Quidditch World Cup scene from Goblet - where we never get to see a second of quidditch - was so jarring and inexplicable, it basically ruined that fourth film for me. But Phoenix is a much smarter, much more logical movie; it cut what wasn't needed and, like I said, kept what was necessary.<br/><br/>The characters, as usual, are spot on, to borrow a term from the Brits. The main trio is getting older, and they're becoming better actors. I was absolutely smitten with Luna Lovegood, unquestionably my favorite Hogwarts student. The choice of actress was absolutely perfect, as his her portrayal of the spacey yet oddly perceptive girl with striking features. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between her and Potter in particular. Luna's character may be straightforward, but easily the deepest and most intriguing of Harry's friends.<br/><br/>I was also glad Sirius Black had some screen time, although still not as much as he deserved. Of course, he was nothing but a CGI face in a fire in Goblet, so it was good to just see him again. <br/><br/>Dolores Umbridge is also, well, just as I expected her. I'm glad they didn't go with a hideous, toad-like woman with CGI features, that would have more closely followed the illustration of her in the book; the fact that on the surface she actually looks like a sweet, kind woman makes her all the more chilling as she puts the vice-grips to Hogwarts and makes Harry open his veins.<br/><br/>Astonishing how far the film series has grown with these characters, both in mood and style. The first film was light and whimsical, mirroring the characters' youth and innocence. This is the darkest film yet in the franchise, darker even than the fourth. But enough about the fourth movie; this one was far, far better film, if for nothing else, because it was coherent. It covered so much material so well. I'll probably see it again."
"fireflyza","8","2","4","12 July 2007"," Not quite what I expected but BRILLIANT non the less!!
","After watching Goblet of Fire, I will admit I was disappointed with the execution of the movie. I will further denote, that this is due to reading too hard into the book. I was expecting a play by playÂ… word for word and was horribly disenchanted when this turned out to not be the case. Some wise words were passed on to me, ""It is based on the book, its not the book"" With OotP on the way I finished reading the book, but did not fool myself into thinking it is going to play out the way I want it too.<br/><br/>My hats off to you David Yates, you pulled it off. The 5th instalment of the most, in my opinion, enticing series of books to hit the selves in a long time was well worth the anticipation.<br/><br/>I will acknowledge that sitting, watching the movie, you do real off the scenes in your head of what should and what should not be happening. Any avid supporter of the Harry Potter series would. But as the movie carries on, with its climaxes, excellent cinematography and stunning CGI, you can't help but enjoy.<br/><br/>My review my count for naught as a critic, but as a true enthusiast and constant lover of the books and movies. Give it a chance. Even if you have to see it twice, it is worth it!"

","I just watched this movie on the first night in theaters, July 11, 07, and this movie was a big let down. Besides absolutely nothing happening throughout this movie, the movie itself seemed dank and dull. The lighting was set at a low apparently as the whole movie seemed kind of colorless. The movie is lacking a LOT of action and has many plot holes that have not been filled. One particular part I cant stand is the fact they introduce the ""Order"", a secret society formed by Dumbledor himself, but after the beginning scene with HORRIBLE GREEN SCREEN EFFECTS you never really see them again. You capture a glimpse at the ending fight scene where ___________ dies. Another is the fact the overall tone and energy of the movie seemed missing. It almost appeared to me like the actors were having a bad day when filming this movie. The movie seemed based on the book and according time lined fairly properly. There appeared to be a ""deleted scene"" or ""blooper"" almost as me and my buddies had pointed out where they show Harry, Hermione, and Ron, laughing away at some little joke on emotions. It turns out its actually supposed to be there... apparently.<br/><br/>Terrible Green screen when flying.... and also with computer graphics. Did this director ever see transformers??? cause it rocked this movie for effects and graphics!<br/><br/>Overall I was kind of let down. Everything happened WAY to fast... Seemed much like the movie Eragon if anyone remembers it.<br/><br/>Effects: 6/10 (nothing cool... animations SUCKED, green screen FAKE LIKE NO OTHER!) Plot: 7/10 good but lacking. Movie: 6.5 /10 A let down to harry potter fans. Nothing good happens, no action at all really. I sat FULLY BACK lounged during this movie.<br/><br/>Comments are written by: http://kanazky.com"
"Review_IT","5","2","4","11 July 2007"," The worst in the series so far
","It seems that this is a go-between movie. There are a lot of moments in the movie where they look back on things already happened in previous episodes. With this movie works up to a confrontation with Voldemort in a later episode.<br/><br/>The HP franchise falls victim to so many of its counterparts (series of movies), it can not keep up the quality of some of the earlier episodes. Also the main characters are getting a bit too old for their role. This will be even more so in following episodes.<br/><br/>Thanks to all the hype this movie will be a success, but it will leave a lot of its viewers with a sense that there was something lacking."
"strawberryswirl123","6","2","4","11 July 2007"," What?!
","(Major spoilers!!)<br/><br/>I must admit, I had quite high expectations after many months of anticipation. However, I was quite disappointed.<br/><br/>Sure the time constraint meant that things had to be cut out, but I really didn't expect THAT much to be cut!<br/><br/>They briefly visited the Black house, without the portrait of Black's wailing mother - and completely disregarded the storyline of Creature the house elf betraying Harry through the Flo network fireplace. I was also looking forward to the cleaning of the house, where they find all sorts of creatures around. Sure it wasn't necessary, but it would have made it a hell of a lot more entertaining.<br/><br/>What really bugged me was the Department of Mysteries scene at the end. No revolving rooms or injuries to any other character besides Harry! I did think the flying brain thing was a bit lame, but they could have made the fight scene between them and the Death Eaters a bit more extensive. The possession scene was very well executed (a bit corny, but you get that), however the golden statues didn't spring to life! Surely that wouldn't have hard-pressed the time at all. The entire climax seemed to go over in a flash. No pun intended.<br/><br/>One major part also ignored was St Mungo's with Neville's parents, and the fact that Trelawney was the person who said the prophecy.<br/><br/>All the little things that made the book interested were cut! No quidditch, no follow up on Cho Chang, no second trip to Hogsmeade. The entire movie just felt like a monotone storyline, that was way too rushed.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was still a very good movie, however the book, by far, surpasses it. I say bring back a previous director."
"kadaj_ff_2006","9","2","4","11 July 2007"," Movie 5 and book 7!
","I saw the movie is was good but, the book was really large they cut a lot of things, also the movie is the shortest of harry potter, the movie is 2:18 long.<br/><br/>The battle of dumbledore and voldemort was incredible, fantastic, awesome and really cool. I LOVE THE Part that voldemort gets inside of harry potter it's was very sentimental.<br/><br/>The book 7 is gonna be very interesting I have my own theorys. Do you want the meaning of the word hallow? here it is:<br/><br/>Hallow is a word usually used as a verb, meaning ""to make holy or sacred, to sanctify or consecrate, to venerate"". However, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the word hallows appears as a noun. In modern English, the word is used as a noun in ""All Hallows' Day"" or ""All Saints' Day,"" which is the day after Hallowe'en or ""All Hallows' Eve"". Hallows can refer to saints, the relics of saints, or the relics of gods. One story where hallows play a crucial role is in the grail legend. In the Grail legend, the Fisher King is the guardian of the four hallows, which include the Grail itself, the serving dish/or stone, the sword/or dagger, and the spear. Many scholars have since identified the connection of these four hallows with four treasures of the Tuatha de Danaan, which include a chalice (Grail), a baton or wand (spear), a pentacle (serving dish), and a sword.<br/><br/>There has been much speculation from many Harry Potter fans about whether the grail legend might play a part in the final Harry Potter book. Many Harry Potter fans have seen a connection between the four founders of Hogwarts, their relics, and the four hallows in the grail legend. It is known from the books that Godric Gryffindor's relic is a sword, Helga Hufflepuff's relic is a cup (chalice), and Salazar Slytherin's relic is a locket (pentacle), presumably leaving Rowena Ravenclaw's relic as a spear or wand. In addition, many scholars have argued that the four hallows in the Grail legend symbolize the four natural elements (earth, fire, water, and air). J. K. Rowling has explicitly stated that the four Hogwarts founders represent the four natural elements. Presumably Helga Hufflepuff and her house Hufflepuff connects with earth (the house's symbol is a Badger), Rowena Ravenclaw and Ravenclaw with air (the symbol is a bird), Salazar Slytherin and Slytherin with water and Godric Gryffindor and Gryffindor with fire (fire is often associated with protection from evil in Harry Potter, for example it is used to combat Inferi). This solidifies the connection between the four founders and the four hallows in the Grail legend. It is also known that Harry Potter must find four horcruxes, and that Voldemort wanted a hallow, or relic, from each of the four founders."
"sandrabw22","5","2","4","11 July 2007"," Harry Potter a disappointment
","So many things. Where to begin. With the camera work... most of the time the camera was moving so fast..It would have been so much better if you could have focused on the scenes. It was fine in those fight scenes, but elsewhere, it needed a slower hand at the camera. Maybe a tripod, you know that's what they were invented for. And then the thing about Choe..really...talk about killing an opportunity. The Ministry of Magic was a maze to get to the Hall of Prophecy in the book. But no, BAM ! and we are there! in the movie. What a disappointment. Although I must say I thought they did a great job of showing the way Sirius went into the veil. Although, the death curse was not used in the book, he was knocked into the veil by a lesser curse. The young lady playing Luna was great. Good for whomever chose her. Better explanations were needed for many things in this movie. If you hadn't read the book, you would have been totally lost as to why this or that was happening. There are other frustrating things with this movie but I have vented enough for one night."
"evanthompson1984","Null","2","4","11 July 2007"," The Fifth Movie
","To tell you the truth. I was very disappointed with the movie. I entire movie was rushed. There were some cool effects and Voldemort was freakin awesome but I just hate it when they change things in the movie that aren't even in the book. For instance, Neville finding the ""Room of Requirement"". We all now it was Dobby that told Harry about it. I know its small but to a True Harry Potter fan it's like a stab in the back when they do that. I also wish they put more stuff in the Ministry. I wish they added more of the Rooms and all that cool stuff. I love the fifth book and the screenwriter just freaked it all up. I hope that whoever writes the screenplay for the sixth book does it justice. I'm out!!!!!"

","I was highly exited to go see this movie and was ready to be in awe. I found it to be excellent in cinematography and the effects were absolutely up to par ,but the story line falls way short of J.K.'s writing, loosing far too much of the plot and jumping from scene to scene leaving someone whom has not read the books wondering what is missing and leaving someone whom has read the book dumbfounded as to why so much of the story has been cut and re-written . I recommend seeing the movie to those whom have not read the book for the effects and to somewhat try and follow the main story line of the movies. As for those whom have read the book, I suggest not having any expectations what so ever, so you will be less dissatisfied. As to the producers, director, actors, and anyone else who may be involved with The Half Blood Prince : Look at the first movie for what to do, and this movie for what not to do."
"tristen19","8","2","4","11 July 2007"," Book fans will be disappointed
","My expectations going into the midnight screening of HP 5 were that not everything from the book would be in the movie. I learned this early on, seeing that even the movie based on the shortest book, Sorceror's Stone, did not include everything. However, what I did not expect was that vital scenes would be cut, hardly anything explained, and perfectly good story lines changed!<br/><br/>The acting I have to say was much better than previous movies. Daniel Radcliffe offers up an excellent portrayal of Harry and Imelda Staunton got Doloris Umbridge right on. The special effects were pretty cool as well, although I felt at some points it masked the story line. What they did with the newspaper headlines was cool, but not needed. The best part was seeing certain things come to life (!!SPOILERS!!): Ministry of Magic, the Black House, Kreacher, Grawp, Snape's memory, and a few other things.<br/><br/>Disappointments: (MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!!!)<br/><br/>-Dementors look different from their appearance in earlier HP films; they looked exactly how they were supposed to before, why change it?? -Harry was supposed to tell his aunt and uncle about the dementors which is where we find out that Aunt Petunia actually knows about them. -Harry finds the people from Order in the kitchen at Private Drive, not at his bedroom door. -The Black House appears because you envision the address, not because Mad-Eye Moody hits the ground with his staff. -St. Mungo's hospital is completely left out of the film which is actually how we find out about Neville's parents. -Dobby is completely left out of the film as well. In the book, he's the one that tells Harry about the Room of Requirement (which only appears after you walk by the wall 3 times!) -Kiss scene is way overdone- it's not THAT important to the story! -Cho Chang did not tell Umbridge about Dumbledore's Army, her friend did. There was also supposed to be a hex put on the paper to show who told. -What happened to Quidditch?? -There is absolutely no mention of Hermione and Ron becoming prefects! -Rita Skeeter and the Quibbler interview are totally left out. -Grawp is friendly in the movie and does not speak. In the book, he is mean (like a giant would be) and learns to speak. -Ministry of Magic: movie does not show how they got into the room full of prophecies. They completely skipped over the revolving room surrounded by doors and the room with the brains. The Order did not enter the room through the veil, but from stairs leading into the room (also, Dumbledore was with them). Neville dropped the prophecy, not Lucius Malfoy. No one heard the prophecy- Dumbledore told Harry what it said later. The fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort is low-key and quite short.<br/><br/>There are actually several other things, but I don't deem them as important as some of the things listed above.<br/><br/>Although I have listed several disappointments (from my point of view), everyone should still go see the movie. Book fans may be disappointed, but it's still entertaining to see parts of the book come to life. Non-book fans will not know that anything's missing and will probably enjoy (although they may get confused). The movie is NOT 2.5 hours long. With previews (I would guess 10-15 min. of them), it's only 2.25 hours long, making the movie about 2 hours by itself."

All in all quite good. <br/><br/>The acting has really improved but I was disappointed that Ron and Hermione weren't in it all that much. I don't think Luna was as dreamy and ""weird"" as she was in the book but still very similar. <br/><br/>-SPOILER WARNING- <br/><br/>I also didn't like how they used the AK curse to kill Sirius.

Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge is a great addition to the movie, the character successfully makes me hate her. This is the most emotional movie so far, especially between Harry and Sirius, his parents, Voldemort, and his friends.<br/><br/>The visual effects need improvement. During fighting scenes, the villains look like they are holding back.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1) How did they know that Harry used magic in front of his cousin? If they could find out, how about Hagrid in the first movie, the flying car in the second movie, or when Harry inflated Aunt Marge Dursley?
2) Hogwarts students sometimes hate Harry, love Harry, trust Harry, call him liar, bully him, or adore him according to the plot.
3) Could they use some kind of magic or potion or plant or object to see Harry's past in order to prove him that he was totally innocent of using magic in front of his cousin? They could use truth serum.
4) Could the prophecy be used to predict Voldemort's arrival?
5) If the students could not even perform expelliarmus, stupefy, or any basic charms, what did they learn then? Even the Weasley twins could not do anything or serve as a teacher for Dumbledore's army.
6) If Voldemort-level threat was coming, why did senior students of Hogwarts not do something?
7) Harry had more experiences in heroism, but his magical skills was almost at the same level as other students.
8) How could Harry and friends get to London so easily and fast? They even got into the Department of Mysteries very easily without anyone noticing.
9) How did Bellatrix know about Nevile?
10) The Death Eaters could not defeat nor harm the children.
11) Lucius could have easily taken the prophecy from Harry.
12) Why was only Bellatrix perform a dangerous charm?
13) Bellatrix or any other Death Eaters could have easily defeated or killed more protagonists.
14) Bellatrix teleported without using any Floo Powder or mentioning the destination.
15) Lupin let harry chase Bellatrix by himself.
16) Harry was (and friends were) luckily saved just in time, as always.
17) What took the Aurors so long?
18) Why did the Dementors attack Harry and his cousin?
19) Why did Harry and friends go to the Department of Mysteries, not the place of the order?

","When reviewing Order of the Phoenix it would be unfair not to take into account the fact that the source material is an 800+ page book, and the difficulties this must've presented in selectively cramming the story into a film with little over 2 hour runtime. Many cherished chapters from the book are omitted screen time, but I suppose David Yates does a good job in bringing to life those chapters that have merited inclusion.<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton is not the most well known actress but she does a brilliant job in portraying one of the most hate-able characters in literature history (Dolores Umbridge of course). Helena Bonham Carter is also cast perfectly as Bellatrix Lestrange. The film doesn't do any justice whatsoever for characters such as Tonks however, and I've always felt the relationship between Harry and Sirius is never fully developed on screen, minimising the impact of the climax of Order of the Phoenix. The duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort is outstanding however and not only rescues the finale of the film but adds an extra star onto this rating.<br/><br/>Overall Order of the Phoenix probably doesn't do enough to avoid the wooden spoon in my Harry Potter rankings.

He and Hermin, Ron still works side by side, even helping students who don't believe in him or even hate him to learn magic.

","Just like it's predecessor, The Order of The Phoenix is unforgivably short and should definitely have been made into two separate films.

The ending is actually quite difficult to follow if you are not well acquainted with the books, and if you are, you would no doubt be heavily disappointed with the telling of this story. The portrayal of Grawp is another huge disappointment that is completely unacceptable given the quality of the CGI throughout the rest of this movie.<br/><br/>Despite not being much of a fan of the books, I can certainly feel the frustration of those who cherish this series. I actually think the movies work better for people who haven't read the books and can just take everything at face value without the agony of comparison. It's a shame Peter Jackson wasn't able to get his hands on this series as it could have been so much better. One thing I will say however is that Daniel Radcliffe deserves a lot of praise for his development throughout the series. I found him painful in the first two films but since then he has flourished in the role and has helped me enjoy the series an awful lot more."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) is the first of the last four Harry Potter films to be directed by David Yates. This works well in my opinion, as the atmosphere across the last four films felt highly homogeneous.<br/><br/>Number five in the series in one of the darkest, but it works well for the premise of the film adaptations. The simultaneous strength and humility of Harry is brilliantly portrayed by Yates in this.<br/><br/>As usual with these films, the technical merits are top notch, with wonderful supporting cast of Gambon, Rickman and Smith, and of course wonderful visuals and music. A magical and dark adventure."

","""Harry"" has an extra-curricular experience with a ""Dementor"" which draws the attention of the newly rejuvenated Ministry of Magic and after a show trial in which he is ably defended by ""Prof. Dumbledore"" our trio return to a school that is all but under martial law. A new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher (a rather Margaret Thatcher-esque Imelda Staunton) is taking over the school by degree, imposing strict rules that merely serve to encourage the pupils to go underground to learn the more practical skills that will be needed if they are ever to face and defeat the evil ""Voldemort"". All of the characters from the previous stories are now knitting together much better; I still miss Richard Harris as ""Dumbledore"" but Stauton is as magnificently evil as Emma Thompson is wonderfully pathetic and we have a cracking battle at the end. Our wizards are now fully cognisant of the dangers they face and have a much clearer idea of the enemy, too. David Yates does better, I think, in condensing this super-long novel into one film; again a two-parter would probably have done better justice to the detail and nuances of the JK Rowling story; but we get more than enough of the gist of the story to make do. Great stuff."

","Things are indeed getting darker in the world of Potter. In ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" both the mood and color scheme are grim, gray and black. There is pink, as a matter of fact, but this belongs to the first female villain of the literary and film series.<br/><br/>The much-awaited film has a new director in British TV vet David Yates, and he and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg do a respectable job in keeping novelist J.K. Rowling's story on course. The problem, though, lies in that story and its course.<br/><br/>This is the fifth -- and longest at 800 pages -- book on which a ""Harry Potter"" film has been based. Consequently, this is a movie that feels like a reunion in a train station, in which even more characters get introduced and old friends revisited, making for a bewildering array of personages to keep track of even for those paying close attention. Then there is the fact that this book -- and movie -- is a watershed of backstory, revelations and plot clarifications before heading into the two remaining chapters. So while ""Phoenix"" is a necessary film, it's quite possibly the least enjoyable of the lot so far.<br/><br/>Which will not keep the multitudes from the multiplexes. Harry Potter is now a certifiable brand. Even the release of Rowling's climactic seventh book in three weeks' time and its promise to resolve all the loose ends will deter no one from checking out this behind-the-curve movie version.<br/><br/>Funnily enough, ""Phoenix"" ends up with everyone realizing what we, the audience, realized at the close of the last film, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" -- that the film's great but to this point almost ephemeral villain, Lord Voldemort, has returned. Only it takes another 138 minutes for everyone, save Harry, to truly comprehend this fact. Consequently, looking back, when the series is finally completed, ""Phoenix"" might go down as the problematic film, full of plot but little fun.<br/><br/>""Phoenix"" begins in a glum mood with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, looking definitely older and more mature) moping about during summer holiday in the blighted land of the Muggles. His use of a bit of magic to save, of all people, his truly despised cousin Dudley results in an almost instant letter of expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for use of magic outside of school.<br/><br/>Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) rushes to his successful defense in court, but upon his return to school, he finds that most students, other than pals Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), steer clear of him. Even Dumbledore shies away.<br/><br/>Harry suffers from nightmares, but even worse is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the poisonous-in-pink Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton). She is the amalgamation of all our worst high school teachers, a chronically strict and arrogant instructor who hands down decrees without the slightest concern for their impact.<br/><br/>It seems there is a political war afoot in which the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), is in severe denial about Voldemort's return. He prefers to view it as a rebellion by the school, its headmaster and that odious boy Harry. So the movie boils down to a series of moves and countermoves between a blind administration and a repressed student body.<br/><br/>There are several eye-catching moments here, some featuring otherworldy creatures, magic duels to the death, a clandestine though illicit wizardry school operated by Harry and rides through nighttime London skies. But the magic -- movie magic, that is -- is mostly missing in this outing."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth instalment of our boy wizards adventures and this time, it's getting even more dark. Yes Harry is back again with his magic world right behind him, well actually that really isn't the case here. With the events that took place in the preceding film, Harry is up against seemingly everyone in this movie, and the angst of some of these teenagers is sky high too. The movie is awesome. It's the kind of movie that after 10 times of watching it never gets boring.<br/><br/>Harry's year at Hogwarts is full of thrills but also a lot of fun, the epic battle scenes were just that epic although mostly confined to the beginning and the end with the middle being the funnier parts. That said the funny parts are pretty hysterical and characters such as Neville Longbottom yet again step it up with Matthew Lewis becoming a regular feature to the gang. This is the first time I feel that Harry doesn't just need Ron and Hermione, he actually needs a lot of his fellow students and it makes it a much bigger film because of it. The trio and all the young cast members are great in this film.<br/><br/>The film doesn't go crazy with new additions, but it does conjure up quite a few. The most impressive and absolutely spot on of these is Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge who's annoying persona and very shall we say, unorthodox methods make for a more intriguing character and a hard one to play but done very well by Staunton. Gary Oldman is back in person for this one and he adds to the wealth of the cast, this is the biggest when it comes to showing off British acting talent and really shows it off in a bright light for all to see.<br/><br/>Now David Yates is brought in for this one and I do think he does great, he manages to get the best performances of the series out of the returning cast so far especially Daniel Radcliffe and Gary Oldman. With Order of the Phoenix being such a huge book, it is a surprise that this is so short compared to what fans expected, but it works in it's favour, it tries not to dwell on certain parts too long and the sustained parts of talking would not have been good made even longer.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the effects used in this movie, the massive scenes are there and the epic scale of the movie and it's budget are plain to see, but it doesn't go over the top with special effects in the middle, creating a kind of movie that feels real and tangible in a weird way . Nicolas Hooper score is solid, it works well because it doesn't contain those sweet snippets of song so often seen in the first movies but doesn't go all dark on us either, he balances it nicely so that the scenes move nicely with the music and long periods of just the score can work well too.<br/><br/>I think Order of the Phoenix is one of the best Harry Potter films and continues it's trend of just consistently great storytelling, it may not make the book fans the happiest bunch with the amounts cut out, but this film is still as a movie, a great entry into the franchise. Would recommend it to anyone, definitely one that even though is pretty dark stuff, can still be enjoyed by the whole family and importantly, even the little kids too."

","(Even) people who are basically supportive of the whole Potter concept who return to this film 12 years down the line may perhaps feel a little justified in asking quite what all the fuss was about! And a reasonable answer would probably be that the films garnered the praise - and earned the huge sums - they did back then, because they followed hot on the heels of the books, of which each successive film version had inevitably to be more and more of a fragmentary representation of what the author wrote (which also in fact began to be inspired by the on-screen characters in some amazing synergy).<br/><br/>This two-hour movie really offers just a flavour of what is in the brick of a book whose title it shares, and quite a bit of the fun goes out in that way (notably much of the aspect dealing with day-to-day schooling in Hogwarts). Admittedly, this is now a changed school for young wizards, and class-act Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge does her stuff pretty well.<br/><br/>In contrast, the non-actor status of many portraying students is (now at least) all too clear, though we are inclined to forgive them this, I feel. People who CAN act like Maggie Smith, Robert Hardy and (an almost-overacting) Alan Rickman get remarkably little screentime, while Gary Oldman (in his last appearance as Sirius Black) does himself no particular favours. Ditto Michael Gambon.<br/><br/>Robbie Coltrane is pretty invisible this time, as the butchered-story film offers Hagrid little to do; though a few people on screen for just a few minutes do make their mark, notably Jason Isaacs as Malfoy senior (Junior appears for just a few seconds) and Helena Bonham-Carter as Bellatrix, as well as (on the good side) Evanna Lynch as a superb Luna Lovegood and Natalia Tena as Tonks.<br/><br/>The cinematic presentation of Hogwarts does not have much new to offer in ""Phoenix"" (indeed it all seems far more impressionistic than in previous instalments); but it has to be admitted that there remains a massive gulp of pride for Brits as we are reminded in 2 awe-insipring London skyline flying scenes that Hogwarts is in our country. The juxtaposition of Muggle and wizarding worlds was always a joy of Rowling's presentation (as of course were the starts of each volume with the Dursleys so sadly butchered in most of the films, though here extended a little thanks to the need to present the reasonably impressive dementor attack on the odious - but here slightly more sympathetic - Dudley, played by Harry Melling).<br/><br/>The presentation of the Ministry of Magic is also quite awesome, most especially when it reappears in the final battle scenes that at last seem to leave the more-pedestrian behind and give us some genuine excitement and wonder.<br/><br/>Fred and George's bye-bye to Hogwarts - accompanied by a brief burst of amazingly motivating music from Nicholas Hooper - is the true joyous highlight of the film, though even that seems like it might have been just a bit squeezed, ""in order to fit it in"".<br/><br/>As a standalone movie, David Yates's ""Order of the Phoenix"" movie cannot be said to deserve too many laurels. As part of the series it of course has its place, and as visual tribute to one instalment of a genuinely world-beating and unique series of novels for kids of all ages it does better. But, money-spinners as they may be, these movies must with the benefit of hindsight be deemed to play second fiddle to the immaculately-plotted and wittily-authored Rowling books. Those who have still not read the latter are definitely advised to reserve a couple of months and indulge..."

","Are there any of you out there who really love the Harry Potter movies but wish they were shorter and funnier? Your favorite of the eight-part series will probably be the fifth: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Clocking in at twenty minutes less than the previous movie, several montages, set to new composer Nicholas Hooper's lively and comedic music, help move the plot along. This is the only installment Steve Kloves didn't write, and the new screenwriter Michael Goldenberg tries to turn the film into as much of a comedy as he can, probably to console the audience after the dark ending of the previous film. As the students grow older and battle their raging hormones, the audience gets to laugh at them and relax.<br/><br/>Joining the cast is Imelda Staunton, playing a sickeningly sweet and secretly sadistic new teacher. She plays her part so well, it's almost impossible to believe she played different, sympathetic roles in her career. With their new hormones, new haircuts, and new teenage angst, the students band together to form a secret club to rebel against their new teacher and the organization she represents. They practice combat spells, and while there are quite a few pratfalls in those sequences, it's a reminder to the audience to treasure their laughter while they can. The next few movies will be considerably darker and more violent.<br/><br/>There is a bit of violence towards the end of this movie, so if you're watching it with little kids, you might want to encourage them to fall asleep before it's over or give them a warning of what's about to happen. Helena Bonham Carter makes her first appearance in this movie, and without spoiling what happens, be prepared to absolutely hate her.<br/><br/>One of the plot points in this film involves the link between the hero and villain, through mind control. Since Harry has some secrets he doesn't want Ralph Fiennes to discover, he attends special mind control training with Professor Snape. These scenes were easily the most interesting in the novel, and while they're considerably paired down in the movie, they give the audience a taste of what they've been craving the most: insight into Snape's character. It's been an ongoing struggle wondering whether he's a bad guy or not, and since Alan Rickman captures all his nuances it's impossible to tell for certain. Is he Hans Gruber from Die Hard or Colonel Brandon from Sense and Sensibility? This movie won't tell you, but you'll get to see some brief flashbacks of his schoolboy days at Hogwarts to help you make up your mind. If you like these scenes, you'll really enjoy the next movie, but for now, enjoy what's generally referred to as ""The Riverdance One"".<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. During some of the montages and mind control training sessions, there are some spinning or twirling visuals. Also, when Harry dreams about the dark hallway, the camera is in his POV for a few seconds, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, there's some upsetting violence at the end of the movie, so I'd wait until my kids were pre-teens before letting them watch it."

","The boy with the lightning-bolt scar and his playmates return to Hogwarts for a fifth term, having sprouted almost overnight into young adults. Daniel Radcliffe has undergone the most striking change, filling out his robes with broad shoulders and a strong jawline, which ties in well with his character's pubescent bouts of temper and gloom. As the kids have matured, so has the filmmaking. This entry continues the franchise's trend towards the serious, both in plot and technique. Harry learns more about his parents' personalities, realizes they may not have been the virtuous angels he once believed, launches a private rebellion against a strict new professor and investigates members of the opposite sex. The school grounds feel more ancient and formidable, the dialog less fluttering and whimsical, the action scenes far better realized. That last note has been a trouble spot for the series so far, as it's struggled to master believable special effects over the years. They've finally managed it this time: the large-scale wizarding battle at the end of the film is head and shoulders above anything we've seen so far.<br/><br/>Some knowledge of the books is a prerequisite - the opening scenes abruptly leap right into the action with little preamble, and the rush of new faces could be dizzying without some sort of primer - but that's nothing new, and I suppose one of the benefits of running such a lengthy series is that eventually we can do away with formalities and get right to the meat. Whittling down a nearly-900-page tome into roughly two hours of film does result in some exclusions: Ron and Hermione once again have very little to do, relegated to the background in many scenes, and several surviving subplots find themselves combined or streamlined for pacing reasons. That's understandable, something of a necessary evil for what's still, certainly, among the best efforts in the series. Things are starting to get interesting."

There seems to be gaps in the story and a few places that have been cut short, especially between Professor Snape and Harry Potter. Overall, there is some interesting special effects, though the first storm scene doesn't really seem all that impressive. The humor is intermingled throughout, with good effect, particularly one owl in the beginning.

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a film directed by David Yates. I remember watching this film back in 2007 since my school took me and not understanding a single word of it. But finally after watching it so many years later, I enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Plot: The Ministry of magic goes to every extent in order to hide Lord Voldemort's return.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This is the first film directed by David Yates who went on to direct the rest of the parts and first not to be written by Steve Kloves but by Michael Goldenberg. I could understand the pressure on these two people but in spite of that they deliver. This instalment is the one that has the Ministry of Magic play out its politics. And that is something quite different the series has never tackled before. Also introduced in this film is Harry Potter forming the Dumbledore Army and the anti-Voldemort organisation the Order of the Phoenix. The film has progressed from Harry becoming just a little boy to one where he is fighting Death Eaters. Each character has an added layer of information to itself that made me care for them so much. And it was so beautifully handled. The makers know the importance of these characters and give them the respect and care that they deserve. Also featured inin this film is the biggest action scene ever where stakes are very high. I remember very well enjoying the scene at that time but now knowing all the characters and their motivations, I enjoyed the scene even more. The music in this film is awesome too. But I did have one little issue. And that is the VFX. After so good VFX in the previous parts, here in some scenes the VFX were cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>Performances: The regular cast does so well in their parts that it is very hard to fault them. Imelda Stauton does one hell of a job as Dolores Umbridge. If you thought that ypou have seen enough of evil characters in this series, you are wrong. She is definitely the worst. Helena Bonham Carter also nails it as Bellatrix Lestrange. Although her role is quite short, but it is very effective. And finally, Evanna Lynch is awesome as Luna Lovegood. The way she alliances herself with Harry and the gang is awesome.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Fred and George trouble Dolores Umbridge during the OWL exam. That scene was just awesome and I laughed so hard during this scene. It always feels good when an evil character faces such a situation.<br/><br/>Verdict: This franchise knows what it is doing and it is good at it. With every instalment, the anxiety increases as to what will happen next. I had a good time watching this film and can't wait to see as to what is next. I applaud David Yates and team for bringing another part of so wonderful series.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."

","Yes, this is the fifth of the seven of Harry Potter. We get a dour chapter of the saga that features Harry facing his greatest challenges yet after the Triwizard Tournament in Goblet of Fire. It's no longer cute and fluffy like the first one but a serious installment where the Ministry is trying to cover up the return of a dark force and Hogwarts is under the thumb of a new so-called teacher and Ministry lackey. There are lots of scenes cut from the movie, but otherwise it's not too bad. Fans of this particular chapter may be put off by the cut-offs, but for me it was just fine. Will Harry and Dumbledore prove to everyone that the truth is out there? As philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke would say, ""Evil is only triumphant when good men do nothing."""

","'Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix (2007)' is more concise than past entries, with much of its plot conveyed in montage. It's incredibly focused, its two or three strand narrative being placed above all other aspects. In some ways, it feels a little rushed. Yet, the focus on the school itself and the teenage ensemble is refreshing. It's nice to be introduced to some proper magical combat, too. The piece manages to maintain a decent tonal balance throughout, elaborating upon the bleaker aspects of the lore but still making time for levity. It's easily one of the best in its series thanks to a fine exploration of several core characters and some proper stakes, even those that go unseen for most of the piece. Plus, its finale is fantastic. 8/10"

","This is a good movie but it could've been so much better. The main problem is that it feels incredibly rushed. The book is the longest in the series but the movie is one of the shortest in the series. They cut out every subplot and some of the main plot too and it feels completely butchered but if you watch it on it's own it's okay. It's fun and it also has some really dark moments and the ending is heartbreaking. You will see it for yourself. The actors are great and Daniel Radcliffe is absolutely amazing and he became a great actor in this movie and continued to be great. But the new- comers were also great. Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge took my breath away and I don't think they could find actresses who would do those roles more perfect. You will hate Umbridge more than any other character in the series. Same with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She's probably the most insane and psychotic character in the series. One more thing I can praise are the effects. Now it all looks completely believable and action sequences are eye candy and the climax is one of the most thrilling parts of the franchise. The movie was pretty good on it's own. Rushing was the thing that hurt this movie really bad but even if it's the weakest movie in the series it's still worth watching."
"tomgillespie2002","6","0","0","20 July 2014"," Struggles to juggle the emotional drama with the action
","Back in 2007, with the impending arrival of J.K. Rowling's seventh and final instalment novel and this, the release of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Pottermania was at astronomical levels. A director new to the franchise was introduced, David Yates, who seemed a shrewd choice given his track record in British TV, but in hindsight, his inexperience with blockbusters proved slightly harmful to the franchise. It became difficult to cram Rowling's increasingly sprawling novels into a two hour-plus film, and Yates (along with fellow newcomer Michael Goldenberg penning the script), struggled to juggle the emotional drama so delicately handled by Cuaron and Newell before him, along with the CGI-heavy action.<br/><br/>With the horrors he witnessed at the climax of Goblet of Fire still lingering in his mind, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) finds himself returning to a wizarding world in denial. The Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), refuses to believe the Dark Lord has returned, and half the pupils at Hogwarts accuse Harry of being an attention-seeker. Even Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), who has always protected Harry, seems to ignore him. Only his close friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), and the strange new pupil Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), stick by him inside school. Outside, Harry is encouraged by his surrogate father Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is part of the Order of the Phoenix, a small group of wizards preparing the upcoming war with Voldemort.<br/><br/>Everything about Order of the Phoenix is suitably grim. The opening scene in which Harry and his repulsive muggle cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) meet a couple of hungry Dementors, shows Harry's world as dry, cracked and grim. It suits Harry mood, with his first experience of witnessing death still haunting him, and the frustration of being ignored making him quick to anger. Hogwarts is also no longer a safe retreat for the pupils, as the introduction of Ministry of Magic worker Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) sees the school of wizardry infiltrated, and Voldemort's true aims become clearer.<br/><br/>The politics were more carefully laid out in the novel, and it's here that Yates stumbles. Umbridge's fascist approach is clear as day, to the point of making Harry write lines that scratch into his skin, but the effect it has on the changing attitudes towards 'mudbloods' such as Hermione (wizards born out of non-magical parents) and half-breeds like the formidable centaurs lurking in the forest, is all but ignored. The climax at the Ministry of Magic, which sees Harry and Voldemort both seeking a prophecy, is messy, as it was in the book. It works well when focusing on Harry and his demons, and Radcliffe again performs well, but integrating them with the enormous ensemble and the overarching story is where it falls flat.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

"axel-koch","6","0","0","3 January 2014"," Not only the second shortest, but also the second worst film of the eight
","Voldemort is back. That was the awesome cliffhanger Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ended on and story-wise, there were loads of possibilities for the follow-up in the series. However, Order of the Phoenix does not do what one may hope for and zeroes in on its protagonist's puberty. Since this is a franchise accompanying kids through their full adolescence, it's only reasonable for writer Michael Goldenberg to give weight to this, I guess, but that didn't stop me from being quite disenchanted while watching the film.<br/><br/>The adaption of the longest novel in the series turned out to be the second shortest film in the series, but before stigmatising one-time- screenwriter Goldenberg for this, it has to be noted that J.K. Rowling's fifth book is easily the most redundantly stretched and I expect few people to be disappointed at Quidditch, Dobby, and Rita Skeeter being absent this time around. Goldenberg also seems to have found joy in testing the boundaries of believability, going from the irrationality of Harry teaching his fellow students a wide array of spells and curses that he couldn't possibly have learned anywhere himself to the plot aberration of Harry and senior members of the Ministry for Magic flying over Britain on their brooms and making no attempts at all to conceal this from Muggles. Considering these aspects, Rowling stultifies herself when naming Order of the Phoenix her favourite instalment of the series up to that point.<br/><br/>Besides all of this criticism, David Yates (the fourth director in five films) doesn't fail as badly as Chris Columbus did with Chamber of Secrets. In the subject of romance, he used some very clever relationship-foreshadowing, as I noted Ginny looking at Harry more than just a few times, though she will have to wait for a response until the next film in the series. There's also humour to find, mostly in the shape of the Weasley twins who pleasurably get more screen time in Order of the Phoenix or Alan Rickman who puts all his acting talent into the role of Snape, especially in one commendable scene of him reprimanding a Harry unsuccessful at stopping Voldemort from interfering in his mind.<br/><br/>Cue Voldemort, a character I can't help to feel disappointment about, despite him actually gaining strength in the story. Whether it's for him having less dialogue in Order of the Phoenix or for the first impression of him having just been reborn not being around anymore. Nevertheless, the film's best shot still involves him, appearing in all his creepiness at King's Cross station, if only in Harry's imagination.<br/><br/>There's also a very visually appealing showdown in the film, getting best once Voldemort creates an awful lot of debris, and doing well at dramatically including one unexpected death into the battle. What has to be noted though is that Voldemort facing Dumbledore turned out to be ridiculous, as Yates obviously had no idea how to make a magical duel thrilling while simultaneously upholding its interest for more than ten seconds and decided – for whatever unlikely reason – to make the two combat with the aid of natural elements. The result shows that Avatar: The Last Airbender and Harry Potter don't go together at all.<br/><br/>And even if it should be a flop in every other way, the art decoration and set design departments are sure to do their job in the best possible way and they did a wonderful job at the realisation of so many of the Harry Potter universe's significant locations, such as the prison of Azkaban (strange enough, Azkaban made an appearance in one of the films' titles already, but it's until now that the forbidding fortress is finally shown) or the Ministry for Magic, especially when it's laid waste to in the final half an hour. 12 Grimmauld Place got a look as generic as one could possibly imagine, which – when you think about it – is precisely how it should be as the importance of it looking unsuspicious is paramount.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not only the second shortest, but also the second worst film of the eight and the transition between teenage problems and the real peril emanating from Voldemort's return just isn't accomplished very well."

From the leads to the always excellent support this film moves along at a quick pace and shows a different side to the characters we have seen grown up on screen.<br/><br/>However it is a long film with only the last half an hour being what you would call action packed but once it all kicks off it makes for a thrilling conclusion."

","I have grown up with ""Harry Potter"" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.<br/><br/>It is Harry Potter's 5th year in Hogwarts and he is met with much misfortune. Hardly anyone believes him or Dumbledore when they say that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has really returned. Both of them are scoffed at and thought to be ridiculous. The Ministry of Magic has even gone so far as to appoint one of their own, as a teacher in Hogwarts, to keep things on track. The new teacher is nasty and utterly unfair. On top of all that, Harry has been having some mysterious dreams that are somehow related to the Dark Lord, Voldemort.<br/><br/>After watching this, I realized that I hardly felt any emotional attachment with any of the characters. The closest I felt to sheer happiness was when (SPOILERS:) the Weasley twins burst in during the Year 5's OWLs and when the centaurs raised off to the deeper parts of the Forbidden Forest with Dolores Umbridge. Other than that, I didn't feel anything. Even during the ending. Oh, except for that tiny pang I felt when Luna and Harry shared that small moment, though. (/SPOILERS) It's weird saying that I didn't really feel anything about characters in a ""Harry Potter"" film. But that is how I felt (or lack of) while watching this movie.<br/><br/>I have yet to read the book (don't judge, I'm waiting for all the movies to come out first), but I know that it is one of the longest in the series. This movie is only 138 minutes, which is less than previous movies. So I'm guessing that a lot of scenes have been left out. Hm.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is an adequate enough movie. It's not my favorite one, but I don't particularly hate it, either. It's so-so.

","Harry Potter is a name almost any one will recognize. Whether they were fans of the books, the movies, both or neither, everyone knows Harry. I myself love the books and have memorized the movies, but this installment in the Harry Potter movies really put me off the movies. It's not the acting or the effects it is I have to say the director's fault entirely that this movie bombed so badly. David Yates chopped the book up so badly that the story was hard to recognize. Making the longest book into the shortest movie may have sounded like the right thing to do for David, but honestly what kind of idiot does that? It only makes since that the longest book would of course be the longest movie also. But sadly that is not the case. David Yates you have ruined The Order of the Phoenix. I was looking forward to my favorite book also being my favorite movie, but no. And when I discovered that he was directing the last 3 movies I gagged. The Half-Blood Prince wasn't as bad as it's predecessor, but it wasn't what it could or should have been.

"John_Truby","Null","0","0","7 January 2010"," All about the story world
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the 5th book in the most popular work of fiction in history. It shouldn't surprise anyone that this phenomenal success has come in the fantasy genre, but it does. In Hollywood, fantasy is a genre that rarely stands alone; it is usually combined with one or two other forms, like action and science fiction. Also, Americans don't have a long fantasy tradition, which is one reason we think of it primarily as a form for children. But fantasy is much bigger than what Hollywood thinks it is. It is fundamental to the act of fiction. A good fantasy, on its own, has tremendous worldwide appeal, to people of all ages.<br/><br/>To understand fantasy, you have to look at it structurally. Fantasy is all about the story world, which, along with ghost, is the second of the 22 building blocks of every great story (discussed in great detail in the Great Screen writing Class). Fantasy takes the story world element and blows it up a hundred fold. Everything depends on how you create and detail this world, and then on how you sequence it. Going in, writers think that fantasy is a light, airy story form. In fact it is the most geometric of the forms. Your hero starts in a mundane world, goes to the fantastical world, and returns to the mundane world enlightened.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter books have an exquisitely detailed story world. From the various school codes and hierarchy to the fantastical creatures to the technology of magic, author J. K. Rowling has examined and expressed an entire and unique world. Like other English fantasists, she has included an opposition of moral values. Setting the story in a school allows her to bring this value opposition forward without being preachy. Rowling also makes sure that Harry solves his problem at the end of each story by adhering to certain values, in spite of temptation. This way the theme is grounded in the plot.<br/><br/>The school of course is the key to the whole thing. The sequence of the fantasy - mundane, fantastical, back to mundane - attached to the school year brings out the best in the fantasy form. Fantasy teaches the audience how to live, and each year becomes a cycle of new growth for Harry. Also, high school is now the universal passage to adulthood. So everyone in the audience, worldwide, sees their own school experience in light of Harry. For the kids, Harry is the student they would all like to be. For the adults, he is the student they would all like to have been.<br/><br/>The obvious lesson of the Potter success is that you should consider writing a script or story in this form. Fantasy, along with horror and science fiction, is known as speculative fiction. That requires certain strengths as a writer. Here's the simplest way to determine if fantasy is for you: if you like to create story worlds, this is your form.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"

","You take all the great points of the book and you get this movie. It was easy to hate Umbridge as the actress made the character pure evil. A bunch of points are left out entirely (ie. the house elves; something that is vastly important to Hermione and Ron in Deathly Hallows).<br/><br/>I did enjoy the film, but it seems the writers have gotten lazy with following the story since after Prizoner. Dumbledore's Army comes together quite differently in the book, and this is the book that shows how powerful Ginny is. It also shows her shining as one of the main characters and not some shy ""good luck"" girl like we saw in the first film.<br/><br/>In the climatic scene there is so much going on, the story is pretty much thrown out -- while you're dazzled by the special effects of Death Eaters versus the Order.

"kai_h138","5","0","0","31 July 2009"," A step down from the films that precede it.
","The introduction to the film was promising, but it begins to spiral out of control quickly thanks to the haphazard editing, lackluster cinematography, generic score, poor special effects and failure to draw the audience's sympathy during emotional moments, all making the fifth film seem like a high-budget, made-for-TV special.<br/><br/>When the film begins, there are some graceful camera movements; however, when the dementors appear, the editing forces viewers to endure shots that are a second each. It seems like the director filmed for coverage, rather than using each shot to their fullest potential, allowing the editor to go on a cutting frenzy (who needs five shots in five seconds with five different angles to show one thing?). Furthermore, the dreams Harry experiences show some poorly implemented fades as well. However, the editing wouldn't have suffered if the cinematography was at least moderately good.<br/><br/>If the movie had been shot well, it would not have felt that the actors were in sets. Good cinematography should have invoked a sense of realism -- that the actors were actually in a castle, or wherever they were supposed to be. One place that could've used some major improvement is the train station at Hogwarts. There's definitely a feeling that the train is just a prop. On that note, the shot composition was poor as well, increasing the awkwardness of the actors' blocking, which resembles a stage play rather than a movie. Moreover, shots are either plain and static, or sweeping and excessively showy -- there's no ""in between"" except for shots that are excessively shaky, juxtaposing more fluid shots... mixed together in the same scene. These points wouldn't have dropped the ratingdown too much, but its further compounded by the poor score.<br/><br/>John Williams was arguably the best composer for the series, followed by Patrick Doyle, in Goblet of Fire, while Nicholas Hooper fails to generate any emotion, creating a bland, boring, generic score. I'm fine with discontinuation of previous themes, but that means that new themes must be competent. The new score is definitely lacking in quality. Whereas previous films had memorable themes such as ""Window to the Past,"" ""Double Trouble"" and ""Harry in Winter,"" there's no real sense of wonder. Action scenes have a dull rumble, while emotional ones are simply plain. Then there's the music used during dialog, where an oboe (I believe) is played. Those are really cringe-inducing. Never has a high-budget film felt so TV movie-like. More so are the special effects, which have taken many steps backwards from previous films.<br/><br/>The main problem was with Grawp, the giant. Whereas Children of Men had been able to create a realistic looking CGI baby during hand-held shots with a smaller budget, Order of the Phoenix manages to have a character that rivals Shrek. Never, have I seen a more play-doh looking character in recent times. Other things that suffered from this were the centaurs as well. The Thestrals are equally as unrealistic, which I assumed was impossible, as Buckbeak looked amazing in the third film. The wings on the Thestrals are a good use of Subsurface Scattering; however, the skin and eyes have an unrealistic shiny quality. Moreover, flying on the broomstick was poor as well. It seems like characters were placed on stock footage. Poor, poor special effects.<br/><br/>Another problem in the film was with the dialog, which made me cringe. Words such as ""Who are you and what have you done with ________?"" are so cliché that they're for sitcoms and comedies. Furthermore, things happened to fast, such as the climax, which made me go ""What just happened?"" Especially with the death of a major character, who falls into an object that was given no introduction. It simply... appears. The same thing happens many times. For example, when the Order shows up in the room to fight their opponents, there's no explanation for them being there. At most, the audience can assumed that some things happened. Only those who read the book can fully grasp the events in the film. There are some redeeming qualities that prevent Order of the Phoenix from receiving a lower mark though.<br/><br/>Acting has improved dramatically, and the story is even more twisted and darker than the last. Furthermore, the spells have cool effects, and Umbridge is played well. Other than that, I feel compelled to say The Order of the Phoenix is not worth one's cash, and it ranks the same as the first two, for different reasons though. While the first two films were pedestrian and lacked style, this film just felt rushed, hurting its rating. May I hope that director David Yates has learned from this experience."

","This movie is better than the first three, but then again that isn't saying much (the 4th wasn't as bad). The first three often threw out story, good dialog and character development and put in a great heap of ""Wow that bus just shrunk and fit between the other two buses!"" or ""That skull has a Jamaican accent, isn't he just the wackiest thing you've ever seen?"" which I found very annoying and lazy. It was like the director thought he could just get by on the ""isn't that wacky"" mood. Well, now we have a different director. This must change right? In some ways that thought would be correct, as this movie has a much darker mood than the rest. However the director still seems to go back to that annoying habit of instead of showing us a character is ""wacky"" through good writing, he zooms in on a characters face way too far. Another thing about the characters which annoyed me was that nearly all, except for the 3 main characters and a select few of the secondary characters, were WAY overplayed by the actors. For example: the Dursley's. If you have seen the previous movies, you know what i am talking about. What i will give to this is that it is a step in the right direction. As I said earlier, it is a lot darker than the previous films. Hopefully we can have at some point a Harry Potter that is serious and relies on good dialog and character development instead of the ""Isn't the magical world just wacky?"" thing that is going on now"

","I am a huge fan of the books, and I must add that all of the movies have failed to impress me. I just wish there was the same level of devotion to Rowling's work in this franchise as there was to Tolkien's work in the Lord of the Rings franchise. The movies are usually decent, but as a die-hard fan I crave to see the sparkle that has made her books so special to me. Of all of the movies in the series, I find this one to be the worst. The director and the screenwriters have obviously not read all of the books in the series. This is just an every-day movie for them. I wanted to see some of my favorite scenes from the Order here; but they were absent or watered down. Some of the really important scenes in the book were completely cut! The screenwriters and director would have had to read the whole series to see the importance of some of these details, which made it obvious to me that they didn't do their research!!!! If I didn't like the actors so well, I would have rated this movie even lower. Yet even they failed to inspire me in this weak addition to the franchise."

","I was so excited when this came out. I had high hopes, I read all 7 books, I had seen the previous movies. Even further, I went with a friend to the IMAX when this movie came out. I thought that nobody could screw up Harry Potter. <br/><br/>Well, to this day, I'm still kicking myself for thinking that. <br/><br/>To David Yates: Who are you and what have you done with Harry? This is the perfect example of when someone rushes a movie adaptation of a book. There were SO MANY things missing from the book, or tampered with, it's ridiculous. <br/><br/>For one, let's begin with the length. 138 minutes???? Are you kidding me? The other movies were in the 150 area and this gets only a measly 138 minutes? The book is 870 pages and this movie gets a stinkin' 138 minute length? Well, thankfully that warned me for what I was about to see:<br/><br/>The Cliffs Notes version of the book.<br/><br/>Whittle the longest book in the series to the shortest movie and you get this. Now let's start on what was either screwed up or missing:<br/><br/>-The Cho Chang/Harry Potter arc. What a missed opportunity. And Cho being an evil snitch? WTF PEOPLE. SHe betrays Harry in the movie. Wow. -No Hospital scenes -No Neville's Parents -No Snape's Wretched Memory -The Department of Mysteries. It was multiple rooms in the book, here it's one room. -Voldemort possessing Harry... WTF? I don't remember reading that in the book. -Mrs. Figg was terrible. I can't even mention her... in the book she was this quirky and fun character, here she's just this evil and deceptive hag that we couldn't care less whether or not she dies. -Sirius' death. I got really depressed when reading that moment in the book. It was one of the most powerful scenes ever written in literature. Here, instead of shedding tears, I was thinking ""Ugh, thank God. At least that means the movie is close to the end.""<br/><br/>There's more I could name. This movie is so awful it's not even funny. It had a stellar cast, a great source for material, excellent effects... but then it took a book as complicated as a plate of spaghetti and made it into... a plate of spaghetti.<br/><br/>If you read the book, watch this movie, but prepare for disappointment. Had it not been for the IMAX 3D at the finale, I'd have had a day ruined."

","I like the movie and I've seen it several times. But I find it more interesting to read the book. When I read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, apart from Harry, Ron and Hermione, the ones who impressed me most was Ron's twin brother----Fred and George. They always made me burst into laughter. Admittedly, they really had senses of humor. They were troublemakers, who enjoyed themselves in doing things deviated from the normal way. They didn't like people who follow rules docilely. In their views, only the one who was stupid or mad that wanted to be a prefect. Therefore, when a Prefect badge was conferred on Ron, they were incredulous and surprised the moment they heard the news. ""There's been a mistake. No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect""Fred said. And George said indignantly to Harry, ""We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you"", as thought Harry had tricked them in some way. After they were convinced that it was true, they began to sneer at Ron. And George thrust the Prefect badge back at Ron as if it might contaminate him. How lovely they are!I think it's a pity that the director didn't mention it at all in the movie. What's more, they were always materializing out of thin air in front of other people with two loud cracks, which made others jump. And they usually disappeared out of other's view in the twinkling of an eye. Besides, I really appreciate their creative intelligence. They showed a talent for inventing magical things, such as Extendable Ears and Portable Swamp. They are genius!"

","I can't believe that Order of the Phoenix was based on the 5th installment of the Harry Potter series. There have been complaints about what was cut from the book, but this is just mind blowing. To begin with, months before the movie's release I rushed to the book and reread it, couldn't wait to see my favorite parts on the big screen. As a child I'd originally read the book just picturing Ron's tottery attitude in the Department of Mysteries while being attacked by the brain. I wanted to watch him try out for the Quidditch team- ""Weasley is our King"", anyone? I'm sure I'm not the only one who couldn't wait to see Hermione's plans for the house elfs, he mention of Percy and his family issues? Snape's worst memories were what I'd really been waiting for. You can imagine my astonishment when I got that 2 minute snort or blurry fuzz. <br/><br/>Let's just say, I'd packed a wad of tissue paper in my pockets for this movie. Sirius' death scene was what killed me. He fell through the veil and it was over. Not even the slow motion clips of Harry, held back by Lupin, calling for him made my eyes water. I was looking for something dramatic. Sirius Black, Harry's only living family member, is dead.

","Although the actors all did very well (I was quite pleased to see the excellent Carter in the role of Bellatrix) in all, I was very disappointed with the movie and it actually makes me not really care about the next, unless it gets some really amazing reviews. I'm a big fan of the books, of course, and although I realise that movies can not completely duplicate printed works, I was incredibly disappointed by this one. I don't know if it was stupidity on the part of the director or if it was just laziness, but even someone clueless about the film industry can tell what parts of the book have the potential to be legendary on film. For example, Dumbledore blasting the heck out of the ministry trying to defend himself would have added quite a notch to Gambon's belt. The twins' famous exit from Hogwarts (a part in the book that encouraged the reader to repeat it over and over just for those pages) could have been one of the most hilarious and glittery part of the whole series to date. Most importantly, the climax of the movie, the raid on the Ministry of Magic and the subsequent battles, could have been absolutely stunning. Instead, we are given one room with a doorway and some ripped up cloth. Goodness, even the book jacket was more vivid and exciting than the climax of this movie. Then we are given an out-of-character Dumbledore battling Voldemort in an empty hallway. The whole beauty of Rowling's books is the sheer imagination that went into this series, and all the film has to offer is a couple of empty rooms? What happened to the spinning rooms, the brains, the hummingbird, the smashed cabinet, and all those other magical items? And what about Harry's little speech to Voldemort in the film which runs something along the lines of, ""You can't win because I have friends!""? I don't know what hack wrote the script for that one, but as far as dramatic moments go that one pretty much fails as it just made members of the audience stifle laughter. There were some ""ooh, aah"" moments, but it wasn't nearly enough to save this movie. What should have been the masterpiece so far became a laughingstock. Had the director added 45 minutes and actually read the book, it would have been said masterpiece. Even just an extended version of the final battles would have made it more impressive (though it would not have saved it) because at least people would have left the theater feeling satisfied that there was at least a climax in the story. This is a movie I will not even purchase, and such a disappointment that I have lost all desire to see the next movie since it is directed by the same guy. One would think that having been handed such a vivid story, the director would find it hard to screw it up. Boy, I sure hope you don't screw the next one up."

","OK, the film isn't terrible, but it's certainly very rushed and aims at spitting out yet another film on schedule, rather than making it epic. There was one absolute major flaw with the script though, and I can't actually believe the producers were ignorant enough to miss it out... How could you possibly neglect the Harry - Dumbledore scene in his office at the end? Arguably one of the most emotional parts in all 7 books??? I wasn't hugely impressed with the ministry part, but I didn't care, I was waiting for that scene. What I got was a few meaningful seconds of it, in fact it was practically a transition. Here was one of the best chapters in all the books, and what did they do? They used it to quickly transfer from one scene to the next... For a moment I almost thought it was a joke, and that they'd return to the scene.<br/><br/>I know I'm placing a great deal of emphasis on it, but you have to ask yourself...

","I looked forward to this installment of the HP series as the book was the darkest of the bunch and really the first to set up the ominous future Harry has to meet.<br/><br/>The screen writer however, falls flat in his attempt to cover the vast grounds laid out in the book, it is the longest of the series, but it results in the shortest film. <br/><br/>David Yates, who for some reason has been chosen for the last movies puts too much emphasis on the visual sides to display the ongoing battle within Harry, and it doesn't quite work and here's why. <br/><br/>Through all the books, no matter what happened to Harry and his friends J-RO makes sure to tell that the surroundings look exactly the same as before the terrible things occurred. This means that you shouldn't make a summer day notorious for it's excessive heat and drought into a cloudy rather autumn looking day, as happens in the very beginning. The effect of the presence of Dementors in Little Whinging would be much more profound had the sky not already been murky. Furthermore, when Dementors approach it turns COLD NOT WINDY. <br/><br/>The same feel does simply not come across in this one as with the previous films, particularly the first two films(and especially NOT the third). Furthermore Yates, and his screenwriter, simply don't understand the franchise they've inherited. Instead of putting things in the movies that has no place or omitting things that NEED to be there for a better understanding of the ongoing action and further development of characters, they should ALWAYS keep close contact with J-Ro and really make sure that IF they leave out things, that they are the RIGHT things, and not just things THEY feel are pointless.<br/><br/>I would much prefer the more ""childlike"" visions of Chris Columbus, than the new cinematography and editing initiated by Alfonso Cuarón, because it is more in tune with what Rowling writes. Also they should bring back John Williams for the last three movies as only HIS music have lifted the movies.<br/><br/>It is the weakest second only to HP and the Halfblood Prince."

But since the third there's been a disastrous change. <br/><br/>Talking about this movie particularly i was mainly disappointed and sad when i came out of the theater hall. The cgi and the special effects are really very good and convincing. But its the story where the movie suffers the most.<br/><br/>If you've read the book you'll know that as far as understanding the Harry Potter universe is considered the 5th book is one of the most important. This movie was supposed to be the one that should have answered all the questions that a common viewer would have, having watched the movies without reading the book. It was supposed to tell us why Dumbledore never talked to Harry about his scar. Why he never said why he left Harry at his uncle's place when he was just a baby. Why he never explained the reason that Harry had to return to his uncle's place during all his vacations. Why it was because of him that Sirius was killed. And so many other questions that would have made the movie perfect in all respect.<br/><br/>I felt that Harry's character was kind of over-shadowed by Hermione. It was like she was bossing him around and he was too much of a coward to take control.<br/><br/>The movie could have been great in many other ways. I have just mentioned a few.<br/><br/>All in all i'd give it a 6 just for the enthralling visuals and nothing else."
"catchick","6","0","0","14 January 2008"," What should have been left in...(minor spoiler)
","Visually, OP is stunning. The special effects are socko. The acting is good, especially Evanna as Luna Lovegood. All that works. <br/><br/>Yeah, OP is the longest book. As such, the writers and director should have done a little more work on it. Some things should never have been left out. We only get a small sense of the Black Family's history. The writers should have taken just a few more seconds for Sirius to explain that Bellatrix and Narcissa are sisters, and they grew up at 12 Grimmauld Place. Since Narcissa is Draco Malfoy's mother, this would have been vital information. It is also essential to understanding why Kreacher is such a mess and resurfaces later in the series. Family ties are such an important theme for Rowling, and this should never have been omitted.<br/><br/>The Order photograph was a brilliant piece of cinematic shorthand, but Sirius should have gone into a bit more detail about who was who. Such as, ""Of the xx number of people in this picture, only xx are still alive. Voldemort killed the rest."" That's a line that would have really brought home the scope of his evil. <br/><br/>Also, Sirius is such an essential part of Harry's life, he really should have had a couple more scenes. One reviewer said the movie felt rushed, and perhaps that's my problem with it. <br/><br/>The other bit that should have really been stressed was the importance of the Order of the Phoenix. We never really get the idea the OP was more than a few adept dissidents. <br/><br/>That said, Gary Oldman turns in a performance that, for all it's brevity, is memorable. Sirius Black is an excellent fit for Oldman. Tormented, betrayed, full of bad memories and dysfunctional background. Tailor-made for Oldman. LOL. However, Oldman brings a wonderful tenderness to his scenes with Harry that really makes the viewer love this Black sheep of his family. And his savage joy in fighting the Death-Eaters is unmatched. Sirius has always been a warrior with no battles to fight. In this, his first and last battle, he acquits himself brilliantly. <br/><br/>For the next movie, the writers and directors need to look for those details that may only add five minutes to the movie, but pay off in big leaps in character development, as well as plot devices."

","Contains spoilers. You've been warned - BEWARE! <br/><br/>Over and over again, we have heard the argument that there is simply no way to fit an entire book into the time slot that a movie may be played in. Nowhere is this more evident than in this, the shortest Harry Potter movie that incidentally is adapted from the longest Harry Potter book.<br/><br/>I'd like to say that the cast seems to do great things with the little on-screen time they are given. Helena Bonham Carter and Robbie Coltrane were hardly in the movie at all. Almost no time was give to Mr. Weasley either, considering his importance in determining the nature of the connection between Voldemort and Harry.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me was the story behind the Thestrals. Forgetting that they were replaced in the earlier movies, the explanation of their existence was never given. Indeed, later, when others encounter them, no explanation of why they could see them survived either. Having read the book, I know why this is so and what has happened between scenes, but I shouldn't have HAD to read the books in order to understand the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, at the end of the movie, the ministry sees the errors of its ways - the newspaper transitions were useful here, since they imparted quite a lot of information without wasting a lot of time. It seems however, they've dug themselves into a hole considering Umbridge by overstating the implications of her time at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>In short, there were a lot of holes left in the movie, little or no explanation of plot progression - things seemed to just happen for little or no reason, unless you knew what was going to happen. I'm glad that the movies are subtly pushing viewers to read the books, but I don't think they should assume everyone has read them."

And I don't mean darker as in the sense of a city at night. I mean mentally darker, like descending in the whole, dark basement of each character. Harry has less time with Hermione and Ron, it's a play of his odyssey with Voldemort, the villain, played by a bewitching Ralph Fiennes. David Yates imposes a nice direction; a wondrous score, and fine acted villains. It's not the best Harry Potter yet; but it seems it's reaching a different maturity and enters a whole new domain, one where the leading actors are no longer kids and trouble are moved by psychological leverages, and deep emotional conflicts.

","To start with, if I hadn't read the book, the movie would still not be rated a 10, maybe a 6. The scenes happened way too fast. The whole movie reminded me of an extra long advertising trailer.<br/><br/>The movie veered way off from the book several times, and it left out numerous scenes. Some that were important to the next two movies and the final story. The mirror that Sirius gave Harry was never shown, and it becomes important in the Deathly Hallows. Also, the locket being found and taken by Kreacher never happens. Again, very important in the Deathly Hallows. The whole scene of Arthur Weasely in St. Mungos was left out. The trio never sees Neville and his parents at the hospital. There was no Quidditch so don't look for it. It shows a scene with all the DA in detention with Umbridge which never happened. Why not use the time for it for something like the locket or mirror? All of it made the movie non-compliant with the previous and next movies due to setting changes. The Dept. of Mysteries was one of the worst setting changes in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie also changed several scenes from the book. This was, I am sure, due to Warner Bros. executives continually shortening the movie. The faults of this movie lay with them, not the director and screenwriter. Don't look for Harry delving into Snapes pensive. It doesn't happen! It should, as Harry learns a lot about his parents and Snape there. The movie only shows a very small amount. One of the worst changes was having Cho Chang be the sneak instead of the her friend. The girl who did tell Umbridge was no where to be seen. I guess Warner Bros. was wanting to save some bucks and cut the actual tattle-tale? Another was showing Neville to be the one to find the room of requirement. In fact, Dobby told Harry about it. There's others too, but it would take more time than I care to give.<br/><br/>It's a shame that this movie made Harry look to be a little cowardly several times, when in fact he is not. He never gave Lucius Malfoy the prophecy orb in the book like Harry did in the movie. They in fact fought over it, and Neville was involved and dropped it. Harry learned the prophecy from Dumbledore in the end, not from the orb in the hall of prophesies. Harry also fought Voldermort and Bellatrix in the atrium a good bit more than what the movie shows. The fight between Dumbledore and Voldermort is shortened and does not match with the book. In the movie, Harry hardly fights at all and neither does his friends which is utter hogwash! Sirius wasn't killed by the killing curse in the book, but hit by another type and knocked through the veil. In the movies end, Harry never once looses his temper when he confronts Dumbledore. In fact, Harry trashed Dumbledores office in the book, and put the point across that he is tired of being lied to, and being kept in the dark. Again, another major screw up from Warner Bros. executives.<br/><br/>I wonder when Warner Brothers will get the hint that a longer movie is more tolerable than the garbage they ship to the consumers? Myself, and others I know, would have gladly set through a three hour movie, than sat this really short version. If they do the next two the same, I'm not sure whether I want to watch them."
"kyrat","7","0","0","7 November 2007"," Good, but could've been better - new director please for the next one
","I know, there's already nearly a thousand comments on this film.... however, I wanted to add my minor quibbles on the things that disappointed me a bit and could be improved for the next few films.<br/><br/>1. The movie from fantasy to 'realism'. I dislike seeing the wizards in their 'street clothes'. I don't want scenes from England (other than the uber-conformist opening scenes with the Dudleys). To me this is an enchanted other world and it should be made to be very different than the Muggle world. This may seem very minor but I found the clothes to be incredibly jarring and it ruined the feel of the film for me. <br/><br/>2. Cutting subplots/maintaining the focus/point of the books. Like many fans have mentioned, I would happily have sat through a longer but more complex film (a la LOTR) -- but given that they made a regular feature length film --I don't mind them cutting some part of the book out(like the Quidditch matches or the hallway monitor issues). However, I thought one tiny subplot should have stayed in (and it would've taken all of 30 seconds to add). The focus of the books has always been that it's actually NOT ALL ABOUT HARRY - that he always triumphs because they are a combined force. This film captures that a bit but left out the part of the prophecy where it's revealed that this could have all happened to Neville instead. This was such a revelatory moment in the book for me - so I was strongly bothered by this being cut from the movie. I think this fits into the message that Harry (while certainly talented and special in someways) is not a super-power charged indestructible one man army.<br/><br/>3. One tiny miscast (Amongst such excellent casting). I'm a huge fan of nearly all the British actors (esp. Maggie Smith & Emma Thompson). Imelda Stauton did a tremendous job of conveying cloyingly sweet but insidiously deadly menace! She displayed the sort of intense understated brilliance as in ""Vera Drake"". I think the kids are growing into their parts nicely. Luna was a nice addition. The only person that didn't work for me was Helena Bonham Carter. In this film, she seemed to play the same sort of Tim Burton film character - vaguely goth/creepy. All the other actors became their characters for me, but every time she appeared I thought ""oh look it's Helena Bonham Carter being Helena Bonham Carter"". Please rethink her casting for the next film or find some"

","I'm a big fan of fantasy books, and I really like when you make films of them. Though the problem with fantasy books is that they often are long (I mean like 900 pages, the Harry Potter books are relatively short). So when you try to make a film out of a fantasy book, you often ends up with something that feels like a resume of a film. I don't mean you shouldn't watch the films, they are often rather good, but you really should read the book before you see the film. All this apply to this film. It felt like they tried to put all the important events of the book into the film, but they hadn't time to more than tell us ""this happened"", and when the film reaches a point you recognize from the book, you get surprised by how little of the story that is left. I don't try to make you not seeing this film, I truly don't. But what I'm trying to say is that before you see any fantasy film that is based on a book (or any film at all that is based on a book), you really should read the book first. That sort of gives you a different perspective on the film, and you often understands a lot more of what happens. So see this film, but READ THE BOOK FIRST."

","I walked into the movie expecting there to be quite a few things cut. This was the shortest movie out of the longest book, after all. Many of the cuts were understandable. Some are probably regrettable once they start filming Deathly Hallows. I did enjoy the film, but there were a few things that bothered me.<br/><br/>One is the lack of screen time for Alan Rickman. That man is brilliant actor and he never gets enough time the movies! Something else that stuck out was that Tom Felton who plays Draco Malfoy is never on screen long enough to do the character justice. In the book Draco is evil, but not completely. In the movies all he does is walk Harry and say 'Potter's stupid,"" or something.<br/><br/>Despite those details the movie was very good. I think they wrapped up the plot of the long book very well. I have seen it twice and I am buying it as soon as it is released on DVD. Also if anyone gets the chance to view the movie in imax it is worth the extra $2! The 3D effects were amazing.

Running Time: 138 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>Harry (Radcliffe) is about to begin his fifth year at the Hogwarts when he and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors. In desperation he uses a secret spell to defeat them, thus breaking one of the wannabe wizards' prime directives--no magic outside the gates of the paranormal prep school. In danger of being expelled, Harry finds himself in the middle of a power struggle between Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) and the new Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (Staunton), who has been sent by the Ministry to discredit Harry's nightmare-inspired warnings of a major threat from Lord Voldemort (Fiennes). Since Umbridge's curriculum is inadequate to the task of doing battle with Voldemort and his minions, Harry and his cohorts in conjuring (Grint and Watson) secretly form an underground revolutionary force they call Dumbledore's army. As they train for conflicts to come, they must also keep themselves hidden from the appalling Ms. Umbridge.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS <br/><br/>In this, the fifth of the Harry Potter film series, the characters have become a little less clever and a little more complicated, and so has the movie itself.<br/><br/>The idea of a school year passing has been lost, and so have the fascinating intrigues and rivalries among student and faculty factions. The only one doing any teaching is Harry, as he readies his band of wand-wielding rebels for an epic struggle with the forces of evil.<br/><br/>The three leads are still quite attractive, but most of the acting burden is put on Radcliffe's shoulders, and he succeeds quite well. Grint's character is given short shrift, while Watson is growing up fast and may soon be angling for adult roles. Cho Chang (Leung) gives Harry his first kiss, but doesn't really register as a character. Luna Lovegood (Lynch), on the other hand, is the most intriguing of the younger newcomers and steals the few scenes she is in.<br/><br/>Of the adult additions to the cast, the most welcome is Bonham Carter who boils and bubbles as Bellatrix Lestrange, gleefully channeling all three of Macbeth's witches. The series continues to be a virtual pension program for acting legends the likes of Brendan Gleeson, Fiona Shaw, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters and the great Maggie Smith. The best of these is Alan Rickman, who has been given a few silly lines, but delivers them like he is auditioning for Lear or Hamlet.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film remain at the highest level, and are now taken for granted in a series that has been so effectively innovative. The filmmakers' ability to create a world as imaginative as Rowling's is the main reason nearly all of the book's fan's are also fans of the films."
"madonnawb","9","0","0","18 September 2007"," The best one so far? Maybe, but I loved them all
","I saw the new installment of the Harry Potter at the IMAX screen and boy was it awesome!!! The sound, the picture quality and the couple of the scenes in 3D (like the ones where they pick up Harry to the Order of the Phoenix, and the fight at the Ministry of Magic) were super cool. I must say when the 2 hour mark came and the movie soon ended I was quite bummed out- I could have watched 2 more hours and I am sure so would have everyone else in that theatre. I mean, I know they can't put everything from the book in the movie, but if the Lord of the Rings can be 3.5 hours so should Harry Potter- especially for the books that have over 700 pages. That said, I must admit I never read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (the size was simply intimidating) and now I regret it because I am sure I would have followed the story even better had I read the book.<br/><br/>Another cool thing was to see how everyone has grown up- Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and the twins, Neville and etc- they all look soo different from 2001 when Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone first came out. It is surely fun to watch them all grow and change through the movies as if it was in real life...<br/><br/>And to simply wrap it up I shall say- the movie was awesome and I cannot wait for the next 2!"

","The Order of the Phoenix was a wonderful representation of the fifth installment to the Harry Potter series. Unlike its predecessor, which was a bit choppy at the beginning, it flowed a lot better, making the movie less confusing for the audiences who didn't read the book.<br/><br/>One great part of the movie itself was the casting of Natalia Tena (Tonks), Imelda Staunton (Dolores Umbridge), Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), and Helena Bonhan Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange). Each actess was an almost exact impersonation of what I believed to be them.<br/><br/>Due to the lack of time for film, there were some developmental issues that could have been useful to comprehend. One example was that Tonks's power was never stated in the movie, so her facial transformations were a bit confusing.<br/><br/>Staunton made me ""Love to Hate"" Dolores; Lynch made me laugh; and Carter wonderfully made Lestrange a feared character.<br/><br/>Overall, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a great movie"

","The first three movies involving Chris Columbus were great and lived up to my expectations. I'd wish Warner would bring back the old team from Philospher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, and put a little more effort in developing a script which comes at least close to the the books of JKR. Also, why is John Williams not doing the music anymore? Order of Phoenix and especially it's predecessor Goblet of Fire are poorly scored, compared to Williams graceful style of orchestration and extraordinary thematic development. OoTF leaves out essential parts of the story, just to prevent to produce an over length movie. Epic and complicated stories need time to unfold, so better let Peter Jackson or Chris Columbus direct part 6 and 7 and bring back John Willams for the music score.<br/><br/>By the way, I think everyone who votes 10 for this movie must be urged by the studio, to do so."

","More than 10 years after the publication of the first book in the ""Harry Potter"" series, there's no doubt that J. K. Rowling's fantasy novels are on the way of becoming classics of the genre due to its imaginative world and its captivating story, which has gone from simple tales of adventure to darker and more complex themes as its main character, the young wizard Harry Potter grows up. The fourth installment of the series, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" began this maturing process, as in that book our hero discovered that fighting against evil, embodied in the figure of Lord Voldemort, wasn't a child's game, as the forces of evil do not hesitate in killing innocents. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", fifth novel in the series, continued and expanded this transformation, and naturally, the movie adaptation followed the same path.<br/><br/>As usual, we find Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) spending the summer at the house of his hateful relatives, the Dursleys, however, something feels different this time, as even when he was the one who discovered that Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) had returned, nobody, not even his good friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), had attempted to get in touch with him. Harry suspects something strange is going on, and his suspicion gets confirmed when a group of Dementors attack him and his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling), forcing him to use magic to save him. After this event, Harry is informed that he is now expelled from Hogwarts, however, the Order of the Phoenix, a group of elite wizards lead by Harry's former professor Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson), appear at the Dursleys' house to take Harry away. It seems that Harry's fifth year has started a bit earlier this time.<br/><br/>Replacing Steve Kloves as scriptwriter for ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is writer Michael Goldenberg, who faces the mammoth challenge of adapting Rowling's longest book to film. As any fan of the series should expect, details from the novel had to be omitted, but it must be said that Goldenberg manages to create a script that despite the omissions remains true to the story's spirit by keeping the core themes and staying faithful to the main plot. One of the key elements of the novel's plot is Harry's angst, and Goldenberg manages to successfully explore this aspect in his screenplay, devoting a great deal of it to the developing of Harry's character (something missing in the previous installment). Sadly, this has the consequence of limiting the screen time of the rest of the characters, as even major character such as Ron and Hermione get reduced screen time in this occasion.<br/><br/>As the new person in the director's seat, David Yates wisely decide to keep a sense of continuity between films and follows the same dark visual style that has been part of the series since the third installment (""Prisoner of Azkaban""), keeping the film in tone with the more mature challenges the characters face now that they have grown up and the evil's presence is stronger. A major theme in the movie is how the life at Hogwarts is affected by the many political conspiracies to hide the fact that Voldemort has returned, and fortunately Yates manages to pay enough attention to this aspect without taking the focus out of the main characters. While Yates does give his film a very fast pace, he manages to make the story easy to understand even to those unfamiliar with the novel and the many details that weren't included in the adaptation.<br/><br/>One of the most noticeable things in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is definitely how much has Daniel Radcliffe improved as an actor, as after many years of being the weakest link in the young trio, he finally shows up a considerable development and a real domain over dramatic scenes. Of course, it helps a lot that the script is almost entirely dedicated to his character, although sadly, this also means that Emma Watson and specially Rupert Grint receive almost zero chance to shine, although both make great performances despite this. The rest of the supporting characters suffer of this same thing as well, although Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson and specially Alan Rickman deliver remarkable acting despite the short screen time they have. However, the highlight of the film is Imelda Staunton's acting as Dolores Umbridge, as she delivers what's simply an unforgettable performance.<br/><br/>As written above, anyone expecting a faithful adaptation of the books will be sorely disappointed. To expect the level of detail Kloves and director Chris Columbus had in the first two films is simply pointless, but that doesn't mean Yates and Goldenberg are not talented, one has consider that since ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", Rowling's seres has grown bigger and deeper than the first two books. True, it's sad not to see some of the most famous scenes of the series in the movie, but what Yates and Goldenberg have done is still impressive as the movie does exactly what the novel did in a flawless way: it gives depth to the characters and completes their transition from kids to teenagers. In fact, the movie's real problem is that it's a bit too fast paced for its own sake, with the events happening at times too quickly to be noticed. I'm sure nobody would complain if 20 extra minutes were added to help slow the pace a bit.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" may not be an adaptation as faithful as hardcore fans would want, but in the end the approach the filmmakers have taken since the third chapter has given the series an identity of its own. This fifth installment is a great addition to the series, as it delivers perfectly the intended message: Harry Potter is not a kid anymore, and his biggest challenge awaits ahead. 8/10"

It was nice to finally meet her character too...but we didn't get to see much of her! In fact, they only had 2 segments of the order in the whole movie! Um, what's the title of the movie again?? LOL. My favorite character, however, was Bellatrix Lestrange. Even though you see her for a short time, her character was AWESOME! She's everything I expected her to be...Mean, horrible, nasty, etc. For some reason, I pictured her totally differently in the book, but in the movie, it was nice to put a face to a name.

","Previous reviews of this film were heavy on criticism of certain themes being removed from the film. It is important to note that J.K.

That being said, one can safely remove all disappointment as it was not a Hollywood decision.<br/><br/>Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint all turn out incredible performances and show enormous growth in their acting skills. The special effects dance across the screen, and colors dazzle you.<br/><br/>The relationships development in this film are one of the greatest attributes. Characters are clearly drawing lines in the sand and choosing sides as should be expected from implications in the previous movie.

","Following the unexpected early dark turn in the film series with ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" I quickly got skeptical if the last four films would turn out good. I'm pleased to say that with the next two having come out since the summer of 2004, they're halfway home- and David Yates is the best director yet in bringing out the Harry Potter magic on the screen, something that Chris Columbus and particularly ""Azkaban"" director Alfonso Cuaron failed to do. Where ""Goblet of Fire"" improved in displaying the magic and focusing more on Harry's story, ""Order of the Phoenix"" did even better. <br/><br/>Yates was able to wrangle a 900+ page book down into the shortest movie yet in the series, which was a minor letdown for fans of the books, but succeeds in focusing on the elements that concern Harry's mental well-being considering that most consider him a liar and psychopath for claiming that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned. <br/><br/>One of the most surprising things of ""Phoenix"" and Yates' approach was though he had more than plenty of source material to go by with such a lengthy book, he actually made some changes on top of the deletions- changes that, for the most part, are for the better- particularly in the end of the movie where they feature a sequence where Harry faces mental torment in chasing Voldemort from his mind, a solution that is never explained in the book. <br/><br/>All of the events concerning Harry's well-being or rather lack of it are in the film, and that's what makes it acceptable that the movie was short despite the length of the book.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the audience feels the magic of Hogwarts. It feels like retribution for the magic lost in previous early films, particularly ""Azkaban."" The movie is unresolved, yes, but that's the idea: there's two more installments to provide all the answers. 3.5 stars/4"

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter movie to date. Its predecessor, Goblet of Fire, was a huge disappointment to me the first time I watched it. The beginning was hurried and confusing and by the time it got to anything good, my first impression seriously hindered my enjoyment of it. Order of the Phoenix, however, was brilliant from the start  I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story-line did not deviate, as it has been know to do in the movies, and there were definite hints of what's to come. I was totally impressed by how far Daniel Radcliffe's acting has come on  he showed real emotion and depth - he really was Harry Potter. Emma Watson on the other hand  what happened? Her performance has slowly been worsening since her excellent performance in the Prisoner of Azkaban. She was too dramatic nearly all of the time, and had a really annoying habit of, when it was her line, taking a deep breath, striking a pose, and speaking r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. Rupert Grint's performance was as good as ever and Imelda Staunton was magnificent as Dolores Umbridge, as was Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood.

"mormonboy23","8","0","0","14 August 2007"," One of the better HP films so far...
","Despite speeding through the plot and excluding several things from the book, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is probably one of the better Harry Potter films I have seen so far. The movie also manages to show the emotions emitted by characters in the book, such as frustrations towards Umbridge. The acting of Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix was amazing, I could really feel that her character had been brought to life.<br/><br/>Another character I would like to note is Dumbledore. Since Richard Harris's death, I have been a little disappointed with Michael Gambon replacing him. However, in this film, his character seemed a little less wild than before. While he does show talent in speech and projection, Gambon still seems too powerful for the role of Dumbledore.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast did a very good job at bringing life to their characters. Although Hermione's character seems to become progressively more spastic and less intelligent, the rest of the characters show a greater change of character throughout the movie as the Harry Potter series becomes darker than ever before.<br/><br/>David Yates also did a good job at portraying the strong relationship between Harry and Sirius. Yates, who will also be working on Half Blood Prince seems to have made an improvement in the Harry Potter films since Chris Columbus stopped work at movie #2. While this movie could have used a little more book content, it did expand upon the world of Harry Potter in a positive way and helped the audience further understand a world much like our own. <br/><br/>Overall, I give OoTP an 8 out of 10. While it is an improvement from movies 3 and 4, It's not one I would watch over and over again for very long."

I seems the characters actually went to acting classes for this one. I have some complains though the movie did not capture the end of the book I mean Harry was downright furious at Sirius death to say the least he was trashing Dumbledore's office and was on the verge on going after Dumbledore too not seating weeping at his lost. The prophecy was changed and Neville's possible involvement. Another miss the mirror from Sirius is missing and that is important for the last book. I also regret the lost of the comedy part I recall an scene where Draco is trying to corner Harry and he just replies something like Sure the Death eaters and Voldemort were just warm up practice for you. Though I loved the girl playing Luna she seemed to be missing her odd artifacts that made her bizarre in the book I do no know odd glasses, strange pendants.

The plot plays out nicely, the acting is great, even the special effects were great (I especially love the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the end). Daniel Radcliffe was EXCELLENT in this movie; he was so believable. Also, I don't think the casting director could have found anyone better to play Professor Umbridge.<br/><br/>I know that it would be impossible to fit almost 900 pages of wonderful literature into a 2 hour movie, but I guess I expected more. So many key factors were left out. I found myself hoping that the others in the theater would go back and read the book if they hadn't already to get the full picture. <br/><br/>Some examples of content left out that I felt should have been included: -Howler to Petunia Dursley and Dumbledore's explanation to Harry about why he must go ""home"" every summer. -Percy Weasley's severe lack of loyalty to the family -Hermione & Ron's promotion to prefect -Ron playing quiddich. Harry and the others being banned from quiddich. -The conversation with the centaurs that gave Hermione the idea to take Umbridge there.<br/><br/>Also, there were changes that misguided the plot.

Voldemort is back but the Ministry of Magic denies it and make Harry and Dumbledore look like the bad guys so the order of the phoenix is left to fight Voldemort and his death eaters.

","As has been pointed out, this is the shortest movie - made, paradoxically, from the longest book. I'm not sure who's responsible for this, but we can only hope that the DVD version restores the subtlety that Rowling wrote into the story. For example: in the book, as Harry tries to deal with being cut off from Dumbledore, Ron is dealing with a lack of support from Harry. It is a nice parallel plot, one that Rupert Grint would have handled nicely, given a chance to do so. But instead of luxuriating in the human-interest sub-plots, we are rushed through what amounts to an action flick. This is horribly frustrating and a mis-read of this series' viewing public. Surely the producers know that we'll sit through a longer movie (as many of us did with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) if the film is true to the book, yet sustainable as a visual experience.<br/><br/>Alas and alack, Yates has been booked to direct the next one, as well.

","I have read and enjoyed each of the Harry Potter books, although I have only read them once each. Reading other's comments, it appears that I am in the minority in that I found that the Order of the Phoenix contained the most redundancy. For me, the first 200 pages and the last 200 pages were up to the usual standard, but the middle section (and a hefty section at that, being over 400 pages) felt an awful lot like filler.<br/><br/>I am pleased to say that the film has been made in such a way that a lot of that filler has been condensed into concise snippets, which assist the story without taking up an inordinate amount of time. My only word of caution would be that, although I haven't read the book since it was released, I still knew enough about it that the story didn't lose me. I would have to speak to someone who has seen the film but not read the book to confirm whether this would be the case for those who haven't read it.<br/><br/>Certainly, the pacing of this film seems perfect, with an excellent balance struck between drama, action, storyline and comic relief. Although the film is over two hours, it really never dragged and I hope is a sign of things to come with the film adaptations.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, the adult cast is as good as always, with particular standouts being Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix LeStrange and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black.<br/><br/>As for the principals, they have all noticeably improved, with the biggest difference being Ron Weasley. I was finding the portrayal of him to be increasingly irritating, with his range of acting seemingly restricted to face-pulling.

Though it's madly efficient and quite often exciting, squeezing in 850 pages of text into the shortest Potter yet, less than 140 minutes, this fifth installment is decidedly more dour and grim than the previous installments. A recurring theme of the past films has been the teamwork that has made Harry, Hermoine and Ron such a formidable trio. The later two take a backseat in this story so that the depiction of Harry's melancholic internal struggle can be front and center. Thankfully, the prevalence of the book's most devious and clever creation, the fascist middle-manager Delores Umbridge, has remained intact. Imelda Staunton, her family name quite appropriate for such a niggling squat character. Gosh, how I adored the emittance of her high-pitched squeal - intended to be friendly...instead such an assault. Also, like always, the film makes grand usage of its exemplary all-star British cast - everyone getting an opportunity to interact within the rich Hogwarts universe. Especially noteworthy are watching Branagh's old flames mug it up under heavy makeup. Never dull, the film flies by... but by the end of a special effects laden climactic battle we realize how unimportant this story in the grand scheme.

The plot was interesting, the effects superior for the times, the main kid characters fresh and funny, the older actors brought seasoned skills to the project and it was just the right mix of all the elements to make it fun and worthwhile to watch. (Although I still don't understand why witches celebrate Christmas!) Subsequent installments left me progressively disinterested until, finally, this last one.....and it is THE last one that I will go to see even if another one is ever produced. I can't fathom someone spending $25. on a book then $8.50 to see the movie version, then trying to figure out how or why one is better or worse than the other, then coming to this venue, or some other, to express some profound pronouncements......of a Harry Potter comparison!!! Personally, I don't care about the books and how the films compare to them. I want to see a movie that can stand on it's own merits and production values, and this one, unfortunately, stands shakily. The kids aren't cute anymore, the plot has evolved beyond interest, there are no new effects added and, in short, it has become a stale, boring snoozefest. One of the few consistent bright spots in ANY of these films has been the older actors. I'm certain that any one of them could make the reading of a deli menu seem like Shakespeare. <br/><br/>Rent it on DVD when available and watch it if you've been troubled with insomnia. It will do the trick."

","There are very many differences between the book and the movie,therefore I was disappointed,but this not the only reason.The movie doesn't really contain the book's atmosphere,it doesn't make you feel as excited and powerful as the book makes you feel when it shows you about the D.A. and the student's rebellion.The book has a more beautiful spirit and the movie could of been better directed to show it.Teenage Snape and Marauders look lousy.They could of chosen better-looking actors more similar to the adult ones.The spell ""Levicorpus"" doesn't appear until the 6th book,Harry reads it in the Half-Blood Prince's book,as his own invention.However the scene from the Ministry of Magic is great.The duels,everything is great in spite of the differences between book and movie.Helena Bonham Carter is more than perfect to play Bellatrix Lestrange.Alan Rickman (in playing Snape) as well,as he has from the beginning.Evanna Lynch plays Luna good too.The movie wasn't so bad,but it could of been exceptional."

","When I heard that the Harry Potter movies had taken on a new director because the last did not wish to proceed further, I approached the newest movie- Order of the Pheonix with hesitation. When I heard that the new director had not read the books I almost waited for it to come to video.<br/><br/>I did not start out a Harry Potter fan. I hadn't even opened the first book until after the third movie came out. I've caught up since. I was thoroughly impressed with the first movies as they were pretty close to the books; given the lengths of the books and expectations for movies. I was most impressed with the Goblet of Fire because I feared the movie would be too complicated- however they managed to at least make the movie worth watching for book fans.<br/><br/>The Order of the Phoenix was everything the last movies were- dramatic and exciting with wonderful imagery on camera. However the goal to make this ""the shortest Harry Potter movie yet"" (a quote from the new director in an Entertainment interview) was disappointing. Not because my favorite scenes were left out, but because I've read the books and the movie was not what I read. I do not watch the movies because I want to know what happens (duh, I've read the books) I watch the movies because I love the choice in cast, so far everyone is just how I imagined, and because I want to watch what I've read. The last movie was somebody else's book. It came from somebody else's imagination- it was a disappointment. I was hoping, still am though it seems unlikely, that an extended cut for readers will be in the DVD. If its not this time, I hope the director is reading bloggs and realizes that if he is going to gut the books at least include something for those who have read them.<br/><br/>I realize there are two audiences: those who love the books, and those who just wait for the movies. I hope the director decides to target us both.<br/><br/>Fingers crossed for the next one: Lori"

","While the first two Harry Potters were made in a very classic way, no unconventional things or matters that in another way were different book, this is what made them a good movie version of the novels. The third and fourth tried a more dark approach, with a new Hogwarts. While I found the third movie satisfying, the fourth movie was atrocious in my opinion, rushing over everything, giving no complete feeling whatsoever, deleting important and cool parts, and replacing them by useless scenes that were either 'spectacular' or funny (the dragon chase, which made no appearance in the book, lasted about 15 minutes). However, David Yates seems to understand better that a movie needs dialogue and character development. Granted, the fourth book was more action-packed while the fifth contained more character development and dialogue. Yates however, especially in the beginning, uses the time to create bonds between Harry and Sirius for instance, introduces Luna Lovegood in a clear way, etc. The issue with the last few films is however still present in this movie, and that is the fact that many facts are not explained (Grimmauld Place, Order of the Phoenix (!), WHY and how they exactly went to the Ministry could have been much more clear). Of course, Rowling wastes little time in explaining most terms and characters from previous novels, and this justifies why Yates doesn't make this movie for non-readers. However, independent from the book, the movie is not individually a good work of art. Not like The Godfather, The Green Mile, or The Shawshank Redemption, does the movie explain itself and needs no explanation by reading the book. Therefore I conclude this movie is a very nice visualisation, a concrete interpretation of how things look that are described in the book, with some memorable acting (Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith seem born for their role)."

","I'll admit that I adore the Harry Potter books, but was never a huge fan of the movies. The first one was mediocre, the second good for only one reason (*cough* Sexy Jason Isaacs *cough*), and I LOATHED the third one. The movie that opened my eyes to its cinematic potential was the grandly staged fourth one. And now we have the fifth one: a modern masterpiece in itself.<br/><br/>Harry Potter wears converse chucks. The students listen to rock music in the common room. While my friends were mocking these details, I admired them. Harry Potter is a hero for our generation. This isn't some out-of-this-world fantasy (no offense, LOTR, I love you!) This is a teenage boy with problems and anxieties we can all relate to. Sure, not all of us have battled an evil wizard, but we can still relate to the darkness of war and the death of a loved one.<br/><br/>I was incredibly proud of the improvement in acting for the main three. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have developed into quite the young actors. Sure, Mr. Grint could use a diction coach, but they know their characters inside and out. Quite astounding, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Of course, I *heart* the majority of the adult cast. I hated Gary Oldman in the third one, but he's proved himself in this one. Brendan Gleeson is a delight as Mad-Eye, and I've always loved David Thewlis as Lupin. And being one of the many who suggested Helena Bonham Carter for Belltrix at the very beginning, her knockout performance wasn't a shock to me. Umbridge and Luna were pitch-perfect. Emma Thompson, Maggie Smith, and the unsinkable Alan Rickman are always standouts for me.<br/><br/>The scenes involving the D.A. were fabulous: exactly how I imagined them. I didn't find Grawp very impressive, but the movie had many golden moments. I was a fan of the scene in the common room after Harry gets his first smooch. We all have those moments where we burst out laughing with our friends. I loved how they added that scene in there...<br/><br/>I don't like Ralph Fiennes as Voldy, but I can't picture anyone else doing the role. The duel between the Dark Lord and Dumbledore was one for the ages. My favorite scene was where Harry, haunted by hundreds of bad memories, recollects the happy ones and says to Voldemort, ""You'll never know love or friendship"". It was the rare HP moment that made my eyes fill up. I felt emotionally involved, a rarity in films nowadays. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a contemporary classic. What more can you say about that?"
"WheelerClown","8","0","0","9 August 2007"," A flawed yet still superb performance.
","My chief complaint about this film was that certain key (comical) scenes that I anticipated for months were disappointingly not there. Am I the only one who was looking forward to seeing the DA give Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle what for when they attacked Harry on the Hogwarts train at year end? Or the swamp created in the Great Hall by the Weasley twins? Granted the movie was meant to be dark and somber, but a little humor never hurts, especially when it is so delightfully described in JK Rowling's prose.<br/><br/>That said, the overall movie was a resounding success. The acting on all parts was superb. I haven't seen a better casting of a Hogwarts ""villain"" than Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge since Kenneth Brannaugh's delightful portrayal of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staunton had the best (worst?) traits of the character down cold. Her oozing patronizing speech as she spoke down to the students. Her vile cold-hardiness as she ""tortured"" Harry in detention. I could go on and on. As for other ""villains"", Helena Bonham-Carter as the malevolent and somewhat mad Bellatrix Lestrange was also riveting, if somewhat underused. David Bradley really shone as Argus Filch in this movie, more so than any of the preceding ones. The Dursleys were as always dreadfully good, but very underused. I did not get a good sense of Uncle Vernon's delightful villainy this time around. Tom Bradley as Draco Malfoy was also woefully underused, but I am sure this will be remedied in Half-Blood Prince. And Kreacher couldn't have been done better, although I was disappointed to see his part in the villainy that resulted in Black's death was woefully absent in the picture.<br/><br/>The two newest female ""good guys"" were also superb, although in one case woefully underused. The casting of Evanna Lynch and Natalia Tena as Luna Lovegood and Nymphadora Tonks, was brilliant. Tonks' character was not seen nearly enough, but in both cases when the characters were seen, Evanna and Natalia stole the show.<br/><br/>Of course the old regulars did their usual superb jobs (well for the most part anyway). Dan, Emma, and Rupert really shine in this movie, showing how much the characters of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron have grown through the years because of their trials and just because kids just have a way of growing up. I especially like the transformation of Hermoine from ""follow the rules to the letter"" bookworm to actually enjoying being a rebel. I have always enjoyed Maggie Smith's portrayal of McGonagal and she did not disappoint me in this movie. Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid was not used enough, but this was true to the book. (Grawp was fantastically done by the way, although not quite the way I pictured him). I can't get used to Professor Flitwick's amazing youthful transformation that took place in an earlier film, but Warwick Davis still does a fine job. Snape as always is delightful (Alan Rickman is one of my all time favorite actors), and the way he reacts to Harry seeing the memory of him being taunted and teased by James Potter was superb. Speaking of that scene, however, the aftermath (Harry coming to grips with the fact that his father wasn't perfect and maybe Snape had a reason to be the way he is) was just glossed over. A wonderful opportunity for character development lost.<br/><br/>I have never been a fan of Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. Richard Harris was so much better, and I couldn't help but wonder how he would have interpreted the Dumbledore scenes in this movie. Gambon did okay, more so than in the last film, but he just doesn't have the magic that Harris did.<br/><br/>The plot, except for the disappointment I expressed at the beginning of this review was actually handled quite well and the story was moving. I can't complain at all there. Like others have mentioned, some more detail in the Hall of Prophecy scene would have been an improvement, as could have Fred and George Weasley's last stand. And not having the centaurs speak about why they hate wizards made what they did to Umbridge a bit confusing. Still all in all, a great movie that I recommend to all Potter-fanatics."

After leaving the previous 22 ( or 4, i can't remember) Harry Potter films with tears in my eyes and a numb arse, I was happy to see that they are getting better as the characters grow up. The films are getting Darker with more action and story lines are starting to take shape. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson are starting to act now and this for one make watching the film a whole lot easier.

","After the Goblet of Fire, I didn't really have high expectations of The Order of the Phoenix, but it being my favourite book of the series thought I would go and see it. What a disappointment. After Moody was so badly cast, i didn't think they could do any worse until I saw their Umbridge, she was not evil enough or simpering enough to be Umbridge. There was entirely no mention of Snape and what he was doing, i think he had one line. How are they going to explain why he kills Dumbledore in the next film? Bearing in mind practically the entirety of the book took place at 12 Grimmauld Place, there was only one scene at the beginning where Harry was there. Nothing was explained in the film, it has turned into one of those films where they assume you've read the book and don't feel the need to explain whats going on. Sirius' death was so quick that I actually didn't care. The film was worse than the Goblet of Fire, i left not remembering what actually happened because the scenes were so disjointed. To top it off was the fight at the end between Dumbledore and Voldemort. This was an explosive fight in the book, and I was looking forward to it being transferred to screen, but it was awful. They say the reason they leave so much out is time constrictions? Lord of the Rings was 3.5 hours long, people don't mind long film times, i'd much prefer that than watching a bad film that ruins my expectations."
"chaz_burgess","Null","0","0","2 August 2007"," Not as good as the other ones
","I have heard people complain about how the film cuts from the book, but this time it is a bit more obvious. However, for nearly 3 hours it obviously has to cut some of it. The bit that makes this film a let down is the death of Sirius Black. It was short and very very poorly done. Even an interesting bit of editing (slow motion reaction kinda thing) didn't save the audience from disappointment. HELLO THIS MAN WAS THE ONLY PERSON HARRY HAD LEFT WHO WAS LINKED TO HIS LOST PAST. Ten seconds of screen time doesn't not do this tragic turn of events justice. For those who complain about the adult nature of this film, it is not the kiss that is the problem, as this is quite tame really- but it is so much darker than many of the others. Remember- this is NOT a children's story anymore. This is more a adult/teen thing now. It may not be suitable for any respectable parent to take a child less than ten along to see it. Special effects- nothing notable really. Shots- beautifully done. Cuts from the book- far too many. However, YOU WILL STILL LOVE IT!!!!"
"xxjoefro","6","0","0","1 August 2007"," One of the best Comedies of the Summer, too bad HPOOTP was supposed to be dark and dramatic.(Very minor Deathly Hallows Spoiler, I give warning before it)
","Three words: Too Much Comedy.<br/><br/>I pre-purchased my Phoenix tickets as soon as I could, for the past year and a half have been researching the title, very excited with every screen shot released. When I first heard Phoenix was going to be 138 minutes long I wasn't happy but I didn't worry, the last four films were for the most part good. After I saw Phoenix I was in a state of shock. My favorite book in the Potter series...ruined. Where was 3/4s of the book? Where was the drama and agony in Harry's life? While I will admit the acting and production of the movie was great, the story was terrible. I want Steve Kloves back!<br/><br/>The moment I knew the film would be terrible was almost from the beginning of the film. Harry and Dudley run under a tunnel and all is getting cold and dark just like dementors make the environment, yet the lights stay on? Wow. Then the dementor attacks Harry. In HPPOA the dementors hands are very skeletal and bony, now the dementors have normal human hands covered by black cloth.<br/><br/>I'll cover my biggest complaints now, I don't have enough room to type to write them all.<br/><br/>What happened to 'A Peck of Owls'? The movie had one owl fly in, in the book at least five fly(I'm not exactly sure).......SPOILER FOR DEATHLY HALLOWS..... I think each owl was important and especially the howler for Petunia from Dumbledore. This comes into play in Deathly Hallows......SPOILER OVER....... This scene would of been the only scene they needed to show how corrupt the Ministry of Magic was.<br/><br/>Sirius in the Fire. Now two years ago, in HPGOF, Harry talks to Sirius Black through the Floo Network in the Common Room. Sirius' face was made out of fire embers. This was different from the book but I didn't mind. In Phoenix they decide to change it to the way it was in the book, well why? There is hardly any consistency in these movies anymore.<br/><br/>The Kiss. Wait, shouldn't they have called it ""The 'French' Kiss""? This scene was supposed to be a sweet teen first kiss on Valentine's Day in a Pub in Hogsmeade. Yet it somehow became part of the Montage(more on that in a bit), and it was in the not-romantic-at-all Room of Requirement. Harry and Cho Chang don't have a little kiss they have a 10 second make-out session.<br/><br/>The Montage. The whole scene with the D.A. and Hogwarts. It was a comedic montage that was very rushed and didn't capture the spirit of the book at all. It felt like a preview for the real movie.<br/><br/>The fight. Hello drama? Wait lets let them change the way prophecies are supposed to work. Oh yeah and lets let Harry give into Lucius Malfoy. Right? Wrong! This scene really does show that Harry is maturing; but it makes him seem like a baby. Now the fight. They just keep fighting in one room. In the book they have lots of rooms; one room has brains in it, one has time-turners and lots more. Then the climax of the book. Sirius' death. It's all comedy, comedy, laugh, laugh, Sirius dies, oh wait we aren't supposed to be laughing? Yeah. And the vale? Really, it looked like a giant plasma TV with a curtain screen saver. Then Voldemort and Dumbledore fight. Wow, I didn't know that two wands that don't have dual-cores can have a priori incantum. And at the beginning of the movie they make a point to zoom in and focus on the fountain at the M.o.M. kind of in a foreshadowing way, I was actually excited. Then the fight came and went, the fountain went untouched. Then when the fight is over Harry and Dumbledore are talking back at Hogwarts and Dumbledore doesn't know of this 'prophecy'. Right. In the book Dumbledore is the one who heard the original and recorded the prophecy. I love it.<br/><br/>I want three things back for Deathly Hallows.(Since the same people are doing HPHBP, except Steve Kloves is back! yay) I want 1. Alfonso Cauron to direct, he took the Potter series in the right direction, which Mike Newell carried on in GOF but David Yates has almost ruined the series. 2. John Williams, the first four movies had excellent music(Williams did the first three, Patrick Doyale did the fourth and Nicholas Hooper did the fifth)the music in four was different from Williams but it was true the Harry Potter. The music in five was excellent but wasn't true to Harry Potter hardly at all. 3.Steve Kloves, writer of the first four Potter movies, and the sixth! I'm not sure why he didn't do the fifth but I know he regrets it. I'm pretty sure he'll do Deathly Hallows but you never know. He really works close with Jo Rowling to capture the spirit of the books.<br/><br/>Finally I give Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix a 6/10. For the excellent acting, production values, and excellent music(even though it wasn't right for the movie it was still good)<br/><br/>Hope this review was helpful. This is my first real review and rating that I have truthfully written. I have written it and taken my time because I love the world of Harry Potter so much. I only want the best for it.<br/><br/>Joey Waguespack(joefro72@gmail.com)"

"caliberx","9","0","0","31 July 2007"," on the music and other stuff
","I rarely notice the music in films but I did with the last 3 potter films.<br/><br/>John Williams music has always fitted well with popular fantasy movies for as long as I can remember and so does his score for Harry Potter. But he outdid himself with his score for Azkaban. His music for that movie really gave it that extra touch of magic (no pun intended) and wonderment and made what was already an excellent movie even better. I would have given him that Oscar he was nominated for.<br/><br/>In Goblet of Fire I too noticed the music but for the wrong reasons. It was too simplistic , repetitive and absolutely made my movie experience a lesser one. Just repeating a jingle in a higher tone doesn't raise tension, it jerks me out of my temporary suspension of disbelieve by irritating me.<br/><br/>So when I went to see Order I feared they hadn't been able to find someone to fill Williams shoes. But I was wrong, the magic is back. Nicholas Hoopers score is wonderful. At times it too bordered on the simplistic but when it shone, it shone like a full petronas. From the long sighs of the violins at the kiss to the low stabs of the strings during the battle, every major musical piece was full of delightful surprises.<br/><br/>So what about the other stuff? Daniel Radcliffe impressed me. He and the others kept growing steadily over the years but here I really felt he was a professional actor. Emma Watsons brows kept distracting me though, keep them steady girl.<br/><br/>Like all the others, I thought the fights were excellent but not just for the visual effects. The sound editing during the Dumbledore/Voldemort fight was spot on. I always appreciate the use of silence and the twirls of Dumbledores wand were effective and a wonderful nod to Cuarons Azkaban. I understand but regret the absence of Dobby, specially since Deathly Hallows where his presence marks important growth for Harry's character. But what I really missed was the sacking of Hagrid, it would have strengthened Harry's feeling of isolation and the (mistaken) absence of Order members would help explain his actions. But despite these shortcomings they did get the feeling right with this movie and that is quite an achievement, with all the slashing they had to do. Together with Azkaban, this is the best Potter movie."
"dr_foreman","8","0","0","31 July 2007"," Another solid adaptation
","To me, the Harry Potter films are all solid, perfectly reasonable adaptations of J.K. Rowling's books. The cool special effects, stunning sets, and eccentric English character actors work together beautifully to bring the world of the books to life. Certainly, the movies are not as deep or rich as the books - but that's only to be expected, since they're shorter than the books by necessity.<br/><br/>Alas, a lot of Harry Potter fans seem to attack the movies because they ""cut out"" parts of the books. I can understand their frustration, but really, it would be impossible to adapt the books in their entirety without making the movies about 4 hours long apiece. So, cut-down versions are simply inevitable.<br/><br/>And, in the case of ""Order of the Phoenix,"" I think the filmmakers were right to trim some fat off the book. Rowling's novel is pretty good, but I remember finding it frustrating in parts. The plot concerns a lot of petty bureaucrats in the Ministry of Magic denying that Lord Voldemort has returned, and their obstinacy gets a little tiresome after a while. Even the ""edited"" film version drags a bit in the middle, as ministry officials Cornelius Fudge and Dolores Umbridge do their best to tie Harry Potter up in lots of red tape. I suppose it's a realistic plot, but it's also borderline tedious.<br/><br/>Thankfully, both the book and the movie end with satisfying action. The climatic confrontation between the good and evil wizards was fun to read, but arguably the action works even better on screen. Pleasingly enough, the old professor, Dumbledore, gets to joint he fight and show off some funky wizard moves.<br/><br/>Speaking of Dumbledore, I should like to defend the actor who plays him in this film, Michael Gambon. I enjoy his performance a lot; his Dumbledore is a little more eccentric and aloof than Richard Harris's, and I think that take on the character works well. Some Potter fans tend to slam Gambon, suggesting that he's some kind of unworthy successor to Harris. But honestly, I think Gambon's awesome - and he did star in ""The Singing Detective,"" which is often praised as the greatest TV miniseries of all time. So he's hardly a total Piltdown man, is he? <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I've ended up writing a defensive review of this movie, since people have slammed it for the plot trims and Gambon's performance. But I guess I just wanted to address some of the common criticisms. I'll admit that this certainly isn't the best Potter movie - it's too draggy in parts, and the direction/design are just OK - but it is definitely another worthy adaptation that doesn't deserve a lot of stick for not being completest."
"alainenglish","9","0","0","31 July 2007"," Best so far
","""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the best one so far. David Yates, the fourth director to take on the franchise, has upped the stakes considerably introducing a grander scale, epic feel and (even for Harry Potter) a considerably top-heavy cast.<br/><br/>Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) faces opposition for his fifth year at Hogwart's. Not only is Lord Voldemort, his parent's killer and dark wizard, returned from the dead, no-one except Dumbledore (Micheal Gambon) believes him. The Ministry of Magic, who do not believe Harry, appoint Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to oversee the school's Defence Against the Dark Arts. But she's really there to make sure Harry keeps quiet about Voldemort. After she tortures him for opening his mouth, the boy wizard mounts a rebellion...<br/><br/>Harry grows up a lot in this one, and seriously takes matters into his own hands here, mounting an army and taking on Voldemort with the aid of his friends. Great scenes include Harry's mock trial near the beginning of the movie, Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon) escape from the Ministry (this scene features the film's best one-liner) and the final battle with the fiendish Voldemort (a snarling Ralph Fiennes).<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is brilliant as Sirius Black, being more than just a head in a fireplace this time and providing some poignant moments in the movie. An under-used Helena Bonham-Carter appears as Black's loopy sister Bellatrix Lestrange. Radcliffe is as good as ever, as the earnest boy wizard, and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are on fine form as Ron and Hermione. The scene where they discuss Harry's first kiss is a comic highlight.<br/><br/>The cast is top-heavy right down to the minor roles. ""Balamory"" star Miles Jupp has a blink-and-you'll-miss-him role as a TV weatherman while prominent theatre actress Kathryn Hunter appears as Harry's neighbour Mrs Figg. Incidentally Hunter was on double-duty shooting this picture, as she was playing the role of ""Yerma"" at London's Arcola Theatre at the same time. The production took a week out of performances so she could go and film her scenes for the movie.<br/><br/>The final scene falls just short of being mawkish but holds back enough to leave you begging for next year's episode ""The Half-Blood Prince""."

For those of you getting frustrated by the childish nature of the previous movies and their failure to remain true to the books will be pleased that this one is stepping ever closer to being true to the book and also being made for adults.<br/><br/>Although many characters have been sidelined such as Kreacher (House Elf in the Black household), other characters were cut completely including Firenze (the Centaur who takes over the divination post) and Nearly Headless Nick, the screenwriters have managed to compensate by simply cutting out bits of the book such as the content of several lessons, the naming of Dumbledore's Army and the entire Quidditch story line.<br/><br/>Seeing as this review has been submitted so late I expect you may have either seen this film or heard about it from someone else, so I shall leave you to go back to your copies of Deathly Hallows as I am sure you have purchased said book in this time of Harry Mania. For those interested at all I am giving Harry Potter: Order of the Phoenix 7 Horcruxes out of 10 (hardcore fans will notice that 7 is the number of Horcruxes Voldemort has, even more hardcore fans will notice that the term Horcrux doesn't appear in Order of the Phoenix)."

","There is no doubt that the new entry in the Harry Potter series is well acted and well crafted. Even so, though, it is the worst in the series so far. The Ministry of Magic is growing concerned on Harry's claim that that the Dark Lord (Voldemort) is at full power again. They try to wart off Harry's claim by trying to get him expelled, but they end up failing to do so. So they decide to send one of their workers (Dolores Umbridge) to take a job at Hogwarts. When she arrives, she begins to take over the school and makes the students read about magic other than use magic. The students begin to fear that they won't learn how to protect themselves using magic and look up to Harry to help them learn to do so. So Harry and his friends begin to train the school secretly and everything begins to start off just fine, but Harry is having dreams about a room in the Ministry and begins to see terrible things (like Mr. Weasly being attacked by a snake). Then Dolores finds out that the students are learning magic without her approval. Once she finds out so, she takes over the school as head master and Ministry tries to take Dumbledore to Azkaban. Then Harry has another dream that his uncle (Sirius Black) is being attacked in a room at the Ministry by Voldemort who wants him to get something in the room. So, Harry's friend and him go to Ministry to confront Voldemort and find out whatever Voldemort wants. I don't think that the problem with the film is that it is too dark or that the characters seem more older, but that it skips some info from the book. The movie is too short (even though it is about one-hundred-thirty minutes long) and some viewers may not understand stuff in the movie if they have not read the book (even though they should have read the book). Overall though, it is a good movie and think fans will enjoy it. Overall: B<br/><br/>-Ben Russell<br/><br/>Note: This movie and the previous movie have been rated PG-13, but for the most part, the movies are like PG."
"TDeMona","3","0","0","29 July 2007"," First really ambitious and wise movie from the book series of a decade.
","First I must say, that, although a Potter-fan I am, I have not found the other movies pretty good. Harry Potter is a book series, a piece meant to be literature. That makes it a hard one to make into a good movie... and finally someone at least tries.<br/><br/>Not since the third installation of Potter series have I left the theater playing Harry Potter movie with such an satisfaction. The direction was superb. Angles and images roared in with a vision; the magic world was executed magically, still without becoming a meaningless blur of overwhelming effects. Also, the script was full of wit and intention. For once they had managed to understand, that adapting a book means different than copying the book word-to-word. They were very brave of altering the holy word of Rowling's, but in eight of ten cases, the effort payed off. The effects never take the grand stage, unless in the final grand combat between Dumbledore and You-Know-Who. I would have rather seen a Gandalf/Saruman -style magic battle. I remind you that the really great magicians don't need to explode everything and throw fire bolts from their fingers. Otherwise, the images were almost too beautiful to see and the musical score rocked.<br/><br/>The story of this one is tighter than usually, which helped to carry on with the narrative. Some important character stuff was cut out anyway, which is never such a good thing, but much less in here than in the ""Harry Potter and the Flaming Goblet"". I would have wished to see more of the Weasley family, at least the running away of Percy, and Umbridge's attempt to capture Hagrid. Also, the ""fights"" between Harry and his school mates didn't really feel so enraged than in the book to that extent, that we almost don't understand Harry when he says that he feels anger almost all the time. Also, the bit where Harry invades Snape's memory seemed kinda fake. Also, in the beginning the dialog doesn't work very well.<br/><br/>About the characters/actors: Gary Oldman steals the show as Sirius Black. Finally little more screen time for him. Also Alan Rickman and Helena Bonham-Carter make a brilliant job with their rather small roles. Stauton as Umbridge doesn't hit the mark all that well, she is rather ""amusing"" than evil and twisted. She doesn't look like Umbridge, and she doesn't act like her. But all the children have evolved as actors, even Daniel Ratcliffe, with his notable performance as the Defence Against Dark Arts teacher. Cho Chang was good, and so were Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, but rather trivially used. Filtch became a very good comic relief. And the one character I was certain would not work, Luna Lovegood, was absolutely spot-on perfect. Unfortunately, Voldemort and Dementors still aren't scary and Mad-Eye Moody still doesn't quite work, but those are the faults caused by the previous movie makers.<br/><br/>This is my humble opinion. I don't understand those, who didn't appreciate David Yates' work and the changes that he made, all to make the movie a better experiment. I am honestly expecting the next movie almost as much as the final novel. Well, I did say almost."
"CheesySnake","9","0","0","29 July 2007"," Excellent Movie, well worth a look
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the longest book of the series weighing in at a rather hefty 766 pages (UK Hardback Edition published by Bloomsbury 2003). Rather ironically, its become the shortest Potter movie made to date at 138 minutes long.<br/><br/>However, this doesn't stop it turning into a very enjoyable movie. True, many cuts have been made from the book and as an avid fan of the series I was rather disappointed by this. But, if you are willing to temporarily forget what happened in the book for the duration of the film, you'll find that what David Yates has managed to pull off in just over two hours of film, isn't half-bad.<br/><br/>The acting by many of the cast has improved in this sequel, especially in the case of the lead three: Radcliffe, Grint and Watson. The new members of the cast have also made a good debut to the series and made the movie a very enjoyable experience. Evanna Lynch as an example, played the part of Luna Lovegood perfectly and it was slightly disappointing that she didn't feature more in the film.<br/><br/>All in all, despite its obvious departing from the book on many occasions, this is a tremendous movie and in my opinion is well worth taking a trip to the cinema to see."
"gise_diaz","6","0","0","29 July 2007"," Where is the Order of the Phoenix?
","No matter what people say you can't separate the movies from the books as has been suggested. This movie wasn't bad. It has great special effects, especially during the last 25 minutes of the movie. The problem resides in the fact that the writer of the screenplay forgot what the book was all about. The book was about the Order of the Phoenix, and sorry kids, but the members of the Order were adults. I understand it is impossible to live up to the expectations of the book, which is infinitely better than the movie. But if you have a great bunch of British actors, together in one set, Shouldn't you use them? You don't sign Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman, Emma Thomson and the wonderful Brendan Gleeson and use them as background decoration! Their characters are interesting and vital in the books. The best scenes of the movie occurred precisely when the adult actors are on scene. The producers and director seem so keen in keeping the Harry Potter movies appealing to little kids that apparently they think adults in the set will bore their young audience. A word of advice: 1)many of the people who go to see these movies (as well as read the books) are adults. And I am not talking young adults, I am talking adults over 30. Secondly, the dynamics of the young students and the older teachers is one of the greatest assets of the books. Why don't use that? Daniel Radcliff has shown he can grow as an actor and it shows in this movie; and he really shines when he is with the adult actors. Guys, producers, writers of this movie, the really cool people in this movie weren't Harry,Cho, Luna, Hermione or Ron. The really cool people, the masters of magic were Tonks, Lupin, Sirius, Mad-Eyed Moody, Kingsley and of course Dumbledore. Your loss if you decided to give them three lines each, so Harry could have a longer kiss with Cho. Also I would like to add that the soundtrack of this movie was much much inferior than any of the four previous movies. As one of the fellow users said, ""music does matter."" And also I would like to say I wouldn't have mind a three hour movie either."

","I am not a die-hard Potter fanatic but I do enjoy reading the books (once I have wrestled them from my girlfriend's grasp). But watching this movie, it struck me how much the story has changed since the first one.<br/><br/>In the first movie, you had a magical world, strange creatures, innocence, magic and a captivated Harry discovering a new world. Now fast-forward to book / movie 5 - what do you have? Despair, depression, darkness, death, evil. Not exactly an uplifting message for kids is it? When I went to the cinema to see this, the kids were in tears by the end.<br/><br/>I can't fault the making of this movie. The special effects were outstanding and the script was excellent with good acting all round. But I just couldn't get it out of my head how dark and negative this story has become (and it gets even worse in books 6 & 7). This really has gone from being a children's story to being an adult story (should we really have torture in a children's movie? I'm not sure children should be seeing Harry getting acid on his hands).<br/><br/>Top marks though to Imelda Staunton who did a magnificent job of playing Dolores Umbridge, the woman everyone hates. She was perfectly cast in the role she was born to play.<br/><br/>Before watching this movie, take a big dose of Prozac. You'll need it."
"s-price476","7","0","0","29 July 2007"," A Taste of Things To Come....?
","This was a movie that had the odds stacked against it from the off. Consider the evidence:- 1) It had to repeat the all out action of The Goblet of Fire and 2) had to be successfully adapted from J.K.Rowling's wordiest and character driven book to date. The book is a wash-up from the last as it explores new characters and develops current ones whilst highlighting the rise of Lord Voldemort. The film is good overall as the pace is just about right, although it's just a pity that there was no meaty characterisation for the actors to get their teeth into. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry well and brings the angst, compassion and dare that have made the books so popular. The other more seasoned actors (Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes etc) seem to relish their roles also, however, due to the cutting down of the source material (for the sake of cinema), they are somewhat underused. To sum up- an enjoyable slice of entertainment but readers of the book will feel slightly short changed. Having said that the movie sets things up rather nicely for the last two instalments in the Potter saga."
"Moragandjim58","6","0","0","29 July 2007"," Somewhat Disappointing
","As an avid reader of the books, I have always considered the Order of the Phoenix and The Half Blood Price as my two favourite Harry Potter books. It worries me therefore that David Yates is/will be directing the Half Blood Prince when in my opinion, in the Order of the Phoenix he has failed to capture the full experience which J K Rowling created in her novel.<br/><br/>I know it is an incredibly difficult task to condense a novel of the sheer length of Order of the Phoenix onto film, however again in my opinion, Mike Newell did a far better job in interpreting The Goblet of Fire novel (which isn't a short story by anyone's standards) and captured most of the truly significant elements from the book onto the screen.<br/><br/>I wonder how much of this is down to the screen writing skills of Steve Kloves who was responsible for all the screenplays for the previous films. Screenwriters are often the unsung heroes of successful films and in this case through Steve Kloves, we have seen a progression of improvements in the transfer of book to screen through each film as the screen writer becomes familiar with the characters and the storyline. David Yates brings in Michael Goldenberg and suddenly we have a fabulous novel turned into a mediocre movie.<br/><br/>We started off with a simple but satisfying film in the form of HP and the Sorcerers Stone and in each successive film we saw a build up of the stories and the characters which I think we had all hoped would lead to a crescendo for the final movie. However, I just feel let down by Yate's interpretation of the Order of the Phoenix and I really hope that Steve Klove's return as screenwriter for the Half Blood Prince signals a return to that development of character, storyline and content. Forget about CGI effects (well maybe not forget them) but at least lets get all the elements of character back onto the screen for the two final films.<br/><br/>Plaudits do have to go to Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman who simply ooze quality for their portrayal of Sirius Black and Severus Snape. Daniel Radcliffe too has progressed from the 'amdram' new boy we saw in the Sorcerer's Stone, to a polished character who displayed all the anger and confusion which epitomised J K's portrayal of him in the Order of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>(Oh, and by the way, I would have had no problem with a 3 hour movie with an intermission. Maybe we'll see a 'Directors cut' version of the Order of the Phoenix in the future)"
"Stephanieramsay","9","0","0","28 July 2007"," better than the last
","While it will never be possible for any of the later films to be as true to the books as the first two (dont forget that the first two were less than 300 pages and the last several have been well over 600) I think that this movie does a good job of keeping to the story line. When a book is as beloved, and yes even as obsessed over, as these books are, there are always going to be those people that are disappointed when the minute details that make the story books what they are are not included in the movie. Overall, it is really well done and they managed to get much more of the main story line into this film than the last. The cinematography is wonderful and the acting is getting better every time. As the main characters grown up and their acting becomes less forced, the movies continue to evoke the essence of the written characters. The ensemble cast including such British greats as Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson really brings these films past the children's films that I think that many adults think of them as and into an entirely new genre. Our grandparents had the Lord of the Rings and this generation has Harry Potter. Well worth seeing."
"fantasyescapist","Null","0","0","28 July 2007"," Improved acting from all but about as rushed as it's predecessor...
","I was really apprehensive going to see this as the film before this, Goblet of Fire was a major disappointment. This, while an improvement on the last has some problems in pacing and scenes just don't last that long and feel tacked together with a shot over Hogwarts or something.<br/><br/>This is obviously a lot more emotional than the last, with Harry feeling like an outcast and loosing his temper easily, even with his friends. He's annoyed that people at the school and even the Minister of Magic himself just refuse to believe that Voldemort is back.<br/><br/>We're introduced to Luna Lovegood in this one, played quite well by newcomer Evanna Lynch. Luna's a distinctly dotty individual who in her own little world. While she may see completely off her head to her fellow students she and Harry connect through both him and her being outsiders. <br/><br/>Rupert Grint as Ron has really improved loads in this one, even if he doesn't have that many lines we don't see the unsightly face-pulling he was doing in earlier films and Emma Watson's eyebrow-acting as Hermione is still there yet more tolerable than Goblet.<br/><br/>The new teacher(completely evil yet appears to look like someone's aunt)Umbridge dressed completely in pink is deliciously evil and it's almost as if she's jumped from the pages of the book.<br/><br/>Even the kiss that was massively over-hyped, and although a bit longer than expected was alright, but seemed to be lacking in chemistry between Dan Radcliffe and Katie Leung. It just seemed very ... mechanical.<br/><br/>I have to say the battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore towards the end was jaw-dropping(and what I was really looking forward to), with Dan's improved acting showing especially here. It ends a bit too soon for my liking, though.<br/><br/>All in all, it was that bit better than the last but the editing was weird and even though it's the longest book in the series made into the shortest film, they could've made it that bit longer to explain things, as part of me thinks non-book readers won't understand some stuff mentioned.<br/><br/>Like a stepping stone between this and the nest one really."
"gigioiaderosa","9","0","0","27 July 2007"," A mature turn on Harry Potter (HP) movies
","Admittedly; after HP 4, I was scared that there wouldn't have been any other movies with that scale of magnitude. Brilliant dialogs, awesome special effects, and everything that a major fantasy movie should have. Now things are changed. You can definitely forget the whole ballet of the fourth movie, and enter into the real Harry Potter World: a world of solitude,pain and doubt. This movie has a lot of ties with the third installment of the series; the same darkness, the same imminent sense of tragedy; most ultimately, the same sense of doom. Without revealing too much of the plot, we can definitely say that we begin to understand Harry's personality for what it is for real: traumatized.<br/><br/>The brilliant Gothic photography, the soundtrack, magniloquent as always, the whole rhythm of the movie, are definitely involving. The actors, excepts from the usual old glories like Gary Oldman & co.(from which I didn't expect any less than the usual perfection-as it has been), seem to grow up talented. Every performance on a movie is better than the previous one, and I'm just looking forward to the next movie, that should be out in late 2008. <br/><br/>One piece of advice: I've been one of the many to doubt about David Yates' capability; mostly, because I'm not from UK, and as such I didn't know his previous works. Doesn't matter what the guy did before, with this movie he definitely put his name into the history of cinema. This Harry Potter Saga is growing up as one of the most incredible serial of adventure, and being remembered for the (at least in my opinion) best HP movie so far is DEFINITELY something."
"jmbellin","6","0","0","26 July 2007"," Entertaining, But Mostly Forgettable (and Poor 3D Sequence)
","This is one of the better Harry Potter films, but as with all of them (and particularly with the length and detail of book 5), a lot gets left out. Overall, this film was entertaining, but mostly forgettable.<br/><br/>Part of the problem with all of the films is the uneven acting performance quality. Here, Daniel Radcliffe mostly stands around reacting, and not particularly well. The girl playing Hermione also suffers from being a bit stiff. The more noteworthy performances come from the naturalness in the character portrayal of Ron Weasley, the Luna Lovegood actress, Maggie Smith's character (as usual) and the actress playing Delores Umbridge. There are a few others, too, but this is not, overall, great ensemble acting. Yes, there are the few great acting turns (I think of Kenneth Branagh's in one of the earlier ones), but the very fine performances make the mediocre ones (and the unevenness overall) really stand out.<br/><br/>I saw this in IMAX with the 3D presentation during the climactic scenes. The art direction, here, was overall SO busy that it was difficult to follow. I occasionally took off my 3D glasses and, even through the blurriness of the double image, it was easier to follow the action without the glasses. I have seen many films in IMAX, and the 70mm print and great quality soundtrack often make the premium admission price worthwhile. I think I would recommend going to see this one in a traditional theater in order to avoid the 3D.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed this one quite a bit while watching it, but like the others, it became forgettable shortly after the end credits started running.<br/><br/>Personally, while I realize that there are going to be many who want loyal adherence to the plot of the book, I'd like a director to take some real chances and reinvent the story to really create something fresh for the screen so that the film can really stand alone on its own merits."
"kittytopia-1","8","0","0","26 July 2007"," For movie and book fans alike.
","I consider myself a die hard fan of both the books and the movies, but I also believe what works for the pages does not work for the big screen, and vice versa.<br/><br/>For the die hard book fan: If you are the kind of person who thinks the movies should be faithful in their entirety to the books, then prepare to be disappointed. This movie does not only cut TONS of scenes and sub-plots that were loved by book fans, but some of the scenes that were included we altered and some completely changed. Despite the changes, the main story and characters remained faithful to the book & series.<br/><br/>For the die hard movie fan: This movie was actioned packed from the beginning. For once, the emotional state of Harry (especially) and company were believable in conjunction with the story line, making the magical world more realistic. The acting has only gotten better. A lot of dialog was thrown in which might not have meaning to a non book reader. The movie would not be able to go into detail because of time constraints, but it wont confuse the viewer, and will please the book fans. <br/><br/>Personal thoughts: I thought this movie was the best one yet. I was glued to the edge of my seat the whole time. Having been under 2.5 hours long was a plus as well. Although I accept changes and missing scenes from books in the movies, I was disappointed in the extremity of the changes made for this movie. The biggest disappointment was the Dumbledore office scene in the end of the book, where the mood in the movie is totally opposite to the book. The Voldemort vs. Dumbledore duel was a plus side to the extremity of the changes. The fight looked and sounded awesome! And I always say there should more Remus Lupin!"

","For a Harry Potter fan like myself i thought the movie was awful. The storyline was a copy of the books, it was almost like reading the book a second time. I expected more for the 10 dollars. Ron Weasley is a funny character, but this time he went from Hero to Zero. The dialog was embarrassing and the acting was terrible. A bunch of overgrown kids with no touch. Still it was exciting.<br/><br/>Only reason i don't bottom-rate this movie is the magic of Hogwarts. Instead of some random castle, they found the real Hogwarts.<br/><br/>I'll rather watch the first movie a couple of times than renting this one."

Although the movie itself was well put together, the 3D portion did not start until nearing the end of the movie. So if you are considering a drive in order to see this in IMAX you may be disappointed, I drove approx. 1hour and I was not happy with the performance of the film's 3-D perspective.

","I know people were ""wowed"" by the medieval style of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and i admit that it was a great refresher from the dull drone of the first two movies. The Goblet of Fire was a let-down as a film but i feel that director Yates has successfully made a film that is both faithful to the book and entertaining.<br/><br/>'Order' is the longest Harry Potter book, and if we remember back to the Goblet of fire movie - it was rather rushed. as an audience member i felt i had no time to absorb any of the action or dialogue... I was apprehensive that this would be the same with 'Order' (Longest book yet shortest film), however, the narrative of the whole film has been handled very well. There are a couple of sequences (e.g. the progression of Dumbledores Army) where all the action is strung together in a way that we can only relate to as a Martin Scorsese style of narrative. The overall effect of the film is a powerful one.<br/><br/>I hated Umbridge, i feared Voldemort and the Dementors, and the final duel in the Ministry of Magic is amazing - of course, Ralff Fiennes plays his character brilliantly. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a very good Potter film and received a well deserved round of applause from the audience when it ended."

","The 5th installment of the Harry Potter series was undoubtedly my favorite, and I expected the movie to be just as good. I may have gotten my expectations way too high, thus leading to my disappointment in the film. From the Sorcerer's Stone to the Goblet of Fire, I thought the movies were steadily getting better, but the Order of the Phoenix brought that thought to a screeching halt. They skipped so much vital information that I expect the next two films will be nothing BUT explaining to make up for it. The dialogue didn't flow at all, nor was there any character development. I could go on and on, but I'm sure the other hundred or so comments summed it up perfectly for me. I just think I'll block the movie from my mind completely and hold on to my own idea of what it should have been like."
"natlee-1","7","0","0","25 July 2007"," Hits and Misses in acting
","As far as plot goes, it matches exactly that in the book, though only the essential plot is portrayed. Most of the details which made the book so popular has been edited away, which is understandable. One of the reasons why I saw this movie was to see how they manage to cut the book down to a 2 hour movie. But, fraid not, the plot still manages to keep you in your seat throughout the movie.<br/><br/>That said, one of the best way to measure this movie is in terms of acting. For those who read the book, all the characters are very colourful and diverse. Unfortunately not so in the movie. Albus Dumbledore for one is entirely flat throughout the movie. Michael Gambon never did manage to portray him as magnificent as the lead character should be. Each time his scene comes on, I was praying that it wont last long.<br/><br/>The other 3 main characters, the young students, was really just so-so. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s acting has not much substance, though I must say it was better than the previous movies. Rupert Grint wasn't that much better too. And Emma Watson didn't have enough screen time to show off her potential.<br/><br/>There are however, excellent characters in this movie. Such as Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). Their acting matches the character and maybe even surpasses the book, at least in my opinion. Emma Thompson as Sybil deserves an applaud too. And yet another character that stands out is Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange. Though she comes in late in the movie, and has very little on screen time, her acting alone more than makes up for the loss of all the other main characters. Here's one character to look forward to in the next movie."
"tareke91","9","0","0","25 July 2007"," great movie, better book
","the movie was the shortest yet the book was the longest. that means there's something missing. Luna and Umbridge are great. Kreacher should have been more involved and the missing scenes from the book should have been included, although it is impossible to include all of them, then at least some of them. as a movie, i thought it was terrific and the whole thing was great, but because i read the book, it was very disappointing and did not live up to the standards of the book. the story was overflowing with potential yet the movie did not live up to it because it wasn't long enough. I'm hoping that down the road, someone else will be able to re-do these movies and make them more accurate with the events in the book, even if they are each more than four hours long. I'm curious to see what they do with the next two movies and i hope that they can make them longer."
"sjdean-1","9","0","0","25 July 2007"," By Far The Best
","I don't think I can even begin to describe what I feel about this movie.<br/><br/>So let me start by asking why the fans of the series can never be happy? It's either too faithful, cuts too much out, cuts out more than a smaller book, doesn't include some irrelevant plot point or another gargantuan helping of eye candy.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is a school of magic, so it stands to reason there should be quite a bit of magic.<br/><br/>However the story has to be there, there has to be a good plot.<br/><br/>Coming after the Goblet of Fire, the first time a relatively well known director has been at the helm, I was sceptical. This has been the first movie out of the franchise that has not only got a new director (David Yates) but a new screen writer by the name of Michael Goldenberg. I expected great things from Goldenberg, the writer of the 2003 film, Peter Pan, but Yates I was a little hesitant about.<br/><br/>Yet however the vision that these two gentlemen have bought to the screen has been magnificent. They've faithfully understood their source material and carefully crafted and re-worked a version for the silver screen that addresses the main plot points.<br/><br/>So I will say this once, yes, they have dispensed with a lot of the fluff around the edges. But brains in jars aren't important, neither is character development on characters you aren't going to see too much, characters who by all rights are cameos. It's called Harry Potter for a reason.<br/><br/>Unlike previous movies, this instalment is not disjointed and a pleasure to watch."
"Jon-392","6","0","0","25 July 2007"," Focuses more on conflicts than characters
","For me, this was a huge disappointment. The other reviewers talking about how the movie lost its sense of magic and wonder are absolutely right. Take the effect that Steven Spielberg creates in his movies and reverse it, and you'll have an idea of what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I think the problem is the lack of focus on the characters. Each of the previous movies spent a lot of time letting you get to know each of the new characters and learning to hate or appreciate them. Since the books are highly character driven, I think it was appropriate.<br/><br/>In this movie though, I think they focused more on the conflicts than the characters. As a result, the movie pushed forward at a good clip, but I didn't particularly care what happened.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Yates lacks a sense of story and what it means to draw the audience into the world you've created. He's created something that looks like a Lifetime movie, not a member of one of the greatest stories of all time. He betrays the magic of the world, the magic of the characters, and the wonderment of magic itself -- destroying everything I held dear about the franchise.<br/><br/>If he directs the next movie, I will almost certainly wait until it comes out on video. Otherwise, it's not worth it."

","OK I have a real problem with sequels which is when seen all together (say matrix trilogy) they are very good. But I, like most people watch them as they are released, and 99% of the time the second one is nothing more than setting the scene for the last one. So you get 90 minutes of build up, build up, and more build up, and then......wait six bloody months for the next one to be released. Now I know what you're thinking ""but that's the whole point of a trilogy"" and so it is but, (and this is where The order of the Phoenix shines) you can have a strong sub plot so at the end you can go ""wow I want to see the next one, AND this one didn't seem unfinished""<br/><br/>In short this movie had a great build up AND a great climax, (get your minds out of the gutter!)And now I am really looking forward to the next one."

","I'm a grown-up muggle who looks forward to All Things Harry way more than is probably appropriate, but OoTP disappointing to me. Maggie Smith is perfect, as is Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and the actor who portray Harry, Ron and especially my girl Hermoine are wonderful, too. The last two movies have just been such superficial renditions of the books. The CGI effects are very much improved over the first few movies, but at the cost, it seems, of the emotional truth and depth of the first movies. Harry and Sirius are on screen together for what... six minutes? Umbridge? We see hardly any of her true wickedness! It was bad enough how Cedric was a cardboard cut-out in TGoF, but now his murder is marginalized from everyone's emotional landscape. I just felt a little cheated at all the shortcuts.<br/><br/>All that said, these movies are like Cary Grant movies. Even when they aren't great, some Harry (or Cary!) is better than none."

","I was very pleasantly surprised by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The book is a tough slog and actually reads very much like a screenplay, so I was curious to see how it would be handled in film form. I have seen the film in both conventional and IMAX 3D versions and found Order of the Phoenix to be the best HP film since Prisoner of Azkaban. This is no paint-by-numbers adaptation like the first two films, nor is it a profound departure from the original text, like Goblet of Fire. Director David Yates and writer Michael Goldenberg, both of whom are new to the franchise, have simply pared the story to its basic elements and built up from there, to excellent effect. Aiding them in their quest to create a Harry Potter ""movie"" is the phenomenal performance of Imelda Staunton, who exudes the right amount of creepiness as the sickly-sweet-with bitter-aftertaste Dolores Umbridge. I may never want to see pink and kittens in any combination again.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also in fine form, with Michael Gambon continuing to make Dumbledore his own, and Daniel Radcliffe balancing teen angst with pathos in a performance miles removed from his earlier work in the franchise. The angst is more easily sympathised with here. I recommend this to anyone remotely curious, and also recommend the IMAX version, as it makes the conflicts in the film more palpable."
"eddyjedi","8","0","0","23 July 2007"," A fantastic movie
","Saw this recently and loved every minute, the pacing and attention to detail by David yates is awe inspiring, the best film by an absolute mile. Daniel Radcliffe on previous efforts didn't really perform but in this movie he is fantastic, the best of the bunch by a long shot and hit the beats so well, particularly when he confronts Dumbledore in his office.<br/><br/>What you have to remember is that films can never be compared to books, they are separate entities, and for all of you that are annoyed with edits in the story, I don't think you understand how difficult it is to stay faithful to the original material and to keep an audience entertained for over 2 hours. In that respect Yates has done an amazing job here, taking a book which in my and many others mind's was a bit of a snooze fest and has turned it into a rollicking ride for all ages, utilising harry's inner turmoil as a great tool. The culminating battle between Voldermort and Dumbledore is simply spine tingling and hands down beats any star wars fight of the prequels, bar of course The phantom menace, and thats one hell of an accolade coming from me, you've only got look at my screen name."

","As an educator and an avid reader, I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. When I was in college I had to read some middle level titles of my choosing for my middle level reading class and to my great fortune it was at the beginning of the Harry Potter series, not all the hype yet, just great books. I fell in love with these books not only because they are well written, but also because I saw my students fall in love with reading. I had a 7th grade student who was reading several grade levels below and hated reading. Once he was hooked on Harry Potter, it was impossible to get his nose out of any book. To me, that is the wonder of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Up until this last movie, I thought the screen writers had done a fantastic job of portraying the books. Now, I know every detail can be in the movie from the book (The Orders 870 pages is a lot of content), but there were some major points left out. What about Harry being kicked out of Quidditch and Ron being joined to the team? What about his horrible muggle aunt sticking up for him in the beginning? And the prophecy was not dropped by Malfoy in the book. Cho did not tell Umbridge about the D.A. either.<br/><br/>Luna and Umbridge I thought were well casted however.<br/><br/>So, even though I thought the special effects were great and the parts of the book that were accurate were good, I felt such a let down after watching the movie that I did not feel after watching the previous Potter movies. I am sure for those who never read the books found the movies outstanding, but for me it was a bit disappointing. I guess that is a compliment to J.K. for her superior writing and the ability to transport the reader to this special Hogwarts world.<br/><br/>I would still recommend the film, but for those who love the books, I would not get your hopes up."

","There are thousands of book-based films that were a let down for the readers, but I must say this was a real disappointment. The movie contained no quid ditch, which is no problem, but the entire movie is just about getting Harry's schoolmates and the Ministry of Magic to believe that Voldemort has returned. There was some mild action, but I won't be getting it on DVD. Definitely not worth the $10 and 138 minutes of my life. I've seen the majority of movies to hit theaters this summer and this is not one of the best. May I suggest Transformers, Ratatouille , or Live Free or Die Hard.<br/><br/>The Potter films kept getting better with each new release, but that pattern stops here.<br/><br/>But, if your a die hard HP fan, than go get the seventh book and sit down and read the book."

","I just recently saw this movie, and I really enjoyed it. My only problem with it was it could have been a little longer and included some more scenes from the book. But, I think director David Yates did a great job narrowing the book down into this remarkable film. The casting was perfect, Umbridge was just as I imagined her, Gary Oldman was perfect as Sirius and also, the screen time that Harry and Sirius had together was great. The fight sequences where very well choreographed and shot. I was very impressed with the duel between voldemort and dumbledore. And of course, Harry, Ron and Hermonie where great too. I was very happy with script and how well the story flowed, it wasn't choppy and everything in my opinion came together great. I hope Yates sticks around for the next film, he seems to be a very good director. I am really looking forward to the rest of the Harry Potter films to be released.

Wish I had watched the earlier ones also on an IMAX. The 1st 2 of the Potter movies had cuteness, humor well spread around the movie. But the last 3 have been getting darker and darker, which is acceptable since they are trying to follow the book. Though those funny one liners and expressions of Ron are completely missing. It was a big disappointment since taking out humor from Ron's character pretty much kills the character, it felt as if he was there just for the sake of being there. I had to wait for 2 hours for the 3D part and will have to wait for the 6th one for Ron's funny stuff. Hope it will be worth waiting."

","After reading so many negative reviews of this movie here, I didn't hold any expectation when I went to the cinema today. But still, I am disappointed. It really is a movie which make you always ask yourself ""what is going on?"" You just cannot follow the plot! It's so badly written For example, all of a sudden it mentions ""deatheaters"". Luckily I have read the book, or else, I would not know what that means. Throughout the movie, I always have to ask my friend who had just read the book again a few days ago questions. Its kind of embarrassing for me and disturbing for my friend.<br/><br/>The worst thing is that ""message"" it carries in the end, which is ""friends are who you will defend for"". Well, its not that abstract to understand but that last scene which Harry said those words KILLED me! That is just too low! I'd rather see more acting from Daniel about how sad he felt when he realized that Sirius was dead. That was the part which gave me the deepest impression in the book.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw is that it seems there is only 1 leading actor, Daniel Radcliffe. Others only appear in less than 5 scenes! There is simply too much Daniel! I mean, even though his acting is good, sorry that I cannot say he's great, its just impossible to make a movie a one-man show while still making it a good movie! <br/><br/>It is not deep at all, the message it carries is not right.

"Monotreme02","7","0","0","20 July 2007"," A bit rushed in the third act but still great entertainment
","The Harry Potter series has always excelled at compiling the most exquisite array of high-profile English actors any other film has since Robert Altman's Gosford Park. Indeed many of them appear for so little, the full effect of it all can be felt only when viewing the closing credits. Seeing all those names one after the other made me grin. Indeed the actors that get the biggest chance to shine are Gary Oldman, whose character finally comes in full-fledged force and reaches his dramatic and development peak in this installment. Other actors that get similar opportunities but to a lesser extent are Alan Rickman, who has been in the series since the beginning; and newcomer Imelda Staunton. This role is such a polar opposite to the pure good that was her Oscar-nominated turn in Vera Drake; it certainly shows what superb range the woman has. It must also be said that the three stars, in particular Daniel Radcliffe, have grown and evolved immensely as actors: both in Goblet of Fire and now in Order of the Phoenix the three actors show a wonderful emotional range and knack for drama; they have done what most actors aim to do and that is completely embody their characters. Other very talented cast members that appeared so briefly it was quite a pity were Brendan Gleeson, Emma Thompson, and newcomer Helena Bonham Carter  fans of Marla don't fret; she has a substantially larger role in the 6th installment (unless it is cut in the adaptation, which I certainly hope not). But the biggest misfire is definitely Ralph Fiennes. His appearance in Goblet of Fire was nothing short of a novelty; I was blown away by how he (and the director) managed to take a rather poorly crafted character on Rowling's part and make him into something far more frightening than the embodiment of all evil: They made him human. Fiennes absolutely glowed in Goblet of Fire, but his appearance in this installment was so brief he never quite got his chance to shine and equal his dominance in the fourth film. Hopefully much more will be waiting for him in the seventh book/movie, we'll have to wait until then to see.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the film's single, major flaw, the flaw that makes it ever so slightly lesser than the previous two installments. I felt that the ending was unnecessarily and confusingly rushed. I usually hate making book-to-film comparisons as I like to view both as strictly separate entities, but when the film is outbalanced as much as it was in this, I must make the connection. In the book, the sequence in the Department of Mysteries is substantially longer, and rightfully so. As the movie's dramatic peak, one would expect it not to feel so rushed and for the film to take its time, building the tension, so that when the final showdown does arrive, it's impact is far more felt. In the film, it seemed like Dumbledore was duking it out with Voldemort so suddenly, the only thing more sudden was how abruptly it was all over. Looking at the runtime of the film (2 hours and 20 minutes), I really don't see why the filmmakers couldn't have taken the liberty of drawing out the final sequence by about 20 more minutes, to increase the suspense and the drama, and to not have it feel so rushed and just plain under whelming.<br/><br/>But there are so many other fields in which to praise the film, one is almost willing to forgive its pacing problems in the third act. If anything can be said about these fantasy franchises it's that they are a designer's dream, and indeed, both the costume and especially the production design in this film have reached a new peak: the production and set design in particular are outstanding and definitely the best in the series, with such absolutely brilliant and gorgeous sets such as the Department of Mysteries or the Ministry of Magic atrium. Like in Goblet of Fire, he special effects and CGI imagery blend seamlessly into the action and drama in the foreground, and creations that would have been considered novelties when the first films came out (such as the cave troll in the first film or Dobby the house elf in the second) are interweaved and integrated wonderfully without ever serving as a distraction and always remaining convincing. Another creator who deserves much praise is composer Nicholas Hooper. While it was sad to see John Williams leave the franchise, it is refreshing to see a composer bring something new to the table: aside from the theme that appears in the beginning and end of the film, the score is an entirely new entity and sound quite unlike anything that has been heard before in the series  this is in total contrast to Patrick Doyle who, in Goblet of Fire, seemingly attempted (and quite feebly so) to imitate John Williams' original score.<br/><br/>This is in all a solid film and an excellent entertainment. The Harry Potter series has already elevated itself above the level of simple novelty and entered the territory of full-fledged and strongly rooted mythology, that lets the characters and the actors roam free in its realm. Yates does a solid job directing and everything  from the acting to the score to the production design to the visual effects and CGI  all fits together quite nicely, although the film does acquire somewhat of a hasty limp in its third act, nothing that can't be ironed over in Yates' second jab at the series directing The Half-Blood Prince, slated for release November of next year. Still good, but not quite as good as Prisoner of Azkaban or Goblet of Fire."

","Overall, disappointing. I understand the need to leave things out for the movie version. But, the drastic changes from the book and the HUGE amount left out was hard to swallow. Cho did NOT tattle on the DA. The DA was NOT Dumbledore's Army until near the end when they were found out. Umbridge did not break down the door to the room of requirement, Dobby ran in and told everyone she was coming and they all scattered. Umbridge never interrogated ALL the students with truth serum, only Harry. Hagrid's brother was not tame at all. And what the heck happened to Quiddich?

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had a difficult job from the beginning; Harry is an emotional and unhappy boy throughout. He is now 15 years old and the hormones are kicking in. Oh, and it doesn't help that Lord Voldemort has returned and is trying to control his mind, all while a teacher from Hell has taken over Defense Against the Dark Arts... along with a few other things. By the end of this year, Harry and his friends have to take matters into their own hands. Fortunately, the Order of the Phoenix, a society bent on destroying Voldemort, is right behind them.<br/><br/>Director David Yates does a wonderful job with what was probably the most complex book. His vision is very obviously different from the previous three directors, but it just might be the best. As a die-hard fan of the books, I expect a lot out of the movies- Luckily they just keep getting better. This one is the best so far.<br/><br/>One has to give some credit for that to Imelda Staunton playing that teacher from Hell I spoke of: Professor Umbridge. She is absolutely perfect, and her performance is Oscar-worthy. Doubtful she'll have a chance, but I'm definitely rooting for Best Supporting Actress. Her interpretation of this character is so spot on, so evil through fake niceness, she inspires fantastic performances from the returning actors around her. They are all back at the top of their game with this one, in particular Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman as Professors McGonagall and Snape, respectively. The scene between Professor McGonagall and Professor Umbridge is one of the most intense in the movie. The other cast member who shines the brightest is Gary Oldman as Harry's godfather, Sirius Black. He just might have you in tears by the end.<br/><br/>And there are some pretty intense scenes here. The last 30 minutes of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. It's fantastic film-making. The action sequences are done wonderfully, and the dramatic scenes are wonderful, too. The only downfall is that the film starts out pretty slow and can seem long at times. All in all, though, Mr. Yates has done a fine job with the story, and I hope he's back for the next round. I know I'll be there Opening Night. 7/10 stars!<br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","(This is a review of the IMAX version, which has some 3D parts.)<br/><br/>The basic story arc of this latest installment in the Harry Potter franchise is the attempt by The Ministry of Magic to change the curriculum at Hogwarts' in order to prevent some sort of conspiracy against them. This involves the movie's Big Bad, Mrs Umbridge teaching a 'theoretical' course at Hogwarts, involving no learning of practical magic. Umbridge comes across as a cross between the Queen of England or ex P.M. Margaret Thatcher, crossed with Attila the Hun, and fuelled by a crystal meth suppositary somewhere it would be impolite of me to mention.<br/><br/>Our hero, Harry Potter, feeling this beaureaucratic meddling at Hogwarts to be a threat to the students' safety, takes matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, playing Potter, seems to be growing too fast for this role. Perhaps future installments, requiring a more believable incarnation as the hero, could employ Ronnie Corbett as Potter.<br/><br/>The lovely Emma Watson, has less opportunity to be lovely in this movie than previously. She seems to be greying to fast for my liking. If Watson gets too greedy with pay demands, perhaps Germaine Greer could play Hermione in future Potter movies. Watson does steal a scene in the movie though...where she defends Potter's kissing standards to Ron Weasley.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham-Carter appears in this movie and hasn't looked so alluring since her star turn in the great ""A room with a view"".<br/><br/>And one girl, who apparently won a contest to appear in this movie, makes a good show as a dreamy girl who, like Harry, can see things others can't.<br/><br/>Now for why the IMAX version is the one to see, if you can. The height of the screen makes the viewing experience more immersive than even the new supersized suburban cinema screens. And the sound isn't as deafening as in those same suburban cinemas. Yet you get marvellous, floor shaking sound at IMAX (literally).<br/><br/>The 3d is astounding. Flying creatures seem to reach into your lap at times! However, apart from that scene, the 3D isn't as utilised as well as it could be...e.g.the setting concerning the location of a magical orb isn't as impressive as it could have been-if there had been more scenes as impressive as the one in which Harry's ride seems to jut out meters in front of the screen and very near you, it would have been more impressive. The IMAX 3D system is vastly superior though, to the awful red and blue glasses version, which just gives bad 3D and looks hyper-ugly on screen...the IMAX glasses look like sunglasses-they don't even seem to be blue, like I think I remember them being the last time I saw an IMAX 3D film, many years ago.<br/><br/>NOT having read any of the Potter books, I just wonder if the movie is true to the book-as old favourites like Hermione, Ron and Malfoyle seem to have very little to do in this movie."

"Listen_to_the_Law","8","0","0","19 July 2007"," Not accurate to the book, but a great movie
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Daniel Radcliffe, Imelda Staunton) Directed by David Yates Grade: B<br/><br/>How do you turn a 890 page novel into a 138 minute movie? Well, you can't. Try as they may, newbie director David Yates and his screenwriter omit a lot of important events and details from the book. I will not mention them, but, if you read the book, expect to be a little turned-off by some of their decisions. Some (myself included) think that Yates didn't truly understand the book, which would explain why some of the characters' actions in the movie seem odd. However, there is no doubting Yates' gift as an amazing director. The book is darker, and you better believe that Yates notices that. Everything from the dimly lit hallways of Hogwarts to Professor Snape (played brilliantly by Alan Rickman) seems enhanced, which can probably be attributed to Yates' vision.<br/><br/>But then again, some blame on the big screen adaptation can be placed on screenwriter Michael Goldenberg (eyeball his page on IMDb.com to learn about what he has done). He took over for Steve Kloves, the screenwriter for Harry Potter movies 1-4. Basically, he doesn't seem to understand the Potter books; leaving out so many important details can really hamper the film, especially for fools who don't read the books but watch the movies. But enough nagging: overall, the film is truly something. The more the movie progresses, the better it gets.<br/><br/>If you can go to the movie to enjoy it as a movie (not a book), you will enjoy it. There is a reason to the negative buzz from the midnight showing- you must be awake and attentive to enjoy this installment. There's a lot to take in, most notably the ongoing feud between Harry Potter and the Dark Lord, Voldemort. Even though the movie leaves out parts of the book, it still follows itmostly. The movie follows Harry as he struggles once again to deal with the pressure and torment he receives from fellow students and Voldemort himself- this time through visions that Voldemort sends to Harry during his sleep. Remember at the end of book four, when Voldemort comes back to life? Well, only a select few people (obviously including Harry Potter) actually believe this. The Ministry of Magic (acting a lot like the current government of the United States) try their hardest to cover all this up, even going to the extent to try to expel Harry from Hogwarts. But none of these evil, cowardly acts can prepare you for Dolorous Umbridge, an evil, manipulative woman sent to Hogwarts by the Ministry to become the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. As the movie goes along, her power increases due to her being a ""high inquisitor"" and the like. Umbridge is played by Imelda Staunton, a very smart actress who relishes in the role of Umbridge. It's not just the fact that Umbridge is evil, it's also that little smile and look of innocence she gives people while dealing out punishment and harsh words. Quite simply, she's a movie critic! Kidding. Harry's godfather Serious Black is back again, which is, of course, good news. As I mentioned, Snape, too, is back, but none of these characters (except for Umbridge, Harry Potter, and the great Albus Dumbledore) get enough screen time.<br/><br/>Like I stated, the movie gets better as it goes along. The ending scenes involving the Dark Lord are truly something special. Try not to yawn or bitch about the middle of the movie being boring, because it sets up the ending well. Sure, I miss quiditch games and sunlight as much as the next guy (the movie has like zero of each), but for making the movie with such a dark tone, Yates has succeeded. Now it's time to get a better screenwriterwell, at least one who reads the book.<br/><br/>Good) fun special effects, great ending, strong performances from all characters over 20 years<br/><br/>Bad) doesn't have that Rowling magic, most characters under 20 years can't act worth a crap, too short<br/><br/>Oscar) the grapevine says that Imelda Staunton may get nominated for best supporting actress"

I can even forgive Chris Colubus' temptation to put little ""Who"" people in his movie, until JKR insisted that he read the book before directing the movie.<br/><br/>But, this movie was so close to the book that one could almost read the book while watching the movie and compare how close they are.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I tend to agree that people who have never read the books or seen the previous movies won't completely understand or enjoy this movie to it's fullest. But, I didn't enjoy the original ""Dune"" until I read the book and understood what was in that movie. So, all you Potterheads, relax and enjoy this movie and prepare for what's to come.

","I am a longtime Harry Potter fan. I have read all the books and have seen all the movies. I was very disappointed with this one. I felt the movie's producer did not follow the book's format very well. While I understand that movies cannot tell the exact story from the book due to time constraints, I feel the movie could have been made a lot better. They left out some very crucial items that would have lended relevance to the plot. Maybe they're saving these aspects for the next movie, but I seriously doubt it. If I were JK Rowlings, I would be upset. I hope that a different producer and director are chosen for the next installment and that JKR has more say in how the story is adapted to the screen. I still hope for the best and will remain a Harry Potter fan despite this most recent film's poor quality."

","Went to the movies yesterday and because nothing else on the bill looked palatable I took a chance and saw the new HP film. As an outsider to the series of Harry Potter books, haven't read them, I was only vaguely familiar with the characters and nature of the series. So I watched the movie with bated anticipation as one would for a new release not based on a book. Impression: where's the plot? Where's are the lives in peril if the antagonist isn't thwarted? Who's crisis was it? Obviously, by HP constipated expressions he was on the throes of disaster. But what about the others? His two partners - as charming as they were - followed HP around like lapdogs as he aimlessly ( to me at least) dealt with a confusion of forces. The scenery and costumes and make-up and music etc were superb!! The actors were no doubt skilled in their trade but seemed wooden and detached from the whole project. I mean, I felt no bonding between any characters. So many scenes seemed lifted from other famous movies; the red phone booth from Dr Who, Sirius' little Gollum-like guy, etc. I won't say it wasn't creative but the devices were not gripping and most I had seen used before, like old ideas tossed in a hat and pulled out at random. Don't want to blast this movie, nor do I want to believe that the books are just a cliché but all I know is that for over two hours I was wondering if I should've gone to see another movie at the multiplex."

","I've never read any of the books (but my sister has, so she fills me in on what was missing from the movies) so I always see the Harry Potter movies without expectations of what I want to see in it. I thought the movie was excellent; perhaps the best so far! But the 3-D effects were disappointing. They were very good, and were quite effective in showing vast spaces, but they could have been a lot better. If you've never seen a really well-done 3-D movie (like the ones at Universal Studios in Florida) you should thoroughly enjoy the 3-D in Harry Potter. But having seen what is possible in a 3-D movie, where things can seem to actually pop right out of the screen and into the audience so it looks like you could reach out and touch it (or get hit by it) it's easy to see how much better the 3-D in Harry Potter should have been."

","Longest book, shortest movie. Longest book, shortest movie. Longest book, shortest movie.<br/><br/>I kept going over that in my head before I went to see it. I did expect it to be a huge flop.<br/><br/>The first two Harry Potter films were done very well I think, cutting just little bits off here and there...but 3, 4, and 5 seemed like they have been hacked off of with an ax.<br/><br/>The main reason J.k. Rowling is considered such a great writer, is her patience in story telling. She shows Harry's everyday life, not just an overview. Since Chris Columbus stopped directing in the series, the movies have become even further and further away from the original vision.<br/><br/>I know that there was no control what-so-ever over Richard Harris's death, but there WAS control over the casting choice for the new Dumbledore. This has been done poorly. Richard Harris portrayed Dumbeldore in the best way possible - calm, rational, and ingenious. I cannot see any of this in Micheal Gambon. While he is a good actor, I do not think he could be farther away from fitting the role.<br/><br/>For some reason, the biggest thing I did not like about the 4th movie was the music/soundtrack. I thought John Williams had done a wonderful job on the first 3, but they apparently had gotten a new composer. The composer for the 5th movie did a surprisingly good job. I really liked the soundtrack for this film.<br/><br/>As I said before - its as if they took the movie and began hacking off pieces. It really does not feel as if they made an effort to live up to the book at all. ""Longest book, shortest movie."" They could have made it so much longer, providing the somewhat full ""Harry Potter Experience.""<br/><br/>Though I have to hand it to them - the scenes that they DID keep in, were well done and very accurate - as if they copied dialog directly from the book.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good movie...but I recommend NOT reading the book if you haven't already, as it would completely ruin the movie. <br/><br/>Hopefully this has been helpful to you -darf :)"
"longhouse-2","4","0","0","18 July 2007"," A disjointed hard to follow movie
","I'm a post-70 senior and I have been to all the Harry Potter films, usually taking younger family members and their friends. I found this movie (and the previous one)too fast, too disjointed and hard to follow. The chopping of the scenes was disconcerting, A smooth transition from scene to scene would have been welcome. I got the feeling the movie was cut to pieces to get it into a not-too-long-time frame. Hopefully these comments might improve the next one coming out.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the acting was good and the special affects commendable. I didn't read the book so could not compare what was left out or not. But like the rushed movie ""Da Vinci's Code"", perhaps reading the book ""Order of the Phoenix"" might make me better understand the movie. I would prefer however to watch a good well assembled easy-paced movie that stands on its own."
"Sparrowmaniac","7","0","0","18 July 2007"," Impressive, but disappointing...
","Harry Potter & The Order Of The Phoenix was and is, the longest book of the series. It appealed to me as the most interesting book of the heptalogy. The character development in this book is superb. Many potter movie buffs will find this disappointing, and to some extent I'll agree with them.<br/><br/>OOTP is all flashy on the outside, true Radcliffe shows more acting sense/skills than any other stuff he has done. Whereas in the previous movies all the time I felt Rupert Grint was overshadowing Radcliffe's role, it's the other way round this time.<br/><br/>The good stuff of this movie is the visual effects, which are pretty neat. Radcliffe's acting prowess shows a great maturity. The Phelps twins as always are great. Imelda Staunton is superb as Dolores Umbridge, there cannot have been a better choice for Umbridge, she brings the character to life like no other can possibly have done.<br/><br/>The bad stuff is well, the direction, the screenplay, the background score. You always identify a Harry Potter movie with the score. For the first time the central theme of the Harry Potter movies(Hedwig's theme) is missing. That makes a load of difference for the movie watching experience. The screenplay like always is bad. There's bound to be complains about the screenplay if you are a fan of the book. Steve Kloves had raped the books and so has Michael Goldenberg. The direction I felt was poor.<br/><br/>The acting has been of the highest order. Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Helena Bonham-Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore, Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, The Phelps twins as the Weasley twins. The scene where Sirius Black dies, has got to be the highlight of the 5 movies so far. It has got to be the highlight of Radcliffe's career. It was the one scene which was amazingly done.<br/><br/>The special effects were mostly ordinary for the whole movie, but it reached great heights on 2 particular occasions. One during the escapade of the Weasley twins and the other during the final duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","0","0","18 July 2007"," exhilarating, if somewhat flawed, fifth entry into the film adaptation series
","Bringing an eight-hundred-plus-page novel that is full of detail and subplots into a compatible storyline for a film adaptation can be a difficult procedure. Especially when you want the film to still be a successful and compelling feature. No matter how poorly it was done, the film would make big bucks because it's based off such a popular novel. But ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is not a badly-made movie. Yes, it's flawed and to a considerable degree. It's not perfect, but it's a mighty entertaining motion picture. In terms of visual excitement and heart-pounding entertainment, it's perhaps the best out of all five of the series. I can't say if it really is though, for it does have some flaws that I personally cannot overlook.<br/><br/>Really, the main problem with the film overall is not the pacing. Like the previous film, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", the very beginning of the movie is rushed-through, quick-paced, and in some ways, not very clearly made out for the audience members who have not read the book. But in this case, the beginning is so rushed and so poorly made that it's painful to look at. I'm sorry, but in my opinion, this movie has one of the worst beginnings of all time. Especially in the first five minutes. And for the next thirty or forty minutes, the movie isn't very clear. We meet out main characters of the story much too quickly, some of whom we haven't seen since the third installment ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", and we don't get very much development from them. They are almost unnecessary, yet they get some more-than-necessary screen time and lines in the beginning.<br/><br/>However, once the beginning has passed by and the painful-to-look-at parts of the film have dissipated and gone by, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is magnificently made for the screen. Full of come good humor, exciting moments, state-of-the-art visual effects in heart-pounding thrilling sequences, and finally some good character development from our talented cast, the movie keeps you glued to your seat from that point to the ending credits. There are even some really dramatic moments in the film, such as Harry's speech in the Hog's Head. It almost seems like a real case of life and death. And there is, of course, the much-anticipated kiss. It didn't really turn out how I was expecting it to be, but it was still good enough for this magical teenager love subplot of the film. It didn't really kick off much in any way afterwards and might leave a few people confused at the end. The bonding we do get is between Harry and his friends, his long-gone parents, his teachers, and everyone else who will stand with him during these terrible times for them in their world of wizards and magic.<br/><br/>Performances by everybody were simply glamorous and well-done. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are still very talented for their parts and they really seem like the characters from the books in a lot of ways. And this, in my opinion, isn't just owed to the screenplay, but to the actors themselves, who are adjusting and understanding the characters very well and becoming a lot like them. Imelda Staunton, who played Professor Umbridge, was keen at the role of being an irritating and dislikable character who acts and behaves sweetly in a creepy manner, just like the one J.K. Rowling visualized in the book. Umbridge wasn't as physically ugly as I was expecting, but the personality was really what mattered. Maggie Smith, though her screen time was limited, pulled off a good performance again as McGonnagall. And now, Michael Gambon really does Richard Harris's memory proud as he plays Professor Dumbledore. I admit he wasn't exactly keen for the role in the previous two entries where he took over. But now, he does it perfectly as the kindly, mysterious and now frightened headmaster.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is just simply, well-drawn out and exciting fun. After its terrible start at the beginning of the film, it rises from the bad part of the scale and excels up with its creativity and visual spectaculars until it becomes what could be, for some people, the best out of all of the film adaptations brought to the screen so far."
"falling_pieces","6","0","0","18 July 2007"," Mixed Feelings
","The fifth Harry Potter book was extremely long and had many things best explained in words than by film. Therefore, it is understandable that it was so cut up and that there were many things changed in the movie adaptation. Personally, I find that a lot of my favorite scenes and aspects of the book were cut from the film that almost ruined it for me. I was eager to see more of Bellatrix Lestrange because she's just such an evil witch, but she really only appeared for five minutes and had very little lines. I also would have liked to see the conversation Harry has with Nearly Headless Nick about ghosts after Sirius dies because I found that Harry's sudden spark of hope was a very emotional part, especially when that spark was extinguished. It also wouldn't have hurt to have some of the Quidditch parts included, but I do admit that they weren't even slightly important to the story. I would have also been nice to see the meeting with the giants (it might have been just a little violent though...) And something very important that was never mentioned (if my memory is correct) in the movie was the reason why Harry has to always stay at Privet Drive every summer with his Aunt Petunia.<br/><br/>There are many more scenes I could mention, but there's a word limit, so I shall move on...<br/><br/>Voldemort was a problem for me. Ralph Fiennes is a wonderful actor for Voldemort but there was just something about him that I just couldn't help laugh about. It's hard to explain, but he just wasn't as scary as I expected him to be...<br/><br/>Now if one puts aside the half-assed story and the mild ridiculousness of Voldemort, the movie is actually very good in terms of acting. Umbridge was played very well and she was very hateful, just as I'd imagine her to be. Luna Lovegood was also picked out very well and she really had that dreamy quality as described in the book. Daniel Radcliffe has also improved a lot in acting and he was really believable throughout the movie. So where the storyline lacked, the casting and acting made up for. The movie wasn't a complete failure, but I did like the others better. Perhaps, if I hadn't seen the others, I might have felt differently..."
"ul90","4","0","0","18 July 2007"," A average film, but a poor adaption...
","Lets start with what is good, the majority of the acting is very good. There are sterling performances from the new cast members, Luna Lovegood and particularly Delores Umbridge were well portrayed. Dumbledore, Sirius, McGonagle, Lupin, Arthur and Molley Weasley are all very good, along with main trio putting in good performances. I would agree with the amount of praise levied on Daniel Radcliffe whose performance, while good, isn't quite the Oscar winning spectacle some have made it out to be. Bonham Carter's performance as Bellatrix Lestrange was a highlight for me, some of her lines could have sounded appalling, but her delivery was perfect. However besides the acting a lot was left to be desired.<br/><br/>The main problem is that so much of the character of the book is lost in translation, the screenplay and direction are very poor. Many of the subtleties that make the books so entertaining are needlessly skipped over, the film is not particularly long at the moment, in fact far from it. There is no need for the film-makers to have removed so much of the story from the film script. The pacing of the film was inconsistent and the scene changes were often dire.<br/><br/>I would be unsurprised to discover that those who had not read the book before watching the movie would be somewhat confused over a number of the issues raised in this chapter of the story. There were many scenes that were poorly done in this movie, including some of the most important scenes in the film. *Spoiler* When Bellatrix kills Sirius, there was no tension, there was no build up and the whole scene was rushed and changed from the book, resulting in the whole feel of the scene being lost. The battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort was somewhat pathetic, the CGI effects weren't particularly spectacular (besides a couple) and the whole scene was rather tacky, I'm quite sure the director allowed his children to cover that one. Then there was Bellatrix Le Strange's disappearing act in that scene... for someone do devout she spent years of torture in Azkaban, she sure made her escape quickly. The book explanation was far better, and would have translated well into film.<br/><br/>I am thoroughly disappointed by the films so far, they aren't so much bad films as they are mediocre. They just have never done the books justice, they oft seem childish and underdeveloped. Warner Brothers are obviously keen on rushing the projects through with disregard to the quality of the films. It seems we will have to wait for someone who truly loves the books to translate them into movies which do them justice.<br/><br/>A pure shame. - SEM"

","This harry potter film contains action and suspense for viewers. This movie that has cut many scenes and condensed into a two hour and eighteen minute movie is well worth your while. This could have done a little better with adding some more details and action to make it even better than before. David Yates compared to the other directors is probably the second best directing the harry potter movies while Chris Columbus is number one in my opinion. Either way, this movie will excite you or give you the pleasure of not seeing it again. Anyways, see it for yourself and judge the movie in your own opinion if it was worth your money or just a waste."

","I've seen it twice, now, and love it. It's not my favorite, but might be my second-favorite. I'm not sure if it's because I liked this book better than GOF, or the direction, but I enjoyed it more. This one actually felt like the first three, unlike Goblet. Even with the darkness of the film, I loved so much more about it than Goblet. It might be that I just didn't like that story, and this one calls to me much more.<br/><br/>Good - <br/><br/>I cried the first moment they showed Sirius. And Sirius calling Harry James during the battle? That moment was possibly my favorite moment of the film. And I really enjoyed it, so that's saying a lot. It was just so perfect. Especially the look on Harry's face. <br/><br/>Umbridge was perfect, if completely evil. She pulled it off perfectly. It was so easy to hate her. Minerva facing off against her--she might have had to back down, but I loved both their scenes together.<br/><br/>DA scenes were incredible. Particularly the Patronus scene. And Neville growing up and strong! I missed not meeting his parents, but I think the replacement worked well.<br/><br/>The endgame at Hogwarts was lovely. Particularly Snape's reaction to Harry's outburst, though I would have liked some more evidence that he went to tell the Order Umbridge being taken by the Centaurs...hoisted on her own petardby both Harry and the Centaurs. Anyone says that she didn't deserve it doesn't get just how horrific she was. I do have one complaint, though. Was it really unimportant that Umbridge sent the Dementors after Harry? I would have liked to have heard her mutter it, at least.<br/><br/>Bella was good, though even after two showings, I still can't quite get a grasp of her. I did like the moment of Lucius/Bella there, when he was telling Harry how kids could never stand up to Death Eaters, though. And the beatific grin on her face when Voldemort started whispering to Harry was perfect.<br/><br/>The fights at the Ministry were well-done. And if it hadn't been Gambon, I would have loved the fight between DD and Voldy. Did anyone else actually believe his blather to Harry afterwards about loving him? His lines came off so stiff<br/><br/>Not so good - <br/><br/>My biggest complaint with this movie has to do with Draco -- not only did he not get enough screen time, but they also didn't show the Death Eaters' arrest, and he didn't threaten Harry at the end. It's vital for his character development in the next movie. After Harry and Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville, Draco's the next-most important kid in the series. By this point, we need to see more than this cardboard cut-out. I don't know its a script problem, or a directing problem, or an acting problem (no, I don't particularly like Tom.), but if this is the Draco we get in the next film, I probably won't see the last. <br/><br/>Sure, it's more dramatic to have the Dementor attack in a tunnelbut honestlydid they think we wouldn't remember that that playground was a lot closer to Privet Drive in POA? Not to mention that it was surrounded by HOUSES And while I'm on that scene, did the actor who plays Dud really think that worked? He looked like the Dementors had been successful in their attack.<br/><br/>Quidditch  surely Rupert's got to feel a bit left-out by now? That was Ron's biggest development in the whole series! And the fight! And Harry and the twins being banned from playing ever again! And Umbridge taking their brooms! And a whole major Draco sequence taken out there <br/><br/>With Trelawney, where was the explanation that it was her who gave the prophesy? We missed several details because of it was done. Like Neville being the almost-boy-who-lived, or that it was overheard by someone.<br/><br/>The point of the Occlumency lessons wasn't to learn how to break into Snape's mind. Harry was supposed to be keeping Snape from breaking into his own. Which he failed to do. But still, that's hardly a reason to stop. We needed the Pensieve so that we could see that even hero Harry can sometimes be in the wrong. <br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I can't be okay with how Cho's role changed. Made her far too sympathetic. Where was the crying? It's going to make no sense for Harry and co to still be avoiding her in the next movie.<br/><br/>Twinsseemed a bit wooden in this one. Yes, we got WWW, and the scene with them leaving Filch the doctored candy was lovely, butI wasn't feeling them this time. I will say I loved the scene where they left, though. The firework dragon managed to hold up against the memory of the one in LOTR. And the Decrees all falling off the wall? Perfect! I also thought Harry collapsing in the middle of the twins escape worked quite well for moving things forward.<br/><br/>Bella did not use AK on Sirius in the book. She actually used red spell. The only red spell JK has mentioned was the stunning spell. She's made a point of mentioning it, in fact. But the death itself?Remus holding Harry back was just a heartstring puller. Yes, I cried. Even if they did do the death wrong.<br/><br/>Good movie. I do recommend it. More than GOF."

","Well, with all due respect to David Yates, I would like to say that The Order of the Phoenix came,tried,and failed.Now don't get me wrong, I am still a faithful follower of Mr.Potter but I expected a lot more from OOTP.<br/><br/>Firstly, I want to make it a point that the start of the movie was 'great'.The opening with Dudley's ever-growing belly and scary yet funny head, together with two Dementors who look like they've gone unfed since they first visited Hogwarts in The Prisoner of Azkaban, and a very fake scene where Harry sticks out his wand in front of a 'bunch' of Muggles, and then a chase down a sewer.There is nothing in the sequence that leaves a lasting impression.Nothing! The opening sequence in Little Whinging is where Daniel, hanging in midair, his throat clutched by a Dementor, shows us that I'm Daniel Radcliffe and not Harry Potter. I am an actor, not a fictional character.Who would have thought one could deliver all that from just saying,""D-Dudley r-r-run""? But then again, that piece of cinema is ruined by the entrance of Mrs.Figg .There was no feeling in what she said!The Dursleys are brilliant in their little shot.<br/><br/>And then,the real bore.The movie jumps from scene after scene without us being allowed any time to think what happened. Reason why I think The Prisoner of Azkaban was the best movie in the Series(so far) is that Director Alfonso Cuaron made sure the actors were actually acting and that the audience got enough time to breathe after a sequence. He paid homage to the Dementors, the Whomping Willow, even something as small as a bat or a leaf, in between scenes.And the music was sublime.Here, however, the editing is so terrible that just after Harry is hit by a freak scene through Nagini's eyes he is thrown into a chair in Snape's Office and down to learning Occlumency.He hasn't even been allowed to stop sweating from what he saw!<br/><br/>The training of Dumbledore's Army is shown better than expected and I still don't know what the big deal was with the kissing scene.It was poor rather than cute(and they did it in 16 takes!)The visual effects are great but they are a bit too abundant. Even when two characters are conversing there's something going on in the background which acts as a distraction from the real scene.<br/><br/>The only part of the 'movie' which deserves real praise is the climax. From the time the final battle in the movie the audience is treated to some solid acting and not to mention special effects.The Death Eaters look great but they could have looked better.The Department of Mysteries is good, but overdone.Too many orbs.Too many shelves.But, a great fight sequence. The part which everyone wanted to be long and drawn out, wasn't. And then it all came down to Lord Voldemort.Now, whether you like Ralph Fiennes or not, he demands attention when he's carrying out the role of He Who Must Not Be Named.He is brilliant.The little time that he gets on screen is worth savoring.The way the connection between Harry and Voldemort's mind is shown at the end is perfect.<br/><br/>Discrepancies aside; hats off to Imelda Staunton who plays Dolores Umbridge oh so well with her little squeaky laugh and her voice and her Office and her eyes and her hair(I could go on forever).Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange deserved a LOT more screen time than what was given to them, but they pulled off their 'small' cameos flawlessly.Grawp is cute but fails to leave a mark. Daniel Radcliffe proves his worth as an actor.He even shouts out,""Look at me!"" with demanding conviction.The sequence where the Weasley Brothers, Fred and George storm out of Hogwarts with a grand show of firecrackers in between an examination is one of the funniest ones in the movie and definitely deserves a kudos.But the absence of acting sequences just ruins the movie.More importance is given to Parvati and Padma Patil than to Ron and Hermione.<br/><br/>Their are no praiseworthy sequences here like that in The Shrieking Shack in The Prisoner of Azkaban or the conversation where Mad Eye Moody confesses his true identity in The Goblet of Fire.Even the Pensieve was given importance in the fourth installment.Here, everything is mute.<br/><br/>OOTP is more like an attempt at a movie than a real movie. It isn't even an adaptation. The acting is mostly dull. The editing is terrible. The length of the movie is ridiculous if not outrageous and in the end all we get is 2hrs of hardly anything and 15 minutes of cinema. I mean,The Prisoner of Azkaban is a 300something paged novel and that got a 2hrs 20mins adaptation, Goblet of Fire was 600something pages and that got 2hrs 40mins of game time whereas Order of the Phoenix is 700something pages and it gets 2hrs 15mins of runtime? Are you freaking kidding me? Look at The Lord of the Rings. The first two movies are verging on 3hrs whereas the third one stretches to 3hrs 30mins plus. The movies remain true to the storyline. The only reason why The Harry Potter movies aren't getting enough recognition as the LOTR movies is because it's more commercial entertainment than 'movie making'. The only movie which had 'movie making' in it was the 3rd one. And most fans call it the 'worst' film. Why? Because there wasn't enough special effects and there was too much of talking!<br/><br/>As for the next installment(due to release in November 2008), It surely promises better things."

","For a movie they could have done really well they didn't quite pull it off. i enjoyed it, but not as much as i have the other ones. as my dad said last night after we came back from watching it, it was different. okay things i did like. the Sirius and Harry scenes I loved those they were well done especially the one at the train station when he hands him the picture. any scene with Luna Lovegood, Evanna Lynch was simply perfect. them training in the Room of Requirement, though they should have just left the patronus thing the way it was. For me Neville Longbottom shone in this movie which I hoped he would. Bella, again Helena Bonham Carter was absolutely lovely even though all she did was cackle. I mean come on for such a superb character thats all they could do with her gee think they could have gotten an unknown actress to do that. I loved Gary Oldman one the best things about this movie and I will sorely miss him.<br/><br/>Things i didn't like. There wasn't enough Tonks sorry there just wasn't and I was really upset about that. In the book one of my favourite scenes is when she and Harry are in his room packing. The other thing Sirius' death hello people that was so badly done a six year old could have done it better. what happened to the fight between him and Bella. They wasted it on, a fight between him and Lucius Malfoy. None of the connections were explained, you didn't know that Tonks was the daughter of Sirius' favourite cousin though unless you know the connection between the name Andromeda and Bellatrix you would have been fine.<br/><br/>Onto the next thing. I must be the only person on the planet that wanted to drill nails into my head every time Imelda Staunton was on screen. I didn't think she was good at all, of course maybe on the other hand I went into this movie thinking I'd hate her and I did. And another thing what was up with making Grawp look like the Big Friendly Giant. From what I remember wasn't he supposed to look at least a little scary. Considering this is my least favourite book, apart from the intros of some of my favourite characters. I don't hate the movie I just don't think its as good as it could have been. I'll go see the others but i won't be buying this movie. maybe i'll have a different opinion when i see it again on Friday for 50 bucks."

","Personally being a huge fan of harry potter, and never has there been a book yet that i haven't read more than once, i found this film to be rather rushed and quite honestly too much.<br/><br/>Although not remotely dull at any point, the film payed very little attention to detail and rushed through what i imagine being every 4th chapter of the book. They cut far too much out of the book to make the film and in the end skipped from scene to scene far to fast.<br/><br/>If they had made the film just a little bit longer and had perhaps put in just a little more detail in the ministry it could've been much better instead of a 30 second wander around before all hell breaking loose.<br/><br/>if, unlike me, you have seen the film and not read the books therefore had not quite the same expectations this film would have been great.<br/><br/>it is truly an amazing film, but not enough adapted to the epic book itself."
"Undertones27","9","0","0","18 July 2007"," Stop whining about specific details
","I'm so sick of reading reviews from stupid 15 year old girls pi**ed off their favorite part of the book was cut in the movie. Its a MOVIE not a biopic of the story. To satisfy some of these fans it would take a three part series carefully and dutifully chronicling Harry's every move and line from the book. Better yet how about a 8 hour movie of J.K. Rowling simply reading the book using crazy lighting effects and gesticulating wildly during the more dramatic scenes? 1st off, grow up, these movies aren't made to satiate your simple little desires but rather to capture the ARCHETYPES of the stories and characters. In OTTP, my least favorite novel but now most favorite movie, this was done PERFECTLY. You can see the straining relationships between Harry and his friends and his sense of abandonment from Dumbeldore and Sirius. We witness his struggle with being completely alone and eventually his determination to accept those who will never abandon him. This entire progression has taken the Harry Potter franchise so close to the realms of great cinema that i wonder if those only thinking Harry Potter was about whimsy and magic were missing the point entirely. The Harry Potter film franchise as a whole can only claim to brush greatness twice within its tenure. This with the Prizoner of Azkaban, by far the best adaption by a REAL director (Cuacaron) and now here under the hand of Yates. Yes much is cut and curbed for consistency but overall the story is thinned to only the best and most important material. If you want the harry potter experience, read the book and never watch the movies for you will be impossibly dissatisfied by the amount of detail excluded for sake of plausible running times, however, if you're not a whiner and appreciate the films as a separate entity you will be greatly satisfied by the job done in OOTP. The only complaints i will make is the lack of the brilliant John Williams yet again as composer. I pray to whatever religious entity might exist that he will have a change of heart and WB will be able to goad him back to the musical helm. Otherwise we will have to suffer through lack luster and no offense, British, composers. Also with as many truly incredible acting talents on display for the Harry Potter movies, why did they cast such a miss for Tonks? She looked nothing like the books description and had such an unnecessary role in the movie. Every time she was on screen i was just asking myself...why? Never the less i am eagerly awaiting Half Blood Prince and am glad they have given Yates the job in order to add some consistency to the bi-polar and truly unfortunate directing of the past (Columbus? Dear God who let this happen?). This series is on the right track and not even whiny detailers can derail it."

","I've just seen the 5th film and i when it was finished i was feeling kinda empty in me. I was sad not because of the deaths which in the movie were too quick but because the film had so many differences from the book. The book was superb the story was excellent and they took the main story or some of it actually and left behind very important things who should be mentioned. Like the mirror Sirius gave to Harry so they can communicate was not in the film and it played some very important role in the book because in the end we see Harry crying in front of it calling Sirius to come. Also another important thing is that the dream Harry saw and went to the ministry searching for Sirius it was the elf of Sirius who made it and we actually see that he was a traitor and he was working for Voldemort. Also in the book the talk between Dumbldore and Harry in the end is completely different there are other very important things which had to be said. There are other things too who for those who have read the books were left behind or changed and for those who were just watching the movie were questions left unanswered. Like what happened to Umbridge?...The film just like film and not based in a story was super the special effects well made the story was smooth and was perfect. The reason i put 9 stars is because its the franchise perfect. The one star lacking is because of the story difference."

","Finally! A Harry Potter film that actually gripped me. There is a tense atmosphere through the entire film and actually a real sense of danger which was missing from the previous installments. The effects are truly excellent and the score by Nicholas Hooper is superb - much much better than the ones made by John Williams, who off course built the scores foundation. I especially like the Irish/Scottish take on the score. My only problem is some of the slapstick scenes - a bit too childish (but then again I'm 33 years old).<br/><br/>Very effective film. A big cadeau to director David Yates, who obviously is more bold than the previous Potter directors. Highly recommended!"

","As a reader of the Harry Potter books and one who has seen all of the movies, I confess I went into the theater expecting something that was barely mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The Order of the Phoenix happens to be my favorite book of the series so far, so I planned on seeing it in theaters when it hit. However, after the less-than-stellar performances in Goblet of Fire, I didn't have much hope. The acting was quite good in this installment. Radcliffe portrayed a 15-year-old teenager very well, with his constant mood swings and whirlwind of emotions. I found him very believable and felt as though for once, I could relate to him. He is on a dark and twisting journey, one quite like a lot of people go through in their lives. As mentioned by another user, I was also pleased with Michael Gambon's performance. Although he butchered the character of Dumbledore in GoF (Goblet of Fire), I believe that he found Dumbledore's true essence in this movie and really allowed himself to become the Dumbledore. Very impressive.<br/><br/>The plot was very easy to follow as well. I went with a friend to the showing who had only read the first two books and seen only some parts of some movies, and he commented that this was the only one that he could truly follow, and he actually found it quite interesting. I did have to explain some crucial elements to him, but other than that, he understood what was happening, which i've heard is pretty rare for those who see the movies and don't read the books.<br/><br/>As I said before, this movie also happens to be my favorite book in the series, and I was delighted that the movie happened to stay pretty true to the book. It did, however, skip a couple of my favorite scenes (such as ""Snape's Worst Memory"") and there were many chronological errors and entirely new scenes added. But that is expected with any movie that is adapted from a book. Probably with the exception of the first movie, I believe this movie was the truest to the book overall.<br/><br/>Overall a 9/10. A truly brilliant movie, and an even more brilliant book. I know that we can look forward to the same with the 6th movie, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, for David Yates will be directing that movie as well."

","While it doesn't achieve the accuracy that I have come to expect from the first three movies, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix does convey most of the book. Inaccuracies abound, and the movie fails to mention key points in the plot, such as Dumbledore referring to the chamber in which Sirius dies as the ""Death Chamber"", and Sirius giving Harry the mirror (which may not matter).<br/><br/>All-in-all, I found that, while the movie did succeed in telling most of the story, it fails to cover many aspects, possibly leading people hoping to watch the movies instead of reading the books astray, and leading to future confusion in the plot, as well as disappointing many readers."

","I just came back form viewing this film and i will say that it was definitely worth watching. I read the book a few years ago but i still remembered enough to see that a lot had been left out.<br/><br/>Like the previous films, it really feels rushed to me and a lot of valuable explanation is left out. --Spoilers------------------------------------ There is little explanation of the prophecy and Neville Longbotom's role of being the original person for whom the prophecy was meant<br/><br/>Kreacher's role is gone, don't know why they bothered having him at all<br/><br/>Some scenes can pass you by in a flash, like the scene where Harry sees Mr. Weasly in his dream. It cuts abruptly to Dumbledor's room where they are sending a message to the ministry about the dream and receiving information that has been saved. The connection between Harry's dream and the events that followed was totally lost. The same can be said about almost all the scenes, they were just too rushed, and put together awkwardly. And though most of the movie moves at a good pace, you very suddenly wind up at the climax(which should have been longer), so it quickly jumps from feeling like the middle of the film to the end. <br/><br/>There is no need for extra scenes, but I believe that the movie could have been made a lot better if scenes were made a little longer and w/ a little more detail/explanation.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the information given is just enough, so there are no plot holes (except for Ron, Hermione and others riding thestrals even though they can't see them) <br/><br/>Otherwise, effects are good, acting is good, characters are great,(Umbridge is especially pink and evil) Though i think Luna could have been made loonier"
"groupiegirlnj","7","0","0","17 July 2007"," Good movie, bad portrayal of book.
","As an avid reader of the Harry Potter novels, I found this movie a terrible interpretation of the fifth book. I will at least give credit where it's due - as always, the casting for this movie was marvelous, the effects astounding. But I feel that they left out some very important information that would leave anybody trying to follow the storyline through movies alone in the dark. For example, the movie never explains who/what Aurors are, so leaving you to wonder why Shacklebolt and Tonks are even in the story at all.<br/><br/>There were many significant parts that were left out or altered. Umbridge giving Harry Potter a lifetime ban from Quidditch was a huge event in the book; so was McGonagall swearing her dedication to see Harry become an Auror, as it showed Harry that there were people who believed in him. Also, every scene in St. Mungo's was left out as well, something I believed quite significant.<br/><br/>Probably my biggest complaint of all was with the way they abbreviated Harry's grieving time over Sirius. In the books, it is a long, detailed process that really stresses how much Sirius' death devastates Harry, how he isolates himself from his friends for a few weeks, and how significant the closing conversation with Dumbledore really is.<br/><br/>I do understand that movies need to ""trim the fat"" on some novels to turn them into an appropriate-length movie. But I felt that by cutting so much of the development of Harry's character, people viewing the movie alone are going to have trouble grasping the depth that was intended for his role."
"santiago_varese","8","0","0","17 July 2007"," Best Potter film to date
","It's dark, it's the most faithful to date, and it has the best plot as of yet. The starting minutes are a bit on the bad side, suffering from the same thing the ending the last of the Potter flick suffered, which is it felt a bit rushed. Nevertheless, these minutes are brief, and as soon as Harry arrives at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, things start to get good. New characters such as Loona Lovegood or Dolores Umbridge are expertly represented, and old characters (mainly Harry and Hermione) have never been represented better. The movie doesn't take everything from the book though, and it shows, however, it usually doesn't take very important parts. The ending is something to admire, because it is one of the parts were it is actually better than the book.<br/><br/>I've never really loved the Harry Potter movies until now(fan of the books though), but this film is how it should be done from here on out.

The films always are very well made, but lack something that I can never quite put my finger on.<br/><br/>This one is EXACTLY the same as the four previous movies and I suspect it will be very similar to the next two instalments. to summarise-<br/><br/>Harry Potter is tormented with darkness.

The direction is pretty good, the script has OK dialogue and the majority of the actors (which there are many) perform well. I find Daniel Ratcliffe rather wooden though, but his other two buddy's (Emma Watson and Rupert Grint )are always played well and are very entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Overall I thing this movie is pretty poor.

","well, i just got back from the midnight showing, and overall i was very impressed.<br/><br/>not with the c.g.i. work, though, which on the whole i found quite weak and unrealistic. i found the character developments from the past movies reach their fullest potential.<br/><br/>the title character of harry potter was excellently acted by Radcliffe, and overall he has made the greatest improvements throughout the films.<br/><br/>but what impressed me the most were the three new female roles: Bellatrix Lestrange, Dolores umbridge, and Loona Lovegood. each one was wonderfully cast and perfectly realized on film. and was anyone else strangely finding loona lovegood kinda hot? the only real drawback i had was the over use of filch throughout the movie. he is in no way funny and only detracts from the story every time we see his face for ""comic"" relief.<br/><br/>this movie could easily overcome my favorite h.p. film (prizoner of azkaban - with its wonderful direction by cuaron and beautiful cinematography by Michael seresin) simply because it creates a new look on the harry potter world. much more dark and sinister, the story is beautifully realized by fast editing that would make Christopher Columbus faint.<br/><br/>and to all you people who find the editing out of certain scenes from the book dumb, think about this: it is not necessary that we see gilderoy Lockhart in st. mungo's or that Reeta skeeter got her interview with harry (too bad, though) the story functions perfectly fine without it! overall a great summer movie, not Oscar caliber in any sense (the closest i can come to see is best supporting actress by umbridge (unlikely)) go and see it - its worth it!!"
"ackstasis","6","0","0","16 July 2007"," ""There's a storm coming, Harry, just like the last time.""
","Perhaps surprisingly, the Harry Potter franchise of films has so far remained relatively consistent in terms of quality, with each new director leaving their own unique mark on the series. Chris Colombus, known for his assortment of warm-hearted family movies, offered a warm touch to the first two films (respectively,'The Philosopher's Stone' and 'The Chamber of Secrets'), offering Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy an air of magic and wonder. As the stories gradually became darker, a new direction was needed for the films, and Alfonso Cuarón was an excellent choice to helm 'The Prisoner of Azkaban,' crafting J.K. Rowley's story into something bleaker and more intimate. Mike Newell's vision for 'The Goblet of Fire' wasn't quite so dark, and most certainly had a more epic scope on Harry's world, but this was used well by the filmmakers. The most recent addition to the Harry Potter series, David Yates' 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,' is probably the darkness film by far, and, despite perhaps being a bit underwhelming, there are certainly many good things to say about it.<br/><br/>Ever since 2001, we have been watching the young stars of the series mature, grow into their roles, advance their acting talents. Whilst previous films had usually shown Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to be a tight-knit team, and almost as the three main characters, Harry Potter is most definitely the only main protagonist in this installment, with his two friends reduced to supporting roles. With a much greater demand on his acting abilities, Radcliffe is phenomenal in a difficult role, successfully portraying the confusion and torment of his well-known character. Notably, the scene in which he screams ""look at me!"" in Albus Dumbledore's office gave me shivers. The supporting cast of young actors is adequate: Rupert Grint is funny again as Ron Weasley, though I wasn't a big fan of Emma Watson, and often the lighthearted scenes between the three friends came across as forced and unnatural. Unfortunately, considering his previous efforts, Tom Felton  playing Harry's sinister adversary, Draco Malfoy  is given very little screen time, and not very much to do at all. Of the newest young additions to the cast, acting debutant Evanna Lynch is very enjoyable as the softly-spoken, hilariously-crazy Luna Lovegood, whose welcome support for Harry's theories is somewhat tarnished by her unwavering belief in the existence of Nargles.<br/><br/>Once again, a delightful ensemble cast of seasoned acting veterans complement the younger performers, with Yates seemingly trying to accumulate as many big names as possible into his film. Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Mark Williams, Jason Isaacs, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane momentarily reprise their respective roles, but not enough time is afforded for any of their characters to be further explored, with the exception of perhaps Oldman as Sirius Black, whose character (presumably) leaves the franchise when he could still have offered the series so much more. Ralph Fiennes, a favourite actor of mine, is fiendishly wicked as the all-powerful, serpentine Lord Voldemort. Helena Bonham Carter is also extremely disturbed, twisted and downright scary as Bellatrix Lestrange, one of Voldemort's most devoted followers. The most outstanding performance of the film, however, is that of Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, the powerful Ministry of Magic official who arrives at Hogwarts to interfere with its operation. Though sickly-sweet and softly-spoken, Umbridge is one of the most loathsome villains the series has yet seen, and I definitely detected a bit of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher from 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) in her character.<br/><br/>My primary problem with this film is that it felt rushed, much too rushed. Quite plainly, it's the sort of effect you get from trying to cram an 800-page book into a 138-minute film; ironically, the longest book to date has been adapted into the shortest film so far in the series. Perhaps because of this noticeable rushing, Sirius Black's death didn't have the same emotional resonance that was no doubt intended, and Harry's ""silent scream"" seemed a bit cliché and uninspired. Unlike the previous films, 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' didn't feel like another Harry Potter adventure, but merely a single chapter, as though it's leading to a spectacular resolution but hasn't quite got there yet (in fairness, however, this was also a problem I had with the later volumes in the novel series). It also didn't seem that David Yates had made the film his own, given it his own distinctive style, as Columbus, Cuarón and Newell had. Nonetheless, despite my seemingly-endless complaints, the overall product is a worthy addition, without being anything particularly special. With Yates apparently set to direct the next film, 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,' it'll be interesting to see in what direction he chooses to take it."

","Chris Columbus did the first and the second, Alfonso Cuaron did the third, the forth was done by Mike Newell and the fifth, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is by David Yates. Who are these people whose names I've mentioned? They are the directors of course.<br/><br/>Oh you didn't think they matter do you? I cannot deny the fact that what matter the most is Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). He is after all the main character of the series. You might even care for his two best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and even Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), but seriously if there is no director then there is no character. It would be like reading a Harry Potter book only not written by author J.K. Rowling.<br/><br/>Are you getting me yet?<br/><br/>If you do please read on If not please take another moment to think about what I've said.<br/><br/>The adventure or plot of the Harry Potter series is only going to get darker. If you are to be still stuck in the realms of innocence and magic of what Chris Columbus has created on screen with the first two Harry Potter films, namely ""the Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" then you're hereby warned.<br/><br/>If you are to be in the mood to argue that Alfonso Cuaron's ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" or Mike Newell's ""Goblet of Fire"" is the best you've seen, then you are warned as well.<br/><br/>With a different director at the helm at ""Order of the Phoenix"" and the continuation of a darkening story, you should be able to feel the differencing treatment as early as when the movie opens. It feels like a horror movie rather than a children fantasy adventure.<br/><br/>Harry is seen sitting on a swing in the middle of a playground. His cousin Dudley and gang came and started antagonizing him. In anger, Harry whipped out his wand and pointed it straight up Dudley's throat. All of a sudden dark clouds formed and everybody started running. Harry and Dudley found shelter beneath a tunnel but two ghostly Dementors located them and started sucking the souls out of the poor boys.<br/><br/>Harry managed to fight off the Dementors with a Patronus spell but was later informed of his expulsion from Hogwart. He had violated the rules by using magic in the presence of a muggle (or beings without magical powers).<br/><br/>But he was later rescued by Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix, a secret society formed in the times of Harry's father as a resistance against the evil Voldemort.<br/><br/>The story will move away from an atmosphere of magic and wonder from the previous films and into a more grown-up stressful fashion. Before even fighting the evil of an advancing Voldemort, Harry and friends will have their hands full with a new teacher who would slowly gain control of Hogwart. She is Delores Umbridge, played in truly self-absorbing fashion by actress Imelda Staunton. Here is one character that gives all who loves pink an evil sense of deportment. All of what will happen is due to Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge's refusal to acknowledge the fact that Voldemort is back.<br/><br/>The ignorance of those in positions of leadership can be so frustrating to those who truly knew better.<br/><br/>It will fall to Harry and his friends to take matters to their own hands. As the tagline suggest: ""The Rebellion Begins"". On the suggestion by Ron and Hermione, Harry will gather like-minded schoolmates and friends to form ""Dumbledore's Army"".<br/><br/>Like in all Harry Potter's film, the evil Voldemort will surface right toward the end with a climatic battle between good and evil ensuing.<br/><br/>Good and evil will be very trying for Harry. This is the darker theme that will follow our poor wizard hero. The film will be very much focus on Harry's internal battle. Just what is Voldemort's relation with Harry, and why is Voldemort unable to kill Harry is what the Order of the Phoenix will set you in ponder.<br/><br/>The prophecy says, ""Neither can live while the other survives"".<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is very well produced. There is a beauty in the cinematography seen from the capture of every scene. They were well thought and well edited. The details on the set of the Ministry of Magic, with its glossy black look is chilling yet cool.<br/><br/>Look out for new character, Luna Lovegood, played by the wonderful Evanna Lynch. She is the character that Harry will be relating to the most. They share the common perception of the word, death.<br/><br/>Although the movie is at 2 hours and 18 minutes long, it is the shortest among all five in the Harry Potter series so far. A lack of action and cinematic wonder made it felt long though. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is more inclined to the thinkers than those who are watching for the visual adjuration of the active kind. Maybe it is due to the lack of Quidditch in this one.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will leave you with anticipation to the next one, which is Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.<br/><br/>All shall be revealed, soon, only two more to go."
"TGRegner","8","0","0","16 July 2007"," From a Middle-Aged Fan... Fun Movie!
","I was late to the franchise, not starting the books until just before Order of the Phoenix was released. But I've read them all more than once and am a huge fan of the books despite some old-fashioned ideas about what makes ""great literature."" I set those aside because Rowling has created a wonderfully heroic world that has, let's face it... magic.<br/><br/>So I saw the first two films without ever having cracked the cover on one of the books. Then I devoured them. Perhaps I'm old and jaded enough to know that movies aren't books, nor are books movies. They are completely different media. Perhaps the best type of story to convert to film is the short story... not an epic multi-volume set such as the Harry Potter series. That said, I would rank my enjoyment of the books differently from how I would rank the movies. All of the books were better. I don't let that stand in my way of a good time.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a good time. My wife has never read any of the books but has enjoyed the movies, and despite so many others saying you had to read the books to understand what was going on in this movie, she had no problem following the story as it was presented.<br/><br/>The three primaries are getting better at acting. For film, subtlety plays better than large, gestural melodrama. Radcliffe is more in control of his Potter character than ever before and (giving a nod to his performance in the first film) is more Harry than Daniel now. Sure, his hair was too short, but the movies are NOT ""canon"" as the die-hard fans are wont to say on the Potter sites. How many of you have actually ever *read* ""The Wizard of Oz""? No contest -- the book is better. But a lot of you love the movie, right? That's because it's a good movie.<br/><br/>So is ""Order of the Phoenix."" It did help to see it through my wife's eyes, because she ""gets it"" without all the lush background of the book. As a fan, I would love to have seen more of Tonks, a much more protracted version of the Weasley twins' subversion of Umbridge's reign, a visit to St. Mungo's hospital, Kreacher's treachery and many other scenes that were deleted, but I understand that screenwriters and directors have to develop a much more concise plot, stick to it and make it move along.<br/><br/>""Order"" does all that, and as a movie, it is highly entertaining. I would hope that fans can keep the books and movies separate because they are different things. Sure, they are basically the same subject matter, but books will always deliver more and richer content than films.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film. It's a fun ride."

","i am like the biggest harry Potter fan, and with everyone making a big deal about the movie and having an awesome trailer, i was REALLY looking forward to watching it. However once it started it was like the first 3 chapters in 5 mins. The whole movie revolved around Harry Potter, i mean sure the movie is called Harry Potter, but Ron and Hermione only had like 15 lines in 2hrs and something-minutes. I'm also a huge supporter of Snape, and i've understood that they only give him like 3 lines in the movies, but i was hoping they'd give him some more attention during the Occlumency lesson scene, his memory was like 3 seconds long!! it's the longest book and i know they can't put everything from it or it would be too long, but it was the shortest movie they could have at least put in ONE Quidditch match. A Quidditch match scene would have only been like 10 minutes at most. My favorite Harry Potter movie is still GOF, i was really disappointed, and i'm glad i chose to watch it at a normal theater first before deciding to go IMAX, it's not worth it. However, if you want to go watch it, go right ahead i'm not saying it was THAT bad, but it's not worth spending more than $12 at IMAX, the trailer is more exciting, its like all the action scenes without the boring scenes in-between. The whole thing seemed rush, as if the director was looking forward to finishing."

","Okay I'll admit that bookwise, my favorite is The Half-Blood Prince. But seeing as how that one has yet to be made into a movie, I'll talk about The Order of the Phoenix. I just went and saw the movie today (and I hope to see it in Imax sometime). Micheal Gambon actually made a very good come back as Dumbledore unlike in Goblet of Fire. Granted quite a few scenes were cut from the film, they still did a very good job at keeping the story together, so even if you haven't read the books (which no one in my family has except me), you still can understand it. Rupert Grint as always was excellent as Ron, although he could show a little more emotion. Emma Watson topped it off as Hermione being annoying as she sometimes is. And of course Daniel Radcliffe as Harry also gave a good performance. Sometimes the look on his was a little creepy as well as intriguing. I also liked Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, despite him having a relatively small part in the story.<br/><br/>Over all except for a few minor complaints about it, they did a great job at getting the story across even with taking out some scenes. The cast was great."

","so i saw the 12 o clock show of Harry Potter and its really hard to say whether i liked it or not. maybe because i was half asleep the whole time, but something about it wasn't as good as the others. it was still an exquisite show special effects, but it disappointed me. i mean, sure, i went into it believing it was going to be amazing because i have every year since the first harry potter movie came out and they all have been far better than my already high expectations. <br/><br/>i can't really pin point why the order of the phoenix didn't ""tickle my fancy"". of course they had top notch special effects, and sets that are mind boggling to think about building. not to mention the fight scenes were incredible. i just didn't understand why they were fighting in the first place. i 've only read the first and second books, but i am usually able to understand what is happening, and this time around, i was pretty confused. i didn't read the book but i heard that they missed out on many key points vital to the next film. <br/><br/>i also have found out that David Yates, who directed the film, has not directed any of the others. that says something, don't you think? i went with a car full of people and everyone was talking about how ""gay"" it was. of course i had to stick up for my harry potter moves and say that it was really good and not gay. but after talking to Ryan i realized how disappointed the readers of the series must be. he told me everything that they missed out on--especially things involving Ron and Hermione. compared to all the other films, they had the least lines in this one. i'm not sure if they weren't that involved in this book, but from the sound of disappointment in Ryan's voice when he said, ""Ron only had like two lines the whole movie,"" i figure that he was, in fact, supposed to have a larger role. maybe i was less happy than expected because Ron is my favorite character and there was not too much of him, and he didn't have as many funny one liners as in the other movies. <br/><br/>another reason i might have been disappointed is because when i leave a movie i usually get this feeling that lets me know that i just watched an incredible movie, but last night (or this morning) all i felt was exhaustion and this little feeling down inside of disappointment for a movie long anticipated that i would not admit. i am going to see the film again on Friday, so i guess i can get a second chance to fall in love with it. hopefully."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite one yet. It's surprising that the longest book in the series gets the shortest screen time, but it's even more surprising to see that it works. Splendidly, in fact. I feel that a lot of details in OotP are superfluous anyway, and that leaving them out of the big screen makes the movie feel more like a movie and less like a tedious adaptation (and I'm a huge fan of the books BTW). Regardless, there are some disappointments that prevent the movie from becoming perfect:<br/><br/>* We do not see Neville's parents at St. Mungo's. * Harry's angst and anger is toned down, especially during his final confrontation with Dumbledore. In particular -- we do not see Dumbledore cry. I feel that this is one of the most important and touching parts of OotP and it is watered down in the movie. * The final battles are not as climatic as they should've been. When Voldemort possesses Harry, I feel no tension or suspense whatsoever. I wish this part could've been more exciting (maybe it's because I've read the book already and know what is going to happen, but something felt lacking). * Is it just me or does this outing go by a bit too fast? I mean, I love the pacing (quick and smooth in transition, moreso than the others) but it could've used some of that suspense I mentioned earlier. And some parts of the story lacked closure or emphasis (like Harry's relationship with Cho; Sirius giving Harry those mysterious mirrors), but I'm not really griping. <br/><br/>There are more negatives that I cannot think of at this moment, but I would really like to focus on the things that make Order of the Phoenix shine -- particularly, the performances. Daniel Radcliffe has truly matured as an actor. The demanding role of Harry Potter in the fifth book as darker with more inner turmoil must've been hard. For the most part, Radcliffe succeeds in making this realistic. Once again, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have shown a certain comfort in their roles as Ron and Hermione (let's hope they'll be able to move out of that comfort zone for more complicated roles in the final two books). Everybody else excels -- and the person who plays Umbridge (Staunton-something, I can't recall -- sorry) is perfect for the role. I mean, I am annoyed by her throughout the movie but that's the way it is supposed to be. I feel that she truly captures the malice of that twisted b***h, so bravo! And the person who played Luna Lovegood is absolutely amazing too. She has a certain natural dreariness that makes her the ideal choice for that character.<br/><br/>So the actors are guaranteed to deliver in this outing, the plot is done right (smooth as silk with nothing much lost in translation), the emotion is preserved but watered down, and finally -- the special effects and action sequences are awesome! Amazing, superb... maybe not a technical feast but certainly eye-catching all the same. David Yates has a talent for directing that gets the darker vision of the fifth book down right. It's just as I imagined.<br/><br/>With that, I'll give Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix the eight stars it deserves. I can't wait to see the series progress!"
"hjoyayala","4","0","0","16 July 2007"," Harry Pottter Six Needs A New Director Now
","Yesterday, I saw the movie for the first time and was extremely disappointed. First, I was shocked that Harry displayed practically no anger in the movie. The book and the cast knew Harry was angry at the beginning of the story. What in the world convinced the director to think he could down play the tension between Harry and his friends and still make a good movie? Harry was attacked by dementors and about to be disciplined for it! When he arrives at Grimmauld Place and is only curt with Ron and Hermione the scene becomes a huge let down. The second reason I didn't like the movie was because some of the actors' lines are poorly written and placed. For example, after Harry, Ron, and Hermione have their awkward conversation about what's been going on the twins apparate into the room because they supposedly heard Harry. I barely heard the conversation so there is no way the twins could have known Harry arrived if they were in another bedroom. Also, there is this scene between Harry and Sirius at Christmas time in which Sirius informs Harry that this was his childhood home. Even if I had not read the book, I would never have believed Harry didn't wonder or figure out who owned the house during his first stay there. Third and finally, I was not that impressed with the special effects. I thought the dementors and the death eaters looked more scary in the previous movies. And the scene where Sirius talks to Harry from the common room fireplace didn't look like he used magic. It looked like he used the oldest cheapest computer he could find. I have read the books, but I am not upset that some scenes were cut. I'm upset that the people in charge did such a lousy job with the scenes they chose to include."
"chenstuff","10","0","0","16 July 2007"," Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
","The Order of the Phoenix is definitely the best of the Harry Potter movies to date. It actually is one of the few movies I have seen that outdoes it's literary counterpart in developing and sustaining the arc of it's main character. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of J.K. Rowling and I have the entire collection; eagerly awaiting each one as it hits the bookstores. However in adapting J.K. Rowling's book, the screenwriter and director were able to truly capture the exact essence of the story and the dilemmas of it's characters while removing the unnecessary and the repetitive; something a good editor could have -and should have- done with the book. The movie was able to fully explore Harry's adolescent angst, anger and terrible losses without making him seem like a spoiled brat, as he often appeared in the book. The same can be said for the characterization of Sirius Black, who comes across as the Godfather that James and Lilly Potter would have chosen for their beloved son, rather than the self-absorbed and reckless character which came into focus in the book. I not only find both Harry and Sirius more likable in the movie, but also -and more importantly- they are more consistent with their previous characterizations and therefore more believable. The exploration of Luna Lovegood is equally impressive. The director allows us to see the absolute beauty and wonder in this character. Also, like Neville, we can see that this is someone from whom we can expect the unexpected. Someone who can understand Harry's deeper self. Someone who knows what it means to suffer loss. Yet, despite the the depth and darkness explored here, the movie moves along at an exhilarating pace with special effects that support the storyline rather than detract from it. There are none of the childish antics and visuals so typical of Chris Columbus in the earliest movies. This is a serious handling of an archetypal plot. While I would have liked to see more of Alan Rickman, Emma Watson, and Maggie Smith, among others, this focus on Harry was true to J.K. Rowling's vision. This is really Harry's story. More than any of the other books, this is the arc in Harry's development from child to young adult. Daniel Radcliffe does a fine job portraying this transformation and has developed into a fine young actor. As usual the casting of new characters is impeccable, with Imelda Staunton as the most wicked woman in pink the world has ever seen. Evanna Lynch is an absolute gem as Luna Lovegood! A most impressive movie. I find myself hoping that this screenwriter and director stay on for the next one."

","Alright so i've been reading a lot of peoples thoughts on this movie and there is much i would like to say. There were only two things like i really really enjoyed while watching this film. I was very entertained by the final fight scene. The spells were pretty wicked and it was pretty well done..though a little short if u include the whole Department of Mysteries. I also enjoyed the acting for the worst reason. i was laughing so hard at the awkward moments, awful dialogue, and unbelievable acting that it actually made them enjoyable. Wow. i have lots of inside jokes now. (examples: the scene where Ron and Hermione have their little duel & just the awkward moments with Neville)<br/><br/>I was NOT enchanted like i am by the books and movies 3&4. I'm waiting for the actors to suddenly become fabulous with age and it just isn't happening. How disappointing. The amount missing from the plot was not even...something they could work with in the future. My favorites scenes were just cut away. No Peeves, no older Weasleys, barely any tonks, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Now if you need to take a huge book and condense it, why in the world would u add random scenes that have NO purpose that aren't even in the book. If u took away the random scenes with no importance..and threw in some of the ones people are craving (the swamp, meeting Lockhart again, QUIDDITCH!), it would have been a better movie. You cant take books that are so widely loved and take away things for no reason. Yes, its condensed and not every person can be happy with the result..but i don't get why u would change things. Honestly..Dumbridge breaking through a wall? WTF was Dobby? haha he tells harry to use the room of requirement, not neville. (oh i could go on and on about the things missing and those taking their place but why waste ur time. =]<br/><br/>So in conclusion, i think that if u have NEVER read the books, go see the film. Its entertaining to the eye, but not those who are pretty big fans like myself. Its hard to enjoy something that isn't what u expected or wanted and after every scene your gasping, ""Huh?..."" Don't expect to see a great story unfold in front of u. Thats what a movie is supposed to be and if thats what you crave, I would advise rereading the 5th book so all hope isn't lost."

","It must be unbearable to watch this movie without having read the book. There are pieces here and there that are in there without much explanation. If you read the book you know what it is, but you also know that half of those parts were left out only to confuse the viewer. It certainly looked like they had a movie that went on too long and did some bad cuts to get it in on time, only to make things too confusing. This is the 5th movie of 7 and the worst so far. I gave it a 7 because it is entertaining, but jumps around too much. It was like they had to hit a bunch of key points of the book with no flow. I also felt like they had to get stuff in for reference in the next two movies. What can you do. Too much book for the big screen and to many directors and editors crossing multiple movies. Too bad they didn't go the PeterJackson/LOTR route and let one crew do the whole thing. One vision, one story and consistency."
"newma_nbway","8","0","0","16 July 2007"," While not the best Potter film overall, it is certainly the most distinguished in several areas...
","By the time most franchises have reached their fifth installment, it has either undergone a drastic reinterpretation or has become so tired and repetitive that it's hardly worth a look. What a joy, then, to see that the HARRY POTTER franchise is still going strong, with its newest actually improving upon its immediate predecessor. Also, unlike the first two films, it manages to create a nice balance between the need to be an adaptation of the much-beloved book but also work on an entirely cinematic level for the uninitiated. This balance strips the tale down to its barest bones, which works both for and against the film in the end.<br/><br/>As is the main problem with all the HARRY POTTER films, the key to its success lies in the adaptation of the lengthy novels. At 138 minutes, this is the shortest film yet and the story is cut down as much as it can be. As a result, many of the supporting characters are pushed aside. Veterans like Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, Brendan Gleeson and David Thewlis are relegated to just a few minutes of screen time, popping in here and there to say a line or two. Several subplots are largely ignored, also leaving intriguing new characters (mainly Natalia Tena as Tonks) regrettably underused. In an attempt to speed things along, many important plot points are left to be explained through dialogue, not only jumbling the plot and potentially confusing the viewer but skipping the opportunity to delve even more into the Potter universe. The purpose of the ""Order"" in the main title is only explained in one line, and the actual group is only seen together once or twice.<br/><br/>The major breakthrough in the film is the performances of those who get enough time to warrant attention. It's been said in many places that the three main stars (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint) have improved their skills with each passing film, and this is certainly no exception. Radcliffe is a revelation; leaps and bounds ahead of his admirable work in the past two films, he imbues his performance here with an aggressive frustration that is attention-grabbing, sympathetic and always genuine. Finally the film becomes entirely his and he holds focus like never before. Watson and Grint, while given less to do, are still solid and serve as a reminder of the more carefree days of the past. The three together have an undeniable chemistry that invites the viewer in. Evanna Lynch gives a memorable debut performance as the dazed Luna Lovegood, alternating perfectly between comic relief and genuine sadness. Staunton and Bonham Carter both give delightfully evil, freewheeling performances, with Staunton in particular crafting the careful portrayal every Harry Potter sadist dreamed Dolores Umbridge would be. Returning cast members Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon continue their solid characterizations, with Rickman in particular adding a new dynamic to his previously cold character that stretches beyond merely what he says.<br/><br/>British director David Yates makes his big-budget debut here and couldn't be in finer shape. Not only does he guide the cast to series-best performances, but many of the technical aspects are simply superb, from Stuart Craig's intricate production design to Slawomir Idziak's simply stunning photography; a palette of nightmarish grays, blues and greens that help make this film far darker than any others before it. The film is almost too dark for its own good; the level of seriousness is almost relentless, with only a few moments taken off to inject some comedy into the mix.<br/><br/>While not as distinguished as HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, this film is a worthy continuation of the franchise. It improves on several problems in the previous film and shows an irresistibly intriguing development in design and performance. Though the film is bleak and dark, and it rushes through the plot a bit too quickly, Yates has only served to drive up anticipation for the next installment. Once again, HARRY POTTER proves that it is one of the few modern franchises that deserves every single penny it earns.<br/><br/>Check out http://newmanscorner.blogspot.com for more!"

","When I walked into the theater, I was already feeling vibes that I would be angry at the movie for cutting out so many scenes and adding unrelated things to the movie. To me, the first movie would have to be the best, as it cut out the least. I do give some props to the writers for the movie, as they had to cut the longest book in the series and put it in a 2 hour time slot.<br/><br/>However, the movie seemed like clips of things pieced together. It seemed to me that every single scene lasted about 6 minutes before it suddenly switched to the next. They also decided to cut out all the quidditch. And, the movie made no reference whatsoever that Fred and George were ever expelled.<br/><br/>Then they had Neville TELL Harry that his parents were crucioed to insanity by Bellatrix. However, in the book they found out by going to St. Mungo's.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie seemed short to me, they cut out so much and added much more then needed.

"ovogel","7","0","0","16 July 2007"," Don't (re)read the book before
","This fifth installment of the Harry Potter series does not quite live up to the previous two. The longest book so far was condensed into the shortest movie. Although it does get the major story lines across, many liberties have been taken with the details. I re-read the book just before seeing the movie, and perhaps would not have noticed all these 'creative liberties', if I hadn't. Some details essential to the plot have just been scratched on the surface, and quite a bit was changed.<br/><br/>A lot of the 'minor' story lines add richness to the books, and that richness is missing from this movie.<br/><br/>That being said, I thought the acting was great. All of the young actors, especially Daniel Radcliff as Harry Potter and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, are coming into their own, and are really inhabiting their characters. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape is, as always, a pure delight, as is Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, and Jason Isaacs playing Lucius Malfoy. I hope they will shoot the next two movies quickly, otherwise the young actors will be too old to be believable.<br/><br/>Effects and camera are superb, although I liked the dementors better in the previous film. Most of the action, as in the book, is towards the end of the movie. There is a lot of character development before that, and because the movie doesn't and can't capture all that, it may be a bit slow to some viewers. Also, if you have not read the books, and/or have not seen the previous movies, you will be lost a bit, trying to figure out what's going on, since it is, after all, a continuing saga.<br/><br/>All in all, still worth seeing."
"Pendergast","8","0","0","16 July 2007"," This movie was all about Harry
","That's what the director (Yates) wanted the movie to be. I'm about half way through the book and have now seen the movie... so I have a half and half perspective. Thus far the book has been intriguing, and I believe Yates is right the movie should be about Harry and his struggle. Meaning if it doesn't impact Harry directly then it will be left out. No time to develop side stories and characters.<br/><br/>Does the Movie follow the book exactly? No, but after the first four films you should know that. Things get moved around, and left out.<br/><br/>Is this a stand alone film? No, if you have not at least seen the other movies you will be lost. And most likely hate the movie.<br/><br/>Also I noticed that reading the book (or at least half of it) did supplement the jumps in the movie. I could piece together what happened in between scenes. Also I was able to enjoy some of the Easter eggs (stuff for the fans that just movie goers would not notice) Once the movie passed the point of what I had read the movie still made sense, and progressed smoothly enough for me not to think I was missing something.<br/><br/>There wasn't a lot of screen time for our favorites, but if you give a character that in the past did not get that much screen time then you have to subtract from another. I for one am glad that they gave George and Fred more screen time. I like the characters, and it brought some humor to a film that was filled with a lot of negative emotion. Luna was great, but I think she needed a little more screen time to develop her better. Cho still really nothing there to make me feel like Harry would if she died. No emotional connection. I think Ginny could have used a bit more face time. Her advancements in magic even though hinted at in the movie would have taken to long to explain out on film. Kreacher also needed a little more time, without reading the book his presents really made little sense other than just a token creature wandering about.<br/><br/>I think the movie accomplished everything that Yates wanted. He also included plenty of Easter eggs in the film. Myself I could have used another hour, especially during the final fight scene. All in all I am happy with the film and look forward to seeing it possibly once more on the big screen, and then on DVD."

The end wasn't quite too scratch, but the bulk of the film more than makes up for this. This is a film for real Harry Potter fans, not just those that think by seeing a film they can make up for a lack of reading.

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/2007/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Harry Potter: Daniel Radcliffe Ron Weasley: Rupert Grint Hermione Granger: Emma Watson Dolores Umbridge: Imelda Staunton Sirius Black: Gary Oldman<br/><br/>This adaptation of the very entertaining book proves that movies can never beat the books. Although a good film, it lacks the magic, excitement, and suspense that the books and past movies had. The past Harry Potter films have actually intrigued us a lot with the stories. In this one we seem to observe what happens with moderate interest (which is good!), instead of wanting, extremely eagerly, to know what will happen next. That is my main negative point. Glad I got that out of the way. I seriously hate talking negatively about a Potter film but I did have to let that out. The film still gives us some entertainment, especially by the wonderfully portrayed Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), who gives us so much entertainment just by her brief clearing of her throat: ""hem, hem"". Staunton has given us a character to laugh at, laugh with, and even to relate with for those of you who are intolerably bureaucratic. The acting is great here by the KIDS, surprisingly. The adults, except Umbridge, seemed a little dull, not really depositing much life into their characters, especially Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Radcliffe did a wonderful job; Watson and Grint, too. Gary Oldman (playing Sirius Black) didn't have as much life in this chapter as he did in the third. Then again, the book didn't really portray him as lively But he played his part well, I guess. As for the script, it was good. The script was well written and original, just like the book. The music by British composer Nicholas Hooper was good. His best was Umbridge's theme. Not as good as Patrick Doyle, who should have been up for an Oscar for number four. And, of course, not as good as Williams' score for the first three. If you don't know who I mean, I feel sorry for you. The third was his best achievement for the franchise and actually was up for an Oscar but Williams didn't win. The first was in the same boat. Back to the story what a convoluted, although well written script. The third 'Pirates' script was convoluted and crappy. This one was convoluted and good. Remember, it wasn't as intriguing as the other four! But when Harry started creating a rebellion, sure, we wanted to see more. I mean, come on. I couldn't be bored by it. That's not possible when it comes to Harry Potter. So I watched and was impressed to see Harry finally get aggravated with all the nonsense going on. I agree with him. There is a lot going on that needs answering quickly, especially the dream he has been having about a certain door at the end of the hallway of a certain building that is certainly going to answer a lot of certain questions. Well something inside the door SHOULD. But does Harry know yet? No, that's too easy. Meanwhile, havoc is reeking at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by one certain teacher. Umbridge. She is basically making Hogwarts into a bureaucratic school and enjoys doing it. The Ministry of Magic, under the control of Cornelius Fudge, is behind quite a lot of it. There is also a sub-plot about Sirius Black and his evil cousin Bellatrix Lestrange. But that's not near as vital as Umbridge's role but it is slightly important, but I'm not going into any of that. See the movie for yourselves for that. There are also some things that were somewhat vital in the book that the movie didn't even mention! There was something about Ron joining Quidditch. They didn't include that; no Quidditch at all! There was another slightly important aspect about a girl named Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), who is in this film, and her father's newspaper/magazine articles entitled, I believe, ""The Quibbler"". None of that was even mentioned except for just showing one scene with her reading it. So, if you haven't read any of the books, you ARE missing some extra detail. Some important and some not. Depends on what you think. As for the duration, it was adequate. I actually wouldn't have minded if they had increased the running time. This is THE shortest Potter film of the series running at 138 minutes; followed by the third (142), the first (152), the fourth (157), and the second (161). I believe they tried too hard to reduce all the unimportant (TO THEM!) scenes and made it shorter than initially planned (the book is 870 pages long!). Whereas, the second film, running at 161 minutes, was longer because they didn't try as hard to reduce it because the book was shorter (341 pages long). It most likely turned out longer than they initially planned. You know what I mean; you know what I'm sayin'? Overall, however, this film is good. Yeah, it had some minor mistakes, a bit too short, dull acting, convolution, etc. But hey they tried and whatcha gonna do? No film is perfect, but this one has an imagination and gives you entertainment and escapism for a good 138 minutes. This film is the funniest of the series, also. It is definitely worth the money to spend. You will enjoy it. I guarantee that. Although David Yates' direction could have been slightly better. Okay, I'm done criticizing Movie directed by David Yates. Oh, by the way, Dumbledore and Voldemort finally fight in this one! It's a rather different conflict, however. You'll know what I mean when you see it"

The actors seem to have lost their magic ( especially Hermione, who seem to have very little to speak in the movie). The makers of the movie seems to have wrote their own books out of which the scenes could have been gathered.Consider the following aspects 1. Members of Order of the phoenix who come to rescue harry from privet drive flew him high in the clouds, not to get spotted (with a disillusionment charm), not through the ferries in the Thames.<br/><br/>2. Its Susan bones who asks harry if he really produced patronus and not Luna Lovegood at the Hog's head.<br/><br/>3. Its Hagrid who tells harry about Thestrals and not Luna LoveGood.<br/><br/>4. Its dobby, the house elf who helps harry in finding the Room Of requirement and some how Neville seems to have found it in the movie.<br/><br/>5. Dolorus Umbridge seems to have exceptional prowess at wizardry, since she completely blew the entrance to the room of requirement (this was funny) and its Mariette, cho's friend who was the sneak (not cho, and it seems umbridge have used veritiserum given by snape on cho instead of harry ) The list goes on like this and what is more painful is the omission of the scene in which kreacher gives false information to Harry on Sirius's where abouts.<br/><br/>All in all the movie completely disappoints a Harry Potter fan and for a person who doesn't know of the books, the movie is nothing but a collage of incoherent scenes."

","I have to warn all that I am not pleased when a movie deviates from the book it is based upon. I realize it MUST to some extent, but I feel this time it went too far. The special effects were outstanding. The score was tremendous (as usual) and the film itself was a very well done work. I give credit to all who worked on and in this film.<br/><br/>Radcliff continued to give an excellent portrayal of Harry Potter, and the same can be said for most of the returning actors and their characters.<br/><br/>I felt there were too many omissions from the book in the editing of the film, and the several changes were upsetting.<br/><br/>I feel Yates has let down the fans on this one. With the announcement that the final book will be split into 2 movies, I have gone from annoyed to outraged."
"x0Padfoot0x","7","0","0","11 July 2007"," Ehh it was good but disappointing at the same time...
","*******SPOILERSSS*******<br/><br/>So I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter and the books are basically my life. <br/><br/>The movies? Ehh Not so much. <br/><br/>Let me first start off by saying of course the movie could not please everyone. It was a Really long book and they couldn't possibly fit everything. So I dealt with the whole no quidditch. While they couldn't possibly fit everything I still don't understand WHYY it was the shortest movie of the bunch. I guess it was good that it wasn't that long because people would have got lost. <br/><br/>What disappointed me the most is not the things they left out but the things that were completely wrong and they put it in. <br/><br/>Sirius did not die like that. I was most upset about that because Sirius is my favorite character and they didn't friggen do his death right. and the VEIL? okay that was not a veil. that was a weird orby thingy. and i didn't like it. <br/><br/>Okay so its good that they put krecher in the movie because he played an important role in the book. and he has to play an important role in the movie too, Right? No, wrong... he didn't play an important role in the movie at all. You saw him twice and you didn't know that he was the reason for Sirius's death. & I know people who didn't read the book were probably like who the freakk is that?<br/><br/>FRED&GEORGE'S DEPATURE. Okay. I appreciate the fireworks. But Helllooo where is the ""Give her hell from us peeves""? or the other things that made that part in the book my favorite. I really wanted that part to be so much better. Also Gawp didn't say Her My Nee. :/ ha ha ill get over it i guess. <br/><br/>Now the things they left out that i was disappointed BUT don't worry guys i can live without these. No need to say this is the worst movie. <br/><br/>Ron & Hermione's prefect badges? Yeahh i wanted to at least see that Okay.. and.. where was the letter from Dumbledore to Petunia? remember my last? I'm sorry i just had to point that out AND. the dementor scene was dumb. <br/><br/>For huge fans like me this movie was somewhat disappointing BUT I have to say I enjoyed it at the same time The acting was good(except for Dudley.. wait why was he gangster?) and it was just a good movie. People who only watch the movie could understand what was going on which is the main point of a movie. So people can ENJOY it. Not sit there going ""OMG OMG OMG WORSTT MOVIEE BECAUSE THERE IS NO QUIDDITCH"" They didn't destroy the whole purpose of this book which was great. I know my brother doesn't read the books and he said that he understood what was going on. WHICHH IS GOOD. <br/><br/>People, its a movie. its not a direct reading from the book. <br/><br/>BUT One other thing I didn't like about this movie is that it jumped from dream to reality . i was even confused sometimes. <br/><br/>Overall I think this is the best of the movies. I don't know maybe not..., all i have to say is that it was entertaining and it got the message across. while leaving some things out of course :]"

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, who is getting better and better) enters his fifth year at Hogwarts, and a shadowy threat grows outside and within the school walls. The threat outside is in the form of scary @ss Voldemort (played by scary-@ss Ralph Fiennes). The threat within is pink, obnoxiously evil Doloros Umbridge (played to horrifying perfection by Imelda Staunton), a plant from the Ministry of Magic who believes that Albus Dumbledore is trying to use wide-spread fear of said Voldemort to usurp said Ministry of Magic. Harry and his classmates rebel from the imperialist thumb of this woman by forming a Defensive Magic club.<br/><br/>Of course, if you'd read the books you'd know all this, and if you are going in without reading the books or at least seeing the other movies, you made a stupid decision. This film does not stand alone and if you're a cynical adult critic, see something else. Why should the film lose points for building on the plots of the others? No one seemed to complain about it in the Lord of the Rings movies, or the Star Wars films.<br/><br/>Fanbase issues aside, the is perhaps one of the best of the lot so far. I loved Goblet of Fire, and all the adult critics gravitated towards Prisoner of Azkaban like catnip for some reason. The film had the most going against it of all the films so far. It's a 2 hour 20 minute version of a 800 page book, yet it breezily goes through the plot and makes it comprehensive without losing any of the book's charm or seeming like a ""Best of"" clip show. In fact, I would go so far as to say it amplified the charm of my lesser favorite of the books. Much props to the editors. They agreed to do what no previous director had dared to do. MONTAGES! No, not the dreaded ""m"" word! Yes they did. And it serves the film well.<br/><br/>Maybe hiring TV director David Yates was a good call after all. Right from the start the movie has a totally new richer darker feel to it. Harry and cousin Dudley are attacked in a tunnel, straight out of Jacob's Ladder, by Dementors, who seem to have a new look and even rougher attitude.<br/><br/>Of course, some critics have made this film out to be a funeral march. Not true. It's not all dark and despair. There is still loads of fun to be had, but when snake headed Ralph Fiennes is right outside your backyard waiting to kill you, how much fun can you have? By Harry's side is a legion of excellent supporting cast. They seem to have picked most of my favorite British actors, Alan Rickman and Brendan Gleeson (who I hope is given more to do in the remaining two films) at the forefront. Gary Oldman is wonderful in this new fad of his to not play bad-guys. Jason Isaccs returns with promising psychotic newbie Helena Bonham Carter as Death Eaters Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange, and oh hell, there's too much wonderful acting. You could literally remove half of the huge cast and still have enough quality British actors to do a rousing Hamlet, Othello, and Macbeth. My personal favs have to be Evana Lynch as the wonderful wayward hippy Luna Lovegood and Mathew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, who has really come into his own. Daniel Radcliffe also shows dramatic improvement in his best round as Harry yet. I like Emma Watson, but she could take a page from Dan and do a few plays. It's not entirely her fault as she's only given exposition to say, but something to change her speaking pattern and keep those eyebrows from not rising up and down every time she talks.<br/><br/>The movie manages to make the least cinematic of the books into a movie where something rousing is there around every corner, and it still manages to seem like the kids are going to school. There is an anormous awe-inspiring magic streetfight at the end. I'd give the film full marks, but it feels like there could have been a little more room for emotion and grieving (look! spoilers!) had they made time and not hurried everything along at the end.<br/><br/>Nearly the best yet but second to GoF, Order of the Phoenix gets an A- Now lets all find out how this ENDS. I hope JKR doesn't ""Sopranos"" the ending."
"december_starz","7","0","0","11 July 2007"," It's a decent film, but it could use some work.
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix went by so fast. You can imagine how little filler there has to be in a movie that crams 700+ pages into 2.5 hours. I mean, Lord of the Rings got three hours per 350 pages, and the plot moved fast enough in those films.<br/><br/>It was major event after major event after major event. They skimmed over every detail that wasn't critical to understanding what was going on, such as Kreacher's betrayal of Sirius, Firenze coming to teach at Hogwarts, Harry/Fred/George's lifelong ban on quidditch which resulted in Fred and George's subsequent departure (I'll talk more about this one later), Harry's interview with the Quibbler, and switching Harry's betrayer to Cho Chang instead of Cho's friend, Marietta. I felt that a lot was lost because they tried to fabricate easier-to-understand reasons for events instead of using the reasons given in the books.<br/><br/>The one thing that disappointed me a little was how very little time was given to the Weasley twins' departure from the school. They set off a few fireworks and flew away. Whoo. And for what reason? They don't give a solid one in the movie. So Umbridge tosses a few stern words at them for testing their products on a first year (I think - that part was unclear). In the books, Umbridge's tyranny has grown intolerable. The twins are banned from quidditch, which was (I'm paraphrasing) 'about the only thing worth staying for' at Hogwarts. They have a very strong ambition to open a joke shop. In the movie? No motive. You don't get the same sense of oppression at all, and the whole joke shop thing hasn't been mentioned since the end of the fourth movie.<br/><br/>Speaking of oppression, I also didn't get a sense that the shadow of Voldemort was kind of looming over everything. Aren't people's family members supposed to start disappearing? Shouldn't there be talk of the werewolves/dementors/etc. joining Voldemort? Why aren't we hearing about strange occurrences and other things that might give us some indication of the disturbance in the wizarding world? This is supposed to be a scary, uncertain time. That didn't translate at all into the movie.<br/><br/>The movie also didn't spend enough time on character development because of how fast the plot moved. Harry's relationship with Sirius seemed forced and it was hard to put a lot of stock into Sirius' death affecting Harry as much as it did. We hardly got any glimpse of the Angsty!Harry introduced in book five, and the cameo by the Marauders barely lasted fifteen seconds. We also didn't get enough Tonks or Ginny - or Draco, but that's a personal thing. ;)<br/><br/>Another complaint - COULD they have made Sirius' death more cheesy? Okay, the death itself was alright, but by blanking out the sound and playing some ridiculous violin-filled tune over top of everything, they made it about as cliché as the shaky-fist, I'd-have-gotten-away-with-it-too-if-it-weren't-for-you-meddling-kids guy on Scooby Doo. You know the guy. Yeah. You know.<br/><br/>The acting by those actors playing the three main characters has improved a little, although Emma Watson's was shaky early on, and I thought that Daniel Radcliffe should probably have paid more attention to the notes in the script, such as YELL HERE. Honestly. Why would Fred and George comment on his shouting when he was talking at a completely normal volume and hardly sounded ticked off at all? I also couldn't help but laugh at how brutal the lines he shouts at Voldemort are; something along the lines of, ""You'll never know love, or friendship. I feel sorry for you."" Okay, there, man. Sounds great. Too bad Voldemort doesn't give a crap on a radish because he's too busy being ridiculously evil. Rupert Grint was, as always, spot-on as Ron. His teenage boy realness is a beautiful thing to see.<br/><br/>Other notable performances: Helena Bonham Carter was picture-perfect as Bellatrix Lestrange. In my opinion, she didn't get enough screen time. Jason Isaacs makes me grin as Lucius Malfoy because he has the ridiculous hair and the pimp stick, but he still manages to be deliciously despicable. You can tell he's having the time of his life. Evanna Lynch was a pleasant surprise. I was worried, because Luna Lovegood is not the Stereotypical Teenage Role in which you can role your eyes and rant at your parents about not lending you the car. I thought that Evanna came off as slightly loopy but somehow still kind of wise, which is great. As for Ralph Fiennes, he is always excellent, as Voldemort or as anyone else. I hardly even need to say it. Imelda Staunton was a decent Umbridge, but she didn't give me the heebie-jeebies, and I think that a character like Umbridge should. For example, in the scene where Harry makes the horrid discovery that she's making him write lines using his own blood, she looks sympathetic, not threatening.<br/><br/>Little things: -I absolutely loved it when Sirius punched Lucius Malfoy in the face. Cliché, yes, but AWESOME. I almost applauded.<br/><br/>-They should not have left out how the prophecy could originally have been about Harry OR Neville. I don't think that Neville's given enough attention in the films.<br/><br/>-Ron and Hermione conversing on the stairs about Ron's sweater was hilarious. Something like, ""I don't understand why you don't want to wear it."" ""Because I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.""<br/><br/>-I was disappointed that they skipped the room with many doors inside the Dept. of Mysteries, as well as the rooms with the time turners, the brains, etc. I suppose it was too time-consuming to show them all, which is a running theme with this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, three stars out of five. It wasn't lacking in action or excitement, and the acting is so solid that it's definitely worth a watch or two. Just don't expect - well, magic. :)"

","I went to see this movie alone, as none of my friends are Harry Potter fans, and I really didn't feel like dragging anyone with me. I have read every review thus far before deciding to post my comments. I have also read every Harry Potter book twice, some three times. I read OotP three times, most recently last week. I feel there are two very distinct points of views for this movie: those who have read the book, and those who have not. I place no judgment on those who have not read the book, as they are giving to their opinion of a MOVIE they saw. Those who have read the book are giving their opinion of a BOOK they envisioned, and then saw.<br/><br/>The two perspectives will give very different reviews. Those who did not read the book saw a pretty good movie- though rushed at points with jumbled and missing connections. The action scenes were better than most of the other movies, the acting was better than any of the previous movies, and most of the special effects were also better. If you didn't read the book, missing details don't matter<br/><br/>HOWEVER the BOOK is called Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The MOVIE should have been called Harry Potter and Professor Umbridge. The Order of the Phoenix isn't emphasized at all. The story is told in staccato: no transitions, no time for explanations, emotions, or details. Those who have not read the book but have seen the other movies will wonder several things: <br/><br/>1. In the beginning: Why was that old lady dragging a suitcase across a field in a rainstorm to the playground? <br/><br/>2. Why was that same lady completely without emotion or fear at seeing a Dementor (especially since she knew what they were)?<br/><br/>3. What's up with the nasty house everyone in the OotP hung out in? Why weren't they cleaning/bewitching it to be nicer? <br/><br/>4. When Dumbledore left, why was Shacklebolt there to arrest him? I thought he was a good guy? <br/><br/>5. How come when Filch and Malfoy opened the door of the room of requirement it was a broom closet but Umbridge could just knock down the wall/door? <br/><br/>6. Why was there barely any magic in the Wizarding school, and for that matter only one class? <br/><br/>7. Why was Mr. Weasley in that hall? <br/><br/>8. How in the world did the OotP know to come to the Ministry of Magic to fight?<br/><br/>Now from the book readers perspective, WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY did they have to change everything around? The castle seemed distinctly un-magical, and since when do the students take a hayless hay ride to the castle? As a book reader, the following things made me roll my eyes, suck my teeth, sigh audibly, and feel really really disappointed:<br/><br/>1. There was no dark magic in the house of Black- i.e. - No portrait of Mom, no shuddering locked desks, no hint of anything except grime. <br/><br/>2. Sirius is related to Lucius by marriage- they couldn't show that on the family tree when they showed everyone else? <br/><br/>3. The Hog's Head was empty except for the D.A. members, a bartender, and a goat. Where were all the seedy characters? <br/><br/>4. Hagrid and McGonagall's fight was skipped. <br/><br/>5.Grawp was an over-sized playful kid. He was supposed to be frightening and violent, but wasn't in the least. <br/><br/>6. What happened to the magical doors and rooms in the Ministry of Magic?????????????? No brains? No time turners? No ""baby"" head Death Eater? Arrrrg! <br/><br/>7. With all of the spells and fighting in the end, why did it look more like Star Wars instead of Spell Wars? What happened to the spells that made stuff happen? <br/><br/>LAST BUT NOT LEAST! <br/><br/>8. Sirius dies by the avada kedavra curse and gets (what looks like) sucked into the -unexplained in the movie- misty archway and disappears? It was written SOOOOOO much better! Where's the part when Harry doesn't understand where he is or what happened????<br/><br/>Despite all of my nit-picking of details, I still enjoyed the movie. Like I commented earlier- the acting was better, the special effects were better, and Umbridge was portrayed perfectly. The only thing missing from her character was the bow in her hair.<br/><br/>Final recommendation: Go see the movie, but remember it's impossible to make a 4 inch thick book completely come to life in a movie without it lasting 4 hours."
"charlie-dont-surf-2","8","0","0","11 July 2007"," the saga continues and the anticipation grows...
","this film was always going to be overshadowed by the imminent release of the final book (the deathly hallows)but, as another director takes the chair (and let's face it there've been as many directors as there have been defence against the dark arts teachers) we're whisked away on yet another potter adventure. the film sets out, full of promise with gorgeous sweeping shots of British suburbia that inevitably lead us to harry. the film immediately takes a dark turn, with harry and his cousin Dudley being attacked by dementors (who look even scarier this time around). the first scene basically sets the tone for the entire film, dark and foreboding. a lot has been said of this film losing it's ""magic"" but there are many who beg to differ. there are moments of light with the weasley twins most spectacular exit from hogwarts and new favourite, Luna lovegood with her delightful monahan accent and whimsical air. this film plays an extremely important role in the series, voldemort is back, but no one wants to admit it. the entire film is a fight for the truth, evil is taking over once more and understandably, there really is very little room for the magical whimsy we've come to expect. this is dark stuff, and director, David Yates makes that very clear.<br/><br/>Every set is astounding, the special effects (As always) stunning, and the acting (spare a few of the younger actors) extremely engaging. the only disappointment for this film is the absence of the always enjoyable (and almost mandatory) quidditch scene, this was actually rather expected though, as we have far greater matters to concern ourselves with now...."

","first of all i would like to say that some people who consider the harry potter series the ""bible"" will be disappointed in the film. i have read all the books and this book is just to long and too complex of a story to condense into a film so don't go into the movie looking for details like tonks' hair being correct or the subtle side plots. they took a great book, over 800 pages, and condensed it into a little over a 2 hour movie... what do you expect? secondly, i would like to say that i really enjoyed this movie. i felt like they gave the movie the feel the book had. dolores umbridge (imelda staunton) and luna lovegood (evanna lynch) were absolutely perfect and brought the characters to life. also harry potter (daniel radcliffe) definitely portrayed the characters feelings and anger throughout the entire movie. i felt like the movie stayed true to the main plot of the book though they had to tweak a lot of details to condense it and make it followable by a person who hasn't read the book.<br/><br/>overall, this was a great movie that i think will have potter readers as well as movie watchers pleasantly surprised with it's action sequences and storyline. it was fairly fast paced, leaving me on the edge of my seat most of the time, and therefore lacked the ""feel"" of the other movies. what you feel in this movie are the characters. it was definitely more character driven than any of the other movies so far.<br/><br/>again a warning- please don't go into the movie wanting to see the book on screen...it just isn't going to happen."
"sirwootalot","8","0","0","11 July 2007"," The movies have FINALLY nailed it! O.O.T.P. is Astounding!
","As a fan of the books; every single film except for ""Azkaban"", and especially ""Goblet"", was a disappointment to me. Not this one!<br/><br/>Easy to read as they may be in terms of language, I have always felt that to pass off the series as children's literature is a massive injustice; one that every film - even my previous favorite, Azkaban - has done so shamelessly and prolifically. <br/><br/>I must warn you that if you think ""goblet"" was the best, you're in for quite a pooper of a film. Then again, the truth of the matter is that ""goblet"" is like the Disney-channel-special take on the books, whereas ""Order"" is like one of Umbridge's cold slaps to the face of that fairy-like, livejournal-gossip-vision of the wizarding world. Order of the Phoenix is, naturally, filled with more ""what about that part?""'s than any of the films to date; but that should be extremely obvious when the longest book becomes the shortest film. ""Order"" is my favorite book in the series because I enjoy the rich backstory immensely, rather than whine for the next chapter where person A and *gasp!* Person B start flirting. Moreso, ""Order"" is the beginning of the massive, glorious, and resounding end for the entire series - it's where the proverbial poo hits the overhead cooling device for-reals.<br/><br/>To make up for the lack in length, this movie compensates by seemingly fixing a projector to Rowling's brain and illustrating both mood and scenery with beautiful perfection. When Harry first walks into Grimmauld Place, I nearly gasped in amazement; the relatively short moments of showing what the place looked like - and especially Kreacher - were EXACTLY what my own mind had conjured while reading. That's nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to when we see Dolores Umbridge walk onto the screen. Staunton is PERFECT. I couldn't believe at first how uncannily well she had nailed the character - that perfect blend of facetious sweetness and slowly-radiating feelings of making you, the viewer or reader, feel viciously disgusted. The writers of the script, too, deserve great credit for their work. Even the other teachers, who naturally get very little time on-screen as Umbridge takes over the school bit-by-bit, have improved their acting greatly and - another first for the films - convey their deepest and most thoroughly hidden true desires on-screen. The best example of this is the scene in which Snape, in Umbridge's office, shows sympathy towards Harry while keeping up his image of hating the boy. Finally, the chemistry between harry and snape on-screen clicks - he's no longer ""that evil jerk""; he and harry both know that they are going to need each other in the times ahead , and for once Radcliffe purveys that sense. On that subject, Dan Radcliffe has improved almost beyond words. He's gone from acting the part of Harry to simply being Harry; and the effect is truly awesome to behold. I won't go into detail here; just watch the film and enjoy if you want to know more! The climax is perhaps the only possible disappointment in the movie; it feels awfully rushed and leaves out some of the best parts from the book (for example, no baby-head-death-eater) and replaces them with technologically neat but overall underwhelming ""fill-in"" sequences. There's very little sense that these kids are probably going to die fighting here, like in the book (where, if you remember, a good half of them got the living snot beat out of them); you see them all emerge with just a few bruises right after the scuffle between Voldemort and Dumbledore. However, this is saved by the wonderful acting that is done within the context of this ""harry-potter-lite"" version of the climax. Helena Bonham Carter is truly sublime in her performance of the beyond-psychotic Bellatrix LeStrange, and as usual Ralph Fiennes is still the absolute perfect man for his part. The art design for the death eaters here is like a chuck-norris-roundhouse-kick to the face of the unbelievably trite and tasteless black-KKK-hoods we saw in goblet. The effect is viciously disturbing, and the exact sort of thing that would have scarred you for life had you seen it in a childhood nightmare.<br/><br/>Finally, we have a Harry Potter film that truly does justice to the series as a whole - forget 100% plot accuracy and the like. What's important here is that this is the first to completely nail down the feeling you have when reading the books; to nail down both Rowling's vision and those of the readers. This movie is, like the books, just as frightening and dark as it is wonderful and whimsical; and for that reason it is, by far, the best film in this series. Go out and see it, for cryin' out loud!"
"MasterBrock","7","0","0","15 July 2007"," Harry Potter: Disorder of the Phoenix
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix isn't a bad film, but it has obvious and glaring mistakes that keep it from being on par with the other Potter films. It's barely ten minutes into the film when Nymphadora Tonks utters ""Don't worry Harry. We will explain every thing when we get back to headquarters."" Sadly nothing could be further from the truth.<br/><br/>The sad part of this film, is how untrue that statement was. They never do explain, they keep applying the same formulaic plot. A mystery appears, Harry and the Scooby Gang face adversity, overcome adversity, then face a greater evil that is ultimately squashed by or with the help of the older generation who plotted the showdown all along. This film failed to hit hard where it should have - dealing with death, unlike the previous which dealt masterfully and subtely with puberty. <br/><br/>Pieces were missing all over, it felt like everything in the film could be considered a Deus Ex Machina. Merely introduced to later fill in a plot gap. There was no casual blending or mere foreshadowing that Mike Newell delicately established in the Goblet Fire, it was blatant disjointed plot objects mashed together to complete the puzzle. Some points the film miserably at: - Dolores Umbridge's hatred of half-breed's into the ultimately just ending of her doom. - Thestral's obviously symbolic of dealing w/ death they are largely ignored, and I found it preposterous that anyone but Luna and Harry could fly on them considering the others couldn't even see them. - The Lastrange family line. It seemed weak and just thrown in, despite perfect casting of Bellatrix w/ Helena Bonham Carter. The director should be ashamed for limiting her screen time with the role, and never expanding on the racism. - The failure to establish inner conflict for Hermoine's character in obvious parallels between Dolores and her methods - Believable establishment in Harry seeing Voldemort and himself alike - The failure of interaction between Sirius and Harry - It seemed forced and poor. The audience was forced to recall emotion from either the book or two movies past. There just wasn't the connection in this film, where it should have been the strongest. - The failure to properly vindicate and re-establish Cho as good character, instead of a turncoat. <br/><br/>While it had bad points, it also had good. The most notable was the performance of two new actresses to the series that lit up the screen whenever they were involved - Natalia Tena as Nymphadora Tonks and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. While Natalia had very little screen time, I enjoyed every moment of it, and left wanting more. Evanna as the peculiar Luna Lovegood gave a near perfect performance, and brought an utterly brilliant character to life. <br/><br/>The actors all around gave good performances, as usual the adults seemed to outshine the kids whenever they could, but overall it was a good movie."

","At 2 hrs and 18 mins. this is actually on the short end of runtimes for 'Potter' films, but delivers plenty of bang for the buck. The Dursleys make a reappearance, the angst from the 4th film continues, and the wizarding world is in plenty of uproar over whether or not Voldemorte is really back. Harry and Dumbledore endure repeated attempts to sully their word as the Ministry for Magic asserts the dark lord has not returned. A special group of wizard, the Order of the Phoenix, knows better and rescues Harry from Privet Drive after a surprise dementor attack. Once at Hogwarts, only a handful of students believe Harry and Dumbledore while the rest openly mock him or keep their distance. Harry meets Luna Lovegood, a classmate who has seen death like him and so can see magnificent flying beasts called Thestrals. But also on the scene is Dolores Umbridge -a Ministry hack under Cornelius Fudge who interferes at Hogwarts and replaces Dumbledore at the school when her strict rules and underlings discover Harry has been teaching other students how to defend themselves against the dark arts. However, Harry has also been plagued by mental contact from Voldemort. Snape has been trying to teach Harry the skill of occulemency to block these invasions but Harry continues to see visions including an attack on Arthur Weasley and a faked attack on Sirius Black to lure Harry and his friends into the Department of Mysteries so he can retrieve an orb of prophecy regarding him and Voldemort. A battle ensues between the children, the Death eaters, and the Order of the Phoenix climaxing with Sirius's death and Dumbledore's reappearance to defend Harry from Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange (murderer of Nevelle Longbottom's parents).<br/><br/>Of course there's an enormity of material in the book that doesn't make it to the movie. Some scenes that do make it in include Harry's half-hearted courtship with Cho Chang and the Weasley twins' celebrated escape from Hogwarts while Umbridge is control, and a few others. All-in-all, I think the movie did an admirable job with the volume of material it had to pack into a feature length film. Can't wait for the next two!"

Partly due to some of the fantastic new characters that were going to be introduced.<br/><br/>However, David Yates' take on what is known as the most dull of the books is a film which never really seems to get going right until it's over.<br/><br/>The problem was always going to be the size of the book, cramming 800 or so pages into a film is never easy, but making this film the shortest of the franchise so far is complete lunacy.<br/><br/>Of course there is nothing to complain about regarding the special effects and the acting has become superb in this installment, Imelda Staunton is just how I imagined Delores Umbridge to be like. The magic however, is still lacking since Cuaron left the helm.<br/><br/>The story takes practically two thirds of the whole film to get going and it feels very much like a stepping stone to The Half Blood Prince. I enjoyed it immensely, but left feeling very disappointed in a film I thought would be outstanding.<br/><br/>Then again, being based on a fairly dull book, Yates' musn't be blamed.<br/><br/>Order Of The Phoenix is good to pass away two and a half hours but it never conjures the spark that we know from these films. If it wasn't for a few outstanding performances, this bird would be grounded."

","I wish I could have seen more Tonks but other than that I thought this was the best result so far. I thought HP4 was a disaster in it's taking liberties and missing characters traits and looks. I feel that the travesty is not in leaving out information but rather adding new material that does not belong. HP5 does not do this as much and where it does take liberties is far less crucial and jarring as in the past movies. This movie took the time to show the characters and included things hat would have been edited in past movies. It's very difficult to apply all the things that make the books so loved. What you are looking for is a capturing of the essence and plot of the book. HP5 does this; both me and my 11 year old daughter loved it. Most have complained about the representation of Dumbledore and for that I would agree. I don't feel it's a matter of acting talent so much as a misunderstanding of the character by Gambon. Dumbledore should be warmer and slightly silly at times. This is a matter of direction and is a bit of a problem since the movies lost Harris."

","Let's start with the negatives first. This film is part of a set now that follow on one after another so if you did take it rating as a sole piece of work, my score would probably be lower ...However, to quote Spock in Star Trek VI, ""All things are not equal!"" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was, by all accounts, many people's favourite book was an appalling film made almost unwatchable by Mike Newell's heavy handed direction. The follow-up to Goblet, Phoenix, was by comparison the worst of the Potter books as it seemed to feature a 500 page rant by JK Rowling against Corporal punishment that could have sufficiently been crammed into 200. The challenge for David Yates was to turn this convoluted mess into something vaguely enjoyable.<br/><br/>To say he did a good job of this is an understatement. The missing ingredient from the fourth instalment that was joyously back in this film was Harry, Ron and Hermione's on-screen chemistry. The scenes with all the pupils enjoying the ensuing adventure even in such difficult circumstances made what could have been an ordeal into the rich tapestry of wizardry that the fourth film should have been.<br/><br/>There are many highlights but it is in the detail that this film excel's. Jinny's look's of spiteful longing, Mad-eye's magnificent posture when he apparates and the, pardon the pun, spell-binding battle between White and Dark wizards.<br/><br/>Good performances of note? Too many to mention, but Gary Oldman steals the limelight again and Luny Love god was great for an unknown.<br/><br/>In short, when watching back in a few years time watch 1,2,3, skip 4 and watch 5.<br/><br/>Much Love"

","""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" may have a few story faults more to do with the screen writing change than anything else, but it is nonetheless one of the better films of 2007. Comparatively, it is very well-directed and well-acted by the cast, even if the length makes cameos out of every actor except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Umbridge. It does not deserve the nit-picking it has received by fans of the books and snooty critics who want to find some loose thread in the film series to unravel.<br/><br/>It would seem that critics want to fault the series for trying to move in a darker, more mature and character-driven direction, even though that is exactly where the books are going and nothing can change that. Critics who don't read the book series have it in their heads that the films should stay light and fluffy and child-friendly and sugary-sweet for some reason, and so as this film maintains the themes of aggression, depression, suppression, and isolation present in the book, the critics aren't happy because this film lacks the whimsy of the prior stories and isn't ""fun"" anymore. Well as Snape says in the film, ""Life isn't fair."" The rest of the series only gets darker and more threatening. Rowling has written a book series which takes Harry's magical world seriously; it mirrors our own world. As the films continue and Harry gets older, his awareness of his world increases as he finds people can be insane (Bellatrix Lestrange), insensitive (Snape), or deadly (Voldemort) as in the Muggle world, but there are also those persons dear and friendly to us, as the Weasley family proves.<br/><br/>Then there are those recently dubbed ""Potter Nazis"" who behave as though they are the protectors of the Potter books and act as though the films have debased and decimated the stories, and criticize the films as though it would be quite easy to make a seven-hour film including every little moment from the books. These are unreasonable and oftentimes ignorant people who do not understand how a film is made, nor the necessity of separating the book from the movie. The movies follow the books very closely in tone and style, and apart from omissions and the cutting down of certain characters and scenes, none of the films have ever strayed so far from the books that one could think Rowling has lost her control over Warner Bros. The films stay to the books and Rowling approves the script so that future movies are not tangled up.<br/><br/>""Order of the Phoenix"" is perhaps the most annoying of the Harry Potter books because most people hate how Harry and Umbridge act. There is so much talk and setting up for the final two books that the book is rather a job to read. This film, however, manages to focus on two key aspects of the book and requires characters and events to revolve around these two threads: A) The Ministry of Magic's denial of Voldemort's return and the actions they take against Harry and Dumbledore, and B) Harry's fears that he is becoming ""bad."" Therefore, a tight story is extracted for the audience to attach itself to. It is highly character-driven for Harry as we understand the pain he is going through following the previous film's story, and as we see a new story unfolding which sets Harry up with a link to Voldemort.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the screenwriter did include dialogue and scenes without giving reason for their inclusion. Certain things are seen or said that the audience will have ""What's going on?"" moments if they pick up on these inconsistencies. They are few and far between, however, and not so terrible that they make the whole movie collapse. And admittedly, as a fan of the Harry Potter books, it would have been nice to see more of the Ministry battle with a few more scenes from the book.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the film stays strong with it's solid acting, particularly from Radcliffe. The possession scene at the end of the film is heartbreaking and he nails the character's feelings of isolation and depression. Keep watch for his inspired neck twisting, it's a key to his character's development in the film. Rupert Grint also has a new flavor of maturity in the film, which is very welcome. It's all about subtlety for the boys. Emma Watson, on the other hand, still acts with her eyebrows.<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton steps into the role of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher this time around, making a splash as the loathed and cringe-worthy toad of a woman. She gets under your skin with every sentence and adds a little salt to make it burn. She is particularly vile and sadistic and makes Snape seem huggable. And speaking of Snape, Alan Rickman is absolutely perfect as Severus Snape, appearing for less than ten minutes of screen time but impressing with just the right amount of sarcasm and malice in his voice. Rickman has always played Snape straight from the book, but has never been allowed the twisted wit his character is known for. This time around, Rickman treats the audience to that flavor of witty disdain for Harry.<br/><br/>To close, it is best to acknowledge that Michael Goldenberg who wrote the screenplay will not be returning as Steve Kloves has penned the screenplay for ""Half-Blood Prince."" As a veteran of the Harry Potter films, Kloves will have no problem in adapting the sixth book as it's perhaps the most film-friendly in its plot, and the audience can expect a much more intense and mysterious film. It's a mindtrip of a story and those who maybe lost interest in the Potter films after ""Order of the Phoenix"" should reconsider: ""Order of the Phoenix"" seems like a decline in the series, but I can guarantee ""Half-Blood Prince"" will surge back as the best in the series, just on the strength of its story."

","In my opinion, the book is simply too big for it to be done justice by a two hour twenty minute film. I was impressed however by the effort that was made. Sure, there were lots of things left out, but the main body of the story was there.<br/><br/>As a piece of cinema: It was a brilliant. The visual effects were amazing, acting better than in most films (even though the trailers made Daniel Radcliffe seem like a very poor actor). Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman steal the show once more with their excellent performances. The only thing that spoilt the film in my opinion, was the over use of the newspaper montage, but i suppose without them the film would not have flowed as smoothly as it did.<br/><br/>As an adaptation of the book: As said earlier, for the size of the book, it was a good job, but some key things were missed out. One thing that disappointed me the most was the under-use of Tonks, who happens to be one of my favourite characters. Umbridge was played very well, though i did not think she looked like a 'toad' as she is described in the book. All in all however, it remained faithful to the book most of the way through.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Order of the Phoenix' is a good piece of cinema, and a fairly good adaptation of the book. I would recommend people who have not read the book to see the film first, then read the book, that way you will not be looking for things that have been missed out. Overall however, the films will never be as good as the books."
"TraceSpirit","8","0","0","15 July 2007"," A great film - changing the story slightly to make a much better film - especially compared to Goblet of Fire
","Warning Here Be Spoilers<br/><br/>Having read all the books and seen all the films I was pleasantly surprised by Order Of The Phoenix - especially after the debacle that was Goblet of Fire. The film does make quite a few changes from the book, however unlike no4 - which tried to tell the same story complete with gaping plot holes - this film instead rewrites the plot in such a way to make it engaging, exciting and slightly scary while still conveying Rowling's overall story.<br/><br/>On a more detailed note I must say that several performances were exceptional, especially GHelena Bonham Carter's - amazing!!!!! The effects were also of a good standard (if not the best Hollywood has to offer) and some things - such as a certain relation to a giant friend - were done better than I expected.<br/><br/>The film wasn't perfect and there were a few disappointments, most notably; a few bits of v. cheesy dialogue (mostly Harry's), the lack of explanation/evidencing of the Inquisitorial squad despite it being mentioned countless times and also the way Dumbledore is perhaps portrayed (through event not acting - yay for Michael Gambon)as being somewhat weaker than Rowling realises him (for those who have already seen the movie I am not dense and do realise he is protecting Harry - the glance as rubble falls on him and subsequent lessening of Dumbledore's attack, however the confrontation still seems to establish voldemort's superiority.<br/><br/>That said I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and count it both a worthy addition to the series and a true and exciting realisation of the book (on a par with No3) and well worth a watch. I count it a very good thing that the same director will be taking on The Half Blood Prince."

","==========THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS, SO STOP HERE IF YOU ARE STRONGLY AGAINST SPOILERS.============= So here I am, the latest victim of the Potter-Movie-Mania. At least I wanted to see the movie to bridge the time to the last novel. If the movie had passed the OWLs it would have reached three out of five: 1. The S-E: they are really outstanding! What the artists have created is really more than I ever expected. Especially the realization of the fight scenes was magnificent! Also outstanding was the creation of the scenery such as Umbridges office and the Ministry of Magic, they were absolutely unique.<br/><br/>2. The actors: they really exceeded my expectations. Especially Radcliffe, Lynch, Staunton and Bonham-Carter were great. Thanks god also Gambon has given Dumbledore his characteristics back. After the poor realization of this character in the last movie I feared the worst. But he surprised me. The problem is that the whole story fixes on Harry and so all the other actors don't really have the chance to give outstanding samples of their competence.<br/><br/>3. Music: The Music is acceptable but the Music of the first Movie fitted more to the Novels. Sometimes it was a little too noisy that you could really account it for music.<br/><br/>4. Cut: The cut is really poor, relating to the poor plot. Sometimes the cut is so fast that you can't follow the plot.<br/><br/>That leads us tho the last item: 5. Plot: DREADFUL!!! Really, after the last movie I thought that the director (it's a NEW director!) would have learned something! But not at all! The original story (800+ pages novel) was cut to 138 min. The whole scene at St. Mungo's is left out, so is the explanation of many details like Tonks's relationship to Sirius, the fact that Mrs Figg is a squib, and so on... I know that you can't put all details of the novel to one movie but I think most of the audience would have preferred a movie that has 30 min more and explains things. Many visitors will not understand who Tonks is, what the order of the phoenix really is and why Percy Weasly suddenly appears in Dumbledores office.(And so on...) It's not explained at all.<br/><br/>During the whole movie I asked myself why the crew that has done such a good job with the outwardness of the movie, like SE, scenery, costumes... didn't pay the same attention to the contents of the story! All these wonderful details that make the scenery and the acting so lively and authentic are left out at the story.<br/><br/>So, for all who read the book: don't expect too much. For all those who didn't read it: read it, otherwise you don't understand the story."

","Summer has arrived but it's not something Harry liked, after what happened at Hogwarts before the holidays. What was meant to save his cousin from the Dementors resulting in Harry being framed (as usual) by his uncle and aunt while they take Dudley to see the doctor's. Harry had no choice but to perform the Patronus Charm before it was too late for his cousin as the Dementors were near Dudley. So, a letter came for Harry from the Ministry Of Magic to attend a hearing regarding what he has done.<br/><br/>After Vernon and Petunia left the house with Dudley to bring their son to the doctor's, members of The Order Of The Phoenix (Tonks, Moody, Kingsley Shacklebolt and etc.) arrived at the house and they come to bring Harry to the Order's headquarters which happens to be Sirius Black's residence ahead of the hearing. It was at Black's residence Harry wanted to know what has been happening since the summer began. It was then Harry learned more about The Order Of The Phoenix.<br/><br/>On the day of the hearing, it was Arthur Weasley who brought Harry to the Ministry Of Magic. But they have to act as ordinary human beings first by blending into the ordinary London crowd before they arrived at the Ministry which Arthur knows where it is. Once Arthur and Harry arrived, Harry can only be the one to attend the hearing and it's Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic who is overseeing the hearing while there is a whole group of jury behind him to hear Harry's case. The Headmaster Albus Dumbledore arrived just in time to help clear Harry's name. Arabella Figg (Kathryn Hunter), whom Harry saw after he defeated the Dementors, became the witness as to what happened. Eventually, Harry was cleared of all charges.<br/><br/>It was back to school and many chose to ignore Harry, except Ron and Hermione and a handful of others like the Weasley twins, Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), Ginny, Cho etc. Almost everyone in the wizarding world thinks Harry is mad. Not everyone is believing that Lord Voldermort has returned and is actually more powerful than ever. After the trio returned to school, Harry saw Cho but she was with her friends. It was also then the trio saw the loony Luna. At the feast, it was being made known by Dumbledore that Hogwarts has a new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher - Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton). She was last seen at Harry's hearing.<br/><br/>It was the beginning of what's to come from Umbridge. No learning of practical magic, only what is being approved by the Ministry and nothing else. And under the orders of the Ministry, she has become from the Undersecretary to Fudge, to Hogwarts High Inquisitor and later on, Headmistress (Dumbledore was being sacked from his position as Headmaster). The last thing happened after she managed to find out about the secret army that Harry and his friends were part of - Dumbledore's Army. It was Hermione's idea given they are not learning much ahead of their OWLs. Harry was the only one who can teach proper magic, based on what he had experienced. In order to save Harry, Dumbledore said that he was the one who gave Harry the approval to form the group. Given the formation of societies was banned under Umbridge's so-called Educational Decrees.<br/><br/>With the wizarding world divided on people believing that Lord Voldermort is back and those who don't, which group will win in the end?<br/><br/>What impressed me was especially Imelda Staunton's role as Dolores Umbridge. In JK Rowling's best-selling series, Umbridge is whom many hate because of what she is - her appearance, squeaky voice and etc. Staunton almost perfected it.<br/><br/>I was initially worried the movie may not live up to its expectations for me, given I had once read the book. But I understand not many things were in the movie because of the timing. Except for a few personal complaints, I actually like it overall. It never disappointed me."

","Consistency oddly both enhances and takes away from the Harry Potter experience. Like the books, the films have a built-in structure that allows for them to not bother with coming up with fresh ways to start and finish each film. A new academic year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry begins and ends with the film following suit. While this familiar structure doesn't allow for surprise, it is the adventures the take place between these two bookends that define each film. And despite a new rule of conservative values and repression falling upon Hogwart's, it is the constantly appreciative and awed faces of Harry, his few friends, his professors and the legions of fans watching that make HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX one of the most solid in the series. Being a part of one of the most successful film and literary phenomenon of all time has not jaded a single player in the least. Doing justice to a lushly imaginative world without making itself into something more serious than it is and managing to have fun while working hard has allowed Harry & co. to find a comfortable, satisfying stride.<br/><br/>Under the new direction of British television director, David Yates, Harry finds himself facing a darkness that is brooding and growing inside of him. In his fifth time out as Mr. Potter, Daniel Radcliffe continues to add new levels to Harry's personality, becoming increasingly more introverted throughout the series. Here is a boy whose parents were killed and dons a scar that certifies him as the wizard the world has waited for. Dealing with his own demons and the weight of being something of a chosen one is so much for this young man's shoulders to bare that social interaction and expectation become more difficult. Radcliffe's Harry is a boy becoming a man. He knows he is destined for great things but he also knows how much there is still to be learned and how far there is still to go. The storm that goes from raging to calm in his mind on a regular basis is so taxing that his instinct is to cut himself off from those that always have his back. It is noble to wish to spare those he cares for from his pain but it is also telling of his fear to be close to people who might one day also be taken away from him.<br/><br/>Detachment and repression are common themes in THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. While Harry imposes rules upon himself, new addition to the Potter cast, Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) ushers Hogwart's into conservative times, placing value on paranoia and control. With this comes the greatest challenge for Yates. How do you make a movie about magic where the characters are forbidden from performing any? Yates overcomes this by driving the magic underground and pitting the students against enemies both frivolous and frightful. Staunton's tart persona has plenty of pucker, making her the teacher every kid wants to exact sweet revenge upon. Despite her stern hand, she is merely an irritating distraction when compared with the looming return of Lord Voldemort. The denial steeped around his return and the subsequent nondisclosure to the public make THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX an atypically topical Potter film. The implications made when the ruling powers manipulate the press and silence those who oppose them are unexpected and yet never take away from the plight of Harry and friends. Suffice it to say that come the end of this film, their growth as people will ensure they are no longer treated like simple children. What is most striking about their maturity is they don't even know it's happening.<br/><br/>With so much emotion being forced inside, it is exhilarating and liberating by the time the climax comes and all is finally unleashed. It's an awful lot like being in the head of an adolescent. HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX also manages its own magic by cramming the longest book from the Potter series into the shortest running time of any of the films while maintaining all the elements necessary to make the story whole. Weaving in layers of thematic insight and giving more depth to Mr. Potter himself brings the film from magical to meaningful. And after five installments, bringing something new to the spell without ruining the recipe or changing the consistency is a pretty impressive trick unto itself."

","(Slight book spoilers)<br/><br/>Reading the book, which is my favourite of the series so far, I looked forward to the movie. The way Mrs Black's face would be portrayed when she screamed, how Neville's parents would act, the Sorting Hat's tune, Harry's jealousy of the prefect badge, Ron's performance on the pitch...<br/><br/>But then when I watched it none of it was there. I could not believe how much stuff they missed out. It was all of the interesting details that made the book so great and the movie missed out a lot. I know it would have made the movie too long but I was greatly disappointed. The little details they missed out too, like the tone of voice, Tonk's hair, the depression from what happened with Arthur - which they could have easily done wasn't there and the personalities of the characters were lost. <br/><br/>The film was OK.

I am just unhappy about how much they decided to leave out.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with some friends who had not read the book and they did not understand what was going on especially because the film jumped from scene to scene, it was not smooth and it did not work well and because the film did not explain itself well and you would have had to have read the book to get it.<br/><br/>So I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I would have liked to but I wouldn't say that you should definitely not watch it ever because it was completely and utterly awful and does not deserve to be in cinemas because that is not true and others might enjoy it more than I did so you should judge it for yourself."

","It was with significant trepidation that I went to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I'd been somewhat disappointed with Alfonso Cuaron's PoA's film adaptation, and severely disappointed (even angered) by the travesty that was Mike Newell's vision of Hogwarts in GoF. OOTP is my favourite book of the series, and I was worried that the plot, characterization and overall film wouldn't be true to JK Rowling's vision.<br/><br/>Well, I needn't have worried. Director David Yates pulled this off in a way that had me grinning throughout the entire movie, because it was clear from the opening titles right through the closing credits, here, finally, is a man who ""gets it"".<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr Yates, for directing the young stars in such a way that fits their age. The awkward interactions between Harry and Cho, the conflicts within Harry himself, Neville's transformation, even Luna's dreaminess, all well-executed. He even managed to rein in the chemistry between Dan Radcliffe and Emma Watson that was leaping off the page in the previous two movies, recognizing - as any true fan would - that despite the actors' obvious affinity for one another, it's really Ron that Hermione is supposed to be falling for. Watson still has virtually no chemistry with Rupert Grint, but at least an attempt was made at giving them more interaction to set up the plot line for later.<br/><br/>Thank you, thank you, thank you Mr Yates, for restoring my Dumbledore! I'd been unimpressed with Michael Gambon in the third movie, downright horrified with him in the fourth, but it was clear from this movie that the man can act, he just needs better direction. Here, he got it, and returned to being the Dumbledore we all know, love and trust.<br/><br/>Thank you, Imelda Staunton, for bringing Dolores Umbridge to life, exactly as evil and as nuanced as she should be. Her performance was pitch-perfect every step of the way.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr Yates, for the attention to background detail. While I recognize that it's impossible to put every single subplot from the book into a movie, you managed to condense pages and pages from the book into corners of the screen in such a way that made us feel like we weren't missing anything.<br/><br/>Thank you to the set designers, editors, animators and directors, for bringing to life the Ministry of Magic in such a stunning way, exactly how I pictured it. Seeing the movie in IMAX 3D was well worth it for the amazing scenes at the Ministry, but even the non-3D scenes were beautifully executed.<br/><br/>No doubt, people are angry at the changes and omissions to the plot. That has been me for every book so far, especially the last one. But here, I found I didn't mind so much. The scenes didn't feel rushed, and the movie made sense as a stand-alone. (One of the friends I saw it with hadn't read the book, and I found there was next to nothing that I had to explain later to her; she'd understood it all from the movie. This was certainly *not* the case in GoF). What changes were made were done for a reason, and I felt they stayed true to the spirit of the book, bringing to life what was most important and simplifying some elements that were less critical. The story was well told, and essence of the movie was very true to the book, while still making sure not to rush through scenes or sacrifice emotion for the sake of action.<br/><br/>David Yates is the first director of a Harry Potter film since Chris Columbus's to truly get it. I'm relieved and thrilled that this movie was so great, and am glad to hear that Mr Yates will be staying on to direct HPB.<br/><br/>A must-see for any fan and also for any skeptic. 8/10."

Such courage was taken by this director as i saw the movie. this movie might not be able to be on top when you talk about gross sales..but in terms of artistry, its way above the average line. as i quote the newspaper review, ""realism overcomes magic and sorcery."" In the previous HP movies, we were overwhelmed by the special effects, the new fashion sense, the new characters, glorious scoring and other petty stuff, and on the end, left us with the question ""what was it all about?"". no lasting effect. it just ends there and there. the ex-movies were like cardboard. hard and plain. HP5 is about feelings, emotions, struggles, mature friendship, and growing up. compared to the ex-movies, time is spent now on every dialogue. silence is being inserted already, allowing us to feel and comprehend. not to mention the unparalleled performance of Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge.<br/><br/>Simply stated, the movie has gone mature. and i love it.<br/><br/>Satisfaction Guaranteed."

The film was choppy (not in a bad way, but shouldn't have been done with HP), with momentary glimpses into the plot and a few specific details pointed out.<br/><br/>I think a good way to describe this movie would be as though you're viewing someone's memories with the pensieve (those who have read the books should know what I mean). It's all about what Harry sees and feels and thinks.<br/><br/>I did love the ministry of magic battle. The visual effects were stunning and looked like what magic would look like if it were real. I did not love, however, how they totally changed it. And somehow, Voldemort seemed less scary, less intense, less evil.<br/><br/>So, to sum up my short review: It was neat to see Yate's perspective and interpretation, but sometimes, you just gotta stick to the book.

The new style of story-telling Harry Potter's journeys are very different. This particular film did not display the magic as I anticipated. I was actually quite bored in the theater for many parts of the film. There were too many silent moments and way too much dialog.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was another thing. The same tracks were playing over and over again.<br/><br/>I am a die-hard Harry Potter Fan of BOTH the books and the films. I just can't wait to see the return of the screenwriter and music composer for the sixth movie. Thank Heavens!!!!!!<br/><br/>TOO much of UNIMPORTANT stuff was taken out of the book-too many unimportant scenes, irrelevant to the main plot were shown (i.e, Sirius's Family Tree). Hermoine and Ron being prefects are VERY important to the main plot as it further shows how Harry is avoided by Dumbledore, AS WELL as the very important scene of Harry seeing Snape's memory!!! TOO SHORT!<br/><br/>This movie was more of actually bringing a few scenes of the book come to life as to making it an actual movie.<br/><br/>(though I may say that the last 20 minutes, were quite impressive...IMAX 3-D. wow. but still...)"

","Wow, what a disappointment. The Potter series is on its way south. Here it continues to devolve into that dreaded practice of film-making-by-committee. So much art is an inherent threat to success, especially in film stories regarded as Big Money ""properties"" that must be engineered for mass appeal, thus we see very little artfulness in such movies. And when it does show up you figure it had to be sneaked in somewhere. Because the creation of these projects involves so many different perspectives from multiple creative departments it's that much more difficult for the director to enforce an overall vision. When we see things in the picture that we like then it is usually something self-contained that doesn't integrate into our movie experience as a whole. All of which is true of this. It has the expected assortment of qualities we admire -- individual scenes lifted from the book, the performances, the preservation of Rowling's politics, stylistic touches -- but it's all detached. Fragmented.<br/><br/>Of course the powers that be at Warner were going to persevere in this vein. They've refined the process of manufacturing and distributing these installments into an efficient, mechanized groove and they don't want to rock the boat. That's why we've had a couple of hack ""yes"" men behind the camera for the past two movies. Yet when we last had a truly capable artist at the helm -- when Alfonso Cuaron took over from the comparatively untalented Columbus for ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" -- I was hopeful. He took the myriad elements of Rowling's world that Columbus transmuted and infused them with an expansive, three-dimensional rendering that the earlier films lacked. The series finally became cinematic. When that happened it looked as though we'd have distinctive visions, from a carefully selected slew of directors, that would be imprinted on each successive sequel. Instead you can look at this and ""Goblet of Fire"" and see that almost everything good in both of them owes to Cuaron's contributions in ""Azkaban"" (the architectural, swooping eye of the camera, the intensified pacing -- subsequently used to misbegotten effect, which I'm about to get to -- and, most talked about, the darkening of the color palette).<br/><br/>So, with little to distinguish each of these newer products from one another in the way of cinematic achievement, my focus shifts to how they do in terms of adapting their source texts but they've dropped the ball on this as well. Cuaron's film broke from its predecessors in how it took liberties with the books. It was shorter, more liberal, but remained intelligible and had a symmetry that was film-specific. Now compare that to this. This is also shorter but only as a mandate by the studio to appease the attention-deficit. I don't see how any movie enthusiast unfamiliar with the books could comprehend it. Inside references for Potter enthusiasts are abundant but not reasons and motivations for why half of the story's countless characters end up at the Ministry of Magic in the film's climax. There is no ebb and flow. Say what you will about Columbus but there is something good to be said for how those first pictures internalized their plots. They had coherence. Now, as we plow through Potter and friends' teen years, the filmmakers have abandoned the clarity of Rowling's writing to emphasize the edgier tones she's let into her work. I doubt it would fix the inherent flaws, but I wouldn't mind seeing an extended cut of this just to determine how much story sense was discarded to placate the impatient.<br/><br/>Now that he's gone out and improved on P.D. James' ""The Children of Men,"" can't we have Cuaron back? Here's hoping for a rebound on the next sequel, but my hope isn't great. This other director's signed up again. Dance, puppet!<br/><br/>Blake's rating: 2 (out of 4)"

It was like peeking through a window and seeing only small pieces of everything going on, never really getting the whole picture. <br/><br/>Every step of the way we kept hoping it would get better.

","This movie is a solid 7 out of ten. The acting was good. The plot was extremely choppy and hard to follow. The visuals were mostly great, but there were a couple of terrible CGI creations. There is some character development and decent amounts of action, but this isn't an ""edge of your seat"" experience. I am a fan of the Harry Potter books. I think they're well told and a lot of fun. That said, most fans I know who have seen this movie were like ""It's the best movie of the century"" or ""I hate that they didn't include ___________, it ruined the entire movie."" They are both wrong. The fanboys and fangirls are eschewing it or lapping it up based on their feelings love of the books. This is a decent summer movie. I'm glad I didn't que up to see it on some midnight show, because it isn't worth a ton of money or a large time investment. It is a pleasant diversion if you have a block of free time and feel like going to the movies. That said, if you haven't seen Ratatouille or Transformers, I'd recommend those first as they have better visuals, better acting and a much more realized plot than this. Just my opinion, but that's about how I see it."
"freaky_dave","7","0","0","14 July 2007"," Still Passable fun but not as good as the other four films
","Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is still passable fun, but I found myself slightly disappointed with the movie. I know that a lot in the book was kept out of the film, but I believe all the main points were covered, so that is not my problem with the movie. My problem with the movie is that it has lost a little of the magic that made the first four films very good. In my opinion, it's become more of a drama and has lost some of the fantasy touches. Even the teachers, which helped to make the first films so good, have simple cameo parts that last only a few seconds or so. However the three main stars, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint are still very good.<br/><br/>It's Harry's fifth year in Hogwarts, and many things have changed. Nobody in the ministry believes that Voldemort has returned. In fact Cornelius Fudge, the minister, thinks it is all a plot by Dumbledore to overthrow him and take control of the ministry. So the ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher to watch over things at Hogwarts. She is perhaps one of the best villains to ever wear pink, and uses her influence to try and take control of Hogwarts herself.<br/><br/>On the other side you have the members of The Order of The Phoenix who support Dumbledore and have gotten together as support in defense of Voldemort's growing influence and his own army. These members include Harry's uncle Serious BLack, Mad Eyed Mooney, and Professor Lumas as well as others. You can see how things are getting darker with each movie just as they do with each book.<br/><br/>During all this Harry is having nightmares about Voldemort and is becoming so angry with the way things are happening, that he finds himself lashing out at his friends who only want to help him. Both Ron and Hermione accept him still.<br/><br/>Order of the Phoenix is still worth seeing. The special effects are as good as ever, and the film moves at a pretty good pace, but with the exception of a major magic battle at the end of the film, the movie doesn't have much else magical to offer. However, I will still recommend it if just barely, and hope the next two films are an improvement."

","If you read the book: I think that this movie hit on more points of the book then any other of the Potter movies, as brief as some parts were. I know some think it didn't follow the book , but they cant make a 10 hour movie. The part with Graup could have been extended more as well as the Centaurs. They went dark with this film as was advertised, it has left the realm of children's book and now is more adult based. I do and don't agree with that, I don't because it started as a children type movie and isn't really made for the 4 to 7 year olds who were drawn in by the first 4 movies. Why i do, is because it has made the film much more intense and more attractive to a older viewing audience. <br/><br/>If you didn't read the book: This movie was made more for you, and it for the most part will keep you in a conversation with someone who did read the book. Of course some who has read the book will know more details of how certain parts transpired. The filming of this movie was done in a very different way from the past direction. It draws you into the story far better then past Potter productions. You get a feel of the intense emotions of Harry and Friends. This is all setting up for the next movie/book, and not by accident. If you think this movie is dark, ""The Half Blood Prince"" will make this look like Mary Poppins. I do look forward to that. Go see this film, it will be worth it, just be sure if you are bringing young children to guide them as this could scare them a bit."
"melbethany","6","0","0","14 July 2007"," Disappointed
","I realize that most of what I'm going to say has already been said in other comments, but I feel strongly enough about this that I wanted to put in my two cents worth.<br/><br/>I am one of the die-hard Harry Potter fans, and yes, I did like the Order of the Phoenix book. I probably shouldn't have read it a couple of times this year prior to seeing the movie, though. That way I wouldn't have been so disappointed. I do understand that an 800+ page book has to be condensed to get to a reasonable length movie, but this was ridiculous. I'm hoping that a lot of this was the fault of the screenwriter and that the change for the Half Blood Prince will rectify this particular problem.<br/><br/>Things I have major problems with: 1) Change in the time line of the movie. I knew that this was going to be an issue when they took Harry from the Dursley's house the same night as the dementor attack rather than several days later. Then the time spent in the house with the Order of the Phoenix ends up being non-existent. OK - they didn't have to show them cleaning the doxies out of the drapes, but showing Sirius' mother's portrait screaming would have made more of a point than just a couple of random shots of Kreacher mumbling. Another major time line issue was having Harry get his first Occlumency lesson from Snape the night that Arthur Weasley was attacked. What was up with that?? Then to have the Weasley twins make their exit during an OWL test? In the book they were gone before the testing took place and even made sure that their disruptions didn't conflict with the preparations for the test. These aren't the only time line problems, just ones that I had a major problem with.<br/><br/>2) Major changes in the storyline. Hermione, Ron (and Draco Malfoy) were all made Prefects. Not even mentioned in the movie. And what was up with no Quidditch? The fact that Ron and then Ginny both made the team were important in the book (especially that Ron had such little self-confidence that he was quite inconsistent in playing). And that Harry, Fred and George were all banned from playing. Was there anyone besides me who was looking forward to seeing Luna in a lion head hat when Gryffindor played Slytherin?? And even though I like Neville I fail to see what it added to the story to have him just happen across the Room of Requirement. I do love the fact that Neville started to believe more in his abilities in this book, but finding the room wasn't part of it. Other changes/omissions include making the Harry/Cho first kiss almost anti-climactic because the awkwardness between the two of them prior to that wasn't illustrated very well. And no date on Valentine's Day, with the subsequent falling out that same day. No interview with Rita Skeeter. And a big thing was just glossing over the schoolwork part of this. The OWLs are a huge thing, and it was just mentioned in passing. They were working harder than ever on their schoolwork and the pressure involved with that added to the burden they all felt. No Firenze teaching Divination (that would have been cool seeing the students' reaction to the classroom the first time they went in there). I've already gone on too long with this part even though I could write pages and pages of the things that were changed with the story.<br/><br/>Things that I did like (thus the 6 out of 10 stars): 1) The additions to the cast couldn't have been better. I had mentally pictured Delores Umbridge as dumpier and plainer, but now I will see her as played here. She was excellent - I hated her in the movie almost as much as I hated her in the book. Luna was also excellent. I read an article on her that said she beat out 15,000 others at the casting call and deservedly so. She WAS Luna! I wish Tonks had more screen time because my impression of the actress playing her was very favorable. Overall I have no complaints with the casting of the characters. Like many others I miss Richard Harris' portrayal as Dumbledore because his replacement just doesn't quite do the character justice. I do love the fact that the same people have played the students through all of the movies so far, because we've been able to see them grow and develop through the years.<br/><br/>2) Music and special affects were well done. I didn't like the changes they made to the appearance of the dementors (they were so much spookier looking in Prizoner of Azkaban), but most of the rest was quite well done. I wish the battle in the Ministry of Magic had been closer to the book, but I'm trying to separate the two. If I hadn't known what the battle was supposed to include then I think I would have been happy with what I saw.<br/><br/>Even being this disappointed in the movie will not keep me from eventually buying it when it comes out on DVD, if only so I can see the things that were cut out of the movie shown in the theaters. I'm hoping that some of the problems with the movie will be fixed with a better editing job.<br/><br/>I'm not giving up - I'm really hoping that a better screenplay on HBP will make for a better movie, even though the director is supposed to be the same as on OOTP."

","By now the Harry Potter series won't need any explanation. Most people that will be seeing this film will have seen the films and/or read the books after all. Bookwise this fifth part is a HUGE part. About 1000 pages, the largest part so far. Filmwise this means a lot of information needs to be brought to the screen or trimmed away far enough that it disappears without too much consequence.<br/><br/>So far the series fared rather well on that. The first three do a more or less straight conversion. Harry Potter 4 was missing a lot of data that was in the book but still worked out well enough. For me, part 5 misses more data than 4 did, but works out better nonetheless. I think this is a great film. It's fast, action packed, played out well enough. I also think it works better for people who have read the book than for people that haven't. Some things don't connect very well without the story backing it.<br/><br/>New characters like Luna Lovegood were typecast brilliantly which added to the film in a great way. Used effects were great, atmosphere was chilling, musical choice was fitting. All in all, another great addition to the series.

I think if you haven't read the book and have no clue what the movie was about, it probably won't make much sense. I do realize that there was a lot of information on the book to turn into a movie, but I just got the feeling that it wasn't focusing anything. There was a positive side to this, you probably won't get bored, it adds a certain rhythm to the movie and you don't get bored easily.

"azulojos_k","8","0","0","14 July 2007"," Very good movie, but should have been done in 2 parts
","I think overall for doing a 900 page book into one movie it was good. Obviously any of us who have read the book will all say the same thing. It should have been done in 2 parts to cover all the pertinent material. However since it was done as one movie, they did the best they could. The story flowed nicely and showed the progression from sad young Harry to angry teenage Harry. The emotional factor was just right (several people in the theater were crying.) I think as an avid reader of books I've come to accept that movies will always be far inferior to the book themselves. As a huge Stephen King fan I've learned that a great book doesn't necessarily a great movie make. But there are exceptions. Jaws was an equally well written book as well as a movie (even though there are several obvious differences between the two.) Anyway my point is that this movie was enjoyable from start to finish with a strong and emotional storyline. Did it equal the book? No. But it didn't destroy it either.<br/><br/>Anyway in my opinion, movies are meant to distract and entertain us. Books are meant to transport us into other people's lives and worlds by allowing us to emotionally get involved by a writer's words. Movies are visually pleasing and instantly gratifying, but books take hold of our emotions and make us feel sad, happy, angry, etc. and stay with us for a very long time. So cherish and savour the books and enjoy the movies for what they are, pure entertainment. Which this movie was. Fun, entertaining and emotionally charged. Definitely go see it and Enjoy!

"rowman2222","4","0","0","14 July 2007"," Good acting and special effects, poor directing, writing, and editing
","JK Rowling has created a world so rich with texture and vivid descriptions that we can live everything from the smell of the kitchen stench at the Leaky Cauldron, to the feel of the sheets at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, she brings one other element into her book that bastardizes the entire work; her reliance on worn out literary devices. The order of the Phoenix is rife with them. First, we see friends that turn on Harry for terribly poor reasons just for the sake of creating tension. Last time in was Ron, this time it is Seamus, and various other people throughout the series who sort of just go along with whatever the stronger willed characters tell them to do. Even Dumbledore has been seen to accuse Harry of wrongdoing when there was little or no proof and his past record is of absolutely candidness. (Goblet of Fire)<br/><br/>The next device is her reliance on contrived and impossible situations to further the story. Of course, suspension of disbelief is necessary for a movie about wizards, but you shouldn't have to abandon common sense. The Tri-Wizard tournament in the last film, was a game that restricts its participants to the whims and fancy of a magic goblet whose motivations are never explained and thrusts them into a tournament whose peculiar games are inexplicably drawn over the course of a school year when the actual competition itself lasts only a couple of hours. In Phoenix, it is Deloris Umbridge who is able to take over Hogwarts putting the entire school in the stranglehold of her moral code and at no time suffers any backlash from parents, other professors, or the rest of the wizard community. The only support offered for this ludicrous situation is that she has the minister of magic in her pocket. Never mind that ministers are elected positions and have to answer to more than just one woman. This is a woman whom everyone is against but no one has the nerve to stand up to. Even Dumbldore simply chooses to vanish like a coward when faced with the prospect of being excused from his position. Has Dumbledore ever shown such cowardice before in his life? I doubt it.<br/><br/>The biggest device however, and the most often abused by Rowling, is her reliance on the Cassandra complex: a person who knows the truth of the past or the future but is disbelieved by everyone including friends and family. This is present in every film in some degree and grows with intensity as the series goes along. In the Order of the Phoenix, Harry spends nearly the entire film being accused by everyone at Hogwarts of making up stories about the Dark Lord's return. Umbridge even goes so far as to scar Harry for ""Making up Lies."" Again, where are the parents and other teachers when this is going on? In the last film, Mad-Eye Moody was scolded for using transfiguration as a punishment on a student, and here we have a professor using mutilation with impunity? But back to Cassandra. While Harry does manage to recruit a small band of friends to that he trains in defensive magic, the majority of people think he is making things up. That is, until the very end of the film when the Minister witnesses Voldemort for himself and the headline in the Daily Prophet reads ""Harry Potter Vindicated."" This headline indicates that it was not just those at Hogwarts but probably the majority of the wizard world that thought he was a Liar. Why? He has no history of lying. Indeed, he has the opposite. He has been vindicated time and time again in each film and yet people continue to think he is making things up. This may make drama in an otherwise undramatic year at Hogwarts, but it defies common sense.<br/><br/>Now unfortunately, the film itself only amplifies these issues. Even more perplexing is that Harry himself is not immune from this propensity to disbelieve other wizards. Although Harry is by now, quite familiar with the loneliness and frustration of being disbelieved, when his budding girlfriend Cho is indicated to have turned him in to Umbridge, instead of asking her what happened, or giving her the benefit of the doubt, he gives her the cold shoulder and does not speak to her again for the rest of the film. Even when it was revealed that Umbridge used a spell on Cho to get her to tell of the location of their secret club, Harry still does not go to her to apologize. Obviously his own experiences have thought him nothing of empathy or understanding, not even equipping him with the ability to admit when he is wrong, something others have done including Ron and Seamus who ultimately realized they were being poor friends for disbelieving Harry. Apart from this, the movie fails in ways the others have not. Namely, it is the shortest Potter film to date and I got the distinct feeling that what was cut out, was more crucial than the editors thought. There were so many loose ends that I left the theater thinking I had missed entire sections. Who ordered the Dementor attack on Harry? How was Voldedmort able to break into Aszkerban? What were the circumstances surrounding the death of Neville's parents? Why has the minister suddenly become a complete nincompoop? Why has Draco (one of the most interesting characters in the first two films) been completely written out of the script? What happened to Quiddich, was it canceled along with everything else at Hogwarts? Why isn't Harry, or anyone else for that matter, doing anything to try to clear Sirius' name? What happened to the romantic tension that was brewing between Hermione and Ron in the last film? <br/><br/>Taken by itself, this would have been a satisfactory movie. But it isn't by itself. It has a book to try and match and four previous films to honor."

","Episode 5 brings us more of the same. the movie tries to summarize the big book in which (too) many details and story lines are described. The summary is actually quite good but, as part 4, has the killing effect of too many things in 2 and what hours. Therefore the movie is very hasty, giving the actors hardly the chance to act properly. As a matter of fact, the most characters have very little acting time. That makes it hard to empathize with the main characters and leaves you no other choice than to sit back and try to enjoy the many special effects (which are not all that great). The 'children' are becoming too old for their roles. I think it will become a big problem in the next two movies. It is a children's story trying to become mature. Therefore it's way too childish. The simple fight between good and bad, the magic of the first three parts, it's disappeared."

","""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth installment based from J.K. Rowling's wildly popular series of a young wizard's adventures in the magical school of Hogwarts, feel much more an obligatory splice between its predecessors and the impending eventuality. For fans who have loyally followed the series, it's temporarily stopping an itch before the final book comes out. But for anyone else, the film is an emotionally inept and borderline drab for most of its running time as the narrative feels crammed just as to cover all bases before going to the final two films.<br/><br/>Prior to his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his bullying cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) have been attacked by Dementors in a subway prompting Harry to use a spell in front of a Muggle to expel the dark soul-sucking creatures. This places him in trouble with the Ministry of Magic, which forbids such practice, and would have been expelled by the tribunal from Hogwarts if not for the intervention of school headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).<br/><br/>Still, even after being cleared of the offense, the Head of the Minister Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) refuses to believe Harry and Dumbledore's claims that the Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned. He instead installs the sweet-talking pink-loving Professor Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as the new Defense against the Dark Arts instructor, whose fascist-style of running the school has led a group of students to form ""Dumbledore's Army."" Led by the trio of Harry, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), the underground rebels plan to put up an army that would fight the one Voldemort is forming.<br/><br/>To their credit, director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg succeed in giving the film a dark tone that signals the young hero's transition to adulthood. The performances, as usual, are competent and the cinematography contribute to a menacing atmosphere all throughout.<br/><br/>Yet despite all the polished trappings, there's no sense of magic. While Goldenberg, whose screen writing credentials include the brooding 2003 version of ""Peter Pan,"" manages to consistently translate the angst required of the film's characters, Yates fails to impart consistent pacing throughout and bring out the requisite emotion from the film for the viewer to connect with its characters. As a result, everything feels less genuine drama than a mere anchor for subsequent Potter films.<br/><br/>While fans may be pleased with this end product that coincides with the source material's seventh and perhaps final installment, anyone else probably won't be held spellbound."

","The big three of Summer, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, Spider-man 3 and Shrek 3, failed in making effective cinema, but still nonetheless brought in huge profits. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will undoubtedly continue the box office success of the Summer blockbusters, but while it is easily a better film, it still fails to help make a thriving series become good cinema.<br/><br/>Continuing where the last film ended this latest Harry Potter begins to show the different opinions to the death of Cedric, and the return of the dark lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The general consensus, as adhered to because of the Ministry of Magic and their minister, Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), is that Lord Voldemort has not returned and that the Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) had something to do with the death of Cedric. All suspicion is placed upon Harry and Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gamdon), as the Ministry believe they are raising an army of rebellion.<br/><br/>Considering it is based off a novel, the film does take some liberties but some fans will notice some scenes which should have been included, have been discarded, but nonetheless, The Order of the Phoenix is one of the better novel-to-film translations. Still, the story starts off slowly and never really picks up enough pace to catapult it to its conclusion which, like many scenes, was abrupt. Some scenes seemed rushed, and many camera cuts never seemed to flow logically into the next ,such a scene where Harry is clearly a good distance away from the rest of his party, but then the next cut has him right next to them without any indication that he was going to be walking back to them. Another problem lies within the story itself: it was far to linear for its own good, and contained no surprises for the audience except that the film had none. The film appears to favour characterisation, as the story itself only goes to end off in a similar situation as to where it started, and it just seems all rather pointless in the end.<br/><br/>And the characters themselves never help the simple story. While the main cast of Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) have matured physically, their acting definitely has not. For the most part they are stale in their performances, and even battle to put the right emphasis on certain dialogue. Still, the acting is not completely lost as the older generation of Gamdon, Fiennes and Gary Oldman prove both convincing and the most exciting to watch, although it is a pity that their screen time is somewhat limited. The film also tends to discard certain characters: Cho Chang (Katie Leung) plays an important part in the story, but after her transgression has transpired, and when Harry has learnt of the real reasons for her actions, the film then fails to try and build their relationship, and render her useless for the rest of the film. Ron also is given minute screen time, which is sad since he is easily one of the more lovable characters in the Harry potter universe.<br/><br/>Another disappointing factor is the locales which are just plain bland. Gone are the magical environments that littered the previous films. Instead director, David Yates, tries to make a flying sequence along London to be of great eye candy. While the scenes seems realistic, as do the many other scenes throughout the film, it is a bore and just very magical to gaze upon. Still the film succeeds greatly in the special effect department which some truly amazing spell effects, especially towards the end. The ending sequences themselves are noteworthy, because for the first time audiences are given a very war-like approach to magic, which is a completely refreshing notion, as it helps make the film more darker then previous installments. This added darkness makes Harry potter a more believable series, but also effectively makes the film less accessible to younger children.<br/><br/>The Order of the Phoenix is both a better and worse film in the series thus far. The world of magic is easily becoming more realistic and not some light-hearted affair at creating a simple fairy tale feel, and the film itself feels more mature. But acting, cinematography and, most importantly, the story, fail to deliver. This latest incarnation of the popular book series, is moving in the right direction and it's obvious that we can expect great things from the films to come, but then again, what is expected is never always delivered, and the order of the Phoenix is a prime example. It's not a particularly bad film, but it falls short of expectations.<br/><br/>--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---"

","The movie was OK. It was rushed and choppy from the beginning to around halfway through the film. The second half, in terms of editing and pace, was a lot better.<br/><br/>Overall, the thing that irks me most is that the movie didn't convey, to me at least, the feeling of dread throughout the book. Of all the books in the Harry Potter series, OoTP has to be one of the darkest. Granted there were some scenes that were hilarious, it seemed much too comedic for my taste because laughter broke out almost every 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The actress who portrayed Professor Umbridge did a very good job with what she had to work with. She came off more, however, as an annoying teacher rather than a totalitarian dictator that I perceived her to be in the book. There was never a person who could garner so much loathing from me than did Prof. Umbridge after having read the book that after seeing her portrayal in the film just didn't do her justice.<br/><br/>Ron and Hermione (Grint and Watson of course) did very well in terms of acting but seemed much more as secondary characters that the film could have very well done without them. The bond of friendship and loyalty that most readers know of among the trio has always been an intriguing part of their story. It seemed like their on screen time was always somehow cut short that there was hardly any character development.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this was Daniel Radcliffe's best performance so far. He's improved leaps and bounds since Sorceror's Stone. The final fight scene with him on the floor trying to fight Voldemort from controlling his mind caught me off guard because it was for the first time that I had felt emotion for his character. Great performance.<br/><br/>There were many scenes cut from the book but it's understandable because of the time limit. They could have extended it to 3 hours because time flew by quickly as it seemed that I was only watching for one hour after having left the theater. The extra 30 minutes that would have amounted to 3 hours would have smoothed the transition for several scenes or possibly could have added another scene or two to explain events more thoroughly.<br/><br/>The movie is worth seeing at least once. My main complaints are above but other than that it was still enjoyable to visually experience what only our imaginations as readers could have seen when reading the books."

","I saw the midnight showing the first day it came out. Looking back, I have the feeling that the movie was better than it was because 3/4ths of the audience was overly tired and would have seen the movie if it filmed the title character taking a crap in the loo for two hours. The movie is very dark (literally AND figuratively...lots of scenes with dark interiors and clouds produce a moody ambiance that at least gets the point of the film across), so it's not the most fun of the previous four. And Hary is just...irritating. I understand the boy is going through a load of hormonal and emotional changes, but couldn't Daniel Radcliffe bother to SMILE ONCE? At least the veteran actors are entertaining (Alan Rickman has about ten lines and the man is still GOD), although I wish Imelda Staunton could have had a little more fun with Umbridge. That seems to be the bottom line...the entire movie and it's components are are burdened with its dark mood, and much of the magic is lost."
"jpaz-8","8","0","0","14 July 2007"," One HP (series, not movies) fan who thinks it was a good adaptation
","I have never been compelled to comment, but I'm actually angry over this. People need to relax. Yes, there are many wonderful moments in the book that obviously made the plot richer, the characters more endearing and just in general ADDED to the magic of the book. Yes, the movie was choppy and a bit discombobulated at times. However, you can't want a slower paced movie AND more details.<br/><br/>I thought it captured the spirit of the book. The book WAS choppy at times; there was no real central story as in Goblet of Fire with the Tournament. It was a lot of setup, but this is hard to convey in a movie and, frankly, boring. Scenes were definitely left out, but when I think about it, they weren't absolutely essential. And I actually liked the changes they did implement to capture the essence of what needed to be conveyed. To follow the book in some of these cases would have been too complicated, detract from the movie, and only satisfy die-hard fans. it wouldn't have been added magic. It would be confusion.<br/><br/>******SPOILERS (esp for series readers) ********* <br/><br/>Ron and Hermione weren't prefects - It would have taken extra time to explain/mention and then more time taken away from them trying to be there and help Harry. It was already adequately portrayed that Harry felt different and the two didn't recognized this and didn't know how to help him.<br/><br/>Harry is not Quidditch captain - this is not essential to the plot. It's just for fun.<br/><br/>St. Mungo's - I was disappointed, but I guess the point was just, look, Harry can ""see"" what Voldemort is doing. It was rushed and a bit poorly done, but not enough so that it justifies a whole scene, which would probably detract from the movie.<br/><br/>Fred and George's finale - yes, disppointing. I definitely wanted to see the marsh, but I guess they thought it was simpler this way. I think if anything should have been added it would be Umbridge asking teachers for help and the teachers refusing. ""They don't have the power to do so."" <br/><br/>Last Battle - Weird, I did expect the different rooms, but the point was the prophecy, Voldemort tricking Harry, the DA holding their own, and Sirius dying. I thought the subtlety that Sirius treated Harry as James was hard to convey; especially since watchers may not remember he's wanted/can't show his face in public/etc. The imp't point was that Sirius and Harry had a bond. And they played that.<br/><br/>I actually liked how Neville quietly confessed to Harry. It held the same poignancy and depth to Neville as in the book. I wish he could have fought Bellatrix, but oh well.<br/><br/>PLUS, I did enjoy the small things added in there for the super fans (like me). It was a compliment and gift to us, I thought.<br/><br/>While I'm rambling, just for the record, thank god Steve Kloves did not write. I thought his writing was wooden and horrendous and contrived. You can't just copy one liners from the book and paste them together. This one conveyed the personalities of the characters adequately for viewers and with slightly more subtlety for fans. And for those who liked POA. I thought that was a GREAT deviation from the plot that didn't even make sense. That's just me. Also, Gambon. Awful. <br/><br/>Watch the movie. It's not great, but they did a good job with it. It's hard."
"adinu79","8","0","0","14 July 2007"," It's impossible to create a real Harry Potter Movie
","Okay, some people will wonder why with the title of the comment comes a score of 8/10. It's simple. The movie, in its own rights has its merits. The problem lies with the way Rowling writes. She has a way of telling a story that grabs you, gets you involved in a very detailed and extensive plot, doesn't let you go till the end, and leaves you wanting more. It's impossible to capture that level of detail on film in a decent amount of running time.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read the books will feel really disappointed. The movie jumps from scene to scene, doesn't go into detail and leaves out a lot, but I think it's not possible to do a real Order of the Phoenix movie. Since J.K. Rowling increased the page count of her books, the writers of the movie had to leave a lot out in order to be able to tell the story from start to finish, even if it seems awfully rushed at times.<br/><br/>Now, the film has a lot of stunning visuals, fast-paced action and, in by itself, stands out as a great movie. The actors did great in portraying the characters we all know and love and the atmosphere was great. This is why, even if I'm disappointed by a lot of things, I'll give the movie an 8/10."

","This is an excellent movie with excellent action scenes, excellent visual effects and a simply marvelous cast.<br/><br/>The casting of Evanna Lynch, Helena Carter and Imelda Staunton for the roles of Luna , Bellatrix and Umbridge was a brilliant idea. They suited their roles very well. The mannerisms portrayed by Evanna Lynch were very much Luna. A certain level of maturity of the characters which was expected in this book can be clearly seen in the cast. The visual effect were very well done. The thestrals were portrayed very excellently. They have a certain eerie, yet peaceful air about them.<br/><br/>The main problem of the movie is that there are many differences in the plot of the movie and of the book, but if you put that apart and look at the movie on its own, its quite a piece of art. I also strongly feel Daniel Radcliffe has hogged the limelight a bit and not much screen time has been given to the other characters. But then this is the longest book and it has been compacted into the shortest movie, you are bound to loose the details.<br/><br/>But even though the plot has been modified, the storyline flows very smoothly and even non-readers can get quite a approximate grasp on the story. This is a feature which I have liked a lot about this series from the very beginning - reaching out to the non-reader.<br/><br/>My advice is :If you like Harry Potter, then go watch movie without fail and if you LOVE Harry Potter, watch it with some caution, for you will be in for some major disappointment as the plot is twisted beyond recognition.<br/><br/>I give : 8/10"

","When I read the fifth Harry Potter I absolutely loved it. I've read certain parts probably more than twenty times. The movie was nothing like the book at all. What really annoys me and my friends is that the fifth movie didn't even suggest that during Harry's fifth year he does have a little bit of fun and quite a few laughs. The movie leaves out extremely important things that need to be in it and I'm not sure how the sixth one is going to work at all. Hermione Granger, Ron Weasly and Draco Malfoy's parts were all pretty much non-existent. I'm almost sure that Fred and George have more lines than Ron and Hermione. Luna Lovegood is really the only thing that seems to come directly from the book, without much change. The actress, Evanna Lynch did a fantastic job and her voice has just the right amount of the ""dreaminess"" that the books describe it has. Not only that but the character herself is portrayed well and you feel quite a bit of sympathy for her. What I suggest you do is read the books then rent the movie if you're bored and find all the things they changed, left out or added to the movie."
"kevin_crighton","8","0","0","13 July 2007"," Potter movies getting better and better.
","I've not read any of the books. I wish to make that clear from the start of the review. The books didn't appeal to me when they first came out, but being a movie geek I have seen all the movies.<br/><br/>And for me, this is the best one yet.<br/><br/>The plot sees Harry Potter preparing the students for battle with Voldemort, while the Ministry of Magic refuses to believe he has returned.<br/><br/>The three main actors (Radcliffe, Grint, Watson) keep getting better with every movie. In this one Potter comes over as an angry teen, which isn't surprising given what he's been through so far, and Radcliffe does a good job. Grint is as funny at times as always but actually the best of the 3 is Watson. She has a bit more freedom here as Hermione, and some of her exchanges with Ron are quite funny.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are full of the usual cast, even if some have little to nothing to do, or say, but the best of them is Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge. The new Dark Arts teacher may look like a nice suburban housewife in her pink outfits, but behind the nice almost friendly outward appearance, is a truly unpleasant woman, and Staunton is good in the role.<br/><br/>The director David Yates does a good job as the latest director in the chair. He handles the action very impressively, but also handles the cast and story very well.<br/><br/>There are a couple of faults with the movie. The sub-plot over Harry's first kiss is dropped rather abruptly And I feel the scenes with Hagrid could have been cut. It is a long movie, and perhaps some brutal trimming in places would have helped. But overall these faults don't spoil the movie.<br/><br/>When the action kicks in in the climax of the movie, we get to see something that up till now, in the movies anyway, we've not seen. Some full blown magic in action. These scenes featuring Potter and his friends battling Voldemort's allies are very, very impressive, cumulating in a battle between between 2 full on wizards, that some have suggested rivals Yoda in action with a light-saber in Attack Of The Clones. Not sure I would go that far, but it is spectacular!!<br/><br/>I'm told that the books get darker as the series go on. If this standard of movie-making keeps going, then the movies will go from strength to strength."

","Once again we packed the theaters once again to watch our good friends Harry, Ron, and Hermione take on yet another year at Hogwarts. The overall performance and outcome of the movie was good, but not up to expectations...or at least mine.The acting was overall well played as Daniel Radcliffe again shows his skill. Emma Watson is growing up nicely, but she puts on a low scale performance and Rupirt in the middle. However, new comer Evanna Lynch shines in her light role as Luna Lovegood. Her ability to have that straight tone voice puts a good laugh in. Moving onto the movie, the movie to me seemed too slow, and only a few action sequences made me feel bored during parts. And EVEN with the intense action sequences seemed low key(not going to spoil). The movie, in my opinion, did not live up to the bar set by the Goblet and the Prisoner. The story line follows maybe about 90% of the book, but like before, it seemed slow. Emma, Daniel, and Rupirt still have that click about them and you can definitely tell there into the movie,maybe a bit too much? OK well off with the bad and to the good. Themovie IS good, don't get me wrong. The colorful cast puts on a show and makes you feel attached to everyone of them. And for bonus points, most if not all are still the same actors and actresses. The CGI images and transitions are steller and I was amazed. So... all in all I think this movie could of and should have been better. In my honest opinion I'd recommend Transformers before this. Transformers is a change of pace and I highly recommend the film. But it was good to see our three main stars in yet another evolution through puberty. Seven out of Ten"
"timber01","9","0","0","13 July 2007"," good effort adapting it from the book
","Overall the movie is enjoyable. People who have never read the books may be a touch confused because some things aren't fully explained but that really doesn't take away much of the enjoyment of this movie. There are a few things I think should have been explained a bit better or in a slightly different way as they do have some bearings on future books (and most likely movies) so it will be interesting to see how they handle the exclusion of them in the next couple of movies. The child actors have certainly come a long way from the first movie and its really evident in the scenes with Harry and his friends wanting to train and fight against Voldermort. Some of the scenes may be a tad scary for younger crowds but there aren't very many of those. I'd have to say that its probably the best of the 5 so far just in terms of story, acting and overall enjoyability."
"Astralan","9","0","0","13 July 2007"," A must see, but not a must praise.
","Harry Potter films traditionally need to have a thumbs up - even if they don't really deserve them. I say this simply because the movies are just chapters in the entirety of the Harry Potter franchise. So far, having seen 5 of the 7 books, one starts to see the light at the end of the tunnel, the actual culmination to the series. I can't say this is my favorite however; the whole movie lacked something. It seemed oddly disjointed and ""fuzzy"". From a book that portrayed Harry as being continuously angry throughout most of it, I didn't get that sense of anger. Sure, there were moments, but at most I felt the biting edge had been dumbed down at points where it almost left you behind emotionally detached (which you only realize when you are suddenly and temporarily drawn back into the world). Most of the problems I have with this film tend to lead back to the movies director, David Yates, who was a curious selection to begin with. He has no real experience, and in my opinion, is apparent in this films visualization.<br/><br/>This film felt more like an interim movie, but still necessary. In some ways this was a real turning point for Harry where he starts to take some personal investment in the future and his karma with Voldermort. We learn a little history about the formation of the Order and some insight into Padfoots (Sirius Black) background, but the main focus revolves around the creation of Dumbledores Army. This all happens when students, after experiencing a couple of exciting of practical defensive use of the dark arts turn into a nightmare under the tutelage of a micromanaging professor Dolores Umbridge (played by Imelda Staunton who was a genius in this role) who absolutely dominates the screen. As the weeks roll by at Hogwarts, an abundance of rules put a stranglehold on the institution to the point where no one wants to be there. Dumbledore ends up in the line of fire, faculty loose their jobs, and everyone in the school live in fear. When the needs of the students don't get met, a secret society blossoms (Dumbledores Army), where Harry is prevailed upon to teach them how to defend themselves against Death Eaters, Dementors and a possible confrontation with Voldermort himself. During the final battle this training comes in handy for the group. I will no longer go into the story, you need to see it.<br/><br/>Things that annoyed me was the lack of consistency with the previous movies. You get to see a new Dementor in this episode, and it doesn't look anything like the previous Dementors. What a pity. I loved the sinister graphical nature of the ones used in Prisoner of Azkaban (Directed by Alfonso Cuarón). Another thing was the cameo appearances of major characters at Hogwarts. There was a lot of dependency on the students to carry this film, and I feel that the support from the faculty and staff at the school just didn't seem to be there. Even Dumbledore seemed to take a back seat except for an amazing appearance in a fight scene near the end. In general, the CGI lacked luster. However, there were some good things to note as well: The magical world and the gritty nature of the real world seem to knit together in a way that appeared more congruous. Buildings were no longer portrayed in pristine condition, and during those moments when you were drawn in with the action of the film, you could find yourself squirting a few tears without knowing it.<br/><br/>These are all signs of a production that did not have a strong captain at the helm, in my opinion. With such an incredible cast, they were capable of so much more if the support was there. I am not encouraged by this, and am almost anxious that Mr. Yates is already signed on as director of the next very crucial book. We can always hope for a miracle... or better yet, Magic."

","Though the cast and setting remain unchanged since Alfonso Cuarón (The Prisoner of Azkaban) changed the path of the saga, the Harry Potter series has decidedly taken a turn for the worse as the director  David Yates - allowed the adults to take control of the movie. Although in fairness there were several points where the emotions of the young cast members were brought forward with spectacular effectiveness. Admittedly the acting seems worse than it really was due to the shoddy dialogue that often gave way to spectacular monologues that were cruelly juxtaposed with the short poorly written lines of the supporting cast. The entire 138 minutes of the film was climaxed with the last 15 minutes being the only worthwhile scenes. However, and I have to bring this to the fore as the character that is quite possibly the most important  other than Harry himself, is once again destroyed by the eccentric and overwhelming performance of Michael Gambon. Once again the director is to blame, for the fact that Dumbledore appears incredibly weak against the might of Lord Voldemort, and whose entire character and personality is modified. Voldemort I have to say was quite possibly  with the exception of Gary Oldman and Imelda Staunton  the best adult performer throughout, portrayed by Ralph Fiennes, Voldemort is given a purely evil face by this spectacular actor. Imelda Staunton does a brilliant job as Professor Umbridge, however her character was just a tinsy bit overdone, but that may well have been the intention. Helena Bonham Carter did a brilliant job of playing the deranged sociopath Bellatrix Lestrange, escaped to serve evil once more, and as she faces Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) who also did a fine job of portraying his character. Over all; the last 15 minutes of the film, the few good performances, the two flying scenes, coupled with the incredible musical score are the only parts of the film worth mentioning. Even and perhaps most disappointing was that sorry special effects that were used, with the giant Grawp looking like something out of Shrek. <br/><br/>Over all 5.5 popcorns is all I can give this film"

I really hate the way they made Goblet of Fire, they cut out so many things that a lot of HP fans thought were major aspects of the book. Phoenix leaves most of the small things in, the inner office memos (paper airplanes) that fly around the ministry of magic, Umbridges cats all over her walls on plates, Hagrid soaking his cuts from Grawp with steak. Even some of the lines the actors spoke were right out of the book, word for word. The only time I remember this happening in GOF is when Voldemort says ""kill the spare."" The fight at the Ministry is cut way down, but they do have to make cuts for time reasons. The only thing that really made me mad about Phoenix is when Sirius dies. I bawled like a baby when Cedric died, as much as GOF sucked, at least they got one scene right! LOL When Sirius died, you don't really feel anything, you know it's coming and they just didn't make it very dramatic in my opinion. And the veil isn't as described in the book. In case you haven't seen the movie, I won't say anymore. I really think this is the best movie by far.

It is always hard to translate from book to movie. The Harry Potter films are nothing to be ectatic about, the first two were at best mediocre. The third was perhaps the most boringst in climax but it made up for that with its style that proved to be more magical and medieval. The fourth was a big mess where it seems very depressive and the magic is somewhat gone. The fifth movie stands somewhere between, it is dark yes, but it has lost all feeling of magic. No Oscar worthy performances here. Everything is solid in this latest film, but it fails to be a phonomenon like Return of the King.

I can't say that for the fifth, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which uses much elementary wizardry and too little caring, except for Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) ambivalent kiss with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), in honor of diversity, I suppose.<br/><br/>The tone is downbeat as Harry tries to prepare the skeptics for the return of his arch enemy, Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). It may be that Harry is becoming more isolated because of his fame (newspapers pronounce him ""Harry Plotter""), distancing himself from his friends partly to shield them from collateral harm and partly from adolescent moodiness.<br/><br/>There is little fun of the kind the Quidditch match, missing here, always provided. Harry is even opposite and distant from Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) as he is consumed by his thoughts about the return of his enemy. Happily some joy comes in a makeshift classroom, where Harry experiences the gift of inspiring teaching, his own teaching, that is.<br/><br/>Harry's teaching antithesis is new villainess Dolores Umbridge (Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton), whose style is to dictate theory without experience, to demand learning without reason, and to eschew practical magic in general. Her pink outfit is almost a joy in such a grey world and a nicely ironic juxtaposition to her distinctly unfeminine behavior. The splash of color is memorable and dramatically spot on.<br/><br/>Some universals apply such as the value of going it on your own and learning well. The lesson about the value of experience joined with theory is a high point in an otherwise dark, action-filled, second-rate Potter production."

","In this latest installment of the Harry Potter series the screen writer failed to read the book prior to writing the screenplay. It looks as if he opted to read the Cliff's Notes version. What was on the screen was not equal to any of the previous movies. <br/><br/>Simply stated it was like a side order of fries, it lacked the BEEF!.<br/><br/>So much of the original story is missing; 1) The lack of the Prefects 2) Sirius' Mother's Portrait 3) Dobby the House Elf 4) Revolt of the Centaurs 5) St. Mungo's Hospital 6) Quiditch (Ron as Keeper and Harry being banned)<br/><br/>The magic with the series has always been how true the movies were to the book.

"TheLittleSongbird","8","2","5","12 May 2009"," An improvement on Goblet of Fire, but still not perfect!
","My most obvious flaw was that at the beginning, the actors looked as though they had been computerised, and I personally found that very distracting, with the scene with the dementors, it just seems strangely executed. Another flaw is that I am still not a huge fan of Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. He isn't a bad actor, but he doesn't quite fit the bill of Dumbledore, and there were some scenes with him that seemed rather strange. However, putting the flaws aside, we do have a lovely-looking film, with very good special effects, and excellent cinematography. As for the acting, I was impressed. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still likable, as is Robbie Coltrane. Alan Rickman is very suave and dour as Snape, but the acting honours do go to Imelda Staunton as Umbridge. I have read the book, and do prefer it, as there was a lot missed out in the film. My favourite scene was the Department of Mysteries scene, because some of that was creepy, with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix. No one could have done that better. All in all, a lovely looking film, with some flaws in the first half. 8/10 Bethany Cox."

","I have seen Order of the Phoenix twice, and it still blows me away. And yes, I have read all the books more than 3 times, and I still love the movie. David Yates did a fantastic job in choosing the scenes that were relevant to the plot, and although the movie went by relatively fast, it didn't just ""hop"" from one major event to another. I don't know why everyone is complaining about how long the movie is. In 138 minutes Yates managed to get the general idea and mood across while adding his own style. You always felt the plot was moving; there were no side stories to slow it down. Everything fit in place, everything worked. Plus the DVD will include deleted scenes, making non-fans of this movie hopefully happier.<br/><br/>It's only natural that a new director brings something different to the HP series. One surreal thing Yates brought across is right at the beginning. Harry walking through the grass, then sitting on the swing in the playground - who knew how closely linked the muggle and wizard world are? You also felt that Harry was very alone, isolated. I applaud Yates for visually and musically conveying that message for the first time in the HP series. The relationship between Sirius and Harry was genuine, natural, and well built, making Sirius's death scene powerful and sad.<br/><br/>The people I saw Order of the Phoenix with were complaining that there was ""not enough action."" Furthermore, they said the action scenes themselves were too short. I mean, COME ON. After Goblet of Fire, everyone thinks there has to be a lot of action and plot twists. If anyone has read the book, Order of the Phoenix is not action filled. It builds up the tension and frustration until the end at the Ministry of Magic. That's exactly what the movie did. There was the dementor fight at the beginning to get the film started with a bang, then you can literally feel the tension mount throughout the film. The battle at the Ministry is amazing. You have to look at what they did instead of what they didn't do to appreciate this battle. And what Yates did in that amount of time is brilliant and exciting. Everything explodes at the end, basically. Especially the Voldemort and Dumbledore duel and the possession scene, which really made my day at the theater.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe has proved himself a worthy actor in Order of the Phoenix (especially in the possession scene). Emma Watson and Rupert Grint actually seem like real people with feelings and a history behind them. Evanna Lynch was great as Luna. And as for all the adult actors (Gary Oldman, Jason Isaacs, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, to name a few), they did an amazing job. The music and special effects were top-notch. You can't really ask for more, can you?"
"liberalgems","10","2","5","11 August 2007"," By Far The Best Harry Potter Film!
","I'm NOT a Harry Potter fan! The previous films I found to be a combination of either annoying, dull, confusing, or in last Harry Potter film - very disturbing. But they finally got one right - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is thoroughly entertaining! It stands on its own. It has depth. And, you don't need to know a thing about the Harry Potter storyline in order to enjoy it! <br/><br/>After leaving the theater, it dawned on me that this story is truly from a European perspective. Anyone in Europe who has lived through War World 2 knows first hand what a powerful monster (dictator) can do to a society. It's not an abstraction, like it is for the vast majority of Americans. While Lord Voldemort is physically portrayed as a devil, what he really is is a very powerful war lord. One that would be only to happy to destroy any person, group of persons or institutions that stand in his way of absolute power. He exists for no other reason. He's not after wealth or glory, just raw power! <br/><br/>There's even a Neville Chamberlin character in this rather clever film. He and his allies are so blind to the obvious threat of war that they undermine everything they profess to hold dear. They are so arrogant and foolhardy they become caricatures of sheer stupidity.<br/><br/>There is so much good that can be extracted from this story - what it means to a leader, that wisdom can come from the most unlikely of places, the importance of planning ahead, there is strength in numbers, don't always believe what you read, improvise in a crisis, help can come when you least expect it!<br/><br/>I have high hopes for the final Harry Potter film. If Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is any indication of what is to come - I wait with great anticipation!"

"adouangchak","10","2","5","11 August 2007"," Excellent, best Harry Potter movie (many changes though)
","OK, I've only watched Order of the Phoenix once....but I know if I watch it again I'll still think its an excellent film. The Potter films have gotten more better with each movie, because the actors have developed a lot since the first movie (they were young at that time).<br/><br/>The reason I think this movie was the best is because of the way the actors perform very well. Also, I think the new actors/actresses in this film did very well. This movie had a lot of action and intense battles.<br/><br/>Even though the movie had lots of changes I feel it still stays true to the book. There are few scenes/characters not from the book (Nigel, and Ron saying ""Don't worry, I'll go easy on you"" to Hermione), and that wasn't important anyway. OK, so the movie was short, but there are lots of parts in the book not related to the plot.<br/><br/>Anyway, Excellent movie."
"simonparker1990","10","2","5","8 August 2007"," Potter Pots Gold
","Let me start this review off by saying that I am a Harry Potter fanatic, at sixteen years old I'm at the perfect age to truly appreciate the series. I started to reading the books when they first came out and I was instantly hooked, I think I was about six or seven when the original book came out, and now ten years on and now five of the seven movies have been made and the final (and in my eyes best) book has just been released. So in short I have grown up with this series, and in some respects the characters have grown up with me. However, in my opinion I always found Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest book of the series. Sure its still brilliant and has its moments, but after the high of Goblet of Fire I just felt Order was lacking something truly magic. It seemed overlong, a bit boring and just filling in the gaps until the final two books. I was expecting Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest movie as a result of this, however due to a great bit of cutting out the unnecessary bits of the book, Order of the Phoenix ends up being in my eyes the very best Potter movie to date! Now I also understand this will be a bit controversial with many people watching the movie, as I was sitting watching this I realised that if you are not a fan of the books or have not read the books I wasn't certain those people would truly appreciate the film. In some respects Order of the Phoenix is the most fan friendly of the series and doesn't rely on an overdose of CGI like the other movies. This one actually has a hell of a lot of talking going on, in fact up until the huge fight in the Ministry of Magic, there isn't a whole lot of action at all. What Phoenix does instead is develop interesting characters, show the plot to its full potential and deliver some great moments in the series.<br/><br/>So lets start off with the acting, now throughout the Potter series we have seen the lead three, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint develop before our eyes. In Philosopher's Stone the three were annoying. Emma Watson just about got away with it, Rupert Grint made me laugh a couple of times so I never really found him to be awful. But Daniel Radcliffe was eye gougingly awful. Since Philosopher's Stone, in each and every movie we've seen the leads get better and better, until now we see them improve yet again and actually become very good. Daniel Radcliffe impressed me most this time around, for once I saw the Harry Potter I wanted to see. You really got a sense of his inner struggle and his confused emotions. His character finally got the room to develop and we saw what Harry Potter should be like. Ron and Hermione are a bit sidelined and so I can't really comment too much on them. The adults this time get to shine as well. Imelda Staunton is the epiphany of evil as Dolores Umbridge, she's exactly as I visualised her in the book, and to be blunt she's a complete and utter cow. But she's a great cow and I can't wait to see her return in the future films. Gary Oldman finally got the opportunity to shine as Sirius Black, he was sadly wasted in Goblet of Fire, but here he gets some great moments with Harry. Alan Rickman gets some great scenes, but for fans of the books they are all waiting for that one moment in Half Blood Prince with Snape. The rest of the actors all do perfectly, special note must go to Evanna Lynch who is pitch perfect as Luna Lovegood.<br/><br/>As I have previously mentioned Order of the Phoenix lacks the huge set pieces that Goblet of Fire gave to us in the forms of the Triwizard trials. This time its pretty much about the school itself and how Umbridge is slowly taking over, its also a bit about rebellion in the form of Dumbledore's Army. The big set piece takes place at the end in the Ministry of Magic, and boy is it brilliant. For those who wanted to see wizards fight, they shall not be disappointed. The big final fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort will have fans sitting on the edge of their seats, that moment is huge. There are also moments of brilliance to be found in the Occlumency lessons which were very well done, the Weasley twins invasion of the OWL's, a tense Dementor attack and any moment where Umbridge wanders round being as nasty as hell.<br/><br/>Order of the Phoenix comes out as one of the best movies of the summer so far and also the best Potter movie to date. Its fast paced, got a great climax, a nice bit of drama to keep things going and also some very funny moments. I can't wait to see director David Yates interpretation of Half Blood Prince which is a much better book than Phoenix. If he keeps to how he did it here we should get a very dramatic and intense movie. Of course fans of Potter won't like this, but people who aren't fans of Potter generally just pretend to hate it more than they actually do so. For people who are fans of the books or movies they will lap this up intently and be sitting and waiting for the next two movies to arrive."
"didi-5","6","2","5","25 July 2007"," something is missing in this film but I can't decide what
","This is the first Harry Potter film I have seen, with no prior knowledge of the series or the books. Perhaps not the best place to start, but with the considerable recaps of what has gone before, 'The Order of the Phoenix' proved reasonably easy to follow.<br/><br/>What's missing is an emotional core. Daniel Radcliffe does not convince as Harry, a superwizard in waiting. He may be without his full powers but he does appear weak and unchallenging, with moments of bravado which do not sit well with the rest of his character. Having a child character carry a film is always going to be a problem - as it was for the Chronicles of Narnia as well - and in comparing Harry Potter with, say, Frodo Baggins, they are worlds apart.<br/><br/>The plot is in some ways derivative of the classic good vs evil battle - as seen in LOTR, Star Wars, and others. The flashbacks are overdone and the characterizations sometimes too much like a cartoon - particularly Imelda Staunton's Doleres Umbridge. And is that really Emma Thompson in thick jam-jar glasses? And Ralph Fiennes without a nose? The classy cast is perhaps the biggest draw for mature viewers of the Harry Potter series (we have Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, David Bradley, Robert Hardy, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, etc.) but with a few exceptions, they didn't really convince, only made me think of other roles they've done which were so much better.<br/><br/>Special effects - the class conjuring up rabbits and horses and the like was impressive, as were the final scenes of fight and destruction, and the twins' firework display. But the miniatures were sometimes obvious, which is a shame.<br/><br/>In pace, the film drags for long periods and gets bogged down in pseudo philosophy or silly jokes. The two strands don't really fit together."
"leffakopi","9","2","5","19 July 2007"," Back To The Basics and how!
","OK, there was a hint of suspicion in the air since some press-critics had been longing for supposedly lost magic, but hey! - the magic was there and what the most: this is again a 'Harry Potter -movie'. 'Goblet' is fine film but as I stated my opinion earlier on it, it lacked the atmosphere that comes through when each movie recollects the events during the whole of Harry's year. 'Till this day 'Azkaban' was on the highest place in my ranking, but 'Feeniks' went just ahead. One reason is that 'Goblet' portrayed not so much Harry's year but what happened around the Tournament and as you might have guessed, I like it when the whole year is shown. Other important reason is how well this time some earlier images, scenes and events were put into use regarding especially movie as an art form. Obviously I must wait the DVD and then firmly decide which one tops the other - 'Feeniks' or 'Azkaban' - but already the series have leaped back to where it belongs: marvelous fantasy-film production of the century and the longing for 'Prince' is ever more aroused. And I guess I have to line up for 'Hollows' Saturday morning so I may read how it ends - first time in English; have been waiting the translations so far.<br/><br/>Happy Potters, everybody!"
"Buddy-51","5","2","5","18 July 2007"," series showing signs of age
","In ""The Order of the Phoenix, "" the time-marking fifth installment of the lucrative ""Harry Potter"" series, the teen wizard and his fellow Hogwarts sidekicks are girding for battle against the recently returned villain, Lord Valdemort. They also have to wage a battle on a second front, against a sadistic dictatorial teacher named Dolores Umbridge, who has decided to remedy the ""lax"" standards at the academy and, in doing so, usurp Professor Dumbledor's position as headmaster of the school.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" has most of what any installment in the series needs to be a success: strong performances, dazzling special effects, and generous helpings of spells and magic. Yet, there seems to be something missing in this episode that prevents it from soaring into that world of enchantment familiar to us from those earlier films. For one thing, too many of the likable secondary characters - Ronald, Hermione, Hagrid etc. - take a back seat to Umbridge, who gets way more time on screen than the interest generated by the character warrants (even though Imelda Staunton is just fine in the role). Or perhaps it's that the movie lacks the tremendously exciting action set pieces that distinguished some of the earlier editions. And why, come to think of it, does the cinematography in a fantasy film have to be so drab, colorless and dreary? <br/><br/>It's admirable that both the filmmakers and the original author are willing to go darker and deeper in exploring the psyche of Harry now that he's become quite a bit older, but depth of theme really doesn't matter all that much if the magic of the series itself gets lost in the process (Michael Goldenberg has replaced Steve Kloves in the writing department and David Yates has taken over as director).<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe still makes for a tremendously appealing hero, but one senses that the perhaps inevitable fatigue factor may finally be settling into this series. I guess we'll know for sure once the final two installments are released."
"Danusha_Goska","4","2","5","15 July 2007"," Film: Underwhelming; Radcliffe: Cute; Fiennes: Evil; Women: Lose
","It amazes me that seven billion of the six billion people on the planet (slight exaggeration) are fervent Harry Potter fans.<br/><br/>What I may remember most from this movie is how shockingly cute I found Daniel Radcliffe. I was afraid I might be arrested upon exiting the theater. I haven't found a teenage boy that cute since I was nine years old.<br/><br/>The special effects were not, actually, all that special. It's all stuff we've seen before, especially the light saber tussle between Luke and Darth Vader ... sorry ... the staff fight between Gandalf and Saruman ... no, no, no. It was a magic wand battle between Dumbledore and Malfoy. And we've seen it before.<br/><br/>Give me Errol Flynn in a duel with Basil Rathbone: two men who knew how to handle an actual rapier, and who were engaged in a real activity that could have, with one false move, resulted in injury or death. Much more exciting. No special effects necessary.<br/><br/>I kept waiting to care about anything that was happening on screen. I kept waiting for the characters to stop rolling around like balls on a billiard table and actually connect. I kept waiting for the fantasy to serve as a thin veil over real life issues that I could relate to.<br/><br/>There were a couple of moments when it seemed that something like that might happen -- when something real might be said about Harry's struggle with Voldemort or with corrupt administrators, but at such moments Sirius or Snape would say something utterly simplistic like ""Concentrate!"" and I lost all hope that this movie would be anything like, say, the classic ""Wizard of Oz,"" my all time favorite wizard movie.<br/><br/>Rowlings' painfully obvious simple mindedness causes me to lose faith in humanity; that her fans fall for this -- all the ugly people, like Vernon Dursley, are bad. The good looking people, with their glossy hair and excellent teeth, are good.<br/><br/>Deep! How did Rowling ever gain that insight! Everything is black and white. Harry is relentlessly, boringly, good. Anyone who opposes him is bad (and probably fat and with bad teeth.) Again, a classic like ""Wizard of Oz"" gave us complicated villains; the Wicked Witch was merely avenging her sister. The bad guys here are so one dimensional.<br/><br/>And it's so narcissistic. Everything revolves around Harry. That can get boring.<br/><br/>Rowling's misogyny is all but a hammer that beats you over the head. Her latest ""I hate my own sex"" character / caricature is Umbridge, who telegraphs, with her pink clothing, her clicky heels, her love of cats -- oh, everything about her, basically, is that she is some misogynist's nightmare of an old maid.<br/><br/>I hope at some point Rowling gives us a black villain with an Afro who speaks in Jive, and an Oriental villain with long fingernails and buckteeth. Rowling handles stereotypes so very well.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes, I think, could not give a bad performance if he tried. He's Voldemort, the villain here, and he's very good, but the director has no idea what to do with him. Fiennes has got all that complexity, intelligence, and talent, you see, and this movie simply has no room for them."
"john-quel","9","2","5","14 July 2007"," Saving the series
","After the fourth film, I had decided I would skip the remainder and move on with my life. I liked what the films had done, liked the cast, and the production was always first rate, but the feeling on my part was ""so what?"" I found myself wishing Rawlings had stopped at five books. I no longer felt involved.<br/><br/>Happily I can say I was completely wrong. A few weeks ago, I began to hear buzz that this film was very good indeed. And the reviews on the well-known movie review site were remarkably positive, so I decided to give it try. I am sure glad I did. This films works, there is real danger and conflict, and the actors, old friends and new, rise to the occasion. It is a movie with children, not a children's movie. ""Teenage adults,"" I probably should say.<br/><br/>As always the world of HP is beautifully realized and the new characters are fully developed and fit in perfectly. In the case of the new head-mistress of the defense against the black arts, the monster is as loathsome as can be. There is still plenty of humor in the movie, but it is humor with a bite. This is probably the most ruthlessly satirical of the films (so far) and well-worth seeing more than once. People who complained about POTC:AWE may well complain about this one too as it gets fairly complex who is doing what to whom, but the pacing never flags and the ride is well-worth it.<br/><br/>Particularly interesting is newcomer Evanna Lynch as ""Luna Lovegood,"" a traumatized character who seems at first will just be played for cruel humor, but comes into her own as a fighter fully worthy of the Order of the Phoenix. This is a wonderful film debut and certainly offers promise of her going on to do great things.<br/><br/>I even found myself wishing it had been longer. This movie definitely saves the series and primes us for the final two films. Now, I can hardly wait to see them. Great job to all concerned, especially the director."

","How do you ""stupify"" an audience of avid canon Harry Potter fans? Force them into a theater, and make them sit through the film adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"".<br/><br/>If only I knew where to begin with this sickening adaptation of a truly remarkable book, this film will honestly make you feel the sublimated desire to stab the director in the eyes with a wand. The plot was drowned out by the void of bad acting, and the inability of the primary actors to properly portray the emotions and situations in the film. Two simple words can sum up this film: ""Rushed"" and ""choppy""; also it had more plot holes than swiss cheese.<br/><br/>The movie either dwelled on certain subjects too much, or not enough at all.<br/><br/>But through all the disappointment in the film, the final battle was a treat, although that (as well) was far too short for liking.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this film for anyone who is a serious follower of JK Rowling's canon work in the novels. But a recommendation for anyone who has yet to read the novel.<br/><br/>2/10. Action was at least halfway decent, but the ill-experienced editing and emphasis on plot (or lack of) completely ruined the film."
"Meuron","8","2","5","14 July 2007"," A great return in the series
","After a very bad 4th movie in my opinion, this 5th movie brought my interest back to Harry Potter. At most times very closely following to the book, the movie brings a great life back to the series. The acting improved tremendously, though of course could be improved more (Daniel acted SO much better this time around). The set I couldn't say anymore of, after the 3rd movie modified the set to such a scale it has kept it up perfectly. While the 4th movie cut out a lot of information and scenes, much of which fans wanted, this movie includes most of the key points and included the much awaited Voldemort vs Dumbledore fight in the Ministry. The special effects have been seemingly cranked up a notch since the last time.<br/><br/>I suggest this movie be watched by all Potter fans, especially those who did not like the 4th film."
"johnrconnolly","9","2","5","14 July 2007"," Simply wow.
","As an avid reader of the book series, i was worried about this one. The last 2 movies, while being the best in the series, they left out an alarming amount of detail, which was central to the plot. However the screenplay focuses on the important plots of the book. IE - The breakout of Azkaban, The DA, Umbridge and the Centaurs, Umbridge taking control, Harry's Trial, and the Return of Voldemort.<br/><br/>The acting is something that shocked me. Emma Watson, was simply brilliant in playing Hermionie. Daniel Radcliff has come a long way, and Rupert Grint always was good. Gambon captures the spirit of Dumbledore, Imelda Staunton is amazing as Umbridge, but the biggest praise, should be heaped on Evanna Lynch. She convinced me she WAS Luna lovegood, as opposed to playing her, and Alan rickman is Alan rickman. Enough Said.<br/><br/>The high points were - Fred and George leaving the School, dumbledore's escape, umbridge and the centaurs, Luna Lovegood, and Aurthur Weasley at the underground.<br/><br/>I had only 3 problems with the whole thing. 1. Sirius' Death seemed a little over dramatic, as well, normally people who were hit with the Killing Curse, died instantly. 2. Dumbledore VS Voldermort, was a little too effect happy. 3. Did Lupin actually say anything in the movie? 9/10"
"epona021","8","2","5","14 July 2007"," Best movie of the series so far!
","Having seen OOTP yesterday, I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Sure it has its flaws but overall was pretty good.<br/><br/>They omitted a lot of things in the movie as usual but this is understandable. I was disappointed with several scenes including the death of Sirius (it took about 5 seconds and people who aren't familiar with the HP series may not understand what's happening to him, before they realise, he's already gone) and the soundtrack could have been better.<br/><br/>On the other hand, one positive thing is the acting: Imelda Saunton as Umbridge is great, Evanna Lynch is cute as Luna Lovegood, Helena Bonham Carter also played well her part. I have mixed feelings about the performances of the trio though. While Daniel Radcliffe shines as Harry and express admirably well the feelings of his character, both Emma Watson and Rupert Grint seem to accomplish nothing. Emma Watson who was the best of the trio when the series started has nothing to do except making her worried face towards Harry, she does not overreact as much as she did in the fourth one but she's not the standout of the movie anymore (Daniel Radcliffe who I ironically thought to be the worst actor in the beginning has replaced her in that). Rupert Grint's part is even minor in this fifth instalment."
"jimmykebab","10","2","5","13 July 2007"," Amazing
","A new direction for the potter franchise with newcomer to the series David Yates. I wonder why he wasn't involved in all of them, as the previous four films have lacked solidity, direction, pacing, atmosphere and have just been generally disappointing and fairly poor in quality. Yates brings a much needed crunch to the series, with frenetic camera work, tight editing, special effects sequences that finally reflect the magic of the world being portrayed by the books and.....fantastic performances. Yes, I may have criticised Radcliffe in the past but his performance has finally broken out of the dulcet tones of the previous films. His performance matches the new pitch of intensity resonated by this outstanding film.<br/><br/>As the film begins, the grey clouds surround the WB sign, drifting forward and out of sight to reveal the Harry Potter logo set to what can only be described as a jaded rendition of the theme tune, which sets the tone immediately. Then the camera drops from the sky to a playground where Harry faces Dudley and his friends. What is instantly noticeable is that the camera work is much more well considered, effective and artistic than previous directors botched attempts at the franchise. What entails is an eerie contemplative build up that plunges right into a heart pounding chase. But its not that the cinematography is just good for the Potter films, it is fantastic beyond this and is some of the best work i have seen in recent films.<br/><br/>This is an overall much darker set of affairs than before, more serious, reflecting a desperate time for the wizarding world. Harry begins to become isolated in his mind's eye. He gets angry, he questions himself and others a great deal more. But this is also the time when he breaks from the mould and takes things into his own hands. A new addition to the fray is Luna Lovegood, providing an outlet for Harry's isolation. Drifting and flaky she adds a greater depth to the film. Umbridge is fleshed out superbly, a wicked callous performance laced with a buoyant sense of self indignation. Its good to see that Gary Oldman was in fact used on set this time, and delivers a fantastic and emotional performance. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also deliver great performances, but I always felt they were never as problematic as Radcliffe. And, as per usual The rest of the supporting adults slink in nicely from Rickman's world weary, cynical and snarling turn to Gambon's dutiful and wise performance.<br/><br/>The success of this film is that it ..feels like Harry Potter, this is how it Should be. It never at any point feels rushed as the others have, instead taking time to reflect on itself with serene moments of ambiance that bring a wonderful sense of calm to the darkening world around the characters. The sets are also fantastic, the Ministry of Magic reflecting a sense post communist fascist nihilism, with the Stalin-esquire portrayal of Fudge looming over the cold black walls. Which ultimately sets up the genuinely creepy panic stricken dash through the Hall of Prophecies and the blisteringly exciting set of wand duels that bring the film to a close. Another new set is Sirius' house which is brilliantly shabby, tucked away between two muggle houses. It is both inviting and chilling, especially effective are the room with the family tree and the bitter house elf kreature who's ramblings are a refreshing change from the way the cgi creations have been presented before.<br/><br/>Although worth mentioning is the shift in music as well, as it now is not just chirpy renditions of the theme tune, but fantastically suited to the events and help to shape a mood and bring much needed emotional impact.<br/><br/>Overall Potter mad or not, this is and absolutely amazing film, subtle in places, brash in others, never is boring, always boiling with an underlying intensity, with a wash of ambiance and reflection. It is perhaps ironic that possibly one of the weaker books turns out to be the best film. I cannot recommend it any more : ) , but thanks for finally getting it right."
"dewy-eyed","7","2","5","13 July 2007"," Not as intense as it should've been
","Here's my review. I just got back from the movie.<br/><br/>The characters were AWESOME. I loved Bellatrix, she was so wicked. I loved Luna Lovegood, she was hilarious. And I liked Tonks because she had a lot of spunk and Kingsley Shacklebolt's Jamaican accent is LOL. UMBRIDGE WAS JUST PURE EVIL! The actress who played her got Umbridge right... down to the irritating little coughs, sickly sweet smiles and her sadistic moments.<br/><br/>There was better character development this time round. And I could feel that Harry was more distanced from his friends, more isolated, despite their concern for him. Also some nice moments between Harry and Sirius. A lot of funny moments in the film - like when Hermione tells Grawp ""PUT ME DOWN,"" and then he gives her the bicycle handlebar - and more. The comical parts were well done.<br/><br/>Sad moments: -When Trelawney was fired ... she looked so pathetic that I was quite moved.<br/><br/>-Harry's Occlumency lesson. Snape said something about James Potter being arrogant and full of himself and I was immediately reminded of how Snape had been bullied as a teenager. I felt sorry for Snape actually.<br/><br/>-Harry's letter telling Sirius that he felt lonely in Hogwarts. Poor wittle Harry.<br/><br/>-Sirius's death. I know how some people complained that it was too abrupt but that was how it was like in the book and they got the tone right. The way all the background noise was muted when Harry was screaming Sirius's name was particularly effective. Quite heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>-Luna holding Harry's hand and telling her that she was sorry for Sirius's death. AAAW. (I'm not a shipper by the way). It was a nice touch. I liked how she and Harry had this sort of understanding that he didn't share with Hermione and Ron.<br/><br/>My main gripe was that they TOTALLY cut out the scene where Harry was being angry in Dumbledore's office and smashing things everywhere. If anything, that was the most emotional scene in the book. I didn't even feel sad when Sirius died (because it was so abrupt, both in the movie and book) but I cried when I read that scene because I could feel Harry's built up rage, bitterness and helplessness. That was, really, the moment of catharsis, but in the movie it was all squeezed into a climatic flashback sequence where Harry has an internal battle with Voldemort, who is trying to possess his body. Sorry but that didn't really work for me. It was too rushed, too compressed. I'm not saying that was bad - in fact it was quite good - but it doesn't match up to the emotional intensity of the office scene in the book.<br/><br/>I'm really fine with it when they cut back on the irrelevant stuff from the book, like funny details, or Quidditch matches, or other characters's screen time (because, really, there are far too many characters) but because the fans have to be pleased with this and that, the essence of the story is lost. The film isn't as intense as it should be. Or could be. Come to think of it, I've never really gotten very emotionally involved in a Harry Potter movie before.<br/><br/>I always think that a film adaptation should be a different interpretation of the book. It's an adaptation, it's supposed to be different! And because of time constraints everything HAS to be cut down to it's essence. So the most important things are story, characters and pacing. Focus less on pleasing obsessive book fans! OK but overall this was way better than Goblet of Fire. I only hope the next two movies will be taken into a new direction - a different one from all the films so far."

","Well, i totally agree with the review. It was amazing! The characters were exactly how i imagined them. The film was brilliant. I am now waiting for the book. My only problem with a character in the film was Grawp, but... this tiny flaw can be overlooked, (Hehe). What a line by Sirius, ""Don't touch my Godson"". And what about the duels at the end with the order of the Phoenix, now you have to admit that that was total and utter class. The way they fought each other was great. And what about the HArry and Sirius, vs Malfor and Nott duel. Unbelievable. I also thought that Tonks was brilliant, she was exactly hoe i imagined her. Yeah, it may not be exactly like the book, but it is as close as it can be.<br/><br/>Harry"
"gunnerthekiwi","9","2","5","12 July 2007"," Faithful Adaptation Keeps a Potterhead Spellbound
","(This review is written from the point of view of a Potter obsessive. You have been warned.) After months of anxious anticipation in which any screen-shot, trailer or other revelation was eagerly lapped up, here it was. The real deal. All around the world the avid Potterheads, (myself included) the casual fans and the people without a clue milled into cinemas to witness the latest installment in the Harry Potter saga. The film amassed a gigantic $44.8 million on its first full day at the Box Office, so Warner Brothers will be ecstatic, but what about the film itself? Is it any good? The answer is a resounding ""YES!"" <br/><br/>Firstly the cast. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson (who play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively) deliver a much more powerful and believable this time round and Grint in particular is (to steal a quote from the character he plays) ""bloody brilliant!"" He provides the film with some fantastic humour and even demonstrates some (subtle) chemistry with Watson.<br/><br/>There are some new additions to the cast as well. Imelda Staunton is outstanding as Dolores Umbridge, the Ministry of Magic representative at Hogwarts. Umbridge slowly establishes a dictator-like role at the school and imposes a great number of ridiculous new rules on the students.<br/><br/>Another new character is Luna Lovegood, the mysterious and rather odd girl with a tragic past who is played by (avid Potter fan) Evanna Lynch is truly excellent and somehow leaves you feeling both happy and sad all at once.<br/><br/>In fact almost the whole cast (with the exception of Kathryn Hunter as Harry's batty old neighbour Mrs Figg) performs exceptionally well.<br/><br/>The special effects are (as usual) top-notch and certainly do the much-loved Fred and George leaving scene justice.<br/><br/>In contrast to what a lot of people are saying I thought that the directing and editing was great. The recurring theme of the ""Daily Prophet"" newspaper looked stunning and the story seemed to flow nicely.<br/><br/>But lastly (and perhaps most importantly) the screenplay. The unsung hero of this film is screenwriter Michael Goldenburg. He manage to compress a 736 page monster of a book into just 138 minutes and managed to do so without undermining the story that we have come to know and love. Sure there are quite a number of cuts (most prominently the St Mungo's Hospital scene, the much shortened Department of Mysteries scene and Quidditch among others) but it doesn't seem to damage the storyline much at all and if you want amazing detail read the book.<br/><br/>So in summary I loved this film. It exceeded my expectations and as far as I'm concerned this is easily the best movie in the series so far.<br/><br/>Magic!"
"sebastian-ortiz","8","2","5","11 July 2007"," nice one...
","i will have to agree with everybody, the film is actually good and I bow to the actors that so well performed. at last we have some justice with dumbledore's character.<br/><br/>i have to say though... i understood from the beginning it would be a book very difficult to adapt due to it's length, but the only thing that i expected well done was the final part of the book, that is from the ministry of magic arrival on forwards.<br/><br/>even though i liked the finale, there was so much excitement trimmed of... like the statues for instance...<br/><br/>anyway... that really was the only thing that bothered me...<br/><br/>good movie, great performance."
"BJHunnicut","8","2","5","11 July 2007"," Another Great Potter Adaptation (minor spoilers)
","I will admit, as a fan of the books, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not my favorite book. I enjoy the book and like it as I do all of them, but the story of the novel I found a little murky for 870 pages. Anyway, I think screenwriter Michael Goldenberg did a good job adapting this monster novel into a workable film, although the film is a bit short and I would've liked a little more story to refine the destination of the film. But again, Goldenberg and his predecessor and successor Steven Kloves do not get enough credit for the tough job they have. The acting was outstanding, having raised yet another notch. Radcliffe is brilliant in showing the angry and emotionally depressed Harry as he is portrayed in the novel. Grint and Watson are once again outstanding as Ron and Hermione respectively, bringing a deeper emotional impact to the relationship of the trio. Imelda Staunton is amazing as the maniacally megalomaniac Dolores Umbridge, and deserves credit for her spot on portrayal of Umbridge from the novels. The adult cast was once again solid with particular praise going the Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is still a bit more aggressive than the novel Dumbledore, but is still portrayed well. Director David Yates does an outstanding job bringing out the emotions of the students in particular, especially with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The Department of Mysteries Battle is an outstanding scene of action, emotion, and tension, well directed by Yates. It may be the best action sequence in the films, only to the Third Task and Graveyard Battle from Goblet of Fire. As for visuals, outstanding once more, from the thestrals, to the sets of the Ministry of Magic, to Grawp. Overall, the film was better than I expected, especially with its short running time, and is yet another great adaptation of my favorite book series. This definitely the darkest film, and many of complained of the lack of magical pizazz from the first two films. Well frankly, the movies are accurately portraying the dark tonal shifts of the novels, and the excess fluff has been, thankfully in my opinion, left behind, as they have been done so in the novels. Again, Order of the Phoenix is one of two warm up novels, the other being Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, to the sure to epic Deathly Hallows. Am I Pottered out? Far from it, I only ask movie goers to be patient with these films, as they are necessary to build up to the exciting final installment."
"tankeredbell","9","2","5","11 July 2007"," Impressive since the book was kind of boring
","Don't get me wrong I love the series but the 5th book was almost a bore to read till the end. But it was because it's one of those filler books that does most of the explaining. The film though, wow. Amazing cinematography. Like from start to finish it was so beautiful to watch, even the simplest of scenes were shot brilliantly. Yes there are a few changes in the story but nothing that changes the effect. However, for those that read the book and cried at the end (knowing what I mean) you'll cry in this just as well. Radcliffe REALLY nailed the part in this one because this is THE book where Harry is more depressed than ever seen before. It was dark and eerie and he has never been so interesting to watch. His expressions and body language were perfect. I was very impressed with the movie and would definitely recommend it to anyone who may not even be a fan. The only criticism I have is that for some of the more important content of the book... well it wasn't as welll explained, for instance the prophecy was NOT well explained in the movie and in order to understand the story I thought that was kind of a let down. Great though!"
"nahor88","9","2","5","11 July 2007"," An overall improvement!
","Although the the general approach of this movie is quite similar to the others, like getting the story out in a short a time as possible, the outcome is quite different. The problem with the others is that it was very obvious where things had been removed, at least for fans of the books. But while watching this installment of the series, the plot sucks you in so much that you're hardly thinking about that. The direction was far better than the previous ones, a credit to Yates, who fully deserves to take a crack at the next movie. However, the greatest improvement is that of the acting! Finally all the main actors have fully embraced their roles, making you believe that they are none other than the actual characters themselves. In addition, the special effects were superb and the choreography of the fight scenes well mastered. While you may walk out of the theater, thinking about what things may have been left out, you'll have no such thoughts during the movie itself!"

","This is movie is going to blow everything else out of the water this summer. I loved this movie, the 2+ hours went by quickly as the movie keep a quick pace,at no point did I feel as if they were just dragging the movie out. The Order of the Phoenix, is a movie that all will enjoy. I think even people who haven't seen the previous, four movies will be able to enjoy this one. I can't wait until the next one hit the screens. J.K.R. is a great writer, as we progress in her stories they seam to get better and better and when they conclude I think that we will be able to say that this has been among the very best series of books and movies ever. Go out and see this movie as soon as you can, and if you haven't seen the last four go out and rent them and then go and see the Order of the Phoenix."
"tarkanking","9","2","5","11 July 2007"," Brilliant - Near Perfect Adaptation!!!
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is currently my favorite book in the series. Having watched the film, I have to say, in my opinion the adaptation is near perfect. I was surprised that the director condensed such a long book into such a short movie. I feared the movie would be fast-paced like the opening scenes of Goblet of Fire. Order of the Phoenix is far from that, moving at an almost slow pace. The director successfully translated the dark tone of the books into film. He director artistically and masterfully crafts the film, rather than simply regurgitating the book as the first two films did. The movie feels almost claustrophobic, squeezing viewers into the tiny hallways of Grimmauld Place and presenting them with a Great Hall that seems not nearly as vast as in the first film. As the film differed from the book, I felt that almost all of the changes were justified and made for a better telling of the film on the screen. Overall, I was particularly impressed by the first and last scenes of the film. I recommend this film to fans of the books, and to older fans of the movies. I feel that small children may not enjoy this movie as much, since much of the light hearted hocus-pocus is absent from this dark installment."
"xxblubaby22xx","8","2","5","11 July 2007"," Review: A bit long, but please read - You'll find it useful!
","For starters, this movie blew me away because it was unlike any other Harry Potter film ever created. It was taken to a completely new (and impressive) level of darkness, drama, suspense, and even the acting didn't seem so ""rehearsed"" but indeed had a smooth flow throughout the entire script. And there's another point, the film was not based on dialogue, but more so on flashy camera angles which range from pictures and waves coming from Harry's mind and also used to narrate the story without using words. (Which cuts what I thought would be a potential extra HOUR of film) The epic saga of Harry Potter picks up right where it left off at Goblet of Fire, immediately following Cedric Diggory's death, and the return of Lord Voldemort. Miserable at Privet Drive, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) finds himself in a tight spot when he misuses underage magic privileges in front of evil cousin Dudley in their muggle hometown against of a pair of rogue dementors. He then finds himself facing an inquiry at the hands of Minister of Magic, Fudge whose main issue with Harry and his so-called ""act of self-defense"" is more rooted to the fact that he refuses to believe that Lord Voldemort is back. He puts his power as Minister to good use to have the ""Daily Prophet"" publish stories that DENY DENY DENY the return of Lord Voldemort and of course make Harry and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) out to be crack-pots.<br/><br/>A secret society, The Order of the Phoenix including main characters like Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), Arthur Weasley, Aurors: Mad-Eye Moody, Tonks, Kingsley, and many others have started to conduct meetings once again to come up with a plan of action against Voldemort's uprise. Although not seen or mentioned much in the film, it can be assumed that the Order's meetings continue and it is also assumed that morale is low.<br/><br/>Back at Hogwarts, the morale here is also less than satisfactory. Many of Harry's classmates are readers of The Daily Prophet and begin to believe the lies it beholds. Harry finds himself, even with best friends Ron and Hermione (played by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, respectively) beside him, completely alone. He's changing and he doesn't know why, or has completely understood his connection with Voldemort.<br/><br/>Dolores Umbridge (played masterfully by Imelda Staunton) is sent by the Ministry to keep an eye on Hogwarts, and ends up being quite the nightmare. As she first names herself High Inquisitor she begins to issue rules that even Dumbledore cannot override, and eventually takes over the school. The performance given by Staunton is superb and truly grasps that deliciously evil disciplinary figure masked by a too-perky, too-pink nightmare.<br/><br/>The film introduces some new characters and revives older ones that we deemed ""unimportant"" up until now. Examples include Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), that we now find is someone with a purpose and a past that even Harry can relate to. Also, Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) steps up to the plate as a powerful witch who I would not want to get in a fist fight with. New to the long list of Hogwarts students is Luna Lovegood (perfectly captured by the real-life eccentric Evanna Lynch) who proves herself to be a good friend to Harry because of their similarities. She is of course, spacey, airy, and keeps on losing her shoes to forces not even I can explain, but is useful and provides Harry with SOMEONE he can actually relate to. Together along with the Weasley twins, and other students, they form whats called: Dumbledore's Army where Harry teaches his fellow students important spells that can defend them against dark forces, to Umbridge's utmost dismay.<br/><br/>And whilst all this is going on, Harry still manages to squeeze in his very first kiss! - not the most exciting moment of the film in my opinion. As an avid reader, I could see how this movie was a good ""sum-up"" of the fifth book. However, it did seem to jump around and while desperately trying to keep its traditional fluffy and fun moments of magic and excitement, I wondered why they were even there in the first place when the feel of this installment is the opposite: dark and gloomy. Impressive performances combined with dramatic lighting and music really does make a good film in this case. There is a fine line between the first four ""kid-films"" and this new adult drama that is sweeping over the silver screen. David Yates's vision for in my own terms: ""a real movie"" has clearly been defined with this film. Let the magic continue as the 6th installment begins production of September this year. I enjoyed this, but go ahead, get on your broomstick and fly your way over to your nearest theatre, sit in on a meeting with the Order of the Phoenix, and decide for yourself!"
"buffy_obsessed","9","2","5","11 July 2007"," Best Movie By Far
","****SOME SPOILERS***** I know, I know. They left out St. Mungo's, quidditch, the swamp, and Lily. However, I think this was the best movie by far. They got all the main points of the book, and many of the lines were actually in the book. It wouldn't have killed them to make it 40 minutes longer and add more things, but all in all it was a great book adaptation. Most of the characters weren't too important, which was irksome, but they were in it enough for them to count.<br/><br/>The only real disappointment I had was how short Snape's memory was, and I was looking forward to that scene. (Snape is one of my favourite characters along with Draco and Lucius).<br/><br/>However, compared to the 3rd and 4th movies, this film was a lot more on target and had a lot more magic and excitement. The 1st and 2nd movies were on target, but boring at some parts.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I think this movie did the book justice. And that means a lot coming from me, as OotP is my second favourite book. (Next to HBP)"
"ckblink182","9","2","5","11 July 2007"," The first Harry Potter movie to stand on its own
","I've always loved the Harry Potter books, but I'd never found the movies more that adequate. I liked them because I wanted so badly to like them. Indeed, with the exception of the Prisoner of Azkaban, I'd say all the movies have so far been rather disappointing (if I'm being perfectly honest with myself).<br/><br/>As far as Order of the Phoenix goes, I must say I didn't know what to expect. I found the book a little long and too dark, and after the rather decidedly disappointing fourth film (the book was just sooooo much better), I was understandably weary. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, however, blew me away.<br/><br/>It's the first Potter movie I liked simply because it was a great film. Had I never read the books, I still would have loved the film. The action was unapologetically awesome and the film remarkably grown up. It wasn't the kid in me that liked the film, it was both the kid and the adult.<br/><br/>From the very first scene you find yourself pulled into an intense and action packed epic tale full of love, betrayal, fear, war, and all that other epic sounding stuff. The battle in the Ministry of Magic is one of the great film battles of all time. Dumbledore's Army provides some of the most humorous and touching moments of the film. Luna Lovegood is almost exactly as I imagined her int he books. And Harry Potter's emotional roller coaster is perhaps the first truly believable emotion I've seen in a Potter film.<br/><br/>Sure there were a few rough points--bits of cheesy dialog and moments of rather overblown intensity where there ought not to be--and book lovers will surely point out plenty of scenes that were changed or left out completely. I, however, have read the book several times myself and I couldn't think of anything that was really missing.<br/><br/>The bottom line--I enjoyed this film far more than I expected to. Indeed, I haven't seen such an enjoyable film in quite a while (and that's saying something as I've just discovered bit torrents and have been on a downloading binge). More importantly, however, I'm looking forward to seeing this film again . . . and again . . . and again. And that's something I've never said about a Potter film before."
"mattza12","10","2","5","11 July 2007"," A shining example of what Harry Potter movies should be.
","David Yates has created a masterpiece, and leaves me satisfied that the Harry Potter franchise has another great movie. Daniel Radcliffe's acting was so magnificent, as well as Rupert and Emma. People have complained that the movie was too short, I, however, disagree. Sure, it was a bit rushed at some points, and I have read the book, and feel very satisfied with what I have viewed. Even though it may be the shortest movie, It felt a bit longer. I didn't once get up to go to the bathroom, although I really needed too. What really got me, was Imelda Staunton and Evana Lynch's acting. Imelda couldn't have pulled of Umbridges character better. She pulls off the annoying little ""Hem Hem"", and her laughs, and, well, she makes me want to shoot her, in a good way. Evana totally pulled off Luna Lovegood, no one could have done it better. She seemed so warped and wacky, yet calm and relaxed. But, my only problem is that almost a bit too much is cut from the book, and how the story revolved too much about umbridge. But, it dosen't matter, this movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a while, and is the best of the series. However, I felt Sirrius's death scene could have been better, and they could describe more about the veil, but the climax was amazing. The movie really sucks you in. And of course, there are those moments for kids, those little jokes put it, I admit to laughing at a few of them, they were actually pretty funny, like how Filch waits outside of the DA, i laughed pretty good. I Definitely recommend this movie, to anyone. However, your viewing experience would be a lot better if you have seen the previous movies, but, most people already have. Put into small words: Watch this movie, Now."
"caskater47","6","2","5","11 July 2007"," Good film at best, but strays from the pack
","When the first film came out I was awed, like many others, at the amazing fantasy world that is Harry Potter. I soon after began reading the series' books with much enjoyment. I have approached each movie with excitement and an understanding that it is often impossible to portray every detail from such long and complex literary works as these. As such I find myself torn with this fifth installment of the on-screen Harry Potter series. I want to love this film but I cannot overlook its very obvious flaws.<br/><br/>Overall, Order of the Phoenix is a good and entertaining film on its own. It has a straight forward plot line that is fairly easy to follow but the lack of the more intricate subplots leaves the characters feeling flat. This is by no means a bad film but is probably the weakest of the Harry Potter series so far.<br/><br/>Having spent this past weekend watching all previous four films in preparation for the big premiere last night I will say that Order of the Phoenix is a good film at best but it strays pretty far from the rest of the pack. Each director in the series has added their own touch to the series but all have respectfully built upon the previous directors' choices while doing so. Yates clearly did not want to be compared to the former directors of the series as he has completely changed the cinematic style of Harry Potter right down to the way spells fizzle and spark through the air. Dementors hardly resemble the incredibly creepy and mysterious creatures that made them so scary in the previous film. The Petronus Charm has been dumbed down to nothing more than a spark of lightning and riding a broom stick has lost all of the finesse that made watching Harry zip around Hogwarts exciting. The lighting and cinematography of the film, while dark, is devoid of all artistic style that has defined all four previous movies. If I hadn't waited 3 hours in the theater and spent $11 on my ticket I would have assumed I was at home watching the film on TV. Yates simply does not have the artistic style that sets a film director apart from a television director. Yates instead focuses the film entirely on plot and does a fair job weeding through the wealth of literary work provided by Rowling to depict only the necessary information. Unfortunately that is all Yates does, depict the necessary information needed so the film misses a lot of the quips and quarrels from the subplots in the book that give each character multi-dimensional-ism. Instead the characters look flat and uninteresting with the exception of Luna Lovegood. A few of the subplots have been demoted to a mere brief appearance with little to no dialog which leaves the viewer with many more questions than answers. Other very important subplots have been completely left out of the film but their importance can certainly be debated.<br/><br/>So now that the bad has been explained lets look at the good because despite the mistakes there is plenty of good in this film. The acting is all top notch; most notably by Imelda Staunton and Evanna Lynch. Staunton brings to life Dolores Umbridge with the very same feeling of loathing one feels when reading the book. Lynch, who plays Luna Lovegood is every bit as strange and awkward that makes her character so lovable and entertaining in the book. The Ministry of Magic and Department of Mysteries come across as an enchanting place of business for the wizarding community. Clearly this is where Yates chose to focus the majority of his attention. The final act comes across very strong with plenty of excitement, spells zipping and zapping around the Department of Mystery with Death Eaters and members of the Order apparating from place to place in the heat of battle. It's here that the true magic of Harry Potter starts to come out but is simply too late in the film."
"filmfan92","10","2","5","11 July 2007"," 'Phoenix' Casts Its Spell
","SYNOPSIS: Harry Potter and co. discover The Order of the Phoenix, a secret society bent on stopping the Dark Lord's reign of terror. Meanwhile, the students of Hogwarts grapple with an oppressive new female teacher, Dolores Umbridge. PROS: This is quite simply the film of the summer. Director David Yates fits this series like a glove. He pulls no punches when delivering the darker aspects of the story, but makes sure to add plenty of humor and heart as well. The cast is uniformly excellent as usual. Old hands like Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are note-perfect in their roles, while newcomers like Evanna Lynch and Helena Bonham Carter deliver memorable performances as well. Deserving special mention is Imelda Staunton, who plays Dolores Umbridge, a perky professor with dark political motivations. In a film with a cast for the ages, she steals the show. The behind the scenes crew isn't slacking off either-cinematography, music, and special effects are all leaps and bounds ahead of the previous Potter films. And screenwriter Michael Goldenberg trims the fat of the 870-page book, leaving us with a lean, mean, emotional roller-coaster of a film. CONS: No huge qualms. Sure, some fan favorites (Dobby) are dropped, but when you have a book this big, who cares. My only really (very small) problem with the film is that the Mr. Weasley subplot could have used a bit more time. Overall, the best of all five Potter flicks, and a fantasy film on par with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. David Yates is the best thing ever to happen to the HP series. Bravo."
"Scribbler17","10","2","5","11 July 2007"," Best. Movie. Yet.
","Amazing, amazing, amazing. That is all I can say. It was the best movie of the lot. I find that the Potter movies just keep improving each film. Definitely this and Goblet of fire were the best. The new characters were perfect. Luna, Umbridge, Bellatrix were perfect. Dan, Emma, and Rupert have definitely grown into better actors. Their performance in this movie is superb. Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite book in the series, but I loved this. I was just disappointed with one thing. I was really looking forward to the pensieve scene where Harry views Snape's worst memory. It is one of my favorite scenes in the entire book series. I was highly let down when I watched the scene in the movie. It was too brief and Lily wasn't even there. Also, the scene after Harry and Cho kiss was too odd, I wish they had cut that out. Hermione bursting into laughter made me raise my eyebrows. But other than that, it was EXCELLENT. Fred and George's departure had me cheering. The last scenes in the Department of Mysteries made me cry due to how incredible they were. I'd give it a 10 if they had portrayed the pensieve scene better, but it was the greatest movie I've seen all summer. I congratulate the cast and crew. I laughed, I cried, I truly smiled. You had me clapping at the end."

","First of all, let me make something clear. My opinion of this movie is not that it was perfect, nor is it that it was absolutely dreadful. I should add that anyone with one of those opinions should really think the movie through, because I find it hard to believe it could be so extreme. <br/><br/>My personal opinion: not true to the book, but a very good adaptation. That probably doesn't make a lot of sense to many people. How can a film be far from the book but still be a nice adaptation of it? I'll attempt to explain. <br/><br/>First- not true to the book. This one is quite obvious. There were many things cut, chopped down, and changed from the book. Whole characters were missing, never to be mentioned. There were characters we know of that appeared but said nothing. Events were in a different order than in the book to suit the pace of the movie. Overall, this movie was probably the least true (yes, I think less than GoF). It's quite understandable, considering they had to cram an 870-page book, full of detail and events, into a movie that would be a suitable length for children (I do believe that's why the WB won't make these movies at 3 hours). But still, I do believe they could have kept some more things without adding too much length to the story. Overall the movie wasn't really anything like the book. It had many of the same events, but they were all in different order, and many things were changed completely without reason (Ron, Hermione, etc., using Skiving Snackboxes to fight off the Inquisitorial Squad? What?). This movie was far from the book. Quite far indeed. <br/><br/>But when you really think about it OotP wasn't about Voldemort. It wasn't about the giant battle in the ministry. It wasn't even really about the Order. <br/><br/>It was all about the characters. <br/><br/>And this is where the movie goes from being untrue to being a great adaptation. The movie kept the same feel of character development, growth, and relationships that the book had. We got to see Harry struggle with himself, with the anger he was feeling and the idea of taking charge of his own like, the same way we did in the book. We got to see Ron and Hermione once again prove their undying loyalty to their best friend. We got to see Neville grow from a clumsy boy with no magical talent to a boy with a strong determination to learn. We finally got to see Ginny as a very powerful young girl, and it was made obvious to the audience that she felt something for Harry. Seamus shuts Harry down in front of everyone but gives a sincere apology later, just as he did in the book. Snape's worst memory may have been cut, but nothing was missing- we saw him an upset boy, saw him teased, and most of all saw James picking on him without provocation. We grew to love Sirius in the short time we saw him and really understood how much he cared for Harry. In a few lines, Helena Bonham Carter captured Bellatrix's evil and insanity perfectly. Umbridge and Luna were the highlights of the film in terms of characters- both were beautifully acted. Who didn't want to strangle Umbridge as she sipped tea while the DA carved into their hands? Who didn't burst into laughter when Luna gazed into space and mentioned her love of pudding? <br/><br/>In the sense of characters, which after all was what the story was about, this movie was quite perfect. And while it sucked to see the DoM cut down so much or Dumbledore's escape half as intense as in the book, the idea of the book still came across easily. I repeat- the real story in OotP is the characters and how the grow and interact. This was captured perfectly in the movie. <br/><br/>Here are a few random things that really made this movie for me. <br/><br/>1. Even though many characters were cut, they found a way to work through it without damaging any other character. 2. Many of the changes were able to add to character development (Neville finding the RoR, Luna explaining the Thestrals, etc.) 3. There were MANY lines STRAIGHT FROM THE BOOK, which was fantastic for huge fans! Even without Phineas Nigellus we got the, ""Dumbledore has style,"" line, and they kept Hermione telling Ron, ""Just because YOU have the emotional range of a teaspoon"" 4. The acting was terrific. Everyone was able to portray their character correctly, no matter how small a role. 5. The use of footage from previous films was very interesting and well-done. I also liked the effects of the Order/Death Eaters and Voldemort/Dumbledore duels. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is my favorite, very close to PoA. No, it isn't exactly the same as the book, but when you think about itwhy would you want that? Jo puts in enough detail for you to visualize as you read, for you to make your own little movie. It would be rather boring to have a cookie-cutter film. These differences from the books keep the films interesting. You can take something apart and rebuild it in a different way, but in the end it will still be the same thing. That was the case with this movie. It may have been far from the book, but it gave the same results- we saw character development, love, loss, and a determination to fight."
"wishingnowhere","9","2","5","11 July 2007"," The best one, maybe
","Reasons why this movie was excellent 1. It contains quotes from the books, especially Dumbledore. 2. They cut items that needed to be cut. 3. The length of the movie was perfect. 4. The graphics were absolutely amazing. 5. Casting was wonderful 6. It did stay very true to the book, only changing some scenes. 7. They finally found a director. 8. They truly brought out the villain. Reasons you may not want to see this movie: 1. Some editing transitions were choppy. 2. Your scene from the book may have not been added. 3. Way to dark for you.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was definitely my favorite. I have the books, and the fifth is my favorite book. Like every movie from book, it brings the imagination of the writers, the producers, and the editors. This movie is what I imagined from the book. They a very good job on it."
"FrankMize","5","2","5","11 July 2007"," OK movie, but lacked ""the magic""
","As Warner is under contract with J. K. Rowling, they are forced to some degree to stay with the story line, so those who have not read the books have no real frame of reference, though it is interesting to read their reviews. I believe this would be a very difficult movie to enjoy without reading the books, as there is no other way to fill in the gaps. There was no other way to understand most of the motivations, as they are not explained. As I am a big fan of the books, the conclusions that I drew from the movie were that Warner's primary decision on what part of the story stayed and what was cut was based on costs. Much of the ""magic"" was cut, and way too much time was spent just getting to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>I, as many others, believe Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is way out of character, but am afraid we are stuck with him through the next movie. If he has been directed in this manner, my apologies to Lord Gambon. He has absolutely no warmth. Dumbledore represents the leader of the powers of good, and this misrepresentation of his character effectively removes any love for the character. Dumbledore's kindness, consideration, and gentle spirit are central to the theme of the Potter saga. The movie portrays him as just another talented wizard. There is nothing special or unique about him. Why would anyone be upset if this character would die? It's not critical in the 5th movie, but in the 6th, it is one of the most important, if not the most important theme element to the plot. Gambon's take on Dumbledore is very short sighted.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the movie, but highly recommend to the fans that have not read the books that they are ""missing the magic"", and they should set aside some time to read. If you like the movies, I guarantee you will love the books."
"gana_kumar","10","2","5","11 July 2007"," The best Harry Potter flick by far
","If you are an avid Harry Potter reader, then you'll definitely love the movie. Adherence to the book was satisfied to a good extent although some characters were omitted(as usual).Even little elements like the thestrals flying over the forest was covered promptly.This movie wasn't dark as the previous two but significantly, it was silent and more thoughtful.The performance by Imelda Staunton(Dolores Umbridge in the movie) is unbeatable. Kudos to her for the sheer villainy portrayed by her character (or rather she lived her character in the movie).The movie however lacked the little funny element of the book.Dumbledore's Army and the sessions where Harry teaches his friends is very good. Evanna Lynch suited Luna Lovegood to a tee.The scenes of the wizard duels in the climax were really wonderful treat for the eyes.Michael Gambon's (Dumbledore) part can be well described by the following words of one of the characters,Kingsley Shacklebolt(Played by George Harris)-""He's got style!"". And the favorite trio of the series grow closer with this movie.Ron (Rupert Grint) however could've been used more effectively. No quidditch scenes in this movie and so he missed his chance to impress the audience. Sirius Black's (Gary Oldman) part was very serious and was totally justified.Hats off to Gary Oldman.His house elf Kreacher,however had no role at all,with only two instances of appearing on screen.Coming to Harry's First kiss - well.. no comments about that.The Ministry of Magic was a delightful set indeed and the climax was well planned and executed.The final meeting between Harry and Dumbledore could've been a little longer and more interesting.It would've seriously made a difference.And the background music was totally insufficient.It was silent for most of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best of the five movies and I daresay a very good one indeed."
"kooolkyl","10","2","5","11 July 2007"," By far the best
","Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix was by far the best of the Harry Potter movies made. The characters are very well developed, you almost feel as though over the years you have watched the young stars grow up. The special effects is great, and all new characters are portrayed greatly. Imelda Stauton does a great job as Dolores Umbridge. Throughout the whole movie I was looking forward to the part when she gets kicked out of Hogwarts, which means she played the character very well. The only bad thing that I can say about the movie is this: the major characters that had a very big part in previous films were not as big in this one. For example Professor McGonagal only appeared like three scenes. Other then that this movie is good and Harry Potter fans will not be disappointed."
"JadeMcKay","10","2","5","11 July 2007"," Absolutely incredible!
","This was one of the first times, that I've been so engrossed that my over-thinking brain didn't try to analyze the correctness of the movie to book. It was absolutely engrossing, charming and fun. High energy. I loved every minute of it. I did wish some parts were expanded a bit but I was thrilled with the outcome. Especially after the slight feeling of disappointment with the others.<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton does a superb job of Professor Umbridge but overall I would have to say that Evanna Lynch does an absolutely fantastic job as Luna Lovegood. She was incredible. I was a tad bit worried before watching the film but she absolutely blew me away.<br/><br/>I won't include any spoilers because thats how the end of the 6th book was ruined for me. I will say that this was well worth the money of the ticket, staying up late for the midnight show and then getting on here to write about it.<br/><br/>Go see it. You won't be disappointed!"
"amit_kumar13","10","2","5","10 July 2007"," The blockbuster of this summer
","I had the luck to view the preview show yesterday for this great movie. A great treat for harry potter fans. The director has brilliantly tried to stitch in all pieces of the plot of the huge fifth book of harry potter and is wonderfully successful to get it done in this 2 hour movie.<br/><br/>If you have watched recently any of the earlier parts, you get to realize how the actors are growing older and may become a spoiler in the next coming parts. But also you cannot stop noticing the acting skills of these actors have matured too.<br/><br/>This part has been a bit different from the earlier parts- very less broom rides, more wand fights. The movie is filled with quite a few funny moments that brings cheer across the whole audience and a couple times applause. It doesn't make a difference if you have read the book, this movie will still bring you to the corner of your seats.<br/><br/>Timed well with the release of the next book, this movie is on its way to become the best blockbuster of the summer. Don't buy popcorn for this movie, you would not need it, as you will be so engrossed in the movie. This is a ""must watch"" movie for every one who has eyes."
"anonomis","10","2","5","11 July 2007"," loved it!
","This was by far the most amazing of all Harry Potter movies! I want to see it again! I loved Imelda Staunton's character; i thought she was really funny and she gave me a laugh or two. Also, i admired Helen Bonham Carter, i think the way in which she acted her small part was fantastic, a real standout for me! I'm a little disappointed with Ron and Hermione in relation to how important they are in the film. This film seems to have pushed them a bit to the back, and they don't seem as involved as they used to be in previous films. I loved the Department of Mysteries battle scene; although short, i thought it was unbelievable. The magic in it, the sounds, all of it made me excited. I recommend this movie for anyone, although i believe it essential to read the book before watching, it makes it so much more entertaining."
"thesaddeststarisfadingfa","10","2","5","10 July 2007"," An amazing film all around
","The new Harry Potter movie was by far the best as of yet. I was amazed. The cinematography was greatacting extraordinaryall around wonderful. <br/><br/>Umbridge made me want to die every time she spoke. Helena Bonham Carter was fantastic as Bella, I was really impressed. Dan really pulled off the struggle Harry is going through...and so on.<br/><br/>The wand fighting as well as the fireworks were astounding. The fight between Dumbly and Voldy was mind blowing. The animals, the Giant, the Centures, the Ministry...the whole set was breath taking.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I was disappointed a little at the shortness of the ending. For me when Sirius was ""killed"" (or was he? We'll have to wait and see) it was really Harry trying to cope with it that tore me up. Sirius was one of my favorite characters and I was trilled to see him played by Gary Oldmanbut his ""death"" was not nearly as emotional as it could have been. He was all that Harry had left and now he's gone. It seems like it needed a little more time to set in for the audience and for Harry as well. Over all, a great piece though a little more detail might have been beneficial."
"lynj1234","3","6","25","11 July 2007"," Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix is a waste of time
","This movie is horrible it did not follow the book at all. The movie is first of all supposed to start off with harry sitting in aunt Petunia's garden under the windowsill trying to listen to the news. Then harry was supposed to meet up with Dudley in the middle of a street and then they both are supposed to be attacked in an alley not a tunnel and then miss fig tries to hurry harry along and get out of there with Dudley. And then another big mistake is when harry gets to #12 Grimwauld Place he is supposed to stay there for quite a while and Ron and Hermione receive there prefect badges and Ron gets a new broom from his parents. And also Ron is supposed to try out for the quidditch team and is made fun of by the slytherin house constantly and during harry's occlumency lessons snape is pouring memories he doesn't want harry to see into Dumbledore's pensive and harry is supposed to look into it one day when Snape has to leave the room and sees a young snape in Hogwarts being tortured by harry's father and lupin, Sirius, and petigrew are watching and laughing then harry's mother steps in to help Sirius and then snape pulls harry out of the pensive and his lessons are ended. And the movie also never showed how the Weasley family and harry and Hermione went to see Arthur in St. Mungos and see Neville with his grandmother visiting his parents. Also one of the things i was most mad at is they left out every thing about quidditch because that is were harry, Fred, and George are banned from quidditch for the rest of there lives because they attacked Draco after the match with Slytherin because he was insulting Harry and the Weasley family and Umbridge takes their brooms and puts them in her room. I think the only good scene in the whole movie was the last part the battle scene that is the only reason i rated this movie that high."
"lee_eisenberg","7","2","6","15 July 2007"," Now I see: they're portraying totalitarianism.
","Whereas it's been a few years since I read the novel on which this movie is based, I had forgotten a few things, so the movie refreshed my memory. Obviously, any book-to-movie adaptation is bound to have at least a few flaws. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" certainly can't equal the book exactly, but I really like Imelda Staunton's role as fascistic Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (I assume that if you're reading this, then you know what that class is; if not, then read the books first). This vile woman, dressed like a slightly drabber version of Jackie Kennedy, makes it her goal to overthrow Albus Dumbledore and totally seize control of Hogwarts,* engaging in all manner of torture when she deems it necessary, all the while sporting an unctuous smirk. Maybe it's just me, but I derive that this installment in the series is an indictment of totalitarian regimes.<br/><br/>Of course, I might just be reading too far into the movie. I figure that the main purpose is probably to get enthralled in the magic, and it's hard not to get enthralled. Admittedly, the younger stars come across as a little silly, as they try to be funny but can't really get it down. No matter, the adults all know what they're doing. A scary but delicious addition here is Helena Bonham Carter as death eater Bellatrix LeStrange. Looking sort of like Elvira, she turns Bellatrix into the sort of character whom we would expect Bonham Carter to play in a Tim Burton movie, and she does this to a tee; I almost felt scared watching her on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, while the movie does have its flaws, I recommend it. I consider it a solid addition in the series. Reprising their roles from the previous installment(s) are Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Isaacs and Warwick Davis.<br/><br/>*Not but a few hours after I watched the movie, I heard a report on the news about a newly released tape divulging the extreme hostility that Richard Nixon felt towards George McGovern, even after winning re-election. Well, Dolores Umbridge is even worse."
"Matt-60","10","2","6","15 July 2007"," The best of the films
","Up until tonight y pick for best Potter film was Prisoner of Azkaban, hands down. It had the perfect blend of magic and realism that the others lacked, the direction was fantastic and the cast showing that under the direction of an amazing director like Alfonso Cuaron they could truly shine. I loved Prisoner of Azkaban, I love it more every time I see it. So when I say that Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter film thus far, its a big deal to me. The movie is wonderful, the acting is top notch, Radcliff really shines here as Harry but everyone is excellent. The script is the best adaptation yet. Every decision to truncate or cut in order to fit an enormous book into a reasonable running time is perfect. Sure, I miss things, we all will, but unlike Goblet of Fire which made in my opinion every wrong choice on cutting story, this film did it all right. I honestly did not mind a single change, even the things I would have liked to have seen here were not necessary. I'm trying to keep this a spoiler free as possible so I won't say what parts I mean. I will say one spoilerish thing though..The wizard battle at the end was fantastic, wow. David Yates' direction was perfect, he knew just when to make things intense and when to make them emotional. He showed a real command of the material and how to realize it on screen. Hats off to him, I am very pleased that he will be directing Half Blood Prince. Now I just need to keep my fingers crossed that Alfonso will be back to do Deathly Hallows..."
"jsbeckwith","10","2","6","14 July 2007"," A good adaptation of the worst book.
","The director, in my view, had a very good go at adapting this book for the screen, as it is (in my opinion) the worst book. I can't really comment on the plot twists as I knew what was going to happen anyway, but it was very well acted by both the child actors (Luna Lovegood being the standout actor - head and shoulders above the rest) and the adult actors. Umbridge was perfect as the auntie who'd rip your head off and then worry about the blood stain and Helena Bonham Carter was also very good as Lestrange. Some actors let the side down (in my opinion Daniel Radcliffe overacted although everyone else made up for this with their performances). Overall, a very well acted piece and a pretty reasonable adaptation of the source material."
"slipknot_master","7","2","6","13 July 2007"," Not as faithful to the book as it could have been.
","Naturally the film has strong points and weak points. After watching the movie twice, I hold the belief the film could have benefited from an extra hour of scenes.<br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>The trio of Harry, Hermione and Ron were presented well with the only standout performance coming from Daniel Radcliffe. At times he appeared wooden, but quickly dispelled my feelings of boredom towards him with quick bursts of rage, particularly when he bellows 'Look at me!' towards Dumbledore. His acting towards the end was shaky and I'm having a hard time believing he put the advice from a bereavement counsellor to good use, as his acting when discussing Cedric Diggory was peculiar and felt forced. <br/><br/>The best acting in the movie is a close call between Imelda Staunton (Dolores Jane Umbridge) and Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood). Professor Umbridge is portrayed exactly as I had imagined her whilst reading the books. Staunton's performance as a firm, condescending yet strangely sweet villain was well conveyed, particularly in her introductory speech in the great hall. Prof. Umbridge was given the right amount of screen time to accurately convey her character without subtracting away from the plot. Luna Lovegood certainly is strange. Having read the book around fifteen times, I thought I knew what to expect from her. I was indeed delightfully surprised to see Luna presented so well. Her voice had a tone of wonder within it, her mannerisms in general were enough to make me feel uneasy  as indeed we should feel about Luna. <br/><br/>The great thing about the Harry Potter movies is that some of Britain's best actors and actresses are showcased. Maggie Smith (Professor Minerva McGonnagal) has always been my favourite piece of casting in the series. Sadly, she was underused in the movie as she was excluded from several scenes. Helena Bonham Carter was a very satisfyingly evil  and rather sexy  witch. The few lines she had in the movie were delivered with conviction. Emma Thompson was underused also. The scene where she was sacked was acted well, but it felt like they had summarised that movement in the movie far too much. Ralph Fiennes had few lines but delivered them well, the same can be said about Gary Oldman, whose performance I really enjoyed  particularly in the department of mysteries even calling Harry 'James' with a nostalgic look upon his face. <br/><br/>The character of Dumbledore has always been difficult for me to relate too, particularly since the passing of the great Richard Harris, and his replacement with Michael Gambon  who himself has never read a Harry Potter Novel. His mannerisms are not graceful enough for someone of Albus 'Percival Wulfric Brian' Dumbledore. He does not command the screen as well as he should and did not look as smugly defiant as Dumbledore is portrayed in Harry's trial at the ministry. Instead he looked intimidated by the Wizengamot. Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) is acted as well as he usually is. His sneering personality is perfect and I particularly enjoy Rickman's emphasis on words such as 'Obviously'. With the next film having a greater emphasis on Snape, I really cannot wait to see more of Rickman's performances.<br/><br/>The Plot.<br/><br/>There was always going to be large cuts to the plot of the book, after all, this is Hollywood. What has happened with this movie is that certain unimportant scenes have been added into the mix, such as the whole of the DA (Dumbledore's Army) in detention with Umbridge. With the additions, come the omissions. The most important scene from the book, not to make the final cut of the film was the visit to St. Mungos. As well as providing useful back-story to Neville, the visit was also used to add emphasis to the horrific injuries Mr. Weasley obtained and to provide insight into what was happening to Harry. Instead, this was thinly skated over with a scene at Christmas, toasting Harry for saving Mr. Weasley's life. Firenze did not take over Trelawney's job either. Kreacher was portrayed well although his main purpose in the book (to betray Sirius and aid Bellatrix) was ignored entirely. The fight scenes at the ministry were done superbly right up until Lord Voldemort arrives, with the possibly exception of Sirius' death scene. For me, the death happened to quickly and was not as epic as it could have been, and throughout the rest of the movie, Sirius' death is all but ignored. I knew that as soon as Peeves the Poltergeist was axed from the previous films that he was not going to be in The Order of the Phoenix. Still, it would have been good to see him present, causing havoc and obeying the Weasley twins. <br/><br/>The action and effects.<br/><br/>The action sequences were hit and miss too. In places it was amazing and quick paced, in other places the action was just wrong. The final battle between Professor Dumbledore and Voldemort, although well done, was wrong. Fawkes did not make an appearance, as he was intended to swallow an Avada Kedavra spell to protect Dumbledore and Dumbledore did not bring the ministry of Magic's fountain statues to life to protect him. In reality this scene went way too fast and was not as epic as a battle between the two greatest wizards in the world should have been. I cannot fault the special effects though as they added to the overall excitement and kept the movie bouncing along nicely."

","The only reason I gave it any stars were from the casting, and Umbridge. She did her part well, which means I loathe the woman! I have been raised within the film industry and this film was abysmal! Even if you were not expecting something from a book, the whole film was disjointed and did not flow from scene to scene. It bounced around and was extremely confusing. I know the content of the film is darker, but that does not mean you need to make it seem like a black and white film.<br/><br/>Where was the small connection with his aunt and what about his line when Voldermort take Harry over. He says something to the effect of ""please Dumbledore, kill me anything is better that this."" Come on! Voldermort is terrified of death and that was the whole point, it brought about the love that Harry is so full of. Question, where did they spend $150 million? With that amount they could have made it longer (which I will venture to say most fans would have loved), and for good heavens, pieced the scenes together a bit better.<br/><br/>They need to move towards how the fist two films were made. The gave the feeling of the true Harry Potter. I thought the PoA was the worst, but this tops that by far."
"griffolyon12","10","2","6","11 July 2007"," Amazing!!!!The Best Movie of the Year by Far!!!!!
","I'm a huge Harry Potter fan,having read every book and seen every movie countless times.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has always been,in my opinion,the weakest of the books so I was very worried about the movie before seeing it,but I was very wrong.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix begins when Harry and his cousin Dudley fall prey to a Dementor attack in an underpass on their way home one evening.Harry fends off the Dementors saving both his and Dudley's life,only to later receive a letter from the Ministry of Magic saying he has been expelled from school for using magic in front of a muggle.Later that night the Order of the Phoenix arrives(the group who opposes Voldermort led by Dumbledore) and rescues Harry taking him back to their HQ and telling him that Dumbledore has arranged a trial to decide his fate.Once at their HQ Harry reunites with the Weasleys,Hermione,but most importantly his godfather Sirius Black.Once back in the wizarding world Harry learns that the Ministry is denying all reports of Voldermort's return and is branding both Harry and Dumbledore liars,essentially accusing them of herecy.At Harry's trial Dumbledore arrives to get Harry off of the hook,and his punishment is lifted and he is off back to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Once back at Hogwarts Harry feels more alienated than ever,while also having to deal with Professor Umbridge(played superbly by Imelda Staunton) Fudge's assistant who is the Ministry's representative at Hogwarts.The Ministry fears that Dumbledore is planning to build up an army and overthrow the Ministry,so they refuse to teach any real magic at Hogwarts.Due to this Harry,Ron,and Hermione create their own secret class full of many other students taught by Harry to teach them Defense Against the Dark Arts.All of these events eventually build up to a big showdown against Voldermort and the Death Eaters in the Ministry of Magic.<br/><br/>The first thing I immediately noticed about this film is how much darker in tone than the previous films it is(even darker than Prisoner of Azkaban).As usual the production values are all top notch,cinematography,production design,and special effects are still top notch and at certain times steal the show.This time around the franchise has changed tremendously with almost a completely new creative staff behind it.First is the wonderful music by the new composer Nicholas Hooper,bringing back a great whimsical feel to the music that Goblet of Fire seemed to lack(still this isn't as great as William's scores,but is a welcome substitute).Another new member to the crew is a new screenwriter in Michael Goldenberg(Steve Kloves having left to take a break from Potter).Goldenberg has perfectly adapted the longest Potter book into a 2 hour and 15 minute film that seems to flow better than almost any other Potter film.The greatest thing about the script was how close it stuck to the book,majority of the film followed the book by verbatim,hitting every single major plot point in the book with precise accuracy.The greatest new addition though is director David Yates,who has only ever done one other theatrical feature before.Yates perfectly captures the spirit of the book generating quite possibly the greatest performances by these young actors so far,which brings me to the acting.<br/><br/>The acting as usual is one of the major highlights of the Potter film.All of the veteran British actors deliver picture perfect performances as always(in particular Gary Oldman).The only thing is the adults in the cast are getting less and less screen time each film.What is really impressive though is how much the younger actors have evolved since the previous installment,especially Daniel Radcliffe,who is proving to me that he could become one of the greatest actors of our generation.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a film rich with character development,emotion,and heart.Although there aren't quite as many laughs in this film as there were in previous installments there still are enough to tide you over.Another huge plus to the film is the climax in the Ministry of Magic giving some of the best action in any Potter film,it was amazing and was great eye candy.<br/><br/>All in all it is another great entry into the Potter franchise with way more character development than any other installment thus far,plus is way darker in tone(the darkest Potter so far),and way more emotion and heart as well.Although it has less action than Goblet,it is a way better film in my opinion.A superb film that is nearly perfect in every way and possibly gives Prisoner of Azkaban a run for its money as my favorite Potter film.<br/><br/>Another Potter film with a Perfect: 10/10!!!!!!!!"
"LemonyShepard","10","2","6","11 July 2007"," Exactly how I hoped it would be!
","Now, the fifth book was, by far, my favorite of the series, so expectations were somewhat high for the movie. I'm actually glad to say that I left with a smile on my face.<br/><br/>Again, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson return as the trio of protagonists at Hogwarts, delivering average acting back to the screen. Rupert and Emma will definitely never win an Oscar anytime too soon, but Daniel is getting pretty good at portraying the infamous angst-filled Potter everyone complained about in the fifth book. He pulls off the character as a whole rather well.<br/><br/>The ensemble is amazing, as usual for a Harry potter film, but two new characters really stood out to me this time around: Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Imelda Staunton (Delores Umbridge). I was overjoyed to see my two favorite characters from the fifth book portrayed so perfectly. Umbridge is, by far, the most evil villain that has ever graced the Harry Potter screen. Audience members hated her so much, flicked her off whenever she was on screen, yelled out obscenities whenever she punished a Hogwarts student. That's the exact response I wanted her to get, because that's the response I gave her while reading the book! Kudos to Imelda for bringing to life one of the nastiest villains that we all love to despise. Evanna played Luna exactly how I hoped she would: that weird little girl who nobody would talk to because she's so weird, but has an amazing heart that's always in the right place. I'm really glad that they both pulled off their characters so well.<br/><br/>It is dark, definitely the darkest in the series so far, but there are many light-hearted moments (Harry talking to Ron and Hermione about his first kiss, for example). It follows the book exactly, which also relieved me. Sure, they cut some things out, but it hardly fazed me. The story flowed well and stuck as much to the original novel as it could've.<br/><br/>To me, this is how a Harry Potter movie should always be. Very, very well done. 10-10 stars for a Harry potter movie."

","Must be the Dementors' fault.<br/><br/>Having never read the books, I can't complain about things changed/left out and only judge the films on their own merits. I'd felt the series kept getting better, reaching its peak with 'Goblet of Fire', which I thought fonud the right balance between darkness/light-hearted fun. This film, however, I didn't find 'fun' at all. It got off to a bad start by including the loathsome Dursleys again (after blessedly skipping them in GoF). I also preferred how the last film started in the realm of magic, rather than the 'real world' like this one. Things didn't improve much when Harry was put on trial for using magic in front of his mush-mouthed cousin. Apparently magic trials are as boring as 'real world' trials. The only interesting parts to me were the visually stunning flight over the Palace of Westminster and the introduction of Nymphadora Tonks (who dislikes being called by her first name, judging by her tone/hair colour changing). Sadly, she disappeared after that. Mad-Eye Moody and Professor Lupin didn't fare much better, getting only small amounts of screentime.<br/><br/>Things improved slightly with Ron, Hermione and the intriguing new character of Luna Lovegood. Evanna Lynch gave an exceptional performance, stealing every scene she was in (talking about Nargles and hoping for pudding). I especially liked her bonding with Harry over being 'different' along with skeletal horses called Thestrals that could only apparently be seen by those who'd seen death (makes you wonder how freaked out the others were when flying on them if they couldn't *see* them). Unfortunately, Harry was at his most unlikeable this film. Being moody/angry all the time might've been the *point*, but it certainly didn't make for fun viewing (though I shared his frustration with Dumbledore/understood his sudden outburst after getting sick and tired of seemingly being ignored by him). Ron and Hermione's characters seemed a bit more 'subdued' this film than how they'd been previously, thus making them feel quite different.<br/><br/>Snape, who has felt underused for a while, got some focus when teaching Harry how to shield his mind from Voldemeort and it led to a flashback of young Snape being the victim of bullying from Harry's father, James. However, that doesn't excuse Snape's current attitude/behaviour towards Harry and his friends (talk about holding a grudge against the wrong people). While Lucius Malfoy gets his most screentime since the second film, this feels like the least amount of Draco we've seen. Meanwhile, we learn about the tragic fate of Neville's parents at the hands of the wickedly evil (and clearly insane, given the hair) Bellatrix Lestrange. When you need someone to play a nutter, get Helena Bonham Carter! She's quite fun, playing someone so evil. Sirius is back...but we don't get much time with him (nor does Harry, sadly).<br/><br/>Seamus Finnigan's brief falling out with Harry (who insulted his mother) hasn't much impact; Ron's brothers bring some slight 'fun' to proceedings, poor Cho Chang gets very little screentime kiss with Harry comes seemingly out of nowhere. When their 'relationship' hits the rocks, all you can think is ""WHAT relationship?"" due to it being given minimal development. Professors McGonagall and Trelawney are also sorely underused. At the other end of the spectrum was the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, (seriously, do some background checks before giving people for that position!) Dolores Umbridge, who I felt had far too much screentime, zapping whatever fun was to be had out of every scene she was in. She's every super strict teacher ever...only *worse*, because she also abuses students by forcing them to write things over and over again with a magic quill that scratches what they're writing into their hands. How wasn't she immediately fired? Wizard logic!). She's the absolute WORST. What's a School of Witchcraft and Wizardry without magic? Pretty damn boring. If Imelda Staunton's performance is to be measured by how much I hated her character...then she gets top points.<br/><br/>While it was nice to see the students going behind Umbridge's back and training for their oncoming 'war', as 'Dumbledore's Army', the sense of fun from the previous films was all but gone, I felt (the only part I really liked was seeing the various animals that the students' Patronus charms took the forms of). The first four films had this sense of wonder and blew your mind with the magical creatures and spells, etc. This movie was much more serious and had very little humour in it (and what humour it *did* have, I felt, more often than not fell flat). Some might like that fact, but to me, these films have always been about escapism and fantasy. Letting yourself be pulled into a world of magic and having a rollicking good time. As more and more of the real world merges with the magic world, we seem to be losing some of the more fantastical elements. Sure, there are spells cast in this movie, there's a dodgy CGI'd giant (the best part of that scene is Hermione showing it whose boss and Ron's protectiveness over her), there's duels involving wands (that more than slightly resemble the light-saber duels from the Star Wars films), there's centaurs and other things. I liked the 'Battle of the Department of Mysteries', and Dumbledore vs Voldemort allowed for some great visuals, but on the whole I just didn't feel the 'magic' this time around and that's why this is my least favourite film of the franchise."

","The series really starts getting dark now... Harry is ""touchy"", loosing his temper and not knowing why (hey, he's a teen!). Dolores Umbridge is highly disturbing, which means Imelda Staunton did a good job with the character. But the feeling of the film is depressing...<br/><br/>If you like bad guys, there are lots of them in this one. Even Robert Hardy's Fudge character is a meany this time. I don't know why Hardy's scenes were always so short, you only got a whiff of him. A bit more Snape in this one. Mark William's hairpiece is awful this go-around, not sure what's up with that one!<br/><br/>The loss of the fun and mystical sets adds to the depressing feel of the film.

After the issue goes to counsel there are protest against anyone claiming the existence of Voldemont. To make things worse the strict Dolores Umbridge arrives with her own ideas for discipline.

Imelda Staunton as the strict Dolores Umbridge steals her scenes but ultimately will become the one being taught the lesson by the students.

It literally looked like it was 7 feet tall . Harry and Hermione were calm at seeing this giant and Grawl was educated and calm which is really hard to believe because I'm pretty sure no giant would act like that .<br/><br/>Kreacher was like in 1 scene , when Kreacher is quite important in the book !

","David Yates may not be able to rekindle the excellent form shown in movies two, three and four however his first of four Potter films he directs is a fine entry into the collection - even if it is a little disappointing.<br/><br/>When Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) tries to assist Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in convincing the Ministry of Magic that Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned from the grave. However, their accusations are ignored by the people at the helm of the Ministry and they send their recruit Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to restore order to Hogwarts and to take over as Dark Arts teacher.

Meanwhile, Harry begins to fall for female wizard Cho Chang (Katie Leung) and suffer mood swings as Voldermort begins to control Harry's subconscious.<br/><br/>The plot and narrative feels a little empty and under-cooked with only a portion of the book making the big screen. Strangely, a duration of 138 minutes makes it the shortest of the first five Potter films; this is strange because the book consist of over 1,000 pages, the longest of the collection. It seems to make little sense that the book which has the most entailed in it is the shortest of the first five films and clearly the one which is most flawed in terms of story line.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the cast of Radcliffe and co. is once more great with the maturity and realism of the upcoming actors/actresses growing by each movie. <br/><br/>Also, the 'Order of the Phoenix' is another thoroughly entertaining and at times creepy fifth film of the eight. It's thoroughly entertaining for its rapid pace, but mostly for the way it climaxes; a stupendous display of CGI and powerful acting resulted in a superior ending to any of witnessed in the previous four films.<br/><br/>Solid foundations for Yates, but foundations which he certainly builds upon in his later Potter adaptions'."

","Young wizard-in-training Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year of studies, only to find that the magical community seems to be in a curious state of denial about his recent encounter with the sinister Lord Voldemort in the fifth installment of the popular fantasy film series based on the best-selling books by author J.K. Rowling.This movie is directed by David Yates and it is the fifth installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Michael Goldenberg and produced by David Heyman and David Barron. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively.The story follows Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts as the Ministry of Magic refuses to believe the return of the evil Lord Voldemort. <br/><br/>Rumor has it that the dreaded Lord Voldemort has returned, but Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge isn't so sure what to make of all the hearsay currently floating around the campus of Hogwarts. Suspecting that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore may be fueling the rumors regarding Voldemort's return in order to undermine his authority and lay claim to his job, Fudge entrusts newly arrived Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Dolores Umbridge with the task of tracking Dumbledore and keeping a protective watch over the nervous student body. The young wizards of Hogwarts will need something much more effective than Umbridge's Ministry-approved course in defensive magic if they are to truly succeed in the extraordinary battle that lies ahead, however, and when the administration fails to provide the students with the tools that they will need to defend Hogwarts against the fearsome powers of the Dark Arts, Hermione, Ron, and Harry take it upon themselves to recruit a small group of students to form ""Dumbledore's Army"" in preparation for the ultimate supernatural showdown.<br/><br/>The fifth Harry Potter film has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple ""children's"" series and children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix begins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes. It's not easy to take the longest Harry Potter book and streamline it into the shortest Harry Potter franchise movie, but director David Yates does a bang up job of it, creating an Order of the Phoenix that's entertaining and action-packed.The director, especially given the sinister subject matter on hand, does a rather workmanlike job of traffic-managing the action. But some of the magic effects are indeed magical. Although, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is a great movie."

","I'm not a reader of the Harry Potter books but I've been watching the film adaptations in order and I'm starting to hit a sticking point. Reading other reviews of this installment in the series I don't feel so bad now that it was somewhat hard to follow for me. The principal characters don't seem to be as engaging as they were when first starting out, and even though that might be a result of the actors getting older in their roles, there's just something elusive that's missing here to make the adventure enjoyable. The situations and dialog seemed to enter clichéd territory a good part of the time, and the overall impression I had when it was over was that I was simply tired of it all. Which doesn't bode well for the remainder of the stories, even though I'm sure enough that I'll go on to finish the films in due time. As usual, great special effects and colorful use of Hogwarts language, but the return of Voldemort wasn't epic, and the introduction of new characters left me uninterested. How about a Petronus charm to liven things up next time."

And also, the new performances provided by Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, and newcomer Evanna Lynch were all quite wonderful and super well-performed. I also love the change in Harry Potter's character where he starts becoming a teacher to the students, when teaching them to defend themselves, but he ends up being controlled by Voldemort and needs help of his own.

This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that ""you know who"" is not back again.<br/><br/>Given that JK Rowling's fifth book is considered to be something of a door stopper, a book more of interim Potter filler than any great amount of substance, credit has to go to new to the franchise director, David Yates. For Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to craft a briskly entertaining segment in under 2 hours and 20 minutes of film. Yes it's safe to say that it ultimately does feel like an interim filler movie, one that is for fans and not newcomers to the series, but the effects are superb (except Grawp that is), the action is much and suspense is not in short supply. While it also finds Radcliffe as Potter finally hitting his acting stride.<br/><br/>New into the magical fray comes the wonderful Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbrage, the sort of cheery psychotic teacher we all had bad dreams about in our formative years. Also most welcome is Helena Bonham Carter as nut job harpy Bellatrix Le Strange, it's an appetiser of substance and we can't wait to see some more of her from here on in. Of course the usual problem of not enough screen time for the regulars still exists, but it's now become a figure of grumpy acceptance in the grand scheme of Potter World. Neatly keeping the story trimmed of extraneous fat, Yates doesn't disappoint in delivering a last quarter as memorable as any so far in the series. Big rewards await those who wait, because the showdown that crowns Order of Phoenix is a magical mêlée of wands and wonderment; a face off between good and evil, a free for all that joyously assaults the senses.<br/><br/>Roll on Half-Blood Prince, where it's great to know that Yates has been further entrusted with the Harry Potter reins. 7.5/10"

The second time I watched it...it was better. When you watch this movie for the first time, you get lost and confused because they are moving the story line way too fast. One minute Harry is in London, and the next thing you know he was kicked out of Hogwarts and on trial to get back in. That is why I didn't really like it as much as I should have. Honestly...take this movie, and watch it once, then watch it again a few days later and it all makes sense!

"wolverinesforever","8","1","2","6 November 2010"," An underrated installment that thankfully maintains an appropriately dark tone
","It's more than just Voldemort that Harry's going against now. It's the fact that he's fifteen. What I'm surprised not many others have pointed out is that Harry's actions, feelings, and self-""justifications"" are very much in line with how some fifteen-year-old boys act. He thinks he's alone, no one wants to help him (it doesn't help that many students now distrust him), he's not confiding in his friends, and he thinks the world's out to get him. Well, he's half right. People are out to get him, use him, and ultimately bring him down. But what he needs to learn is that friends are at his side, that there are allies to trust in dark times. Unfortunately for him, growing up is going to get in the way of discerning dreams from reality.<br/><br/>If Mike Newell planted seeds of tragedy in ""The Goblet of Fire,"" then new director David Yates is planting seeds of hopelessness. Immediately, Harry is reminded that he has no parents, he faces expulsion from Hogwarts for trying to protect his cousin from Dementors, and he's angry at his friends for not informing him of new developments over the summer. Dark doesn't even begin to describe the tone of ""The Order of the Phoenix."" Hogwarts no longer looks like an accommodating place. It's serious and joyless, hope is lost, spirits can be broken, and authorities have an iron hand.<br/><br/>David Yates may not have created an ""enjoyable"" installment, but he's still created a worthwhile one. What separates this from its predecessors is that this time, magic alone will not solve the problem. The only way Harry is going to get Voldemort out of his head is when he realizes that his friends are on his side, and that he's ultimately very different from Voldemort. <br/><br/>Of all of the ""Harry Potter"" stories, the may be the most Harry-centered. I loved how well Daniel Radcliffe juggled his external and internal problems. When he snaps back at classmates who accuse him of being a liar, you can feel his pulsating anger. Or when Voldemort forces him to horrific things, and you can feel the fear Harry has in his belief that he's becoming a bad person. If there were any doubts about Daniel Radcliffe taking on the role of Harry Potter, they were surely gone by this installment.<br/><br/>Some performers get to shine. Gary Oldman brings fatherlike-credibility to Sirius Black, and when he tries to reassure Harry that he's not a bad person, I truly felt like a father was talking to a son. Michael Gambon also brings more delicacy and vulnerability to Albus Dumbledore. Matthew Lewis gets more time as Neville Longbottom, and like Harry, he also has an old enemy he must eventually encounter. I enjoyed watching his expanded performance. Other regulars like Emma Watson as Hermione, Rupert Grint as Ron, and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, don't get as much screen time as you'd like them to, but they still make the most out of their roles.<br/><br/>New casting once again helps ""Harry Potter."" Evanna Lynch brings a great balance of quirkiness and honesty to Luna Lovegood, the marked-out student that Harry forms a bond with. Helena Bonham-Carter is appropriately mad as Bellatrix Lestrange. And Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, man, I had to fight an impulse to slap her when she hypocritically said ""I really hate children."" Well done Imelda!<br/><br/>The best part of the film would have to be the climax in the Ministry of Magic. We get more terrific setwork by Stuart Craig (who beautifully constructs the clean-cut but foreboding corridors of the Ministry as well as the endless halls of glass spheres in the Hall of Prophecies), and there is a terrific duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, the teacher vs. the pupil. This leads to arguably the best shot so far in the series, where Voldemort destroys the glass windows of the Ministry and bathes in his takedown, arms spread out in triumph. If there is an indelible shot that defines the return of Lord Voldemort, that's the one.<br/><br/>This is followed by yet another terrific scene, one where Voldemort attempts to posses Harry again (compliments to Mark Day for the terrific editing). It is here that Harry finally comes to his senses (with some help from Dumbledore), realizes that he and Voldemort are more different than alike, and understands that there is strength to him knowing love and friendship. Many people hated the following line he said to Voldemort, ""And I feel sorry for you,"" but I found it to be very moving. It showed that just as Harry could care for his friends, he could also show remorse towards his enemies, a trait Voldemort can never imagine.<br/><br/>This is the only ""Potter"" film to be written by Michael Goldenberg, and he writes a tight and serious script. It doesn't have the sense of humor that Kloves could put into his ""Potter"" screenplays, but ""The Order of the Phoenix"" does benefit from a straightforward and no-nonsense tone. David Yates was an interesting choice for a director, seeing as his only experience was in British TV films. While his inexperience occasionally shows, he wisely puts his faith in his actors and the characters they inhibit.<br/><br/>To those who were disappointed that the longest ""Harry Potter"" book got turned into the shortest film, my advice to you is the same I gave for ""The Goblet of Fire."" Accept this film as a loose adaptation and appreciate it for what it is. The book was well over 800 pages long; even a 3-hour cut wouldn't have gotten even half of the material! As it stands, ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is integral to the grand scheme of Harry Potter growing up. It's not easy being fifteen and having to deal with a dark wizard who wants you to feel alone and isolated, and this film terrifically sells the point."

","This fifth installment in the Harry Potter franchise doesn't match Alfonso Cuaron's cinematic vision brought to life in the third film, but it is an improvement over its immediate predecessor, ""Goblet of Fire."" It shares some of that film's sense that a tremendous amount of plot is being squeezed into too short a film, and that all sorts of things that might bring subtlety and nuance to the story are being left out, but it's crisper and better adapted -- you don't have to have read the book to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>The most persuasive argument for watching ""Order of the Phoenix"" is to see Imelda Staunton's deliciously evil turn as Dolores Umbridge, a kind of fascist grandmother decked out like Jackie Kennedy, who may just have to kill you if you break her rules.

"hnt_dnl","9","1","2","16 July 2010"," Harry Potter gets dark!
","HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (2007) is really, IMHO, the first Harry Potter film to be purely dark in overall tone and mood. There is a sense of doom, sadness, and dread that permeates throughout that is not really completely present in the earlier films. ORDER is actually the 2nd Harry Potter film that I saw when it first came out (GOBLET OF FIRE being the 1st), then I went back and watched the first 3 (SORCERER'S STONE, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, PRISONER OF AZKABAN) on DVD. All films before ORDER definitely had lighthearted moments of fun and whimsy. ORDER does not and I think that's a good thing! In that sense, I'd say that ORDER is the first ""mature"" Harry Potter film.<br/><br/>ORDER gets off to a great start with Harry (once again played superbly by Daniel Radcliffe, but this time with an added touch of maturity) sitting alone on a swing, having spent the summer re-living the tragic events at the end of GOBLET to Cedric Diggory (played by TWILIGHT's Robert Pattinson, who has a very brief cameo in this one). Voldemort killed Diggory at the end of Goblet, but only Harry saw it. His bullying cousin Dudley (funny Harry Melling) shows up with his entourage to make fun of Harry when the Dementors show up and Harry must use his wizardry powers in Muggle world, which violates Hogwarts rules. The Ministry of Magic wants to expel Harry, but Prof. Dumbledore (again essayed expertly by Michael Gambon, who has made the role his own more and more in each new film) intervenes saying that he believes Harry's story about both Voldemort and the Dementors, so Harry is allowed back in Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Harry meets up with the the Weasleys, their son and his best friend Ron (again played solidly by Rupert Grint) and best friend Hermione (again played by the charming Emma Watson), his godfather Sirius Black (reprised by the great Gary Oldman) and others who call themselves the ""Order of the Phoenix"" gathered together to fight Voldemort and his evil army of wizards.<br/><br/>Upon arrival back at Hogwarts, Harry is shunned and scorned by his fellow students who don't believe him when he says that Voldemort has returned. Feeling lonely, sad, and betrayed, he pushes away Hermione and Ron (who both are a bit skeptical themselves) and he meets one Luna Lovegood (played brilliantly by the perfectly cast Evanna Lynch), a rather strange Hogwarts student with special abilities to see creatures (an ability that Harry also possesses). They bond and Luna helps Harry to realize his importance and he is able to re-connect with his Hogwarts' friends. They band together to form their own wizard order to fight the impending doom that is Voldemort, who has in the mean time kidnapped Sirius. While training the new order, Harry grows closer to his long time Hogwarts crush Cho Chang (played the sweet Katie Leung).<br/><br/>The wicked new Dark Arts instructor Dolores Umbridge (wonderfully and refreshingly played by Imelda Staunton) has had Dumbledore administratively removed (temporarily) by the Ministry as head of Hogwarts because of the secret goings on at the school and Harry et al work together to correct this. The new order, led by Harry go off to try and save Sirius in the climax from Voldemort (played with evil panache by Ralph Fiennes) and a group of Azkaban escapees led by Bellatrix LeStrange (played with sexy, vicious glee by Helena Bonham Carter).<br/><br/>The main draw to ORDER for me is the rise in maturity and darkness that the prior films didn't quite focus on. It was understandable as they were much younger and those were more ""kids"" films, although CHAMBER and AZKABAN have draws for adult audiences as well, especially AZKABAN. I think GOBLET is the weakest of all the films as it was much too focused on teen angst and raging hormones. Also, I think that ORDER did a great job introducing an eclectic group of new characters to the Harry Potter world like Luna, Bellatrix, and Umbridge. The start of dark Harry Potter...Great!"

","Plot: Harry saves his cousin Dudley from two dementors, but by using magic outside of school he needs to go to a trial. After being found not guilty, he spends the rest of the summer at his Godfathers Sirius' house. When he goes back to school, his new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher Miss. Umbridge basically tortures him, Hagrid is missing, Dumbledore won't look at him, and Harry keeps having dreams about a door at the end of a long hallway. <br/><br/>Review: Let me just say this, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a good film, but as an adaptation, it's only OK. In terms of an adaptation it's basically about as good as The Last Airbender, as in, they got enough for the basic story, but there's so much cut out. This is the only Potter film not to be written by Steve Kloves, and the first directed by David Yates. It certainly shows that this film had a different writer, and to be fair I'm not saying the writer Michael Goldenberg (who also did Green Latern) did a bad job, but he could've done much better. For example Quittich is completely gone, Harry saw his dad tormenting Snape in the Penesive, not by memory charm, young Lily doesn't appear, We don't see St. Mungo's and don't see Neville's parents, Rita Skeeter isn't in it, Kreacher barely appears, Aunt Petunia doesn't get a Howler, Hedwig isn't injured, and much more is either left out or changed. One other thing I don't like is the message of friendship is shoved down your throats near the end, I know that was a theme of the book but it wasn't forcing it. Also a minor nitpick, in the first book, it was established that Harry could grow his hair back in one night, so why is his hair so short in this movie?<br/><br/>After all that ranting, let's talk about why I like this film. Once again, the actors do a great job, and this film also also gives us two of the best casting decisions after the three main leads. Imelda Staunton was perfects as Umbridge, I wanted to smack her in the face. And Evanna Lynch was absolutely flawless in her portrayal of Luna. The special effects are great, the last battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore was pulled off well in my opinion, some say that Dumbledore looked scared and was weaker than in the book, but I don't think that was how the book portrayed the battle. The effects in that scene alone make this film worth watching. And the humor works really well, and like I said, it follows the main plot of the show, just like The Last Airbender, but people seemed to hate that film.<br/><br/>So yes, I like Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, it's fun, a good film, but as an adaptation, it's mediocre. Because of this, it is my least favorite film in the series."

Later, when I watched it again I realized that the acting is good and if you look past some of the minor details from the book they chose not to include it's actually a very good movie with ton of suspense. I found the 6th book to be the most suspenseful. It's sorta leading up to ""The Gran Finally"" And they certainly got that effect in the movie.<br/><br/>Some minor ""problems"" I had with this movie was that the dialog seems very fake and vague. It's like the actors just met each other and are forced to talk. Also I feel the movie emphasizes many things wrong such as The Harry-Cho relation.

","Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix is an entertaining film for the most part. It's a worthy addition to the franchise and director David Yates does an admirable job of turning this book into a movie which can go either way depending on how close they stay to the material. For the most part Order Of The Phoenix is enjoyable with some flaws. The talented cast are good in their roles including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman are great in their supporting roles but most of them don't have much to do and lack screen time. The movie still seems to be juggling too many characters with some of them getting the short end of the stick. Despite its flaws the film still has some action maybe not as much as the previous one but they're well executed with great special effects, a little romance, and some humor that make it enjoyable. I do prefer the Goblet Of Fire over this one but Order Of The Phoenix isn't that bad of a movie. It just could've been a little better if the movie was faster paced with less supporting characters and more action."
"irish23","3","1","2","13 July 2008"," Best of the series, yet still only an average film
","The Harry Potter series remains a story in search of a director. This installment is the best yet, incorporating key story elements to move the plot along and new scenes & touches to cram in some character development, but it all leads to an ultimately disappointing climax and denouement.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is, as always, phenomenal. It is *criminal* that this much brilliant talent is assembled for only the briefest screen appearances. You can tell their talent by how much they wrench out of every second of screen time.<br/><br/>Radcliffe has matured nicely as an actor, but Yates' emphasis on action, action, action prevents Radcliffe from holding center stage as much as one suspects he could.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint has finally moved out of clumping ""block of wood"" mode but has so few lines and action that he still comes across as a cipher. Why would anyone find Ron Weasley interesting??? What does he actually *do*? I daren't ask what he *thinks,* since he so rarely evinces evidence of that, whether in the books or on screen.<br/><br/>Emma Watson seemed on hysterical overdrive for much of the picture, to the point where I couldn't understand her lines at times. Her outstanding prowess as a witch in the books is completely lost in this film, where she appears as just another student in Harry's class.<br/><br/>""Order of the Phoenix"" is essentially an action film, and as such, it fulfills that role to a T. Shallow characters, very short scenes, fast edits, heavy use of montage, hints at relationships rather than exploration of them, focus on high-drama pursuit of an Ultimate Goal, and then - - the inevitable falling flat. <br/><br/>One of the great things about the Rowling books is that they make *consequences* very clear. Children are still children, no matter how brave or clever, and need caring adults to help them deal with emotional and physical bruising. The scene in the Dept of Mysteries was, in the book, a completely gripping experience as, one by one, the characters took serious blows.<br/><br/>In the movie, however, following the convention of almost every action film I've seen since the original Die Hard, there are virtually no consequences of what is supposed to be an epic magical, emotional, and physical battle. No torn clothes, no bruises, and none of the serious injuries that made the scene so frightening in the book. It's the presence of the consequences of violence (think Sarah Connor in either Terminator movie) that makes a good action film great. We have to see that these characters are human -- which means that they are vulnerable.<br/><br/>And, as in all the other pictures in this franchise, there is no exploration of the emotional toll such battles take. Sirius' death scene was so sanitized that it made no impression on me whatsoever, except to wonder if Yates' scene of Harry's reaction and the ensuing 15 seconds of slow-mo footage constituted plagiarism of Lord of the Rings as Frodo (far more effectively) reacts to Gandalf's death.<br/><br/>I have my usual laundry list of minor peeves, such as poor Evanna Lynch's thin acting abilities compared to the giants around her, and especially the Christmas scenes where everyone is saying, ""Merry Christmas"" -- only Mrs Weasley says the more Brit-appropriate ""Happy Christmas."" (I do detest how these films dilute the cultural specificity of the books.) <br/><br/>The ending, like most standard action films, leaves us with a forgettable closing line that is as emotionally satisfying as a twig in a cup.<br/><br/>Overall, I was willing to overlook the hacking and slashing of Rowling's epic (I'm used to it by now) for about 3/5 of the picture. Imelda Staunton made an outstanding, ever-present, puffy pink noose that kept tightening around the throats of our heroes. I even appreciated Yates' throwing in some lighter moments to keep the film (like the book) from getting claustrophobic. <br/><br/>But with the total emasculation of the Weasley twins' spectacular departure (I actually cheered when I read the book; in the movie I just kept saying, ""Hunh?"" and waiting for some sort of statement to be made), the picture fell into all the traditional ruts of any standard Hollywood-type action film. Special effects over substance. Superhero abilities given to our previously human characters. Predictable climax (only, in this case, add ""confusing"" because it was changed so much from the book -- for the worse), and lame & unsatisfying denouement.<br/><br/>I wish they would give these films to someone like Terry Gilliam or Baz Luhrman, who are capable of creating multi-textured stories using every tool in the filmmaker's toolbox: script, actors, sound, costuming, lights, sets, score -- all used to tell the story. Instead we're stuck with directors who think only in two dimensions and deliver ""standard"" adaptations of Rowlings spectacular, visionary tales. Such a tragic waste."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a great movie, no doubt about that. The only thing that went wrong is the how the movie was adapted from the novel. Many action-packed scenes were left out. Any way, Harry goes for Year 5 at Hogwarts and he must endure the hateful Umbridge and teach some students magic that Umbridge refuses to teach. The acting in this film is the best. Radcliffe did a good job showing Harry's emotions from the book. Everyone else was good as well. The technical aspects(cinematography, camera work etc) of the film is fantastic. The score is not that bad. Hooper put together a nice piece of work. There should've been more scenes that were in the book including Quidditch(Weasley Is A King, Fight with Malfoy), the Rita Skeeter interview, and the explosive anger towards Dumbledore. Other than that, this is a good film. I rate this film a 9/10."

"missrljane","3","1","2","22 May 2008"," Too Fast And Devoid Of A Reason To Exist
","The fifth Harry Potter film doesn't feel much like a film at all, everything happens too fast, as it whizzes through an entire year of events, lines babbled under too-loud music, making it feel as if nothing is really happening and with no noticeable time actually passing until Dumbledore informs Harry that he has been ignoring him for a year. A year? Surely not. Nothing happened.<br/><br/>Most of the plot is about Dolores Umbridge taking over Hogwarts, which has nothing to do with Lord Voldemort wanting to kill Harry, which is what seems to be happening at the start. Umbridge, a pink-clad giggling bureaucrat from the Ministry of Magic, seizes control of Hogwarts, a character that starts as a clumsy juxtaposition gag  she smiles but really she is mean  but develops into a chilling child-torturer.<br/><br/>While events surrounding Harry at the start of the film are mildly mysterious and quite creepy, these are instantly dispelled by the horribly disappointing realisation that Harry is going to spend most the film with his two useless sidekicks, Hermione and Ron, who are simply there to stop any of that creepy, interesting stuff going on too long. Emma Watson as Hermione wobbles her head and pronounces syllables that aren't there, failing to be convincing at any point, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry veers wildly from completely believable to child-in-a-school-play acting, and Rupert Grint mumbles his lines, possibly deliberately because Ron is dull and pointless, but if so, Ron really needs to be cut. There is no friendship or love discernible between the characters and every moment Hermione and Ron are on screen is annoying.<br/><br/>On the subject of unbelievable relationships, it is rather tedious that Harry is obsessed with his Godfather Sirius while poor Lupin is forced to the side, even though he clearly cares deeply for the boy. Harry is also still hero-worshipping his father when here we get a glimpse that he was a horrible bully, before moving hurriedly on.<br/><br/>As the plot speeds along, forgetting to be a plot, explained only in the lazy device of spinning newspapers, it crashes into the finale, in which we learn at some point the good guys will fight Lord Voldemort, but it won't be in this film, begging the question, why does this film need to exist? Much like the previous two, it is simply adding in five minutes exposition that might be needed later. There is a bit of a scuffle at the end between the Order of the Phoenix (good guys with white smoke) and the Death-Eaters (bad guys with black smoke) but it is difficult to see who they actually are, and the battle is dull and confusing. Voldemort shows up, looking stupid and rather ill with a flat nose and skinny white arms, in time for a lame ending.<br/><br/>This film is a non-entity, simply setting stuff up for further sequels. At least some day, these will end."

"Lejink","5","1","2","6 May 2008"," Hurry up Harry! (with thanks to Sham 69!)
","I quite like the Harry Potter books and try to read the novel of the film before-hand and so approached ""Order Of The Phoenix"", wondering like many, just how the director could cut a 700 page novel into a just over two hours movie. The conclusion I draw is, very unconvincingly, so much so that it's no surprise to me to learn that the production team behind this money-spinning franchise plan to split the last humungously large novel into two parts. That's not to say that JK Rowling's writing couldn't do with some pruning for the big screen, but certainly on the evidence of this poorly edited instalment, I'm more in favour of the double-up plan. There's's also the dread element of inherent formula-ism, dictated of course by the source novels, following as usual the path of Harry encountering his magical friends and / or enemies in the neighbourhood of Little Whinging, displacement to Hogworts, his in-out tribulations with friends Hermione and Ron, interaction with teachers good and bad, winding up with a big, dramatic climax where nothing is resolved one way or the other - Voldemort always lives to fight another day. It must have been almost impossible for the director to do any more with these base elements than is conjured up here, but even with the introduction of the mildest of love interest (from out of nowhere, or so the film would have it) between Harry and Cho, a reasonably malevolent turn by Imelda Staunton as on-the-make Black Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge and the death at the finale of Harry's beloved godparent, Sirius, the film fails to engage leaving the viewer breathless at the end, certainly admiring of the SFX on show but ultimately dissatisfied that Harry and his cohorts get to the end of the film in no more danger than the last. Victims of the breakneck editing of the piece, to the best of my recollection, are, besides the wholesale extraction of the Quidditch tournament which sees Ron humiliated then redeemed as goal-minder, a series of key scenes that are almost butchered in the rush to get to the end. These include, as hinted earlier, the lack of any meaningful build-up to Harry's kiss with Cho, the revealing of her later complicity in ratting to Umbridge of Harry's behind-her-back dark arts lessons to his school chums, Voldemort's attack on the Weasleys' father, the session with Snape which reveals Harry's parents in their bullying of the young Snape not to be the golden-couple everyone imagined them to be. Most gaping of all is the sly Staunton's fate - the last you see of her she's being whisked away by a bunch of angry centaurs, then at the resolution, you're blandly told in a newspaper montage that she's lost her position as Headteacher. Guess she got away from the centaurs unscathed then..! All this and more flies by in a blur, with very little humour to lighten the load, almost zero characterisation and at the end one feels the way you would as if you've gone through a flight-simulator type ride at a theme park rather than the real deal of an actual roller-coaster. Goodness knows how people who haven't read the novel made sense of it! Maybe the little kids will understand, as Jim Morrison once said, but the more discerning of them and the rest of us, might feel shortchanged by Harry's Gang, this time around."
"claudemercure","8","1","2","6 April 2008"," skillful adaptation
","This is a first: a Harry Potter movie that bests its source. The first, second, and fourth movies were okay at best, and the third one was as good as the book. But book 5 is the weakest of the bunch, and the filmmakers have done what I was hoping they would do - distill it. In the book, Harry's life reaches new levels of miserableness, and he turns into an irritating teenager. Making matters worse for the reader is the fact that the book sorely needs editing; it takes forever to get to Hogwarts. The book is filled with so much unpleasantness that it's a chore to trudge through. Plus, it introduces the series' most annoyingly cutesy secondary character, Tonks.<br/><br/>The movie fixes all that. It looks great and is fast-paced, breezing through the opening pre-school scenes; Harry remains testy, but not overwhelmingly so; and Tonks is now a fun addition. The film also makes the Dumbledore's Army scenes more dynamic and retains the essence of two great new characters, spacey Luna Lovegood and insidious evil incarnate Dolores Umbridge. At the same time, this one suffers from an ailment that plagued its predecessors as well: in attempting to stuff the plot into a 140-minute movie, some depth is inevitably lost. Books 4 to 7 all need to be three-hour epics."

Being a true HP fan since 1999 I can say that the only movies that do any justice to the books are POA ad GOF. Yates took a lot liberties with the movie and made every single character one dimensional. He has taken a great franchise and killed it. I'm sorry if you liked this movie but being a true HP fan I hated it (except for a few parts) but the overall movie stunk.

","The movie has around 30% of the book. They miss a lot of the interesting things such as the wizard sport, St. Mungo's (definately would've wanted to see a wizard hospital), and detail. In the book things progressed slowly and in the movie these things were introduced in whichever way seemed easiest. Like for example when Harry sees Mr. Weasley's attack, he goes to #12 Grimauld place then finds out Dumbledore wants him to learn mind-closing, in the movie after he sees the attack he goes to Dumbledore's office, somehow Dumbledore knew about it before Harry told him, and somehow he called Snape, and after he comes he drags Harry to his office to teach him mind-closing and another weird thing, how did they end up in Grimauld place? nothing makes sense, and in the movie, why did Cho be the sneak and there was no Marrieta? And why were there no acne on Cho's face? And the way Umbridge found out about the DA in the movie was pretty stupid.<br/><br/>And some stupid things were shown which weren't shown in the movie, like Harry and Cho's kiss, although it is understandable being a Hollywood film. And the last showdown between Dumbledore and Voldemort was exaggerated and the fighting against the order and the death eaters could've been shown better. To someone who hasn't ever read Harry Potter, the film is 'exciting' to those who have read- a disappointment. A movie which is mostly different from the book is totally pointless and confusing because it makes it hard to make the next film mainly because they have to make the themes same as the last movie, causing a plot change.

And because the directing is fine, visual effects are good, actors are very strong, and the story is still interesting although it's the 5th episode, I think this movie deserves an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>However, I must sat this is a HUGE disappointment for the book readers like me. I think the best adaptations were episode 1 and 2. Episode 3 was worse, 4 was worse than that. 5 is the worst adaptation by far. There were so many scenes in our heads (like the OWL exams where Harry makes charms in front of teachers, or Quidditch) which were taken out. I believe they don't have the right to kill the book like that. They could have made 2 movies, or simply make the movie 2 and a half hours.

How lazy can a director get? I knew all the characters, general histories and motivations; the settings were familiar; and I knew the basic plot from seeing the trailers... but I had not a clue as to what in the blue blazes was going on. I had to stop the DVD, go online and check to make sure I'd actually seen ""Goblet of Fire"". Cripes!<br/><br/>Do not pay money to see this - especially if you've never read the books!

There is SO much wrong with this film, not least of all the length -- it must've taken four hours for me to stagger through this dreck, what with all the clarity-rewinding, sleep-resisting coffee-brewing, and sanity-requiring break-taking.<br/><br/>I could keep ranting on, but you get the idea. Now, since almost no movie is *perfectly* lousy, and since I give this one 3/10 (for the visuals and general theme) I feel I should say something positive. Okay, hmm... I'm positive I'll never watch this again. (Hey, the good comedy isn't free.)"
"lord_jeanquev","5","1","2","1 January 2008"," Left Wanting more
","Im sorry but of the 5 films so far this is the one I like the least. I'm sure a large part of that comes from having read the book before seeing this film something I had not done up until now. The pace of this movie feels to rushed and things that should be in the movie from the book to make the audience better understand what is happening are not there. When you finish watching this film you will feel cheated. It doesn't matter whether you have read the books or not (I have read all seven my wife none). She was left confused in several parts of the movie because they failed to adapt so many key parts from the book. They should have shot for a longer running time and covered more from the book I know you can not shove everything into a film that is in a book, but when you get down it should not feel as if watched the movie on fast forward just to get somewhere on time. 138 minutes is hardly enough time to do the story right. Have they not learned that people will sit for a 3 hour movie if its done right. Even shooting for slightly more than 2 hours would have helped this film.<br/><br/>Now was everything in the fill a wash? Heavens no it has a few saving graces. First and foremost is the introduction of Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). Evanna pulls off the role wonderfully as the quirky, abnormal, kind hearted heroin. She was to me the brightest point of the whole film Not to be undone Imelda Staunton does a wonderful job of bringing Umbridge to life. In much the same way that she forces herself into a power position of Hogwarts she forces her way into the film almost stealing the Villain role from voldermort.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the books I believe overall this film will leave you confused at times. Those who have read the books will feel the annoyment of knowing why tings went the way they did but were not shown more of the background to the story. I can only hope that they decided to run the next two films a bit longer perhaps even entertaining the idea to split The Deathly Hallows into two films."
"zdaniel89","1","1","2","30 December 2007"," Ummmm . . . no! Bad director!
","Jeez. I was supremely disappointed with this film. Did anyone else walk out of the theatre going, ""Where was Peeves?"" Granted, they didn't include the poltergeist in any of the previous films, but in the previous books, his role is minimal at best. In Order of the Phoenix, he is a major player against the ministry's controlling influence at Hogwarts: Umbridge. Now, I liked the fight in the Department of Mysteries, don't get me wrong. Maybe some of the people who liked this film have lower standards than myself, but I am of the most sincere opinion that if you're going to make a book into a movie, that you should include every single minuscule detail. Turn the book into a movie, so to speak, instead of merely ""adapting"" the book like so many do. Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix disappointed me beyond anything I could have foreseen.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but if the sixth and seventh movies are going to be anything like the third through the fifth, then maybe they shouldn't make the movies at all."
"joesgirljeri","2","1","2","30 December 2007"," Flat-out disappointment
","How can a movie be filled with actors who are flat, boring and don't come near the emotional potential of Rowling's original characters, yet be so hyper-active and jumpy that you feel like you're going to have a seizure? If this sounds like a fun movie experience, this is the movie for you! <br/><br/>The mark of a good movie is that you can totally immerse yourself in the story, feel for the characters and pass the time believing in the world that the director has created for you. If you are constantly being pulled out of the story thinking ""what the H was that all about??"" or ""wow, this guy couldn't act his way out of a paper bag!!"" then the movie is worth nothing more than the plastic it's printed on.<br/><br/>Book/movie story comparisons aside, I simply don't know how you could possibly understand this movie without having read the book. I'm sure there are lots of people out there who do watch only the movies and I wonder how the story translates to them? Can you understand the complex snippets of disjointed story that are being thrown at you? Or are you just mindlessly slavering over Dan Radcliff's pale skinny body and have no brain cells left for anything else? Yup... that's what I thought. Quit being mad and go back to your Tiger Beat fantasy. The one where you're slathering sunblock on Danny boy. Lots and lots of sunblock...<br/><br/>I think the biggest frustration with this movie is all the unrealized potential. The humor from the Weasley twins. The evil, power-hungry wretch of Dolores Umbridge. Instead she's played as a slightly pompous Queen Mother. Boring! The furious and unpredictable teen-angst from Harry (I'm not sure Radcliff's acting ability could have pulled it off, so maybe it's OK they skipped that part). Sirius in the movie is just... bizarre. Not a lovable godfather but more of a weirdo goth recluse.<br/><br/>The visual effects are getting better - at least there are no rubber-band stretchy people like in Sorcerer's Stone. But everything is deliberately changed and shot so fast and from strange angles that you lose the story trying not to vomit from the shifting screen perspective (aka Blair Witch).<br/><br/>I hate how each new director has to put his own little ""spin"" on the story to make it his own. Get with the program guys! So, back to the mark of a good movie. I couldn't watch more than 4 minutes of the story without wanting to reach through the screen and poke Radcliffe in the eye to see if I could elicit any kind of emotion. The rest of the characters were mildly annoying. The special effects have probably caused several thousand undocumented cases of epilepsy. And at the end of the movie I didn't feel anything about any person, good or bad. So, as a movie experience this one fails utterly. After Goblet of Fire I had really resolved to be done with the movies, but I heard that this one was not that bad. Apparently I need to learn that ""not that bad"" still means ""not very good either""."
"yoyo22008","1","1","2","24 December 2007"," Worst movie I've seen this year
","WOW! I honestly could not even sit through this one. The fight scene was just horrible, all of the parts that were set at Hogwarts were choppy and could not have been more boring, the scene where the brothers leave is too toned down, and overall, the movie doesn't follow the book at all. I mean really, the 5th book had a TON of useful plot and the director and screenwriter threw it out the window.<br/><br/>I must say that I would not be surprised if they decide not to make a 6th movie. And unless the director and screenwriter from the first movie come back, the next one won't be worth the dollar it costs to rent it from redbox. These movies have been going downhill since the first one, and I'm not surprised at the rumors that Rolling wants to control the last two. She put PLENTY of good material into the books, and none of it comes across in the movie. I regret buying this movie."

","Let's put it this way, this movie was very good. However, there's SO much more they could've done with it. I do realize they had to condense such a huge book into a 2 hour movie, but they left out way too much for MY liking. I felt it was more rushed than it should've been. Those who have read the book will know what I mean when they watch the movie. At the end of the movie I was conflicted: How could JK Rowling say this was the best of the Harry Potter movies when they left out such a large amount of significant details from the book? Don't get me wrong I really like this movie, but I was expecting much better.<br/><br/>Quick Notes Story: 6/10 (a lot left out) Acting: 8/10 (great performances) Direction: 7/10 (could've done much better) Visuals: 9/10 (stellar special effects, sets, etc.)<br/><br/>Final Grade: 7.5/10"

","What shall I say about this movie.. I admit, that the special effects where great. I admit, that the actors did a very good job indeed. But other than that, watching the movie made me really angry. So many things where missing. So many things have been changed, I don't know why? For more drama or sense, or what? I know that it's not possible to adapt a book on screen taking every part of it, but one should stick to the facts and not change basic subjects into something totally different from the book. <br/><br/>And where was the main thread running through the movie??? Nowhere. People who have not read the book can't understand why things happen when they happen, or why there is a cut in the scene and it starts somewhere else and no one knows what happened in the meantime... The complete movie seems to me like shot as an commercial; 30 second shots and then simply assembled. <br/><br/>It is true, it wasn't the best book at all, but does this mean that they had to do an even worser movie? I understand that even J.K. Rowling said that she has to differ between the books and the movies, but as I said before: You have to stick to the facts!!! And not to just change them because someone thinks that it might be more dramatic or the viewers reaction could be more effective or whatever. And why David Yates?? Because of his amazing work as an director before??? Most of his experience is based on TV-Episodes and mini-series. (That might be an explanation that the movie seems to me like short shots without main thread and then just simply put together). <br/><br/>Well at least I hope that the makers and J.K. Rowling of course, learned from their mistakes. Think about The Deadly Hallows and ask yourself: Would you like to see the last chapter of Harry Potter done like that?? There's so much action and Drama and different locations and tons of stuff in it. So many details which I, or better we, want to see on the screen. Who should we trust to write and direct such a movie?? I just can think of Peter Jackson and his writer crew, who already did an amazing job by giving us three of the best writing adapted movies ever made...<br/><br/>So, let's hope...."

Didn't have a clue about the book. Apparently drinking the same stuff these people who rated the movie highly were drinking.<br/><br/>I rated it a 3 just because it did give us some decent visuals.<br/><br/>It deserves an immediate rewrite by someone who isn't an idiot.<br/><br/>I dread the next 2 movies thanks to this garbage.

However I watched it, and I saw that there was nothing really special about this fifth part of the Harry Potter series. Don't get me wrong, the book was great, but I was disappointed with the way it was adapted on screen. They could have made it a lot better, as they did with the previous films. The relationship between Cho and Harry could have had more potential and a much clearer and cleaner ending, as it is in the book. But it's necessary to see the film to watch what comes next in the Harry Potter series. Let's just hope that the Half-Blood Prince will be better than this one."
"siit","2","1","2","5 December 2007"," The Rocky Five and death knell of the Harry Potter Franchise
","I haven't read the books and maybe Order of the Phoenix (OOTP) is an accurate telling of the book. But for me, I have lost all affection for the Harry Potter franchise. OOTP is too dark, too complicated and has lost the magic that endeared me to the blockbusting phenomena that the first two Harry Potter's instilled.<br/><br/>I understand that the saga must advance and Harry and Ron et al must evolve as they age, but the look, feel and sound of OOTP bears little resemblance to the first two (and even the third). The story for me is so disjointed from the fourth and the glaring anomalies and pure stupid plot holes are unforgivable. There's nothing really new to delight, the pacing is slow and laborious and the characters become annoying and wooden.<br/><br/>I have said this before in previous Harry Potter reviews, but Gambon's portrayal is terrible, and I find myself constantly mourning Richard Harris' passing. I just do not like Gambon's work in the franchise. He has ruined all credibility of the all powerful but controlled Headmaster. But his performance aside, I feel all the actors seemed to be bored and no one stood out- with the exception of Imelda Staunton's portrayal of Dolores Umbridge. I seriously disliked Umbridge, and we are supposed to, but I felt no joy in her demise, no one stepped up to the plate. Ron Weasley and Granger were token appearances, Radcliffe's performance was wooden and amateurish, and Gary Oldman, and especially Maggie Smith and Emma Thomson, had little to do. Voldermort's appearance was nothing special and the supposed highlights of the movie was at best a yawn fest.<br/><br/>I do not like this movie and have no interest in further installments in the franchise. My eleven year old son (who has not read the books) was left scratching his head saying it was too complicated, he didn't understand parts, and it had lost it's magic... I couldn't agree more."

I walked into this film with such HIGH expectations to only be let down!! The scenes were too choppy! Although, now that the young wizards and witches are growing up it is cool to see a darker side to the HP film series. However, I would liked to have seen a much better edited version of Film #5.<br/><br/>Despite my disapproval and disappointment of this film, I still would recommend any HP fan to go see this movie -- don't cheat yourself out of an HP experience just because the ratings aren't the best.<br/><br/>No matter how the HP film turns out to be like it is very difficult to cram a huge plot into a 2.5 hour film.

It is actually indescribable ... just pure genius. Anyway the film is very good the director has really taken into account about the gist of the film and made one amazing movie because the plot in th book is so clever the film just has to be good. Umbridge played her part well and it gives you a sense of what the characters are when you read the books you can relate the characters to the one's that played them in the film. In short Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is brilliant definitely deserves the ten out of ten"
"squire6433","1","1","2","28 August 2007"," Horrible
","So I am assuming that the man who wrote the screen play for this movie got drunk and read spark notes instead of actually reading the book. The was by far the worst movie adaptation of a book I have ever seen. Nothing flowed what so ever. Nothing was explained. Not once did they explain why Percy had a look of loathing on his face when he saw Harry Potter. Luna used the levicorpus spell even though first of all Harry doesn't even learn that spell until the next book and second of all, that spell is a non-verbal spell. The picture of the original Order of the Phoenix it showed ""Mad Eye"" Moody with his magical eye but in the book Goblet of Fire we found out that during that time, ""Mad Eye"" had two regular eyes. How is it that the Wesley twins are going to disrupt the test for the O.W.L.s and they don't show them having to re-take them. The movie did not show how Harry, Fred, and George were kicked off the Quidditch team and that Ron and Ginny made the team. Quidditch was never even brought up once during the entire movie even though in my opinion it was important to show the growth in the character of Ron by becoming a good keeper. I wonder how they will explain the sudden arrive of Ron and Ginny to the Quidditch team in the next movie. There are many other reasons why I was disgusted by this movie but I do not feel like discussing them. All in all, I would have to say that this is the worst Harry Potter movie ever made and if the next two are anything like it, I do believe that Harry Potter fan base will dropped significantly."

","Having seen every Potter film theatrically at various times of the day I was always saddled with an audience full of little children. Immediately I was irritated knowing the running about, talking, asking questions etc. that seemed to happen in every Disney, family film I was going to go see. Well what happened was sheer silence and little faces glued to the screen for 2 1/2 hours which is a major achievement and this happened on films 1-4. I took my nieces who are 8 and 10 and love all things harry potter and they were bored wanting to leave. I've loved every Harry Potter film as a movie and thought they were all very good adaptations from the books, except this one. This may end up sounding like a rant but first, whatever happened to having any humor. The books have loads of humor but as each film has progressed any sense of fun or whimsy has been removed. I'm tired of all this oooh its gotta be dark these movies have gotta be dark. Yeah the books get darker but this film was joyless and boring, I saw it 3 times slept twice to try to convince myself it was me. First the film looks like they cut the budget in half, its too dark and i don't mean tone, I mean I couldn't see too much. They did some kind of desaturated film grading that made it look like some cheap sci-fi channel movie of the week knock off. I still think chamber of secrets is the darkest of all the films, with goblet of fire coming in second. Order was one of my favorite books in the series but they managed to make it the worst film, actually the only bad harry potter film. Nothing happens in this movie except *Spoiler alert (Harry has nightmares of voldemort, goes to order of pheonix where there's lots of talking about nothing, goes back to school ends up (still don't remember how) at the ministry, there's a fight, minor character dies very undramatically and its over. End spoiler.) Anyways of all the books this one had the perfect excuse to have a bad ass action sequence, the wizards duel where the adults actually get in the action, but its over before it starts. There is no momentum in this film, things just happen. The sceenplay is the main problem, second is the TV director cuz it plays like a made for TV film. It also seems they used a television director cuz they're used to shooting fast and on a way lower budget. This film felt small in the imax cinemas, All four previous entries felt like massive epics in comparison. This will be the only one I won't own on DVD."

","You can tell that the screenplay writer, Greenberg could NOT have thoroughly read and digested the previous 4 stories. While the movie was good on its own, it omitted potentially entertaining and vital scenes from the book. Most notably were the numerous exchanges in the book between McGonagall and Umbridge, the swamp spell perpetrated by the Weasley twins, and the animosity between Umbridge and the Centaurs. And Firenze was totally omitted as the replacement for Trelawny! OMG, how could THAT be?? I'm relieved that Steve Kloves is doing the screenplay for Half-Blood Prince. The integrity of the overall storyline SHOULD be restored with the return of Kloves' writing talent. As others have said, while I'm a fanatical fan of the series, Order of the Phoenix was the least successful transition of book to film."

","As a great fan of the books, I went to see this movie as I had done for the last 4. And it proved to be the worst ever! I had thought I had been disappointed by film 2 & 4, (1 is excusable) because they were children's films, but then I hadn't seen this one: It's not as if they were lacking the money to pay for screenwriters, good actors, and a director who knows what he's doing. My main point of criticism is the lack of coherent story-telling: Even if they had good reason to reinvent the story and change everything around; still editing a movie is about more than just chopping some scenes and putting them together! I completely missed a golden threat! It's like in a puzzle where the pieces are related but don't quite fit! And then it isn't really surprising that even though we find some really good puzzle pieces, such as Alan Rickman's brilliant performance of Snape or Staunton's Umbridge, the final sum is (a lot) less than its components! Which , I believe, is a great pity, for: not only contains this book more fundamental ideas (DA coins, the locket, Kreacher, the two way mirror, the Ministry...) and people( Bellatrix mainly, some Death Eaters, Tonks, Kingsley...) that will be developed further in future books, than any other book so far, it also lives by its great detail and most of all: by Harry's EMOTIONS. But where were they????? <br/><br/>@Mr Radcliffe, what exactly is your definition of range, shouting, terror, the so important mourning for Sirius, the devastation ???? I didn't see any!!!!<br/><br/>Sirius's death scene was completely lost; without managing to convey any feeling/shock/sadness!! And I'm convinced that it was not Mr Oldman's fault. It was just lousily directed [-->just remember the death of Gandalf in LOTR 1 for comparison] ! <br/><br/>@Ms Watson, why do you use such a peculiar way of panting when speaking of emotionally touching things? don't! It looks ridiculous.<br/><br/>@ Mr Gambon, you seem to be under the impression, that Dumbledore is a over-energetic, dim-witted 23 year-old, well, I suggest: you re-read the book! <br/><br/>@Mrs (Dame) Smith, being used to your usual performances: I really expected better!!!<br/><br/>@ Mr Fiennes, in Red Dragon, you scared the living daylights out of me without doing any (black) magic and in HP: you're laughing stock!<br/><br/>@ Mrs Thompson: What's your understanding of ""crying out your heart""?? I could see nothing of Trelawny's devastation and utter loss of confidence in your interpretation of the sacking scene!<br/><br/>---I could go on forever....<br/><br/>And of course, the screenplay.... well, let's just say this much: IT HAS NOTHING GOT TO DO WITH J.K. ROWLINGS BOOK! Why they changed basically every scene, I cannot see! Why they cut important details, that would have been easy to bring in and yet wasted minutes on Filch hanging up yet another of Umbridge's degrees???? I'm really wondering how they're gonna manage to stuff them in the next film.... There really is no excuse for ruining the continuity and smoothness of the film, some parts of the story are stretched unbearably (like the DA scenes) others so very much rushed (Snape's memory, Dumbledore's ""office"")... *shakingmyhead*<br/><br/>Please: next time bear in mind the following: <br/><br/>1) -either cut something or don't but don't do some weird compromise!<br/><br/>2)- Leave those great actors, you have cast, room to develop the characters (that feature was absent in this film !) <br/><br/>3) -Teach the kid-actors the meaning and importance of dialogue! (for the little dialogue encountered in this movie was pretty much lost)<br/><br/>4) -Take time to process the book's content and ""think"" before you translate it into a screenplay (also taking into account those books to come)!<br/><br/>5)- Well and last but not least: GET PETER JACKSON TO DIRECT THE NEXT ONES !

"jackjones727272","7","1","2","22 August 2007"," Harry Potter 5 is good, but not good enough
","Wow, a lot to say for Harry Potter 5. First of all, I think that with a book this good, the directors can't really mess this movie up too much. That's a good thing for the directors, because they really messed up on some major parts of this movie. <br/><br/>First, the good things. I thought the casting for the characters of Luna Lovegood, Dolores Umbridge, and Bellatrix Lestrange were done very well. The acting, for the most part, was well done in this movie, and the casting continues to be excellent (with the exception of Grawp.) The movie certainly had a lot of action in it, and I actually liked what they did with the scene in the department of mysteries.<br/><br/>Now for the bad. Ron and Hermione together had about one full sentence of dialog in this movie. Draco barely came into the movie at all. I think David Yates is forming his own opinion of what should have been shown in this movie (I mean, the whole thing was spent on the DA meetings.) This is a big mistake, I think Yates is forgetting what a huge success this book was, and thinks he needs to add stuff in. A couple other things: (1) Make the movie an hour longer. I felt as though I was watching a bunch of clips thrown together.(2) Get a new Dumbledore. The first guy was perfect, this guy, far from it. He has way too rough a personality for the part. (3) Stay true to the book. For example, if somebody hadn't read the books and just seen the movie, he would have said, why is Harry upset about Sirius dying. They try to make it so that people who don't bother to read the book will oooh and aaah by the special effects, but not get the actual plot. (4) Finally, either make Daniel Radcliffe take acting lessons, or get a new one. He was great through the second one, and after that, went downhill. It is really hard to sympathize with him in the movie, because he is portrayed as some whiny brat and not a hero.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: See the movie, it's worth it. But to live up at all to the book, David Yates needs to make a lot of changes."

Even at 2:40, the movie definitely dragged, and yet they try to capture key plot points in 5 seconds at best. It seemed that they filmed a lot more than was shown, and edited out everything that seemed not 100% necessary to explain what was happening. However, adding a line here or there COULD have explained enough to the casual fan. For example, why not say that the Weasley Twins decided to quit school and go into business? That's one line of dialogue - and it would help explain why they would risk expulsion by flying through the OWL exam room making fireworks.<br/><br/>In the book, Harry getting kicked out of Hogwarts was a BIG DEAL. That's his ENTIRE LIFE - yes, it's a big deal. In the film, he's mildly upset, and quickly gets voted back in. In the book, Umbridge takes each teacher, one by one, to task and humiliates them in front of their own classes. In the film, she speaks one line in each class, and we're supposed to see that as bad behavior.<br/><br/>Very disappointing. How Yates gets the next HP movie before this one was even released is beyond me. Perhaps he learned something from this one, however, and the next one will be better."

","After the extreme disappointment of the 4th HP movie (Goblet of Fire), I didn't really have any hopes for OOTP at all. When it came closer and closer though, I began to hear good things about it and was open-minded when I went into the theater...whaddaya know, I got disappointed AGAIN! Don't get me wrong, there were good things about the movie. I thought casting on Luna Lovegood was especially good. I loved how they made the Ministry look. I even liked the last battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore, even though it wasn't entirely faithful to the book.<br/><br/>Now to the bad things.<br/><br/>They completely left out LOTS of subplots from the book, both important, and unimportant. Some of them wouldn't even take more than 5 or 10 minutes more of screen time. The actress who played Umbridge had the character of the book version down exactly, but she didn't look ANYTHING like how they described her in the books, which was a letdown. Tonks wasn't at all how the book makes her out to be. The plot became a complete mess sometimes, and you wouldn't understand some of it if you hadn't read the book.<br/><br/>Overall, some of the biggest things I was mad at, were just the little touches that they change from the book for NO reason at all. It makes no sense. For one, the ""stupefy"" spell is bluish instead of red, which is mentioned TONS of times in the books. Luna yelling out ""LEVICORPUS"" and then a guy flying off was totally ridiculous, as thats not even what it does, it doesn't even appear in the 5th book, and thats gonna cause all sorts of messed up things for the 6th movie, as that spell was a big part of the plot in book 6.<br/><br/>And finally, one of my ""pet peeves"" so to speak(sorry about that one heh), was that not one of the movies yet has had Peeves. Peeves for those of you who haven't read the books, is a hilarious poltergeist that bothers the people in the school and plays pranks all the time. Book 5 contains his shining moment, where when Fred and George are leaving the school they yell, ""Give her hell for us Peeves!"" and he salutes them and does exactly what they told him to do.<br/><br/>Anyways, I've ranted enough. To summarize, alright movie i guess, but not if you are a fan of the books. 5/10"
"amberoelliott","7","1","2","8 August 2007"," It's all in the detail...
","I decided to leave it a week or two after seeing Order of the Phoenix to let it level a little in my mind. Mainly because I was really disappointed after coming out the cinema and if I were to have written this review then, I think it would have given the wrong impression!<br/><br/>I will also point out that I am an avid reader of the books. However, I only got into them very recently and so this is the first film version I have seen after reading the book (not the best way round I'm afraid). I wish I could have waited for the film to come out before reading the damm book but there you go, what's done is done!<br/><br/>So to the review<br/><br/>Firstly, the look of the film is pretty much what I imagined. There is of course large chunks of storyline taken out for timing reasons (though the film could have been 20 minutes longer, it would have made all the difference), but as to what is there, it looks good, it's fast paced and entertaining. The shots have the right amounts of darkness and mystery (though funnily enough not as dark as Azkaban) and the new characters (Umbridge, Bellatrix and Tonks) and places make the story grow with excitement of what's to come. What's missing is detail!<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying that I expected to see the whole book transposed on to screen (it was a bloody big book) but there were certain things that were merely touched upon that should have had an extra few minutes, just to give the film clarity, rather than filling it with amusing montages of Filch and Umbridge giving children horrible detentions.<br/><br/>On the good side, the child leads have also grown in appearance as well as acting ability (I had to keep reminding my friend how oooohing over the young Harry Potter was wrong in so many ways). Though to be honest the more I watch then the less I notice. Daniel is far better in this one and I've never had a problem with Ron. Hermione is still a little wooden but it never makes me as half as angry as watching Keira Knightly ""act"" so I'll get it pass!<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, they are wonderful as usual and under used! But we should be used to this by know I guess. Luckily, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon and everyone I haven't named at Hogwarts are such gems of England; they steal every scene they are in, even if it's just a look (especially Rickman). The Hogwarts Staff are also joined my the elusive Order of the Phoenix, which along with most of the above names we are joined once again by Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Brendon Gleason of the 3rd and 4th movies and regular sweethearts Julie Walters and Mark Williams, not to mention newbie Tonks played by Natalia Tena (barely introduced) who have re-banded together to raise an Army to fight Voldermort. <br/><br/>But no one will tell Harry Potter anything. He's not heard from his two best friends all summer and now has been called in front of the Ministry because he used magic outside school, defending himself (and his cousin Dudley) from Dementors. Worst of all, the powers at the Ministry refuse to believe the Dark Lord is back, calling Harry a liar and they've sent a she-devil in the form of new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher Dolores Umbridge to keep an eye out at Hogwarts. <br/><br/>There's only one option left. Rebellion!<br/><br/>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with Order of the Phoenix, it's an action packed, entertaining story and nearly everything that's stuffed into the 138 minute film is as I imagined. The acting is fantastic, praise to Imelda Staunton, it's exactly how I imagined she's be and the original story is there, I just hope that they've put enough of the detail in needed to explain it all when they finally make Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows!<br/><br/>Still not the atmostphere of Azkaban but bloody entertaining! But looses marks on detail!"
"suzannadavi","7","1","2","7 August 2007"," Too much story to fit into a standard length movie
","This film was an okay bridge to the next sequence of events. I guess all readers feel sorry for those who have only ""seen the movie"" rather than read the books... More than ever I would encourage anyone with a slight interest in the books but no time or inclination to read the hefty tomes to LISTEN to them on CD or tape or MP3. There is no way they could give anything more than a fast sketch of events for the last 3 books. This one felt a little wooden in spots simply because the characters other than Harry were given so little time on screen to develop their characters. I still enjoyed it but unlike the previous Potter films I don't have a special desire to see it again. Alan Rickman is still totally hot :-)"
"gsygsy","4","1","2","5 August 2007"," room for improvement
","This is the first of Potter films of which I felt I'd have done well to have read the book so that I could be let into the story more fully. The earlier movies, for all their faults, entertained me on their own terms, whereas with this one I was aware of time ticking by, so I was clearly not engrossed in it. What remains of an unquestionably high standard is the seemingly never-ending supply of excellent UK actors. Imelda Staunton makes a contribution that would be outstanding in any movie: I hope she wins recognition for it when the awards come around. There is also some engaging work from the youngsters: Daniel Radcliffe has become a good young actor - perhaps unsurprising, considering he's been able to learn from the very best. Unfortunately, Emma Watson's gifts seem to be travelling in the opposite direction: she is effortlessly outshone by newcomer Evanna Lynch.Or maybe Hermione is just a duller role.<br/><br/>The author's fully-imagined world is what appeals to me about these films - though it is not sufficiently appealing to impel me towards her doorstop novels. I appreciate that it is extremely difficult to capture the detail of a work of literature on screen. I can also understand that Ms Rowling and her filmmakers feel an obligation to the hordes of young fans who want to see as much of the books as possible on the screen. Until now these adaptations have trodden a pretty much successful path. I hope they find their way again for the last two outings."
"heenz-war-pig","10","1","2","3 August 2007"," Darker, better and grown-up!
","Being a hardcore Potter fan, in both books and on the big screen, I though 'Yates has got to put almost 900 hundred pages into 2 hours and 15 minutes' and i expected like the other films, it would just be a mediocre adaptation. Boy was I wrong! To begin with, Potter 5 was much darker. It pushed it to the borders of a 12 film and almost into a 15. You might think that's bad, but people love to be on the edge of their seat and love to be frightened and Potter does and immense job on that front. It's not just a mellow film with a scary climax, it's dark all the way through. Also, Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have grown up in their acting big time. The film is set in the period of the characters adolescence, the period in your life where you start to say 'I don't agree with that' and Radcliffe and the others don't fall short on that front. Oldman and Staunton also give great performances as Sirius Black and Dolores Umbridge, but Alan Rickman outclasses both on the sinister front, merely by raising an eyebrow, as his performance is truly the definition of sinister. Finally, there is more action, which keeps the viewer in suspense and keeps them interested. This time round, they also managed to cut out minor parts of the book, which doesn't leave out vital information, unlike the other versions. All in all, Potter 5 is a fantastic, dark and action packed film which is enjoyable for anyone and I recommend it, even if the other films have put you off."

"annawa","10","1","2","30 July 2007"," The best Harry Potter movie to date
","Even though this movie doesn't follow the book exactly and doesn't contain all the plot lines that the book does, it still is my favorite Harry Potter movie to date. David Yates definitely did a great job with capturing the tone and the spirit of the fifth Harry Potter book (which happened to be one of my favorites in the series), and Dan, Emma, and Rupert's acting just continues to improve. Dan especially shone in this movie, displaying Harry's complex emotions and his relationship with Sirius perfectly. Rupert's acting caught me off guard with how good it was as well- his scenes really showed that there's more to Ron than just the comic relief he's served so far in the movies. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD--- The scene in the Ministry of Magic where Harry is possessed by Voldemort was, by far, one of the best in the movie. I personally liked that scene more in the movie than I did in the book- but that's just my opinion, of course. Also, the kiss scene was excellent and followed the book perfectly, and the scene following it in the Gryffindor common room was absolutely hilarious. --END SPOILERS<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this movie absolutely blew me away; I thought it was even better than- dare I say it?- John Williams' compositions for the first three films. Nicholas Hooper's compositions seemed to perfectly possess the magical yet dark characteristics of the movie. The special effects were amazing as well- the thestrals looked almost exactly as how I had pictured them in the books, and the scenes of them flying over London were excellent. Do I hear another special effects Oscar nomination for the film? <br/><br/>Basically, if you're not one of those people who insists on the movies following the books exactly, you should like this movie. I laughed, I cried, I sat on the edge of my seat with anticipation (even though I knew what was going to happen); I tip my hat to David Yates for a job well done and can't wait to see what he does with the sixth movie!"

The flow of the story is shaky at best. The film is titled order of the phoenix but does very little to be involved regarding what the order of the phoenix is, who they are etc. It seems that the cinema's have been waiving their arms again not wanting long movies so they can have more showing which has completely destroyed this movie. I was very annoyed that although i had not read the book I could clearly see it had been hacked. Actual fans who read the book prepare to get upset."
"lastdomino","5","1","2","29 July 2007"," Music Matters
","Perhaps with Book 7 coming out a couple of weeks later, I never really was excited about this film. However, when I finally did see it I was pleased with some parts and very disappointed with others.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the director did instruct Michael Gambon better this time and while I still don't really like him in the role of Albus Dumbledore, the performance was an improvement over the last film. Imelda Stanton was absolutely perfect as Umbridge - she almost looked like a pink toad - and the cats were wonderful.<br/><br/>Also, aspects of the books that had been ignored were returned to this book. Only Harry would call the Dark Lord, Voldemort. EVERY one else called him 'You Know Who'. <br/><br/>Another positive was the exit of the twins which had to be spectacular though I did miss the swamp. A bit earlier than in the book but I felt that as long as every one stays in character, a bit of change to the story is acceptable.<br/><br/>However, I am not sure that someone who has not read the book would truly have been able to understand the film. Like Book 4's film, it felt somewhat disjointed. Knowing that the upcoming films are getting more intense, it is probably time to accept that the only people seeing the films will have to have read the books.<br/><br/>The one thing I felt didn't help the film was the music. Because Books 1 - 3 were filmed with John Williams' music, a high standard had been set. Patrick Doyle was OK enough for the 4th film and I am willing to listen to the soundtrack album. However, the music for this film was just plain bad. It came in too bombastic in places with no direction. There was nothing about it that would make me want to listen to it again and again (I am a soundtracks buff so I do listen to a lot of movie soundtracks). It did not move me in anyway and for the first time in a very long time I left during the end credits. It just did not impress me at all.<br/><br/>There are many films that have done poorly that might have done better with different music. With the high standard already set for the Harry Potter series, they may want to return to bigger named composers."

"tahir_nasser","7","1","2","26 July 2007"," Err...No.
","I thought this was a good, solid movie. gotta agree that they've got progressively better, but thats not necessarily because of the acting. Let's face it, out of the 3 main characters: Ron, Hermione and Harry, only Ron can act. The other two are shockingly bad. Each film takes about 8/9 months to film, and they've done 5 of them. That's FIVE. How long does it take to get into character? Does Daniel Radcliffe have to look indecisive the WHOLE time; does Emma Thomson/Watson (can't quite remember) HAVE to look as if her brain is hurting ALL the time. It would be nice to have some sort of a semblance of reality from these two actors, mind you i thought Radcliffe acted well when he was being possessed by Ole' Voldy. Older actors were good, especially liked the choice for Bellatrix. But honestly. You could go into any theater and probably pick out better actors that Harry and Emma. In fact, try any school."
"cowperadam","8","1","2","26 July 2007"," The worst in the series.
","I am a massive fan of the Potter series and my expectations for this film were very high. Yates has recreated many sequences from the book yet has neglected to provide us any of the genuinely emotional moments that define the series. The book (as i see it) is about family (Harry and Sirius, the Blacks, The Weasleys, The Longbottoms) and the terrifying prospect of something horrific happening to our loved ones. The danger is more real than ever, loved ones are getting hurt. This is defined in the book by the scene that really had to be in the film yet tragically wasn't... Mrs Weasley and the Boggart. We should care about the characters like they care for each other. Its difficult to care for a bunch of cameos, with screen time so short and characterisation near non existent, it feels like watching a sequence of events that you really don't care about. Harry's relationship with Sirius is underdeveloped and Sirius's murder wasn't the hero's death he deserved. This film is the worst in the series."
"cherriedawn2001","8","1","2","26 July 2007"," If you have not seen the movie it may give some opinions away.
","I agree the movie was alright but way to many important facts were removed. Even my son noticed that about 4 chapters in one area were removed. Voldemort must not be much of a wizard Mr. Weasley did not even end up that hurt after the attack. The book shows that he almost dies the movie shows that he gets hurt. The fact that Harry feels guilty about Sirius' death could have been shown better if we understood more about harry and Voldemort's connection. If we also understood how hard Sirius tries to help even though he is told not to. There should have been more about Neville's parents that is an important piece about his character for later movies unless he just going to get dropped out. This movie shows more about the character relationships but does not explain the hardships that they go through. With Harry and Choe, their break up brings him to his next love but it does not even show that he is a normal young teen who likes girls."
"jaredmobarak","6","1","2","21 July 2007"," Naughty children deserve to be punishedHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
","For starters, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was by far my least favorite book in the series. Not much happens until the end, which is actually pretty good, there is a lot of repetition through the beginning of the story, and Harry's adolescent anger and temper just get plain annoying. After enjoying how the fourth book was adapted onto film, I was hoping we'd get more of the same here with a distilled version where main plot is paramount and the detentions and acting out cut down immensely. At first I thought I was going to be very happy. The film starts off great with Dudley and Harry in the London playground where the Dementors attack. Just having a sequence in a Potter film outdoors and not at Hogwarts was a welcome sight and everything pretty much went as planned. There were some exclusions when the boys arrived back home, most noticeably the absence of Mundungus, but I was willing to look past them. Even in the early time at Hogwarts, Potter has one outburst of anger and it seems that would be it. I was ready to ease into the tale and enjoy the ride, but that comfortability never occurred. <br/><br/>I will say that the acting was par for the course. We have a few new characters and as a result see less of those we have come to love. McGonagall is almost nonexistentwhich means her attack is not used hereand she was the one person who stood up against new teacher Dolores Umbridge; Draco is a blink and you'll miss him role; and the Order itself are hardly seen until the climatic ending and that's a lot of decent paychecks for little work. Even Hermione and Ron have their roles shrunk in order to keep a big spotlight on newcomer Imelda Staunton's Umbridge. She is the main antagonist of the story so I understood the large focus on her, and Staunton is wonderful in the role. My problem was that she was made into an evil witch. In the book, although misguided in her thought process, she was not a vicious psychopath as she is shown to be here. Umbridge always did what she thought was right and allowed by the Ministry of Magic, however, her cinematic counterpart turns about halfway in, once her power is increased at the school. She becomes a monster doing anything she wants, at one point physically abusing a child, and even about to use the Cruciatus Curse on a minor, (I don't quite remember that one happening in the book, although I could be wrong). Maybe the reason I disliked the book was because she wasn't evil enough and Potter couldn't necessarily justify his anger, and in that regard, maybe the filmmakers needed to up the ante. However, by seeing this new incarnation, I have to say her wrong decisions in the novel were more believable because at least she thought she had her mind in the right place and wasn't just being a vindictive crazy woman.<br/><br/>Besides this tonal change with Umbridge, I was disappointed in all the differences from the novel. **If you haven't read the story there are spoilers in this paragraph** This film was by far the least like the book, and that should have been a good thing, but unfortunately for me it was not. Besides things happening out of order, Trelawney's run in with the High Inquisitor occurring way too early, (and where was Firenze?), and Hagrid being gone way too long, many things were just changed all together. Cho Chang is used as a scapegoat when it was her friend in the book that blew in ""Dumbledore's Army."" This fact makes the relationship with Harry awkward and needing some extra work in film six to iron things out. Hermione never enchanted the sign-up list, nor used the magic coins as a meeting signal (something used again in book six). We never find out who is giving the Weasley twins money for their jokeshop, we don't get to see Neville's parents or Lockhart at the mental hospital, Harry doesn't end up being the only one cutting lines into his skin which subverts the extra abuse he receives above the others, and there is no Quidditch so Ron never became a goalkeeper. Also, Sirius does not get the chance to give Harry his magic mirror, which has to play into book seven or why would it even have been mentioned, and in fact dies from a curse not just falling through the curtained archway. The most egregious error, though, is the treatment of the centaurs. We never learn that they are ready for war and no longer care if it is children they hurt in the forest. This fact causes their capture of Umbridge to not have the meaning as it does in the novel, thus setting up their role for the following story. As far as that goes too, we never hear of Hagrid's work with the giants and whether they will join Dumbledore against the Dark Lord. **Spoilers finished**<br/><br/>If I need to blame anyone, it will have to be first time Potter scribe Michael Goldenberg. It seems as though he didn't read the sixth book and decided to adapt this one without care for what he was leaving out that may be important later, not to mention how he treats some of the characters he keeps in. What was my least favorite book has now become my least favorite cinematic entry as well. Even when Chris Columbus gave us two mediocre paint-by- numbers films at the start, they at least stayed true to the books. With this newest one, the tone has shifted, most of the good parts were missing, and now the next film will probably need extra explaining to fix the mistakes made here in continuity."
"jwtrox08706","7","1","2","20 July 2007"," Not a life-changing experience
","I have to admit, this movie wasn't the best I've seen. I can't believe I'm saying that about a Harry Potter film because I am a fan of the books and films. The main reason why this film isn't so good and the reason why the more recent films seem to be going downhill is simply because they are trying to take 600-800 pages of story and put them into a 2-3 hour movie. It just can't be done. They have to touch on all of the essential stuff for the series in that 2-3 hours and leave out certain other details. I really think that the ending sequence at the Ministry of Magic went way too fast, and Voldemort's entrance was far less dramatic than in the fourth film. However, this film does have quite a few bright spots. Many of the actors provide great performances. Daniel, Rupert and Emma all did very well, as usual as did Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson (Prof. Trelawney). Now, as for the new faces, Evanna Lynch played Luna Lovegood very well right down to her voice as J.K. Rowling had described in the book. It was as if she was Luna Lovegood. I almost stood up and cheered when Grawp picked up Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and when the centaurs carried her away. Imelda Staunton did a magnificent job bringing to life the very evil character that was Dolores Umbridge. I knew from when I first saw her in the scene from Harry's hearing about underage magic that I was going to really hate this character. A well done for Imelda Staunton. As for Helena Bonham Carter playing Bellatrix Lestrange, wonderfully evil. She portrayed Bellatrix with the utmost precision, and she seemed to take a few liberties as well, but they went very well with her character. Yes, there were quite a few good performances in this film and many of the special effects were very well done. I have never EVER seen an entire building expand. That was a really neat effect pretty much hearkening back to the effect of the appearance of the doorway into Diagon Alley in the first film. The battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort was another triumph of special effects and acting. While this film wasn't quite as good story wise, it certainly did well enough for a 7 out of 10 stars from me."

","Well, what can i say? I'm not a huge fan of the franchise and haven't read a word of the books. This film was ultimately disappointing due to one major flaw. THE DIRECTOR! David Yates, of Merseyside. He?s apparently not really up to the job of handling(read more)a several million dollar budget. I haven't seen any of his other work but then i don't usually watch 'The Bill'. Bring back Chris Columbus, a much more capable director. Although a change of screenwriter probably didn't help things much either. The big effects scenes were marred by the director's insistence to cut away from the glorious special effects work at every opportunity! I can't understand his thinking, if you have huge budget special effects sequences why limit their time on screen? Shining through this incompetence are superb performances from Imelda Staunton as a delightfully evil and vicious Dolores Umbridge, and the usual impeccable stability from Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon and Gary Oldman along with a sadly under used Ralph Fiennes. The score was a bit over the top and didn't do enough to improve the depth and atmosphere of any scene. Only seeming to accentuate the awful direction. However, the sound design was superb; never overdone and perfectly judged. All in all not a good film at all. Unfortunately, I feel the producers are giving in to the needs of it's increasing adult audience (different covers for the books, WTF?) It should have been left where it was; an excellent children's fantasy adventure in the best traditions of British literature that adults can secretly enjoy."
"nvlahou","Null","1","2","19 July 2007"," What can a mediocre director do for Harry Potter? Obviously, nothing
","I too have not read any of the books, so I will be judging the movie only on its merits as a film. It felt like a strangely anti-climactic film, in contrast to the story itself that was filled with excitement (one can tell that, even without prior knowledge of the book). The expectations were kept high all along but great disappointment ensued after the most important final scene - like something was missing, or failed to materialize. It was muddled, and somehow the dramatic importance of the events did not sink in at all. On top of that, there were countless secondary incidents and characters introduced here for the first time, while others (older characters) hardly got the attention they deserved - inevitable with such a production where stellar actors like Emma Thompson only get a scene or two at best and mostly serve as decoration. The fault lies entirely with the director. I came away feeling that the movie had no economy, no clear progression, no climax, and no distinct personality (as a film). Far too much time was spent on incidents that could have been compressed for the sake of the film's economy, which also created the impression that the director was trying not to disappoint the readers attempting a far too literal adaptation of the book (at least that's how it felt). I also heard others comment that the final scene was badly edited - to the point that some of the things that happened seemed incomprehensible (in how they came about). By far, the best Harry Potter film was no. 3 and I have no idea why they would let such a brilliant director as Alfonso Cuaron, walk away from the series. What is worst, I saw on IMDb that David Yates is to direct the next Harry Potter film! How that is to be prevented, I have no idea - but certainly it will be unfair for viewers and readers alike to be left with mediocre movies towards the end of the series. The only bright point in the film was the performances: Especially the delicious Imelda Staunton, the wonderful Gary Oldman, and the infallible Alan Rickman. Of course, people will see the movie no matter what anyone says or writes about it (I would), but is it too late to change the director of the next installment?"

The battles were better and the acting has improved.<br/><br/>This has Moody, Sirius and others back in it. Harry makes new friends and enemies along the way. Neville is a main character and is awesome. Luna is crazy, but is one of my favorites, and there is more of Ginny. The book and movie set up for Half-Blooded Prince, which I can't wait to see when it comes out, and Deathly Hollows. I said this has spoilers so if anyone doesn't know about the people returning I wouldn't get in trouble.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Strider_1978","9","1","2","17 July 2007"," Simply put- Excellent.
","Kudos to a director for finally giving HP the adult feel it needed. Nothing wrong with previous films being colourfull and having a target audience of pre to mid teens. This book, however, is much darker, and is reflected so in the motion picture. There are people trashing this film, I don't know what they expect. You cannot have everything. David Yates however, has brought the story back to me (long time since I read it) with just enough of what I needed to know. What makes me smile even more is that there were little and no comedic moments, no audience laughter, bar a few titters. There is no reason, and was no reason to have comic relief. Instead we are allowed to wallow in darker waters with no scripting to try to pull us out of it. The acting throughout is excellent. All of the characters were fully believable, my personal favourite being Bellatrix. Bohnam Carter manages to pull of deadly insanity without looking theatrical, and this is very important considering the tender nature of her past escapades. I would agree that there are some characters, Lupin for instance who is given next to no speaking parts and spends the limited time he has on camera merely looking at the conversation. What they *do* manage to do, is look like they are *part* of the story and the group, and not just extras or stand ins smiling for the camera. Yates has a background in TV vs films. This is obvious with his command of character direction. The film contains nice visuals, but he's not playing the film to visuals, he is using characters as the driving force. The films special effects, though integral, are secondary. As a book fan it delivers all I really need to know, as a film fan it more than delivers considering the bulk of the written word it has to convey in a film just over two hours.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to both Potter fans, and non fans; The heart and soul is there, even if things have been chopped and changed slightly. A film that actually made me care, and has left me wanting more."
"rodney_mattallica","8","1","2","17 July 2007"," Amazing film...slightly annoying in parts
","This was definitely an amazing film! Unlike The Goblet Of Fire, it wasn't repetitive with constant moments of peril and narrow escape. Meanwhile, Umbridge was incredible - the way she acted so kind and gentle, yet what she did was actually so evil.<br/><br/>However, I must admit there were moments in which the film annoyed me. Firstly the number of times Harry was seen breathing in fear/anger through his teeth was quite noticeable. Another thing was when Harry had his vision of Sirius, right in the middle of Fred and George's exit from the school. There was so much excitement and happiness as everybody cheered, and it was as if Harry was beginning to get over the past and was going to sort himself out - but then it was all ruined when the director chose that moment to put the vision in. I can understand what Yates was doing, with the way it gave the message that there isn't a chance for happiness and the world of magic really was dark.<br/><br/>Other annoying things were changes from previous films - small things such as when Sirius was speaking to Harry via the fireplace, they showed his face in the flames rather than in the burning coal. Also, at the beginning of the film, the area used for the playground just did not feel like England. It more reminded me of a place from the film Signs."
"uefamily","10","1","2","17 July 2007"," Did the professional critics see the same movie?
","Professional critics who previewed this film obviously did not see the same movie that my family and I saw! My children are now 14, 20 and 23 and have grown up reading the books. My whole family reads and loves the Harry Potter books and we enjoy the films, as well. Mostly, we love seeing the films together and then discussing them: what we liked or didn't like, what we would have done differently, etc. The five of us loved the fifth movie. We felt that it did a great job portraying the important points of the story while expressing the dark mood and growing tension. My 14 yr.old is the harshest critic of the films, and if she liked this one, then you know that it was good! These are no longer ""children's"" literature or films; the audience has matured along with the characters and the story line. If you haven't seen the film because of some mediocre reviews, do yourself a favor and go to see it! You'll be thrilled.<br/><br/>On the other hand, we felt that the editing was terrible: scenes were too short or ended abruptly, particularly in the first third of the film."
"Scoop2005","9","1","2","17 July 2007"," best so far
","this is definitely the best potter film so far. the first film was childish, however i did enjoy it because it came out when i was 12, but i feel the films have grown up with me, now i'm 18 and OOTP has just the right ingredients to appeal to my kind of audience - girlfriends, emotional turmoil, anger etc.<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton was great as Umbridge,she was so annoying yet so well acted, she made me feel virtually sick,as did her character in the book. Luna was also brilliantly portrayed by Evanna Lynch, considering it's her first film in the franchise and indeed at all(I think), she did a smashing job and a lot better than even some of the main child actors. <br/><br/>Overall, David Yates has given a whole new style to the film, unlike directors before. The newspaper technique used in order to show the passing of time and some of the other montages were excellent as it allowed minute details from the book to be included so that fans would not be angry but also adding rich detail to the film itself. <br/><br/>I hope Yates directs the next film, or maybe Alfonso Cuaron. The other directors didn't do a brilliant job of their films."
"ledzepbadco","9","1","2","17 July 2007"," Great acting, special effects, and movie in general.
","With Imelda Staunton playing Dolores Umbridge, this movie really gets to you quick. Staunton's acting is superb, and almost Acedemy Award material. This movie is very fast paced and action packed, the special effects are intense, and the scenery is just beautiful.<br/><br/>The story is quite different then the book, in that the book is the biggest one in the series, and it would be impossible to make a 2 hour movie out of something so big. A lot of the smaller plots that really have nothing to do with the whole scheme of things are missing from this movie.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the book, you will like this movie, and if you are just a movie goer, I think that you will LOVE this movie.<br/><br/>Based on the acting alone, this is by far the best movie yet. I would recommend it to anyone."

"hollywoodgirl-1","9","1","2","16 July 2007"," Excellent
","As a huge fan of the Harry Potter books I always look forward to the movies. I've never been let down with any movie as I was still really young (eleven) when the first one came out so I didn't know any better. However looking back on all of them now I definitely recognize their faults and strengths. I was very excited to see The Order of the Phoenix but a little skeptical since this had been my least favorite book. I was blown away. If I could have kept any director it definitely would have been Alfonso Cuaron, whose style and touches were perfectly suited for the third movie and a welcome change from Chris Columbus's kid-glove style. Mike Newell did a decent job with the fourth movie, though it suffered from plot changes that didn't work well. I did (and still do think) that he had the toughest challenge thus far with staging Voldemort's return and he did do a good job with that. David Yates did an amazing job. I really loved that he kept the movie dark and unsettling, with a few smatters of well-done dry humor here and there. The book is dense and not a pleasant trip and he conveyed that sense beautifully. He also managed to achieve something that none of the other directors, not even Cuaron, could do: he made the movie flow. None of the first four movies flow well at all; they all feel awkward and jerky and you can almost always see when they remove something from the book and try and smooth the transition. By showing the issues of the Daily Prophet as transitions he keeps you informed on what is going on outside the walls of Hogwarts as well as inside. It was a brilliant touch that I loved.<br/><br/>Of course not all of the credit lies with Yates; the acting in this movie was superb. All three of the leads were at their best, although I did sense that the size of Rupert's role took a cut due to the immense popularity of Dan and Emma. Evanna Lynch was a better Luna Lovegood than I could have ever imagined. Helena Bonham Carter creates in Bellatrix Lestrange a villain that you can truly and purely hate. I always have trouble, even with the nastiest of villains, not feeling some sympathy for them or trying to understand them. I had no trouble hating the truly evil character that Bonham Carter paints. Imelda Staunton makes a perfect Dolores Umbridge. If I were asked at almost any time I would say that I much prefer Richard Harris's Dumbledore to Michael Gambon's, yet I felt that Gambon's portrayal was perfect for this movie.<br/><br/>The only gripe I have is that they do cut a lot out. It is the shortest movie whereas the book is the longest in the series. The movie isn't really hindered by this, but purists will be incensed. I feel that the only scene that really suffered from the cuts and changes was the customary Dumbledore explanation at the end. That scene in the book is fraught with important points and raw emotion that is not conveyed properly in the movie.<br/><br/>All in all I definitely felt that this was the best movie of the series and it is my favorite. Go see it."

","We have been waiting so long for this Movie, We bought advanced tickets for the 7p.m. show, then my daughter found out her softball game was canceled and we had to rush and get the 12:01 tickets. We could have waited, along time maybe till Video, this was the biggest disappointment.<br/><br/>There is a progression in the books, The First; Happy cause Harry is away from his Aunt and Uncle and then it gets Dark. 2nd: A little darker. 3rd; Darker Still 4th: getting scary dark 5th: Getting almost terrifyingly Dark. 6th leading up to the darkest climax 7th; ending the serious and potentially the darkest of all.<br/><br/>The Movie's although a little tough to digest at times have honored the above. Until this one. It appears the Director wanted to spare the 5 year olds who might watch any of the real terror the book depicts. The Special effects are really good. I guess that is the best that can be said. Harry is a teenager with all the normal moods and attitudes that teens get plus the added stuff, this movie never really lets anyone into the evolving relationship between Harry, Ron and Hermonie not to mention any of the other Chars. I wont go into all the really important books stuff that is left out of this movie. Or the major changes made from the book version. If I were J.K Rawlings I would stand on my head and scream if this Director and Screen Writer are involved in the next 2 movies. My 13 year old asked the really important question; DID THEY EVEN READ THE BOOK, OR PREVIOUS BOOKS? If you love all things Potter see the movie if you just want a visual of a book you liked don't. We Love all things Potter and the Movie still managed to Disappoint. But we have the Book Release coming. Chin Up. One more thing a reviewer above blamed this on a Americanisan of the movie, I am American and I can say honestly say I do not think thats it. They wanted a movie a child could watch. They got it but I think even a child who has read the books would be disappointed."
"cathie454","3","1","2","14 July 2007"," I half expected his head to spin around
","If you're not going to keep to the plot and spirit of the book, why direct it? JK Rowling has no say over what they do to her books, but in the first 4, the directors and screen writers kept to the feeling and plot of the books. These books are loved and pored over by millions of people. The first movies basically stayed with the plot and ambiance of the book. This one was tricked up to give it a more ""horror movie"" feeling, to the detriment of the movie. Yes, it needed to be darker; the book was definitely darker on many levels, but the way it was done changed this pivotal book in the series to not much more than a mish-mash of scenes that lent themselves to the machinations of typical Hollywood horror movies. It begins immediately, in Little Whinging. Why change the way Harry and Dudley first encounter each other? Why change the way dementors look? Why minimize the shock Harry feels when he learns Mrs. Figg is a squib? Why totally eliminate the important scene when Harry realizes that Aunt Petunia knows about dementors and understands about the evil of Voldemort? (And why have Aunt Petunia dressed in what looks like a trashy sun-suit type outfit that might have been seen in the 40's? It looked ridiculous.) The point of it in the book was to blur the line between the wizarding world and the Muggle world; it was glossed over for no reason. Obviously this idiot of a director and the screen writer don't truly know the books. I could go on with just the problems with the first 20 minutes, and the movie goes down hill from there. Plot lines were chronologically changed. The person who betrays Dumbledore's Army is changed to Cho-- why? That is a totally ridiculous and unnecessary plot change. Percy Weasley shows up working with Fudge, no explanation of why or the background of the rift in his family, which is key in the next book. Why have Umbridge in muggle clothes throughout the movie? The book sets her apart by having her wear a horrible pink cardigan over her robes, which is much more ridiculous look than having her wear- admittedly horrible- muggle clothes. The wonderful feeling of revenge the students have while harassing Umbridge when she takes over as Headmistress is all condensed into one scene of Fred and George throwing fireworks and flying out of the castle-- no explanation of the background of that, of the coming of their joke shop, of the fact that Fred, George and Harry's broomsticks had been confiscated by the foul Umbridge. When the six rescuers take off on the thestrals to go to the Ministry, the fact that three of them cannot see the thestrals and feel as though they're going to fall while flying on invisible creatures is ignored. The intriguing rooms in the Department of Mystery are eliminated, and the room with the prophesies and the duel with the Death Eaters before the Order arrives is condensed and does not show how well the students were able to fight off the Death Eaters, or the fact that Hermione and Ron are possibly seriously hurt. Even though Bellatrix Lestrange calls Harry a filthy mudblood, they left out the crucial fact that Harry informs the Death Eaters that Voldemort himself is a mudblood, that his father was a muggle-- more clear evidence that the director does not really know these books or the point of all of it. Bellatrix Lestrange, who in the book oozes evil and is obviously devoted to Voldemort, is shown more as a madwoman, and disapparates without talking to Voldemort. The worst scene of all is when Voldemort possesses Harry-- he suddenly turns into a modern version of Linda Blair's possessed character in The Excorcist, red eyes and all. I half expected his head to spin around. The crucial scene, where Harry talks with Dumbledore about what it all means, the point of the whole reason for Harry's fate being connected to Voldemort's, is glossed over into about 4 lines of dialogue between them. The only reason I gave this film even 3 stars is because there were a few good scenes, where they actually kept to the spirit and the plot of the book-- Harry and Cho's kiss; Harry's anger both because of adolescence and because his emotions are tied with Voldemort's; and Luna Lovegood; -- were all very well done. Also, cinematography was good. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have become fine actors. It's been fun seeing them not only grow up, but grow in their profession. In the past, we've gone to see each of the HP movies at least three times while they were in theaters, to experience them on the big screen, and bought the DVD when it was released. We won't be doing that this time. Of course, the director and the movie studio can count on huge audiences for these movies, because of the books, and it's obvious in this one that because of a guaranteed huge profit, they saw no reason to give this book the spirit of Rowling's book that it deserved. I'm sure many people will bring up the point that these books are so long that of course they have to be cut, shortened, manipulated to fit time constraints, and of course that's true-- but the first four managed to do that and still stick to plot lines and the point of each book. This one is such a disappointment. If the next movie is directed and written by the same people as this one, I won't be seeing it. Not that the cost of my one ticket will make the slightest dent in Warner Brother's pockets, but at least I'll have the satisfaction of not contributing to their profit."
"randboc","5","1","2","16 July 2007"," My Expectation Bubble Burst and it wasn't good
","Our family had high expectations for this Harry Potter movie. I had thought the last one was over the top in story, action, cinematography. I was on an adrenaline high when I left it and couldn't wait to see it again when it came on video. My daughter has read all the Harry Potter books, more than once. I read the first one so I am coming toward this not as how true to the book, but from the pure entertainment value. It was a good movie and we'll worth attending to see on the big screen, but not near as good as the prior Harry Potter movies from action and cinematography. Maybe they were trying to be true to the book so they included some of the chit/chat sequences...They were so staged and seemingly irrelevant all that did was make me feel that these actors were doing it for pay check with no heart in it at all. We bought tickets in advance for Friday night thinking it will be packed out. Our theater was empty...maybe 20 people in it at 8:30 on a Friday Night. Granted, that was probably the exception than the rule, but still, I don't think you are going to have a lot of repeat attenders and word of mouth won't be as positive as in the past. I can only think the change in directors caused this outcome. It seemed so staged, as the kids, Harry & Co, lined up to walk in a V formation across bridges, through doors, not like they were on a mission to save their world, but because somebody told them to line up this way and walk in place while we move the computer animation behind you. It would be so obvious that the background was computer generated....of course a lot of it is in fantasy movies, but let us think it is real like it was in the goblet of fire. What I liked: Scenes with Harry teaching the kids (when he finally gets his chip off his shoulder) magic, the revelation about Snape being picked on by Harry's oh so nice dad...but why leave that hanging, the fight between Dumbledorf and Voldemort, the sense of this secret order that has all the people that Harry trusts and the old picture of all the folks that were against Voldemort, some having turned to his side. BTW, my husband liked it and my daughter the reader loved it!"
"eschetic","7","1","2","15 July 2007"," Decent Readers' Digest Version (but Bring Back Columbus and Continuity Checkers!)
","Potter fans rejoice (if only moderately): the latest installment in the film saga comes closer to the high standard of film adaptation set by the *first* two films than the last two over praised ""mooovie-movies,"" even if in the slapdash ""best of the highlights"" approach the latest director takes (despite attention lavished on the big fight scenes near the end), we only have a decent Readers' Digest Potter with the bones of the plot and little if any of the motivations or substance - or even locations we have come to know and love. <br/><br/>The ubiquitous argument about how ""radical editing"" was unavoidable given the 875 page original book is essentially a nonsense. The problem is not that so many plot lines were shorn (they were, but by in large that's OK and not the reason the film doesn't totally satisfy), but that the core story is so sloppily told with so little care to motivations. <br/><br/>The movie assumes that most of the audience knows the story and will forgive story changes which will allow the director to delete characters (Dobby for instance) yet stick some characters (Kreacher) in for a scene or two but omit the only REASONS they were in the BOOK in the first place. <br/><br/>Not to give away plot revisions, which are in fact relatively minor - ranging from who proposed the use of ""The Room of Requirement"" to who exposes its use (a particularly nasty change), to how the supply of ""Veritas Serum"" is supposedly used (or the missing explanation necessary as a result of the change as to why it didn't work) - but a simple list of what is left OUT of the movie from the book (details which need NOT have taken significant screen time if any additional at all - NOT major sub-plots) may serve as warning against disappointment:<br/><br/>*The coaches which the Thestrals pull (they're mere dogcarts now). *Quiddich (playing or bans even referred to). *Confiscation of brooms (requiring alternate transportation to distant points). *Lessons (of any kind except in the D.A.!). *House Elves (except for two brief, non-plot appearances from ""Kreacher""). *The Invisibility Cloak. *The Marauders' Map. *Pensives. *St. Mungo's. *Ghosts AND poltergeists. *Cleaning of the Headquarters of the Order. *The *concept* of ""Secret Keeper"". *The Hour Glasses and the House Point system (why not, since they omitted the scoring from the contests in ...Goblet of Fire!?) *Dumbledore's Office (and access to it or lack thereof). *How the D.A. was named (or how Umbridge heard about it). *The enchanted Galleons communication system (or any substitute). *Any explicit blockage/monitoring of student communication including the Flue Network and Owls! *The Quibbler *Any censorship of outside publications. *Umbridge's racism (or WHY her actions against the centaurs are so provocative). *Attacks on Hagrid AND/OR McGonagall *Outside O.W.L. examiners. *Why Filch likes Umbridge so much. *Any hint as to why Neville may be such an important character - or might have been even MORE important. *Magical swamps. *ANY attacks on Umbridge at all or student resistance to her regime (except at the *one* time Rowling specifically made it clear the Weasley's at least would NOT - when it would interrupt important student activities - specifically when they are sitting for O.W.L. exams!) *The elimination of *any* member of the Order of the Phoenix from Hogwart's grounds *except* Dumbledore so there was a REASON Harry couldn't call on them for assistance in a crisis. *Who MADE ""the prophesy,"" why it is important & why it is a secret. *How the Dementors came to BE in Little Wingins. *Any celebration of Umbridge's departure (her *rescue* is not even mentioned) and most stunning of all, *HARRY'S SCAR* (it literally isn't ON his forehead until it makes one brief, suddenly darkly drawn in appearance late in the movie)!<br/><br/>OK, readers may well wonder how they COULD tell the story without these things (except for the final fight scene, this film eliminates more actual MAGIC from Hogwarts than Umbridge does!), but still, over all the film works. Rowlings provided a rattling good allegory of right wing governmental repression.<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton's Umbridge is an evil joy to behold (even if her best scenes were eliminated), and Evanna Lynch's sublime Luna Lovegood is a true find (even if the REASON for her character to be IN the book - her publisher father - has also been eliminated). Most of the student cast is growing wonderfully into their roles - from the three leads to (especially) Neville Longbottom. <br/><br/>The utterly silly (frequently noisy!) plot changes surrounding The Room of Requirement or even the astoundingly stupid and time wasting taking down of all the portraits on the Hogwart's walls can't undercut what remains a fast moving fun story for reader and non-reader alike. Those who know the book will be aware how much better this movie could have been. Those who don't won't have to worry too much about it - despite the odd plot line left hanging and action curiously unmotivated - director Yates keeps things spinning along so swiftly, most won't notice 'till long after the interminable crawl at the end is a distant memory."
"jogebau","9","1","2","15 July 2007"," They finally got one right
","This is my first review on IMDb.com I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, but to be honest I was very disappointed with the first four films. Although they have been true to the story most of the times, they never really caught the atmosphere of the books. The Order of the Phoenix changes that. It is by far the best film in the series and director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have done a great job turning the 800 pages of the book into an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>It has been said that the storyline from the book has changed, and that is true. Goldenberg had to, otherwise we would have a movie of at least 6 hours. But the way he shortened the story is brilliant: he manages to shorten the story without leaving holes in the storyline, and every change he made still leaves the storyline intact and even true to the book. That is a huge improvement over Goblet of Fire, which left left people who did not know the book with loads of riddles.<br/><br/>Another thing that has wildly improved over the previous book is the performance of the actors, which now actually shows what the cast is capable of with a competent director (well, I still do not like Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, but even he improved).<br/><br/>But the hugest improvement over the last movie is actually that David Yates got the pace of the movie just right. While the movie stays relatively true to the book, it manages to be an entertaining movie on its own, which for me was the biggest surprise in the cinema since it is based on the Harry Potter book with the most complicated storyline to date. Overall this movie might actually please book-readers and book-ignorers alike.<br/><br/>9 out of 10!"
"legolander","8","1","2","15 July 2007"," Fantastic Film of the Year, yet too time thrifty...
","Before I begin my review, please note that my comments may contain spoilers, so watch out; they might spoil the surprise!<br/><br/>First of all, I find this movie as the most fascinating film of the year! Although a lot of scenes were omitted, I think this movie deserves high credits. I really can't blame the film makers for the alterations and deviations from the book, considering that the whole novel is about 800 pages long. However, they should have extended the run time of the film. When I watched the movie, it started at approximately 6:00 in the evening and ended at 8:00. Supposedly, the running time of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is 2 hours and 18 minutes; that makes it shorter than Goblet of Fire. I wish they extended the film for another 12 minutes to make it 2 and a half hours. That way, the movie could have been much clearer to the viewers especially to those who did not read the book. They could have added crucial scenes that would explain the events that occurred.<br/><br/>I liked the effects especially the duel with the Death Eaters. But I noticed again that those parts were filmed in such a hurry that everything went wild and confusing. On a lighter note, I appreciate the efforts of the film makers in including minor characters like Grawp (Hagrid's half-brother) and Kreacher (Sirius' House Elf; according to Ms. J.K. Rowling, he will have an important part in the last book). I think the only problem of this film is time. Again, they could have added more scenes that feature St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Dobby (the former House elf of the Malfoy family; his part in this film is again taken by Neville Longbottom),the Two-Way Mirror that Sirius gave to Harry, and Neville's parents and grandmother.<br/><br/>I agree with other reviewers in saying that Sirius Black's death was too sudden and has a lesser impact on the audience. But I do like the battle scene between Dumbledore and Voldemort, it was absolutely fantastic! I know that David Yates will be directing the next film ""The Half-Blood Prince"", and so I will be expecting a lot of things this time, since the 6th book is shorter than the 5th one. I hope they would be able to cover up the significant points in the story and allow the film to run for exactly 2 and a half hours, so that fans and viewers will not be disappointed. Despite my rants and raves, I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars!"
"Scaramouche2004","7","1","2","15 July 2007"," Longest Book, Shortest film...you find the logic!!??
","If you were to read my previous review on Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, you will note that I entered into a rather long diatribe on the fact that due to the Harry Potter books growing in length, subsequent movies will have to outgrow the confines of a mere two hour movie for them to prove true to the original text and have any credibility at all to the Harry Potter Legend.<br/><br/>I used for examples other great novels which have benefited from extended run times such as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy or Gone with the Wind.<br/><br/>With such a stark and obvious truth staring us in the face, it therefore baffles my belief that they decided to take Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix, which as many Potter and Rowling fans can tell you is the longest book in the series, and adapt it to the screen in what is so far the shortest film!!!???!!! <br/><br/>I know, no matter how hard I try I am still trying to find the logic.<br/><br/>As a result, once again as with The Goblet of Fire we are presented with a final film that fails to do either Harry Potter or JK Rowling justice with so many things having been left out.<br/><br/>I know they cannot fit everything in or that will take my idea of an extended runtime to bum numbing extremes, but it all seemed so rushed.<br/><br/>The Hearing, Dumbledores flight after the DA's discovery, Occlumancy lessons with Snape and the final fight at the Department of Mysteries, all made for great and exciting reading, but was glanced over so quickly that it failed to even raise an eyebrow on the screen.<br/><br/>Its not even mentioned that Lucius Malfoy and his fellow death eaters end up in Azkaban at movies end, nor does it mention that The Dementors finally defect to the Dark Lord once more. There is no mention that it was in fact Umbridge who set the Dementors onto Harry and Dudley the previous Summer, nor does Severus Snape get any mention for being the one who alerts the Order of Harry's trip to the Ministry, thus saving his and his friends lives.<br/><br/>Also in the final two chapters of the book Harry is consumed by loss and guilt over Sirius' death. In the movie he seems to take it on the chin with a British stiff upper lip.<br/><br/>Also the whole cast seems to be severely underused. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Helena Bonham Carter, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, Mark Williams even Rupert Grint and Emma Watson seem so absent in places.<br/><br/>Instead the film seems to be overshadowed by Imelda Stauntons Delores Umbridge. Ms. Staunton is superb throughout though and I guess this feeling of Umbridge Overdose was exactly the desired effect an audience should have felt, as, I suppose that is how every student and teacher at Hogwarts must have been feeling also.<br/><br/>Also special mention to Evanna Lynch who completely nailed the part of Luna Lovegood...exactly how I pictured her in my mind while reading. Well done Evanna. Her first film and I hope not her last. I hope she has a long and successful career in front of her.<br/><br/>Again Sir Michael Gambon fails to impress as Dumbledore. Although now with three films under his belt compared to Richard Harris' original two, he is the predominant Dumbledore of the series, he just fails to convince me of the greatness, wisdom, wit and bravery of the Late Mr. Harris's portrayal.<br/><br/>Even now 5 years after his death, when I read a Potter book, it is only Harris's Dumbledore I can bring myself to picture in my head.<br/><br/>Surely Peter O'Toole, can do better. Go On Peter have a go! <br/><br/>Maybe film lovers who have never read the books will probably enjoy this film more than those who have, but I can't help but feel that many die hard Potter fans will feel a tad disappointed as what could have been the biggest, boldest and most exciting potter yarn yet, has turned out to be a mediocre and unmagical limp squib.<br/><br/>Come back Chris Columbus, Potter needs you for the final two movies."
"navya_hermione","9","1","2","15 July 2007"," Best of the five movies
","I'm a huge Harry potter fan, books as well as movies and I can say I am not at all disappointed with this film. The movie was brilliantly made, and the dark feel was evident right from the beginning of the movie. What I was really happy about this one is it was more faithful to the book. The new actors like Imelda Staunton(played the role of Umbridge brilliantly), the young lady with potential Evanna Lynch who played Luna Lovegood and no need to mention the Bellatrix to the heights of evil.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the climax sequences which were a pleasure to watch in 3D, the movie went smoothly right from the beginning and there were no split ends. The lack of quidditch in the movie makes sense because the viewer can assume Umbridge might have banned that as well. I can say that this movie was the most touching of all the five because of the importance it emphasized on friendship and love. The movie also showed properly about the rebellion in school and fudge's lack of belief in Voldemort returning.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe has definitely improved in this movie and the improvement has been clearly seen in the final scenes where he had to fight Voldemort possessing him and Sirius dying. Emma and Rupert were great as Harry's friends Hermione and Ron as usual. The only mistake which I've seen is Luna using the spell ""Levicorpus"" in the final fight which does not come until the next book. Apart from that I'd give this movie a double thumbs up and everyone whether a book reader or not can watch it and still be able to appreciate it."
"pochomankra","4","1","2","14 July 2007"," Disappointing.
","First and foremost I will begin by saying that I am not a reader/fan of the Harry Potter books. Never have been, never will be. With that aside, I found this movie to be utterly disappointing. Sure some people will argue that it is the best Harry Potter movie. But come on! What is so great about it? The acting was off, almost mediocre, the believability of this was just ridiculous, and to top it of the whole story had no plot.<br/><br/>Lets first get some things strait. The story starts off with Harry being harassed by his brother, or step brother. Things seem a little hopeful at the beginning. The sky turns black, big winds howl, then Big creatures appear out of nowhere ready to take the life out of the two! Things are looking promising.<br/><br/>But with goodness comes blah. Yes, blah. From then on we are treated to talking. Talking. And more talking.<br/><br/>The only promising points, or should I say point, is the ending of the film (The last twenty minutes or so) that I must say is pretty visually entertaining. But that alone can't summon any happiness from my tired soul. This movie is just disappointing. Sure, some will say that because I didn't read the books I am not entitled to say anything abrasive. But the point is I'm not the only person who hasn't read the books.<br/><br/>But I also have to say I am a fan of the first three. Number four was ""eh"" for me. Then comes number five. Please, where are the two hours and eighteen minutes of my life? They are gone. Sadly."
"charchuk","6","1","2","13 July 2007"," A bit rushed, but still fantastic
","My biggest complaint is that it felt too rushed. It did a great job of keeping everything that was needed and getting rid of all the excess, but I felt it needed time to slow down and breathe. This is especially noticeable at the end - the final battle is so well-done and so exciting that I wished it could have been longer. Sirius' death was also botched because it was too quick; there was no real emotional impact. The music is basically a non-factor - I noticed its absence more than its presence, especially because some scenes could have really used it in the background. And, as always, a lot of the characters get the shaft, but I've come to expect that.<br/><br/>All in all though, I was satisfied. The director was the thing I was most worried about going in, and it turned out to be one of the highlights. Yates is certainly no Cuaron, but he's right there alongside Newell in continuing the style that Azkaban started. The cinematography is simply astounding at times. The effects are truly amazing, especially Grawp (which was actually one of the few things I thought could have been cut). The final battle, as mentioned, was amazing, as everything combined to make a truly intense sequence. The Dumbledore/Voldemort fight was even moreso, as it simply lived up to the hype. The montages of Umbridge and the DA were very entertaining, and the news clippings were an inspired choice. It certainly had enough style.<br/><br/>The acting was impressive; the main trio was suitable, and the adults were all - as to be expected - fantastic. Oldman was as good as always, Fiennes was sufficiently evil, Carter was a perfect fit, Staunton was just as perfect, I could go on and on. The girl who played Luna was spot-on, and could have been the highlight of the cast, though. However, the girl playing Ginny was pretty weak; I'm not sure how they're gonna pull that off in the next film. Lupin was terribly underused, though (as it is in the books after Azkaban) and I wanted to see more Snape, McGonagall, Hagrid, but that's the way things go. On the whole, though, the entire ensemble was terrific.<br/><br/>As I said, though, my biggest problem was the pacing and, to a lesser extent, the story. I hope there's an extended edition, because there's a lot of scenes I thought could have been kept in, most noticeably the Hagrid sacking scene and the Christmas hospital scene. I'll cross my fingers for it, but I'm not expecting much.<br/><br/>It's a notch below PoA and GoF, but it's still up there with them. An extra half an hour or so would have done wonders, methinks. Still, though, it's incredibly intense and a suitable novel adaptation."
"ashwani-g83","5","1","2","13 July 2007"," Not good enough
","Finally the wait is over...and yet in the end you wish the movie had never been released. A decent movie but not recommended for Harry Potter book fans. The film leaves you wanting for more and then there are fundamental difference from the book. I personally feel that all book fans should refrain from watching it. The Director in order to create magic in this ""magical"" movie deviates from the original work. The film will receive huge box office success but that is because of all the hype created and not because the final product. the film fails to create the sense of awe achieved in the first two films of the series and casts a doubt on future films based on the series."
"pipe_d_awol","6","1","2","13 July 2007"," surprisingly disappointing
","To begin with, Order of the Pheonix has been my favorite book so far. As i was reading it all I could do was imagine how awesome it was going to be on the screen! The whole plot is amazing, and exciting, perfect for a film version it seemed. Granted there would be much cut out, as it has been the longest book in the series so far, I was still looking forward to a crazy film. Needless to say I went into my screening of Harppy Potter at 4 o'clock the day after it came out and I was a little taken back. I thought over all it was pretty cool but so much was removed, parts that could and should have been added in if they just spent a little more time with it. The film was very rushed, the cuts between a few different scenes are so dramatic i wasn't sure if it really just happened or not. My boyfriend, who has not yet read the book, was unsure if a certain major incident near the end of the film even happened or not because of how abrupt the scene ended! And while I'm on the subject, the last scene could have been so INCREDIBLE! The last few chapters of the book are some of the most intense pages in all of the Harry Potter books combined, and it took the film about 5 minutes to show us. It would have been worth it all, had they taken like 30 extra minutes and actually elaborated the last scenes to what they needed to be. Basically, there were major plot holes- to a fan of the book anyway, pretty good acting- about as same as usual, although I felt like I didn't see Ron or Hermione much, but, that was due to how short the scenes were in order to pack the movie into just a few minutes over 2 hours. All and all, I did enjoy the film, I just think it was just too rushed and packed together to really do the book justice. They should have done a ""Kill Bill"" type movie, split it into two parts and released them separately. Maybe I need to go alert David Yates and let this little secret out, if the final book is going to be as big and intense as I hope. I know people are going to expect something crazy from that. Anyway, Let's just hope David Yates brings it next time, because he's in it for the long road and so am I."
"wbellido","4","1","2","13 July 2007"," Poor direction and editing spoil #5
","I'm sorry to report Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix movie didn't live up to my expectations largely due to the direction and the editing. It was too clipped and jumped from here to there without sufficient connection. Dolores Umbridge character was perfectly done as was Luna Lovegood, but again the editing was severe. If I hadn't read the book it would have made no sense to me at all. As it is it's a very poor rendition of a really good book. The director and editor should be ashamed of themselves. There were several scenes in the movie that I was looking forward to seeing, but they were very poorly directed and staged. I guess four out of five ain't bad, but in my opinion they should retract this issue and edit it again."
"moni2808","4","1","2","13 July 2007"," Disappointing movie
","The OOTP was my favorite book and i was so hyped to see the movie only to leave strongly disappointed. The movie, in terms of a movie, was great with excellent effects and acting but as far as the storyline of the book it was awful. Did any one else notice that Ron had like 10 words the whole movie? Everything seemed rushed and a lot was missing like the entire time spent at Sirius' house, visit to Mungos, the actual way Harry and Cho fell apart, Ron and Heremonie becoming prefects/ and no Quiditch??? There was no plot building only a ton of climaxes which would leave people who didn't read the book confused. Professor Umbridge and Luna Lovegood were well played,though. What was up with Umbridge blowing up the Room of Requirement door? And the entire DA having detention with those special quills? And the lessons Occumencly lessons with Harry and Snape? And Sirius dying so suddenly then going through the archway? It was horrible i was so mad. This was a awesome book with a lot of information that was rushed into the shortest Harry Potter movie ever. Yates seemed to disregard the story and turn this movie into a typical Hollywood fantasy action movie, which is unnecessary and uncalled for. <br/><br/>Overall this movie sucked."
"draiochtfilms","4","1","2","12 July 2007"," Missing Mike Newell & Chris Columbus
","I loved all the other films, and in particular, the Goblet of Fire. That being said, this movie was terrible. Veteran performers are made to ""overact"", giving this a blown up BBC Drama feel, instead of a Harry Potter film. I'm surprised that Daniel Radcliff didn't hyperventilate when making the film, he had to pant so much in reaction to his misfortune. That, accompanied with the fact that all our favorite characters had no development in this film whatsoever, makes this a very disappointing outing for the series. If the rumors are true that they're going to keep David Yates to direct the next installment, I know that I'll be waiting until after the word of mouth gets around instead of wasting my money seeing another bad film."
"imizedumacated","Null","1","2","12 July 2007"," If i hadn't of read the books I might have been inclined to really like the movie
","While I don't think it was a bad movie, I think after reading the book I had too many expectations for the movie to be just as good. I feel that for a movie that ran as long as it did, there was ample time to go more in depth about some of the more important parts of the book that were left out or altered altogether. I feel some of the biggest issues could have been a more involved development of why umbridge was the way she was and her disdain for non-humans, harry's confusion and sympathy for snape and doubt about his father and sirius' actions as students, and even the down played roles of jenny and luna. i could go on and on but those are some of the things that bothered me most after seeing the movie"
"maatmouse-1","8","1","2","12 July 2007"," Potter really does grow up!
","I had the usual expectations and excitement of a new Harry Potter movie, although I knew that a lot of the moments from the book are usually done away with. This film is spot on and much darker than all of the other films. There is less emphasis on out and out action and more story-telling moments, such as Luna and Harry's meeting with the Thestrals in which Luna explains why Harry and she can see them. Evanna is absolutely spot on in the film and embodies the idea of the character being slightly unusual but friendly and genuine nevertheless. For me, she was not in the film long enough and you wanted to get more about the character simply from meeting her.<br/><br/>Other regulars are equally as good. Emma Thompson was wonderful as the unhappy Trelawney who gets bullied by Imelda Staunton's ruthless dictator and bully Umbridge. Rickman does wonderfully as Snape, revealing why he hates Harry so much (because Harry's father bullied him at school) and is particularly delightful in the subtly done Occlumency scenes which I thought wouldn't have got into the film (although there is less airtime given to them). Other scenes that work particularly well and add layer include Harry's detentions and the reveals to Umbridge's boo-hiss sneering and chuckling. In fact, Staunton is brilliant. You just want to hate her character so much, which is precisely the point.<br/><br/>Other parts continue to shine as well. Michael Gambon starts to show an accustomed vulnerability and agedness to Dumbledore which lines him up for the character's later films. He has a much more detached relationship with Harry in this film as per the book.<br/><br/>And where would Harry Potter be without Hermione and Ron? Well, both do excellently, trying to show the differences between the three and the similarities. All three work very well together and continue to show both gravity and layers beyond their childhood years to their acting. Also, Neville Longbottom is given more to do beyond the usual fooling about of previous films. We get to discover why his parents aren't around anymore and his animosity towards one of Sirius Black's family, the utterly mad and bad Bellatrix LeStrange, played wonderfully by Helena Bonham Carter (although I can't help wondering what Helen McCrory would have been like in the role).<br/><br/>All in all, superb film and lots to watch and be amazed by the wonderful set designs and details. Certainly bears a second viewing to take in the bits you missed."
"jh-52","6","1","2","12 July 2007"," OWL - Acceptable
","I'm a huge fan of the books and so of course I had to see the movie. But it only rates an Acceptable. **spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>1. Harry gives up the prophecy?! Of course some content will be lost due to time and expense. The back story on the prophecy, the members of the order, the ministry rooms, etc... unavoidable but acceptable losses. But why would they have Harry give up the prophecy, especially to Malfoy? that was a mistake.<br/><br/>2. They lost the magic. There were so many opportunities to show the magic, the patronus against the dementors, the order's flight over the city, the phone booth, but the magic was put aside until the end. WTF?! <br/><br/>3. There was no music. Ya know, when the action is lagging, a little music helps. But I could actually feel my bottom getting tired of sitting for the first hour. <br/><br/>4. Wonderful actors with no lines. Aside from Sirius, everyone was an extra. That's ashame. A few expository lines from Bellatrix, or Lupin, or the Weasleys could have gone a long way to filling the potholes. For example when Arthur is walking Harry down the Ministry, a few lines for the viewers would have been helpful. Luna Lovegood was well portrayed and a pleasant surprise. Too much Umbridge, not enough Ron or Hermione. <br/><br/>Of course we fans will find flaws here and there. But as fans, we tend to be overly generous at times too. In this case, Acceptable is generous."

","Let me first say I finished reading book five for the second time just a few weeks ago so it's very fresh in my mind, and perhaps that affected me.<br/><br/>Yes, overall, I liked the movie! It has lots of action, and it was very entertaining. However, I felt it moved abruptly from point to point, and this could spell trouble if you're not familiar with the book at all. My kids, who've read only through book three, were constantly asking me questions about what was happening.<br/><br/>The biggest issues I noticed were:<br/><br/>1) There's a WHOLE LOT of material from the book which was left out, and much of it may have been rather important:<br/><br/>a) No St. Mungo's at all, and the whole thing with Neville's parents was covered in, like, two seconds. No Gran either.<br/><br/>b) No character development of Tonks. It's unclear why her hair keeps changing colors, for example.<br/><br/>c) The entire ""final trip"" through the Ministry of Magic was truncated considerably to basically just one room.<br/><br/>d) Where was Buckbeak?<br/><br/>e) Who were made Prefects?<br/><br/>f) No character development of Mrs. Figg<br/><br/>g) Luna, the Quibbler, and her relationship to the publisher were undeveloped<br/><br/>h) The sorting hat never sang its ""new song""<br/><br/>i) Firenze never came in as the new teacher<br/><br/>j) The whole issue with Grawp was made to seem quite harmless<br/><br/>k) No O.W.L.s ever took place<br/><br/>l) The prophecy was shortened to remove the elements about the seventh month<br/><br/>m) no Quidditch which means the whole part about Ron's joining the team, Umbridge cutting Potter, and so on was eliminated<br/><br/>n) The Order never met Harry at the landing after the train ride home which would have been a fun ending<br/><br/>2) Somewhere along about the half-way point of the movie, it sort of took a turn away from the book enough so that I began asking myself what was going on.<br/><br/>3) The educational decrees were posted, but you could hardly read them; therefore, it wasn't very clear why they were there at all.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's a great movie, but it really helps if you've read the book first!"

My husband (who didn't read the book) said there was no ""magic"" to this film. My 10 year old son (the H-P fanatic) said this was the worst HP movie (where was the brain room and all the other things that happened in the Dept. of Mysteries?). I felt the story was disjointed.

"shivandavis","1","3","12","14 July 2007"," Awful book, awful film
","Before i begin my rant, i would like to point out that this film was doomed from the start. This is because the book by J.K Rowling, the fifth in the incredibly mediocre series, is by far the worst book of the lot. It is a obese thing, full of pointless drivvle and bland characters.<br/><br/>The film, like the book, is too long and has a huge lack of action. Voldemort is as scary as your average bald bloke on the street and Helen Botham Carter is more like a mother dressing up on Halloween rather than a lunatic.<br/><br/>The acting, if you can call it that, is diabolical. Daniel Radcliffe, bless him, cannot act to save his life. I cringed when Harry delivered his heart-felt speech to Voldemot. "" I have something that you don't- friendship and love"". Please. Emma Watson is another who makes me smirk at her sheer appallingness. Rupert Grint is okay, but his job of delivering the funny lines is pretty easy.<br/><br/>At the end of this film i felt as if i had been mugged. My legs were dead, my eyelids closing and my head drooping. I would rather have watched paint dry. Nothing happened. And the scene with Voldemort was pathetic.<br/><br/>I went with my cousin, a Harry Potter fanatic, and to sum up the film i shall use his words- "" The acting was diabolical, the screenplay was shocking, but it was still a good movie"". Better still, don't see it, don't waste your money and don't' give J.K Rowling and her cronies the satisfaction.<br/><br/>Ps- How the hell is this in the top 250 films ever made??????"

The lord says in Deuteronomy 18:10-11 ""Let no one be found among you... who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or cast spells, or who is a medium or spiritist."" The BIBLE itself condemns witchcraft. THIS IS THE WORD OF GOD telling us to condemn witchcraft, the most evil of sins. Yet, JK Rowling twists the minds of children into believing that magic and sorcery are wonderful things by portraying young wizards and witches having fun and using spells. By reading these books and watching these movies you are letting Satan and his evil spirits into your soul. Some don't even know that they are trapped by his spell. These lost souls need to pray to the lord Jesus almighty that they will be saved and granted entrance into heaven. If you continue watching and reading these Satanic novels you are guaranteed suffering in eternal hellfire.<br/><br/>I have not read or watched anything in relation to Harry Potter because I wish my soul to be saved in the afterlife. But I do know that these books contain dark magic and that they are teaching children that magic is ""acceptable"" and even ""fun."" Don't fall into Rowling's trap.

","This film is the adaptation of the fifth book in the Harry Potter's saga, written by JK Rowling, and is the first film that was directed by David Yates, the last director to join the franchise, this time to stay. Yates was up to the task: this film is one of the most complex and profound of the saga and have some important psychological developments of the characters, as well as large computerized effects and great moments of action. <br/><br/>The film maintains basically unchanged the cast structure of the previous films and, although it ignores some details and passages that other directors would have appreciated, is still very true to the story of the book. Its also necessary to remember that the size of Rowling's books has been gradually increasing, which may explain some of the omissions in the film. It can be said, in fact, that the movie, in a certain way, even surpasses the book.<br/><br/>And so, the saga walks to it's final films, which are increasingly more interesting, more adult, more deep and psychologically complex.

"jeffreyhillen-364-945381","7","1","3","9 September 2014"," Alright , but true to the book
","Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix is a real war movie. In this movie it is more about human rights but also about the first confrontation between the wizards.<br/><br/>In many ways the fifth film is a difficult battle for Harry. On a mental way he the fifth story is a very hard year for Harry. And when you make an movie of a book you have to take the most important parts of the book and bring that in the film. And I think they did a very good job on bringing this mental battle of Harry on screen. Than I am talking about Harry's moments with Umbridge, The battle between Harry and Voldemort when there is an inside battle but of course also the nightmares harry has. Another important thing that had to be included was the death of Sirius Black. Sirius was Harry's father figure and as Harry has many father figure's and I think it was a very interesting thing that Harry loses those people. Which means at a certain point he is no soldier anymore, he isn't the hero who is under the orders and rules of his guidance. He has to make his own choices. Sirius death was a very important thing with that. and in the books you really see they are building up a relationship which also transferred on screen. That was nice to see.<br/><br/>So looking at the story line they did a good job. I personally don't like the fifth book very much but they chose for the most important moments in the film, which was good. I think the cast did a very great job performing in this film. I liked Gary Oldman , Imelda Staunton in this movie. I think Daniel Radcliffe was absolutely great in this film there were some very difficult scene's for an actor. He was great! The best part of the film is obviously the fighting in the ministry, the special effects were amazing, most of all the scene between Dumbledore vs Voldemort. Great job David Yates. Only I wasn't satisfied about the music in the film. I missed John Williams.<br/><br/>Eventually I can say 8 out of 10 : Because of the strong emotional scenes and that they produced such a big book into a good movie, true to the book."
"parallel_projection","7","1","3","20 August 2012"," Overall a wonderful adaptation
","Let's face it. The entire book was never going to fit into a two-a-a-half hour long movie. People are complaining that there are so many aspects of the novel missing, and although I do have a few complaints, I think it was well written enough, and it was definitely very entertaining. <br/><br/>For some reason Steve Kloves decided not to adapt this movie, but I think Michael Goldenberg does a fine job. The movie is essentially propelled forward by a series of montages, that David Yates does a good job with, and which are accompanied by great scores from Nicholas Hooper, whose music overall was very fitting.<br/><br/>The acting, obviously, was excellent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are getting better every time now, and some others in the younger cast, such as Matthew Lewis, James and Oliver Phelps, Bonnie Wright, and, making her film debut appearance, Evanna Lynch, all did a great job.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was amazing, which they are every time. Ralph Fiennes is even better as Lord Voldemort, and Imelda Staunton was absolutely brilliant as Professor Umbridge. Additionally, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alan Rickman do a great job. Also, Emma Thompson, although only in the movie for about five minutes or so, gives and exceptional performance as Professor Trelawney.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is, and this is somewhat confusing, but the running time for this movie is only 2 hours and 19 minutes, which is long, but not for a Harry Potter movie. They removed the scene where Harry and the others visit the hospital, and many scenes in the department of mysteries. I understand that these might've been expensive to film, but it's not as if they have any lack of money, and these would've added greatly to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is a fantastic movie that, although it does waver from the book, does a great job at getting all the important parts in. It flows fluidly with great direction from David Yates, and is definitely worth a watch."

","Before his lame three future movies of HP, Yates delivers at last one good movie! First, the movie benefits from the excellent story of the eponymous book. It's not that i don't like the others but after this one, HP turns into private Potter and wizardry becoming war isn't my cup of tea. Here, they are still students and it's really their last one when they look still childish. Next, there's a great addition of new characters: Evanna is as eerie as Luna and Nat/Tonks directed a very funny making-of in the extras. But only the books will give you a deep view into them because in the movie, they are only fly over. I don't forget Dolores Umbridge who teaches a good lesson for audience: bad, mean people can look sweet and gentle! The trio faces a interesting evolution as well: Harry lacks patience and shows anger while Hermione and Ron are really true friends, accepting him as he is. So, it's really about helping each other and not fighting. The production and sets are beautiful, especially the Ministry. Its gloomy and mazing architecture recalls ""Brazil"" and above all, the entire movie is fortunately not salvaged by a poor cinematography. In conclusion, it's a vivid, full-colored phoenix that we got there!"
"illbebackreviews","7","1","3","9 January 2012"," What;s all the Criticism On this Film!!!??!!
","The first three Harry Potter films were directed with pure brilliance. The fourth was good, but the fifth film was everyone's big question. When I watched this film, I found it amazing. Later, I realized all the criticism on this film. I can't find what's wrong with the movie.<br/><br/>As far as I remember, the novel of OOTP had over 800 pages. It would be impossible to stuff in 800 pages of content into 2 1/2 hrs. Yet, David Yates had a perfect understanding of what to cut out and what to include. In my opinion, this film would be one of the harder films to direct in the series, and yet Yates did it brilliantly. He understood the concept of movie-making and he did great. The standouts of the film are the Order of the Phoenix and the battle between the Order and the Death Eaters as well as the Dumbledore vs Voldemort duel. This duel had one problem. Dumbledore seemed to be too frightened, which was the actor's way of having to portray him.<br/><br/>David Yates chose the brilliant Umbridge and the brilliant Bellatrix. Both actors had such a nasty look that you felt like killing them. That's how good the actors were and that's how good Yates's decisions were.<br/><br/>The scenes with Dumbledore's Army were well done as was Grawp. Another memorable scene in my opinion was the Kidnapping of Umbridge. It was magnificent.<br/><br/>David Yates did a great job with this film, and he deserves more credit than what he gets."

","I never have grown tired of this Potter film, in my opinion apart from the final two it is the best. It perfectly highlights the dangerous link between Voldemort and Harry, and takes viewers on a magical journey as Harry fights to find himself in this dark chapter. The final scenes are well acted and with Helena Bohnam Carter as Bellatrix it really makes the film thrilling and scary, giving a slight taste as to what fans should expect in the last Potter(s). Watching Harry Potter and Order of the Pheonix in cinema's made me realize as to exactly why i love all the Potter movies, it gave me goosebumps and the music was quite supportive of the theme too and i would recommend to all others if they have not seen this Potter then they are indeed missing out."

","All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","13 July 2009"," Under Yates, ""Potter"" No. 5 beautifully embraces the dark side of the novels
","Despite its fourth director in five tries and even a new screenwriter, the Harry Potter franchise takes a huge step forward in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" based off the fifth book in the young adult fantasy series by J.K Rowling. Whereas Harry's character growth took a backseat in the Mike Newell-directed fourth film, ""Goblet of Fire,"" ""Order of the Phoneix"" restores our protagonist to a place of inner turmoil where he is set to achieve great personal growth.<br/><br/>British TV director David Yates takes on the task of directing Michael Goldenberg's (2003 remake of ""Peter Pan"") script and the results are deeper and darker than Harry Potter has ever gone before on the silver screen. Gladly, Yates' favorite Potter film prior was the third, ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" directed by Alfonso Cuaron, who took a much more character-driven take on the series, which resonated more with most fans and critics. Yates successfully restores the series' intelligence and wit, remaining magical and mysterious but also full of tension and excitement. The pacing is quick like ""Goblet of Fire,"" but our portrait of Harry is in greater detail.<br/><br/>In ""Order of the Phoenix,"" Harry (Radcliffe) takes a step closer to his destiny as he learns more and more about Voldemort (Fiennes), the man who killed his parents and has tried to kill Harry in the past. Although Voldemort has returned, the Ministry of Magic, the governing body over wizards and witches, have been denying it to the public and spinning it to make Harry and his headmaster at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) look like conspirators. That brings Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to Hogwarts, a power-hungry old woman who takes the school under her control and fills it with propaganda. Harry and his friends must now take things into their own hands to prepare for Voldemort's inevitable rise to power.<br/><br/>As Voldemort's return to power looms fast-approaching in the distance, a dark overtone sweeps through all of this film and Yates is sure to use proper foreshadow to keep it so. His ace is Staunton, the series' most vivid antagonist to date. She's deranged in the pink and frilly sort of way and takes over Hogwarts with a laugh and a smile. In response, Harry forms an underground club where he teaches magic self-defense to fellow friends and students such as the usual Ron and Hermione (Grint and Watson), more extensive parts from Neville (Matthew Lewis), Ginny (Bonnie Wright) and Harry's crush Cho (Katie Leung) and new character Evanna Lynch as the odd and spacey Luna Lovegood. <br/><br/>But the film belongs to Radcliffe. This is his most trying performance as Harry yet and he meets great success. Harry is having constant nightmares in the story in addition to the one unfolding before him. Radcliffe really has to juggle anger, fear and his new role of leader. Thanks to some great writing and direction too, we understand exactly what Harry's going through at every turning point.<br/><br/>Most thrilling, however, is we get to see wizard fighting wizard action for the first time. It's beautiful, scary and really intense. Choreographer Paul Harris helps turn this wand-fighting into an art form and the visual effects crew does the rest with sparks flying and characters zooming about in puffs of smoke. Action can finally be added to the list of genres that Harry Potter applies to and without embellishment.<br/><br/>Just as Harry Potter begins to embrace his destiny in this film, ""Order of the Phoenix"" accepts the darkness that these books naturally have evolved toward and it does so with not only great visuals that bring the novel to life, but with Harry's inner struggle. Yates understands this and as long as he's there, we can count on the remaining two adaptations to do great justice to this story."

","If you haven't read the book u might think its a good movie but... no. The story was changed completely, and not the good way. A lot of things were left out and a lot was added... for example, harry never heard the prophecy, and he never gives it to Lucius... One thing that really annoyed me was the fact that every time someone fought the wands would get atached, like they did in the 4th move when voldemort attacks Harry, that is not supposed to happen, it only happened before because Harrys and Voldemorts wand were made with the same phonexs fethers.

I think if you added up the time actors were speaking and the time they were not, you would find a 50/50 split. The lack of action also made this movie seem like just one more installment.<br/><br/>My suspicion was correct - the director has been changed. The other installments in the story of Harry Potter were fast paced, loaded with charm, excitement, interesting, and fun. This one verges on being brooding droll and annoying. I was hoping this would change with the next (last?) installment but alas no - the same director of ""Order of the Phoenix"" is directing ""Half-Blood Prince"" - what a shame. Here I was just thinking that this is the only series of movies to go into history as maintaining a solid entertainment line, but alas no.<br/><br/>Amazingly everything else is absolutely the same strong entertainment as before (from production to acting), except for the very weak action line. It is so poor it drags the whole movie down _for me_. I couldn't wait until it was over.

","The series of Harry Potter always seem to be enjoyable and charming. However, this installment is rather quite gloomy. Hermione is portrayed as a powerful and intelligent witch, but most of her skills are rarely used against forces of evil. Most oh the time, she relies on Harry or someone else to rescue her as if she is in trouble. Dude, what is the use of being so talented if all the heroism is reserved for the male characters? Moreover, the character- Cho Chung's act makes me even more disappointed. She is ""well-known"" for her erotic mind. There is hardly a scene that she is not throwing herself into Harry and kissing him. She is such a filthy woman that she betrayed Harry(her beloved boyfriend) and give up to Malfoy who gaged her. All in all, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix exists to whet our appetite. It is such an eyesore that I strongly recommend all of you not to dare to glimpse it."

","Order of the Phoenix: Production and acting: very fine. Music: very good; sound and special effects: superb; and it is easy to enjoy all the well-formed characters.<br/><br/>That is the absolute full extent of my praise. The screenplay for this fifth Harry Potter movie needs more than just a bit of critical review. As a matter of fact, the plots for each entry in the series seem to be getting progressively poorer.<br/><br/>Why would anyone in their right mind continue to live with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and totally spoiled brat (and sadist) Big Dudley Dursley? My answer: The authoress needs a dramatic fulcrum, and some comic relief, to start each episode. Otherwise, I do wonder about Harry's lack of common sense in this issue.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Harry Potter just take steps to effectively neutralize Lucius Malfoy and his son, spoiled brat (and sadist) Draco? Through how many more spoiled, sadistic creeps must the audience suffer? After all, Lucius is known to be in league with He-Whose-Name-Cannot-Be-Uttered. My answer: We need all the villains we can get, no matter how illogical it is to keep them around. Actually, the villains seem to have longer life spans than the heroes in this series... Is there a moral pattern here?<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe was 17 years old when this film was released; Harry Potter is supposedly at least a year younger than that in this episode. Close; nothing a short haircut and owlish spectacles cannot help. Emma Watson plays Hermione Granger; just the right age for her character. Rupert Grint was 18 at the movie's release; he's beginning to look a bit aged for his part. Why don't they get new actors, or stop producing the series now, before these actors start to appear markedly aged? Answer: What? Lose all that fan base, and all that money? Sorry, what was I thinking...?<br/><br/>Why did J.K.R. have to announce to the assembled press corps of the world that Professor Albus Dumbledore is (fictionally) gay? What purpose did she have in doing that? Does that have any bearing on the story? Apparently not... (but future movie screenplays may tell)! Should parents warn their children about this useless fictional fact before the tykes partake of the books or movies? This does nothing to enhance anyone's enjoyment of the series, but it does, I fear, change my view of it, and cast niggling doubts about whether the authoress is in her right mind...<br/><br/>5 out of 10. The Harry Potter series seems to follow the apparently immutable rule that sequels cannot possibly be as good as the originals. Too bad this series is, apparently, no exception."

","OK, look, I'm a 62-year-old grandpa, and long ago gave up keeping track of all the story lines in these movies. I enjoyed the first one most, because it introduced me to the characters and the fantasy world that they are in. So I no longer try to keep track of everything, I just sit back and enjoy what I see on the screen.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe as most of us have come to see is the embodiment of Harry Potter, the fictional character. He has matured and now has the opportunity to take a leadership role among the young wizards, to fight off the evils that seem to be invading Hogwarts school. <br/><br/>Emma Watson is back as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. The two of them along with Potter make up what is most fun to watch. The rest of the characters, to me, are just there to allow the story to unfold and for Harry, Hermoine, and Ron to save the day. <br/><br/>I enjoyed it, but I suspect only die-hard Potter fans can get the full benefit of the movies anymore."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","3","25 November 2007"," The most bold and daring Harry Potter movie as of yet.
","Lots of people at the time praised ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" for its dark approach and atmosphere. Well, if ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a dark movie, than this is an ultra-dark movie. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a semi-dark children/fantasy movie that never really dared to cross the line. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is not afraid to this though. I must say that this movie is actually closer to horror than fantasy in my opinion. It had an incredible atmosphere, with also some classic build up horror moments. There is little room left for fun in this movie and it's all very serious. Yes, perhaps a bit too serious though. I felt that the movie could had used some relieving humor at times, something all of the other Harry Potter movies were still loaded with.<br/><br/>No, I'm not a great Harry Potter fan and never will be probably, but I have to give it credit for some thing. The series perfectly adapt to the maturing of the main characters as well as the viewers/readers. In other children book series the readers/viewers of course mature over the years, but the stories don't mature with them and everything remains just the same as the first book/movie. I praise the Harry Potter series for not doing so.<br/><br/>So the movie is quite different from any of the previous other Harry Potter movies. It has a new style, which provides the movie with a different atmosphere. This is being empathized all the more by the different musical score from the still unknown Nicholas Hooper. I liked this idea. A new approach calls for a new style, also in the music. None of the themes sound familiar or reminds us of any of the other previous Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>The movie is more political than fun. The whole taking over Hogwarts thing by the ministry was done quite nicely and interesting. Harry and friends need to face some serious grown up difficulties now. Voldermort is back, no doubt, which means that there now needs to be fought in a battle between life and death. So no giant spiders, house elves, games of quidditch, brewing potions behind closed doors or snakes this time, but a real murderous evil villain, with dangerous followers, that needs to be stopped.<br/><br/>I'm sort of fed up though with all of these new characters that constantly get introduced in every new Harry Potter movie. It's of course not that any of those characters are bad, or being portrayed by horrible actors, but it just goes at the expensive of already some fine and established actors, such as Minerva, Dumbledore, Snape and Hagrid, who are now all being pushed more to the background. The movie is now filled with literally dozens of characters, that are not all getting the attention they need and deserve.<br/><br/>This is a very recommendable movie, especially if you thought that all of the Harry Potter movies were still too childish.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"doodlersstuff","10","1","3","20 November 2007"," My Order of the Phoenix comments
","First of all, I have to agree wholeheartedly with the previous person and would like to add some more.<br/><br/>I thought the original casting of Richard Harris for Dumbledore was spot on - he was the exact image I had of him from reading the books and I loved his gentle quietness and yet very powerful demeanour. When I saw Michael Gambon for the first time, I thought...noooooo - it's all wrong - but as an adult I knew they were not going to be able to replace the late Richard Harris and to try to do so would have been futile - so they had to come up with a more ""off the wall"" character. It took me several years and countless viewings of Azkaban and Goblet to finally find that he has now grown on me. Thank god! Daniel, Emma and Rupert's acting abilities have certainly come a long way from what I thought was a bit robotish, reading off script to now a much more flowing sense of ease - growing into their characters and yes, showing by expression rather than words alone - they have done well. One thing in particular is Daniel's acting of emotional pain - he does that so well. Always brings tears to my eyes and a painful churning in my stomach. He achieved that also as the character of Jack, in ""My Boy Jack"" too. Very Well Done Dan! I think the films version of the kiss was actually better than the book - I think the books portrayal of Harry being so confudled by the idea of girls at the age of 15 is a bit out of date - boys are much more ""with it"" at that age - and this is where the film gets the vote for that scene, he comes across a bit more like a 15 year old boy would.<br/><br/>I only have one real disappointment - considering it is the longest book of the series, it so far is the shortest film at 2 hours 16 mins and it is because of this it gets my criticism. There was so much in this book that it definitely should have been a three hour film. So much was left out - important stuff that will affect the next two films. I really would love to have the people who decided on the length and what should be in it to tell me what the reason was behind it. It certainly cant be money - Warner Bros on a budget? I don't think so. It couldn't be because they thought kids couldn't sit still for three hours - as we know the books grow with kids, so its older ones watching it. So what on earth could the answer be? Deadline on the production causing them to cut scenes out? Actors being committed to other projects? Please someone give me a justified reason to why this film was so short and therefore compromised some vital elements. And please someone reassure me that this wont happen with the last two films.<br/><br/>There, that's my only moan - effects - brilliant, scenery - fantastic, music - fantastic.<br/><br/>All in all, 99.9% perfect. I have to be loyal!"
"monk_e_fish","6","1","3","17 September 2007"," Solid entry into the Potter canon but no masterpiece
","Given its long, sprawling, complex plot, The Order of the Phoenix has often been regarded as both the least enjoyable and the hardest to adapt on film of any of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. Bearing this in mind, the producers' decision to eschew any established or safe film directors in favour of David Yates, a man whose career thus far rests on well regarded, serious political dramas on TV, is a bold but potentially disastrous choice as director.<br/><br/>So, does Yates pull it off? Well, yes and no. The Potter series' jumping from director to director makes for some interesting differences in style and quality and on the whole Yates comes off quite well against the competition. For a man stepping up from TV to film, Yates does an admirable job with some of the grander sequences and set pieces, especially the final confrontation in the Ministry of Magic, and there is certainly a serious. grown up undercurrent to events that was completely absent from the early bright, fluffy Christopher Columbus pictures. However, Yates equally does not manage to imbue his film with a real sense of magic and wonder, or the constant threat evident in Alfonso Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban, easily the finest of the series so far. While the only strong evidence that this is Potter from the man who brought you State of Play lies in the repeated montages of newspaper headlines and a plot strand concerning media campaigns and government spin, this is, in fact, a relatively minor part to the film.<br/><br/>Yates' film begins strongly, anchoring the sinister in the everyday as we see Harry in a very ordinary playground bullied by his unpleasant cousin and his cronies, things soon take a dark magical turn with the appearance of a soul sucking dementor in an underpass, so successfully threatening in Prisoner of Azkaban. Yates handles this with impressive disturbing effect, however it turns out to be the last time in the movie the audience really fear for the characters' safety. Back at Hogwart's, we are on fairly familiar ground and it is largely business as usual, even if the removal of another visually spectacular but rather tedious Quidditch game does provide a refreshing change. Rowling's plot is not focused enough on the threat of the returned dark lord Voldemort to give the plot any drive and seem like anything more than an episodic series of public school trials and tribulations.<br/><br/>Of course, this is where Yates is able to reveal his secret weapon, Imelda Staunton, perfectly cast as Dolores Umbridge, a nicely different type of villain, all twin sets, pink and china plates with cats, her cheery demeanour hides a chilling intensity of purpose and narrow mindedness. Staunton gives one of the best performances of any of the illustriously starry cast in the whole series as she inflicts her reign of moral repression on the school through a series of proclamations hung on every available space on the wall. Unfortunately, although her bullying of the pupils, reaching a height with a strong sequence in which Harry is punished by writing lines with a magic pen that cuts the words into his hand, is effective as it is only just removed from how ordinary people view their teachers anyway, she does not provide a major threat and is rather quickly brushed aside to make way for the climax of the plot.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Staunton's performance means that the rest of the cast exist rather in her shadow, many of the big names showing up more through contractual obligation than a need to add anything to the plot. Alan Rickman as the sinister Snape remains underused, while Gary Oldman, no longer the fearsome and dangerous Prisoner of Azkaban, is stuck with a series of unimpressive sentimental moments and Helena Bonham Carter, as his witch relative Bellatrix Lestrange, another new addition to the cast, has barely anything to add. As for the young leads, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint once again improve a little on the previous film whilst still not really giving three dimensional performances. Although Evanna Lynch provides an impressively odd turn as creepily not all there Luna Lovegood.<br/><br/>One actor that does make the best of limited screen time is Ralph Fiennes, back again as the evil Voldemort. Fiennes has a great presence in the movie, needing little more than a strange crook of the neck to appear a threat. Meanwhile, his cowled and masked Death Eaters are equally sinister. Once the movie finally arrives at its finale with Voldemort having lured Harry and friends to a vast hall of crystal balls in the Ministry and our heroes are attacked by the dark figures, the film finally gets going but it has spent a little too long in getting there. The finale is spectacular even though Oldman's final moments are just a little confusing and anti-climactic.<br/><br/>In all, Yates does a solid job of adapting this difficult book, cutting down the plot to a manageable length, although he is a little over-reliant on montage, and throwing in some big moments. He has shown enough to justify his return for film six, The Half Blood Prince, however he will have to prove himself capable then of providing more than a superficial film with a greater sense of peril. The Potter films have always been more impressive when viewed as a series, when the true achievement of this grand scheme is obvious and the familiarity of Hogwart's becomes part of the appeal, and Order of the Phoenix is one of the better films in the series, however on its own it is certainly no masterpiece. ***"

","New director ruined the movie. That says it all. Yes, the book was way too big to bring it fully to the screen, it lacked action and contained too many intrigues and political nuances. It was hard to screen, but I'm sure, doable. Why not Mr. Columbus? Why not Mr. Cuaron? Why, at least, Mr. Newell, who's dark and depressive, but still whole and logical adaptation of the fourth book was quite watchable? But this, I-don't-know-who director, that has no big experience..<br/><br/>His movie looks torn apart. Cutting is awful. For viewer, unfamiliar with the book, events are odd and happening without order and logical connection between them. Such an ""Blair Witch"" effect in all.

I have found the darker tones of the films quite interesting and have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movies.<br/><br/>The order of the Phoenix sees Harry Potter fairly isolated at times and the performance of Daniel Radcliffe is quite commendable. With an excellent supporting cast this is probably going to be one of the best acted blockbusters of the summer. I've always found Gary Oldman one of the finest actors and he doesn't disappoint here.

I couldn't even figure out who was talking - Harry or Dudley; it went too fast to tell. Even the beginning credit sequence was cut short - silenced in mid-overture. The ending seems like an after thought - many plot pieces that should have been much more coddled were left to simple half minute scenes. The high point in this film is not the end, but the middle - when Umbridge is making all her ridiculous rules. It's kind of sad - that isn't really the most important part of the plot but it is given movie-star treatment, and is done well. Nearly the entire middle of the movie is quite enjoyable - though, obviously, cut short from the book. Had the rest of the movie been like this, I would have given it a much higher rating.<br/><br/>This director could do to learn something from the Lord of the Rings director - how to compact a very long, drawn-out book into a well-paced movie that EVERYONE can understand and enjoy."

","I'm not usually one to post comments on films. As a matter of fact this is my first time writing a review, but as a fan of the Harry Potter series(both books and films), I felt it my responsibility to warn fellow moviegoers of the latest adaption of our favorite boy wizard's adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br/><br/>Weeks before the movie's release I already had my doubts. After all how can the longest and possibly most revealing book in the series be the shortest of the five films to date. How do you fit over 900 pages of near perfect dialogue into a 138 minute movie and still hit all the key issues covered in the book. Well after watching the film it all became quite clear, you can't.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I realize you can't possibly fit every little detail in a film. Order of the Phoniex's predecessors never did, but what those films were was informative to the point that the only question needed to be asked was ""I wonder what will happen in the next one""? The latest leaves viewers not familiar with books asking ""what the hell was all that about""? In the end it's just a poor storyline that been disguised with state of art special effects. <br/><br/>Quite a shame really because this could have easily been the best in series by far. I will end the review on a somewhat positive note however. Despite the numerous flaws in the writing, direction and editing, the individual performances of the cast were outstanding. I can only imagine how great they would had they been working with an adequate adaptation."
"Cinema_Fan","4","1","3","22 July 2007"," Lacks structure and pace. Mr. Yates needs to brush up on his interpretation skills.
","Be it the first or the last season, but excluding the third, with Harry and his friends at Hogwarts, this years school term feels exactly the same as the previous terms. This year we see a much drawn-out affair that takes great pains to expel any adventure and fun, yes, fun. For the same messages that we have become accustomed to, such as Harry's parents, Lord Voldemort's so-called appearance and his good-time older friends treating him as the child that they, and we too, still see him as, is no fun to watch any longer. He really does need to become more assertive and independent, this does happen in a tiny moment, but it seems more tantrum and transcendence.<br/><br/>With the conspiracy theorists out to outdo our hero's reputation, once more, it really is surprising how much this young man can take after the last four years, Harry is led into the world of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation banded together, by the elder wizards and witches, to challenge the evils of Lord Voldemort. But what a waste, as Harry is pampered around these guardians, it is obvious that these magnificent men, and women, on their flying machines are only a fleeting and almost none affair throughout the entire movie. Whose only appearance, toward the end, is to do battle with their evil nemesis, the final battle, if we can call it that, is over before it starts, another anticlimax to an uneventful journey in the life of master Potter and his friends.<br/><br/>The short-lived characters coming and goings, and more often goings, such as Rubeus Hagrid and his journey to the land of giants, to find allies, but only comes back with a half-wit brother who serves no purpose at all, and what did become of these giants? Hagrid, along with Remus Lupin and Alastor 'Mad-­Eye' Moody, who no doubt we'd like to have seen more off, felt like they were just there to prop up the plot and serve as little purpose as possible. All well and good perhaps, but wasn't the title of this fifth term called the Order of the Phoenix? We know that a Phoenix can regenerate itself but these Phoenix's make very little time and effort to generate any screen time at all, it is then bewildering and farcical as to why the movie was called Order of the Phoenix in the first place. Having read the book, I can fully understand, but these are two completely different mediums here, and to simply take one from another and pass it off as the first is both dangerous and arrogant. To have so many holes and questions left unfulfilled and unanswered in this movie can possibly do irreversible damage to its reputation as a whole. Are the movie makers of these novels becoming complacent or are the books too long too interpret into the medium of film? This could be just giving the public what they want, but to judge them as a whole, as two mediums that should work as one is too a dangerous act. One plus one may not always add up to one here, as we have been shown, but it does add up to two, without a doubt: Novel vs. Movie. Take your pick.<br/><br/>Yet again, the emphasis is centred on Harry and his friends, of course, and this time becoming that little more rebellious, that little more independent, and why not, while the cats are away the mice shall play. But do we have to be constantly reminded of his poor dear parents, his poor old scar and while all this is going on it truly distracts from the adventure and excitement of magic and witchcraft. The opening sequence looked very promising (and how much has young Dudley Dursley changed, until his name was spoken he was unrecognisable, he seems to be the first to have a completely new personality) but then we see the same, if not very much older and larger actors, as to can be said for Mr and Mrs. Weasley, uncle and aunt, setting the same rift and contempt. Another term, another year, and another pound around the old waistlines of all our favourite characters'.<br/><br/>Yes, this David Yates interpretation of the J.K. Rowling novel is more prone to droughts of fulfilment and stimulation than the highly sub-plotted, imaginative and creative Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) by Alfonso Cuarón, in all areas of movie-making here. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2008) shall be the final term of endeavour and with Mr. Yates at the top of the class once more. Let's hope he has learnt some very important lessons by then, or detention may not be enough, expulsion may be his only option if he fails to rise up to the level of courageous and inventive movie-maker and there are no excuses for not delivering the goods on time. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007): Repetitive, short-lived and disappointing, stay behind for extra studies. If you know what's good for you."
"owlman-4","10","1","3","21 July 2007"," The best of the series to date!
","While some reviewers point out a few inconsistencies with the book, I think this movie reflects an absolutely outstanding job of synthesizing the whole essence of the 5th book and presenting it in an extremely interesting and riveting way. The visual aspects of this movie are remarkable; the IMAX & 3D presentation was nothing less that superb; the sound and score were excellent; and the bar for acting has certainly been raised from any of the previous movies, especially Daniel Radcliffe's performance.<br/><br/>I was extremely pleased about this movie and would think that this is clearly the best of the Harry Potter series."

","To those of u who have read the book and already know how great it was and also depressing, the movie highlights all its aspects and unlike the 4th movie which included details that didn't exist in the book and was awfully annoying, the 5th movie does contain details like so but it really fits into the plot and actually makes it better... The acting itself has improved beyond measures, especially Dan, it shows a lot in his expressions and his out-bursts, they also act older and finally can show that the movie is no longer in the shadow of the kids section (no offence to the young ones here), thanks to David Yates whose efforts are worldwide appreciated by the HP fans as he is the first to make it seem more like an adult movie."

"MartinPh","4","1","3","19 July 2007"," Garbled and unfocused
","To this non-reader of the book, the plot line in this film hardly made any sense at all. There is a great fuss about 'a prophecy' Voldemort needs to get his hands on, but what it is or why he needs it remains unclear almost until the end. And once found, it basically appears to dispense the tacky morale that Voldemort is the true weakling because he'll never know love or friendship. That eventually either he or Potter must die is again not an insight that seems to require any great prophetic gifts. Before these stunning pieces of wisdom are revealed, towards the finale of the movie, the viewer has sat through a prolonged but lame attempt to psycho-dramatize HP. Though Potter ended up as the hero in each of the previous movies, we here find him all of a sudden an inexplicable outcast, old friends suddenly picking fights with him. Are his buddies that fickle? Themes of loneliness and first love crop up, but are handled in a hackneyed and rather embarrassing way. There's much ado about The Kiss, yet at the first setback HP apparently drops his girlfriend like a brick, and without a question asked or a word of explanation offered. The adolescent shouting matches might have been just bearable hadn't the acting been so wooden.<br/><br/>Worse, the attempts at realism compromise the mood of magic and surprise that was maintained in one way or another throughout the previous installments. Moments of quasi art-house spareness and puerile introspection do not sit well with the undeniably dazzling visualizations of the magical world - even though some of the latter (the great hall with its magical ceiling; the moving paintings; the brooms etc.) do pale somewhat on their fifth outing. On the other hand the design of the Ministrry of Magic is spectacular to say the least.<br/><br/>Many characters merely seem to put in an appearance to remind us that they are still around. New characters do not generally improve matters. Helena Bonham Carter was better as the Corpse Bride; here, she merely overacts. Imelda Staunton, though, is a joy to watch and makes the most of the twisted Umbridge.<br/><br/>It all ends with a big wizard fight that looks like ""Lord of the Rings meets The Matrix"", and no doubt will satisfy viewers hungry for spectacle. None of it, though, struck me as particularly original, nor very exciting to be honest.<br/><br/>Inconsistencies abound, of course. I wondered how it was that nobody could see the thestrals except those ""who have seen death"", yet later on Ron and Hermione who couldn't see them before are suddenly flying on their backs. The idea of Umbridge letting herself be lured, all alone, into the woods by the youngsters whom she knows to be her sworn enemies is way of track. And if it is as easy to kill with a spell as we see here, why didn't Malfoy sr., or Voldemort, or Potter for that matter, die ages ago? As I see more of the movies, I not only wonder where it's all going, but I rather get the impression that Mrs. Rowling was wondering the same while writing it all. In the final reckoning, I'd rate OOtP below GoF, and way below PoA, which remains in my view by far the strongest installment to date."

","First i want to say for those who read the book 5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,they will for sure be kind of irritated when they see that some parts are not the same at the movie and that there is a lot of changes.Some parts are missing,some are added...And for sure,those who read the book,are going to expect a lot of this movie.But i want you just to stop and think about for one thing for a second-if they make a movie to be just like the story in the book-how much do you think the movie would last?I would like to say that I'm amazed how they created this movie.Its a lot scarier,a lot exciting,the acting of characters is just getting better and better.I am amazed how they described some parts of the book and put it into movie(the coming of dementors,the occlumency lesson with Snape,the dream of Harry being a snake,the department with mysteries and killing Sirius Black and Harry's pain at that moment,the part when Voldermort turn inside harry etc.etc.etc...)i am veeeeeeery satisfied.

"cococostella","4","1","3","19 July 2007"," Worst of the series so far
","I've seen this movie twice, and neither time was I impressed. I like it simply because it's a Harry Potter movie and I'm a Harry Potter fan, but at the same time it is my least favorite out of all five in the series so far.<br/><br/>Of course there were things left out of the movie - it is, after all, the longest book and the shortest movie, so of course they couldn't cram everything into 2 hours and 15 minutes. But what about Hermione and SPEW and the house elves? What about Ron's spot on the Quidditch team (actually, Quidditch wasn't even mentioned in this movie)? What about the fact that the prophecy could have been talking about Harry or Neville? In leaving things out, Yates (the director) has left out important information, has failed to explain things properly (especially to people who have not read the books), and has demoted Ron and Hermione from main characters to mere sidekicks.<br/><br/>This movie has transition scenes, at least, which is more than I can say for the Goblet of Fire. Yet it seems to rush through things, and has poor character portrayal (by the younger actors, at least) and no set mood (comedy? drama? who knows). Throughout the movie, I felt as if Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and their friends were merely a bunch of actors on a stage instead of Harry, Ron, Hermione and the gang. I felt nothing towards any of them; even during the scene in the Department of Mysteries where Sirius falls through the veil, I felt as detached as if I were watching ants on an ant farm. And ironically, I thought Luna Lovegood's character was better than even Harry's."
"meesamcduck","10","1","3","17 July 2007"," Loved it
","Now all of the Harry Potter films are wonderful and kept many fans wanting more. I found this movie most likely my favorite so far in the series (The third book is my favorite). I felt it was a little bit slow in the beginning and there wasn't much fighting scenes until the end, but all in all, it was very deep. I found the heaviness of this movie made it greater than the others. Of course, they left out things that were in the book, which drives me crazy. But i understand that if they threw everything in, it would turn out to be a twenty hour film, as well with the other four movies. I really enjoyed this one, it was emotional, humorous, exciting, fun, and magical. I like how in this film, the makers interpreted in their own way how Voldemort tried to get to Harry, by trying to possess him in the end, very creative."
"aah_dandanakka","2","1","3","17 July 2007"," One the the worst films
","apart from the camera, there was NOTHING,absolutely nothing in the movie. I should accept that the story was good but the screenplay was HORRIBLE to the core. I don't know how you people can give 8.1/10 for this movie...please don mistake me but I'm a big fan of harry potter series myself but i guess i got a bit too disappointed. some of the good points about the movie were cinematography and that's about it. the dialogues were not up to the mark as well. I am being really harsh on all of them regarding this part in particular. I wish to see them put a better show next time. Last of all, I don't understand one point.. the director has the story which is the preliminary and the screenplay is all that needs. people have done a awful job with this novel. i feel sorry for Rowling for messing up her work."
"yamipegasus","10","1","3","17 July 2007"," This is not the book.
","First, I'd like to start by saying that I haven't read the book. I refuse to read any of the books until I have finished seeing all the movies, so that I don't waste time picking apart minor detail inconsistencies. I am judging this movie by its value as a movie, not its accuracy to the book.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was great: the acting was top notch, the music was more than fitting, the set design was stellar, the lighting was top notch... I could go on and on about what was done right during production, but the writing (something typically done during preproduction) was better than everything else that this movie did right combined. Though I don't know how closely this movie sticks to Rowling's original story, I do know that many of the ""haters"" are wrong.<br/><br/>I've heard from people who have read the book that the plot doesn't flow well in the movie. This is not true at all; the flow may have been different but it was very good. I've heard that certain scenes which were omitted from the book make the movie difficult to understand. This is also incorrect; even though I haven't been exposed to these missing scenes, I understood the movie perfectly. I've heard that mistakes were made in the writing of the movie which cause large continuity errors. I did not notice any continuity errors either within the movie or to previous movies in the series.<br/><br/>This is the first (maybe not last, but probably) time I've ever walked out of a movie at the theater thinking to myself ""This is the best movie I've ever seen."" Purists can feel free to complain all they want, but this remains an excellent movie. Not having read the book, I can neither confirm or deny that the book was better than the movie, but I can say without a doubt that this film is a must see for anybody who is old enough to handle it and is familiar (or is willing to become familiar) with the previous Harry Potter stories."

"mheath-9","3","1","3","16 July 2007"," Really Poor Film
","Its true to state that this film is absolutely nothing like the book. It contains around 35% of the events that actually happen so prepare for disappointment - but thats not the reason why this film fails on so many levels. Initially, lets start with some positives. Michael Gambon does an excellent job of playing Dumbledore, a complete reversal to his dreadful portrayal in the Goblet of Fire. The special effects are excellent (and probably save this film from being completely unwatchable)and errrr... thats about it. The characters Ron and Hermione barely have any dialogue in this instalment, a shame since it is usually their performances that carry the talentless and wooden actor Daniel Radcliffe through the previous films. It is true that Daniel Radcliffe looks the part but his adaptation of Harry is awful. Alan Rickman is solid in his portrayal of Snape but his brief cameo in the film only highlights the fact that all the characters that Harry Potter fans have grown to love and hate barely appear at all. I envisage that in the near future that these films will be re made with the help of better script writers, indeed, the previous lord of the rings films, before Peter Jackson produced the trilogy, were awful and thus I conclude that that this again will happen. Very Poor, Very Dull. Harry Potter 5 Avada Kedavra!!!"
"MaxBorg89","7","1","3","16 July 2007"," Still a great deal of fun, but less captivating than previous installments
","With each new film, the Harry Potter franchise gets darker and more mature, perhaps also to reflect the fact that the audience has grown up along with the characters. ""Darker"", however, is not synonymous with ""better"", in fact Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the least accomplished entry in the series so far.<br/><br/>And yet it starts very promisingly: following a quarrel with his cousin Dudley, now a cruel bully, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is attacked by Dementors and thus forced to use magic in front of Muggles (i.e. human beings). Now, had this happened in one of the preceding movies, he would have gotten away with a mere warning, if even that. Unfortunately, that is not the case, as the Ministry of Magic has become incredibly paranoid when it comes to Harry: not only are they threatening to have him expelled from Hogwarts, they have also openly stated that the return of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), which the teen wizard witnessed at the end of Goblet of Fire, is a scandalous lie invented with the purpose of spreading panic and allowing Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to take over the Ministry. Given the situation, all that is left to do is prepare for the imminent, inevitable battle in secret, which is why Dumbledore has restored the Order of the Phoenix, whose most prominent members include Harry's godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). Sadly, they can't do much to solve Harry's other problem: Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), a Ministry employee who has managed to be appointed as the new teacher of Defense against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Her intentions? To keep all students disciplined, make sure no one mentions the Dark Lord and, generally, turn all the good people's lives into Hell.<br/><br/>Regarding the tone, which is closer to (moderate) horror than fantasy (hence the PG-13 rating that has been applied since the fourth film), some critics have expressed their disappointment, fearing the last two movies, yet to be filmed, might become too violent for the franchise's target audience. And while it is true that an R-rated seventh episode would lose many of its viewers, it is equally true that the bleak moments are the best in the whole film: the last half-hour is arguably the strongest conclusion a Potter film's had to date, emotionally speaking, whereas everything that comes before that, especially the lighter stuff, is quite uneven.<br/><br/>The problem has almost nothing to do with the adaptation, in fact director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to make an accessible, entertaining blockbuster out of an 800-page book which, according to many, is the weakest in the saga. Nearly all the unnecessary stuff that could have been amusing but wasn't very relevant in terms of plotting (such as possible returns for Kenneth Branagh and Miranda Richardson's characters) has been left out, ensuring the film hardly ever gets slowed down by futile digressions. There are, nonetheless, a few instances that are included in the movie but could easily have been left on the cutting room floor. What, for example, is the point of having Sirius' house elf Kreecher appear, when his contribution to the film's events equals zero (although he had an important role in the novel)? The same goes for Remus Lupin: it is nice to have David Thewlis back on board, but with very little of relevance to do or say the overall feeling is that his presence is merely a reminder of how great the third flick was (Brendan Gleeson, on the other hand, is allowed more space to reprise his quirky role from the previous installment). And last, but not least, the much talked-about kiss between Harry and Cho Chang (Katie Leung), which is part of the ""teen romance"" section introduced in the fourth picture, is actually a huge disappointment because: a) there is no more mention of the love story in the rest of the picture; b) the scene itself, being completely flat and lifeless (and what we see is supposedly the best of the several takes that were required), stands out as the single dullest moment in the franchise's history, making it even more ironic that the subsequent sequence, a conversation between Harry and Ron that follows the book word for word (""How was it?"" ""Wet!""), is one of the series' comic highlights.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, though, the film seems to work pretty well, mainly thanks to the consistently reliable cast: Radcliffe is at his best, angry and in pain, while Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman, sidelined in the fourth film, are enabled to steal the show once again, the former warm and humane, the latter deliciously sinister. As for the bad guys, Fiennes' role is, as usual, brief but instantly memorable, and the same ought to be said of Jason Isaacs, finally allowed to fully show his dark side. Now, what about Staunton? Well, she is far from bad as an actress, but her characterization makes Umbridge more of an annoying buffoon rather than an unsettling threat, making it possible for fellow ""bad girl"" Helena Bonham Carter, who is truly disturbing and scary as the demented Bellatrix Lestrange, to outshine her.<br/><br/>In the end, Order of the Phoenix is pretty good on its own, but sub-par compared to previous achievements. Hopefully Yates, who will direct the sixth film as well, will deliver a more even product next time.<br/><br/>6,5/10"
"Korben_Dallas","6","1","3","16 July 2007"," Disappointing...
","First of all, I think it's stupid and unfair to label fans as ""disappointed"" only because the movie isn't 10 hours long and it doesn't match the book word-by-word. I'm a fan of the books and I've enjoyed the movies so far. Goblet of Fire was faithful enough and had good pace and a great finale. For some reason ""Order of the Phoenix"" which is the longest book of the series, has less 20 minutes than GoF and has a lot more content and characters. Too much stuff happens and Harry is probably the only character with more than 5 lines of text. There are a lot of holes in the plot, needless changes from the book (Sirius' scene... why?) and a sense of rush that prevents you from enjoying the best parts. Umbridge was great as well as Luna, but Dumbledore continues to be a completely different character from the book. It's a shame that Michael Gambon didn't even bother to read the books, cause Dumbledore is obviously a key character in the series. It's great to see HP in the screen but if you've read the book you can't help but feel disappointed, especially cause it could've been a much better film with another 20 minutes and less changes from the book."
"djnumbers","8","1","3","16 July 2007"," Stop comparing the book to the film. really.
","I haven't read one word from any HP book. And because of that I probably have no right to write a critique of the critics. But I have seen all the movies and OotP is easily the best FILM of the HP series and generally a good movie. Keep that non-profane four-letter f-word in mind. FILM.<br/><br/>YOU CANNOT COMPARE A BOOK TO A FILM. Stop passing judgment based on what the film omitted/changed from the book. I understand that many of you are hardcore book-readers who want to see as much of the book as possible in the cinematic representation. However, movies are an entirely different entertainment medium from books.<br/><br/>Remember that filmmakers have to consider infinitely more aspects of presenting a story than an author.<br/><br/>What does an author need to write a good book? A good story, a laptop maybe, and a publisher. Any constraints? None on length, sometimes on composition time, marketability is a concern, little money is needed for production (no budget), and generally authors get paid AFTER the book is done (unless the publisher expects a best-seller, which is uncommon).<br/><br/>What does a filmmaker(director) need to make a good movie? A good story, millions of dollars from a studio which will limit your creative freedom, good actors (who are hard to find and/or cost a fortune), an able cinematographer, a score composer/good soundtrack, the space to shoot the movie, a cgi team (very expensive, especially for fantasy films), and countless other pieces in a film puzzle. Any constraints? money, money, money, production schedules, actor schedules, the right time of day for certain scenes, marketability is many times more important for a film compared to a book, the fact that there's a budget necessitates much omission, 1 1/2 to 3 hours in length, and money.<br/><br/>I think I have a good analogy for this issue: someone is asked to depict the ups and downs of an entire 16-game season of a football team as one 60-minute game. Wouldn't there be ample omission? the creator would have to make tough decisions about what's most important/interesting and leave out the rest. One game is nowhere near as detailed and varied as a season, but no one wants to watch 16 games in one sitting. Same goes for book-to-film adaptations.<br/><br/>So to argue that films and books aren't at all comparable, I had to make a comparison. The director(forgot his name) had 3 hours max to adapt an 870-page book. And given the expected young, impatient audience, the studio must have implored him to keep the length down. Give him a break. The movie was great.<br/><br/>I've also seen suggestions to split this movie into multiple parts. That makes no sense. HP is already going to be 7 different films! how would splitting any of them for the sake of the books work? Critics, please leave the book out of the HP movie comments. For real. Stop it."

","Firstly I want to say that this comment is coming from a big big hardcore die-hard fan of HP. As I said if you're going to watch the novel than you'll be disappointed because so much is cut in the movie that a die-hard fan of book will not be delighted as happened to me but when i watched it second time i thought this was the best potter yet. This was the first potter movie in which i really felt that i am watching a sequel. Previous two were completely indifferent from each other. However reason I always enjoyed HP movie is that i never compared them to novel.5th is one of my favorite & this movie did justice to it. There are emotions there is action everything is there to make a perfect movie.<br/><br/>There are fun moments there are dark moments.One moment you laugh next moment scene completely changes. Movie is so rushed so fast like dementors attack.Mr.Weasley is attacked next scene he is alright. Snape's Worst memory scene is of seconds but explains everything. Prophecy is too short Harry never mourns over death of Sirius nor show his anger nor ask why going through veil took his life. Movie just end. But scenes like Umbridge's scenes as high inquisitor, Room of requirement's, Harry's possession by Dark Lord,Final Battle are just perfect. They can't be better. Fred & George's escape i daresay is better than i imagined. Harry/Cho relationship is just superb.The duel between DD & Dark Lord is just one of the best moments in movie industry.I always thought can Gambon do justice with this duel,Or how will be last battle in Veil room will look like & now i can say everything was perfect Yates is successful to capture the tension the greatness of last few chapters.What to say about Ralph i just love him as Dark lord he is the one & only Dark Lord.You just didn't get a second to blink your eye in last scenes.<br/><br/>Imelda gave her best performance as Umbridge. Her scenes are some of the best moments in HP yet.Helena, Jason were best. As far as acting is considered everybody gave their best performances. Dan delivered his best yet. His possession scenes his abrupt change to Dark lord his portrayal of anger is just brilliant. Rupert first time stood as an important part of movie after 2nd. Emma is good. Bonnie ,Neville stand out in the movie. Michael Gambon first time look like DD.If there is a Dumbledore except Great Richard Harris Its Michael Gambon.Evanna is just perfect her expressions her persona all are just luna-ish. First time i can't hate Snape but loved him he was more sinister than before.<br/><br/>But the most lovable character played is by Gary Oldman his brief role left a great impact on me. Seeing that he may not return to HP he delivered the most heart warming performance really cried by his performance the way he said ""get away from my godson"" or his tapestry explanation just made me cry. His scenes really made you feel his closeness to Harry his loss of a friend which he can never forget & seeing his image in Harry. Gary Oldman is one of the greatest actors & i award an Oscar to him for this performance. Natalia Tena impressed even by her seconds role. Emma Thompson, David Thwelis, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Brendon Gleeson, Tom Felton were there because they were meant to be there.<br/><br/>Special effects were breathtaking.Grawp, Kreacher, Thestrals looked amazing. Wand duelling in last is just as i imagined. So before making any view about movie think about details that were cut in the movie & think about were they needed? Movie is not only for fans but also for non-readers & they can't sit through 4-5 hrs. Lastly i've to say they did a fine job condensing a 800 page book in 2hr something movie. Everything about this movie is just plain great. You just feel that Alfanso is back. Davis Yates is just best as director(which i doubted before).I am so delighted he is back for 6th. Go watch this HP movie You'll not be disappointed it'll be one of the best times of your life(as it proved to be of mine).<br/><br/>10/10(I can't give more)"
"moviewizguy","9","1","3","14 July 2007"," The Rebellion Begins
","As another year begins for Harry, at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry so does the never-ending articles stating that he and Dumbledore are insane. As the ministry starts to invent new and malicious lies about Harry's account on Voldemort's return, Hogwarts begins to change for the worse as the ministry sends in their cure for all the insanity, Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge. As she begins to inflict her rules and regulations on the students at Hogwarts they begin to find that with her as their teacher, they'll never be ready for the outside world.<br/><br/>So Harry along with his friends decides to take things into their own hands and begin to learn magic the real way. As Harry starts having visions of terrible events happening with the Ministries very walls he decides to take action, leading himself and his friends into battle, ultimately teaching them what friendship, loyalty and sacrifice really means.<br/><br/>You know how crazy the trailer and TV spots are, showing all the good parts in the film? Yeah, that got me very excited for the film. I set a very high expectation for this film. Maybe a little bit too high. With each film getting better and better by each entry, this one is the worse, by far, although it is still a great film.<br/><br/>Maybe the mistake is a new writer (Michael Goldenberg)? Or maybe the film is too short? Ironically, this is the longest book in the series but the shortest running time. I felt that the movie was rushed, trying to fit everything in the short 2 hour and 10 minutes it has. The editing is very noticeable.<br/><br/>With that being said, this movie goes straight to the point, like Fantastic Four 2, which is encouraging for people who haven't read the films and discouraging for fans of Harry Potter. Yeah, it talks more of the plot but most of the fun in the previous four films are taken out and more depressing things are added in.<br/><br/>Why can't they have made it a three hour movie? I'm sure people don't mind it. For a person who have read the books, they have cut out many important elements. Another bad thing from the running time is the short appearances made by brilliant cast members. For example, blink and Sybil Trelawney (wonderfully played by Emma Thompson) might be gone. Same goes for Alan Rickman's performance on Snape.<br/><br/>No doubt this film might be liked by some and disliked by others and that the film is the darkest and most visaulistic yet. The visual effects are even better and seamless. The action sequences, less in this film, are good but not better than the last film. The music, although different, isn't up to par with the previous films.<br/><br/>I like the new look of the film. Obviously, each director has their own perspective on the world of Harry Potter and I would love to see another director making another new look for this series. It's refreshing and not repetitive.<br/><br/>The main three cast members have grown mature over their roles, most notably Daniel Radcliffe, who gives a great performance. Another person who gives a brilliant performance is Imelda Staunton. She is the perfect role for Dolores Umbridge! And how about the kissing scene? Well, just watch the movie for yourself.<br/><br/>Although not the best movie in the series, it is certainly a worthy sequel. The film is magical. The look of it is great. If you're a fan, you might be disappointed or you might like it. For an average movie goer, you'll notice nothing and that's probably the reason you'll love it."
"adudewhoiscool","9","1","3","13 July 2007"," Congrats David Yates!
","In 1997 JK Rowling introduced to the world a small eleven-year-old boy who discovers that he is a wizard. Fast forward to today (seven books, five films later) this boy, Harry Potter, is one of the biggest phenomenons of today. With an amazing book series and four brilliant films to the résumé, will the newest film, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" still have that ""Harry Potter"" magic? To this reviewer's surprise, considering that the book was his least favorite, the movie was one of the best of the series.<br/><br/>Harry returns to his fifth year at Hogwarts full of ill fortune. Few of students and parents believe him, or Dumbledore, that Voldemort is back. The Ministry of Magic had decided to step in by appointing a new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, Delores Umbridge, which proves to be the nastiest person Harry has ever encountered. To top it off, Harry is having some mysterious dreams featuring Voldemort. Can Harry Potter survive his toughest year at Hogwarts yet? <br/><br/>If you are a hardcore Harry Potter nerd you will probably trash this movie to pieces. There are a lot of missing subplots but if you have watched any of the Harry Potter movies, or any book adaptations for that matter, you will realize that most adaptations is not 100% the book. Just look at the runtime, 2 Hrs and 18 minutes (the shortest of the films), and you would realize that it would have been impossible to fit all 870 pages. They cut out some good sub plots, for example: zero references to Quidditch, but they kept the theme of the book intact and that is what this reviewer wanted and hoped for as a companion to the book.<br/><br/>The acting was amazing. There should be props given out to David Yates for getting the best performances out of the young actors, especially Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley). For the first time, it felt like Ron Weasley was more then just the butt of the jokes. The veteran actors (Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Garry Oldman, Emma Thompson, and others) are always great. The newest additions: Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix), newcomer, Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), Natalia Tena (Nymphadora Tonks) were also great. The best was Imelda Staunton as Professor Umbridge. She pulled off her villainous role so well that you hate her more then Voldemort.<br/><br/>This is the most mature of the series. As the book series continues, as well as the movies, it gets darker and the same goes for this film. There are also many themes about how everyone has their own dark side and how you can fight your own dark side. Though it is the most adult of the series, the kids can see it and enjoy it too. If you expect a big action packed film, with many special effects, you might be bored with this movie because it concentrates most on the characters and the story.<br/><br/>The action and the special effects are amazing. They introduce Hagrid's half-brother giant named Grawp. There is also an introduction to Thestrals, which are these skeletal horses with wings. The action is not much until the climax of the story at the Department of Mysteries, so if you expect a big action packed, special effects film, as they showed in the trailers, you will be disappointed. Nonetheless, the climax is very thrilling with all of the wizardry battles and it gave a ""Star Wars"" type feel.<br/><br/>Overall if you are a fan of the series, you should like it. However, as this reviewer has mentioned earlier, if you are a die hard Harry Potter freak who wants everything in the book and complains when something is different you will not like this. There is very little this reviewer does not like about this movie besides the absence of Quidditch. Go see it because this reviewer is sure you will enjoy it. This reviewer hopes that David Yates will continue his magic on the next installment, ""Half Blood Prince."" One big warning: if you want to get into Harry Potter, do not start with this film. The story does rely on your knowledge of the previous installments and does not work as a stand-alone film like the others."
"jnifere","6","1","3","13 July 2007"," Revise and Resubmit as any teacher would make one do..
","I can proudly say I'm a die-hard Harry Potter fan, AND I have to agree with the overall lukewarm review! The movie kind of blew!! BRING BACK CHRIS COLUMBUS AS DIRECTOR, and make sure JKR oversees her precious storyline! I have read all of the books many times and own every movie and PS2 game out right now... The Order of the Phoenix movie was horribly disappointing: 1) Where was Rita Skeeter the reporter? She will have an important role later 2) Where was the development of Kreacher and/or Mad-Eye Moody stealing artifacts from the Black's house. Harry didn't even come across A LOCKET TOO HEAVY TO PICK UP. Does JKR not remember the whole Horcrux thing when overseeing a movie? Horcruxes are HUGE later...<br/><br/>3) Where were Ron's lines? He mostly just stood there.. They could of had a field day for comedy when they were flying to London on the creatures he couldn't even see...<br/><br/>4) Who directed (well sadly we know) Hermione to huff-n-puff? Give that girl an inhaler for her lines... OR BRING BACK CHRIS COLUMBUS!! 5) Where were all of the rooms in the Ministry of Magic, esp the fight scenes? Ample selection for great action in a movie, totally blown over and fluffed by! 6) Where was Snape's part? I think the title character of book 6 and a HUGE PIVOTAL character should be involved in the movie more. Plus he is a Death Eater/OOTP member double agent... COME ON, that was an easy one! 7) In honor of the seventh book... What about the full prophecy elluding to the two possibilities.. Neville & Harry (son born at the end of july to parents thrice defying voldemort yadda yadda yadda) What about Neville's parents? TWO LINES?? WHAT?? They go to the insane asylum with his grandmother in the book! NEVILLE IS A PIVOTAL CHARACTER AS WELL!!! I have a heavy-heart to say this movie was so-so, but it was.. In the spirit of Hogwarts and School, We the public need to write REVISE AND RESUBMIT as a teacher definitely would if this were handed in... JKR use your power, Recall this movie and help them fix it! It is afterall your story...<br/><br/>ONE MORE TIME FOR GOOD MEASURE: BRING BACK CHRIS COLUMBUS AS DIRECTOR!!!"
"stiva","6","1","3","13 July 2007"," An interesting movie so as to speak...
","I saw this movie on 12th. I would say this is the third best Harry Potter movie. The special effects are really awesome. So is the music. This movie much darker like the third one. If compared with the book, honestly, this movie is total crap.<br/><br/>Dumbledore character sucked as usual. I didn't find final battle between Dumbledore and Tom as intense and interesting as I found it in the book. I mean, in the book I could visualize the entire battle and compared to that this was nothing. They added a lot of unwanted additional scenes. The script is like the movie is running very fast to reach the end as if the end of the world is nearing. A better choice could have made for Luna Lovegood character. I mean, her character is supposed to be weired and dizzy and carefree. But, Evana Lynch didn' portray these things. Also, her voice was childish. Someone at Emma Watson's age might have been a better choice. <br/><br/>Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) was awesome as usual. And, so is Alan Rickman (Snape). The new addition Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) was awesome and freaking scary and Imelda Staunton (Dolores Umbridge) was good too. Even Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasly) was good.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed. I expected a better movie. I thought at least the last three movies might be 220 minutes like Lord Of The Rings Series. They modified the entire content of the movie and made it totally different from the book. I don't want to divulge any part of the movie here because some people might prefer movies rather than books. But, I prefer books. <br/><br/>But it's worth watching for fun and special effects. Just don't expect it to be like the book nor very close to the book and watch. Watch it to enjoy and have fun. It's a 2-hr movie.<br/><br/>Out of 10, I would give it a 6.2<br/><br/>My order of movie rating in HP Series:-<br/><br/>1. Sorcerer's Stone - 8/10 <br/><br/>2. Chamber Of Secrets - 7.8/10 <br/><br/>3. Goblet Of Fire - 7/10 <br/><br/>4. Prisoner Of Azkaban - 6.5/10<br/><br/>5. Order Of Phoenix - 6.2/10"
"Rainy-3","7","1","3","12 July 2007"," Incomplete Story
","I loved the acting and directing in this film, and I thought that the effects were quite good, but the story was lacking, and the tone was too persistently dark.<br/><br/>As far as the story, it just felt like a jumble of events without a solid story line. I have grown accustomed to the Harry Potter films having much of the story cut out, it is to be expected if you want a movie to come in at under 4 hours, but this was extreme. The title of the movie is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, but the Order does not play more than a VERY minor, passing role that may as well have been completely omitted from the movie all together. There are several things that make this movie hard to follow as a story in itself, rather than just a bridge between movies.<br/><br/>As far as the mood of the movie, I understand that this was the darkest book to date, but the movie cut out all of the joy and levity present in the book. The entire book was not just a dark brood-fest, and that made the book palatable. The drudgery just got old after a while.<br/><br/>It is often said that the movies are supposed to be taken on their own merits, ignoring the quality of the books or the previous movies. Doing that with this movie only makes the movie worse, because out of the context of the books and other movies this film was complete gibberish. As a part of a series the movie was entertaining, but it really needed to add about 45 more minutes of story in order to stand on its own."
"drbone007","8","1","3","12 July 2007"," Second best of the series, but didn't feel the magic (A very long and somewhat of a ramblingly detailed review)
","I, unlike some of you out there, came into Harry Potter rather late. The first movie I saw was the second one and after that I became obsessive and hurried up and read all four books before the fifth one came out that summer. Upon reading that book, I felt exactly how I did after reading Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers-aka that the book was a gigantic (800+ page) mark time. The book itself, although entertaining and enjoyable, really doesn't do much for the series. In all fairness you can Siriusly (pun incredibly intended) boil down the book to the following points: <br/><br/>1) Neither may live while the other survives (Which is almost cryptic enough to be skipped all together...not to mention the fact that according to Rowling, and I'm paraphrasing, Prophesies are both accurate and dangerous because they are almost always misinterpreted. So really it has no bearing at all except to confirm the fact that Voldy and Harry will have a showdown in Book 7. <br/><br/>2) Sirius dies...yea...enough said.<br/><br/>Really that is all I can think of that is WHOLLY necessary. Things that aren't so much VITAL to the main plot are:<br/><br/>1) Weasley's shop 2) Umbridge in all her tyrannical glory (Spectacular job by her in the film by the way) 3) The Neville/Harry connection (Left out of the movie...so sad) 4) Bellatrix Lestrange (Spectacular job by Helena) 5) Possible R.A.B. thinger...which since left out-and since Rowling knew it was-might mean that it's not who we believe to be the front-runner???<br/><br/>Anyway...on to the movie adaptation.<br/><br/>Book plot to film plot adaptation:<br/><br/>I thought it was quite good and defiantly better than the hacked up and rushed GoF (Save the Voldy stuff, which was exactly how I pictured it). I felt the cuts they made were adequate...even though they left out my favorite scene of Molly Weasley's Boggart turning into her dead family (very cinematically written IMO). I mean what they were working with was a rambling narrative (which I love...believe me...it's how I write too as you can plainly see) that simply had more side-stories than it knew what to do with. No movie will ever be exactly like the book. This is why individual reading and using your own imagination will always be superior to anyone else's vision set on screen. (Sorry English teacher back-to-school special rant) <br/><br/>Acting:<br/><br/>Lets see...I'm not good with numbers but I'm going to try. OoTP 1,000,000 X better than SS OoTP 100,000 X better than CoS OoTP = PoA OoTP 10,000,000 X better than GoF (Mostly for the lack of Brendan Gleason hamming up Moody and Crouch's...lip licking...::shudder::) <br/><br/>Stand out performances go to Umbridge, Bellatrix (Even only being in 3 scenes), Harry, Luna, Snape (per always) and Dumbledore (Never thought I'd say that considering I thought he was totally unfit for the role in the last two)<br/><br/>Also...holy crap there are other people at Hogwarts! The last movie I felt that only Harry and Moody existed to have lines. It was nice to see everyone again...even if it was only a few scene. <br/><br/>Music:<br/><br/>Much better than GoF (no excess drum beats and cliché Irish music in this one). <br/><br/>Special Effects:<br/><br/>BLAH! Sort of the only thing that took me out of the movie. Grawp was kinda childish looking and didn't look to good. Dementors were entirely better in PoA. Centaurs were entirely better in SS. Patronis charms were better in PoA too. Only saving grace were the Threstles (Not looking up the spelling) which were spectacular.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>OK, so if I liked to movie so much, save the FX, why only an 8 out of 10? Well...it wasn't as magical as the last few have been. Yes there was magic performed, but I just didn't feel it like I did in PoA. This could, however, be the fault of the source material. The book itself is doesn't hold nearly as many magical moments as the previous ones. I do think it is also the fault of a weaker director and a not so great cinematographer. I mean when I saw PoA, although it slashed the book a lot and cut some very important stuff, the movie is gorgeous and very entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>Although the film and book are both huge mark times to the next two installments and lack the magic of the last four, both mediums are still very enjoyable to watch and read."
"BrokenDreams24","3","1","3","12 July 2007"," Worst of the Potter Movies
","I don't want to say too much about this movie, I already wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this, but for me as a viewer who hasn't read the book, nothing made sense in this flick.........there wasn't any continuity. They started a storyline and than just dropped it, no explanation why this and that happened, nothing nada zilch. <br/><br/>The so called action scenes were boring. The whole time sitting there I thought, there is going to happen something else this can't be everything just wait, even as the credits rolled, but nope it never came. <br/><br/>Now I will go and buy the book, maybe then I will get the answers I was waiting for in the movie.<br/><br/>I'm only giving this 3 stars because the actors were good."
"ic3cub3","9","1","3","12 July 2007"," A good movie (though not entirely a book to movie adaptation)
","Being a fond reader (and not a ultra-loyalist) of the book, I felt that this movie gave its essence and kudos to the whole team for giving us that.<br/><br/>The acting was very good (with the exception of Cho - who picked her anyways???). Some didn't even had much to say but their presence were really felt (Lupin, Lucius, Moody, Trelawney). I really missed Richard Harris as Dumbledore, but Gambon's portrayal grows on you with every movie. Bravo! The plot was effective enough for the movie's length. The climactic battle was awesome. I know the feeling should slowly die down till the end of the movie, but I felt that it plunged out. It was forgivable that some of the events were taken away, but I strongly believe that they should have: - Included the mirror which was Sirius' gift to Harry. Along with including a few minutes wherein Harry was desperately trying to contact Sirius, and that he saw the mirror when he was packing for home (giving that heart stabbing feeling the book gave me).<br/><br/><ul><li>Sticked to the book that Harry heard the prophesy after it shattered, and Dumbledore establishing that Trelawney was the one who did the prediction. Giving more importance to Emma Thompson's character(not make her look like just a goofy/no use teacher) and justifying Dumbledore's protection of her in one of the scenes in the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>I didn't mind that the left out the hospital, quiddich (haven't they had enough of this in the first 3 films?), and other events in the book. The changes as I've said were acceptable, but including the above mentioned events would have gave the movie a better ending."
"b_o_h_a","7","1","3","12 July 2007"," Great movie, poor book adaptation
","I think this movie was probably the best of the series yet. The acting was superb. The portrayals of Bellatrix Lestrange and Luna Lovegood were closer to perfect than anyone could sanely hope for. The special effects were riveting. The thestrals looked awesome, and Kreacher was sufficiently creepy. Yet sadly this movie also went farther from the book than any of its predecessors. Being the longest, most complex book I watched fully prepared for the removal of sub-plots and many scenes, but even so I was shocked and disappointed by many of the changes. 1. NO DOBBY. That makes two movies in a row where Dobby the house-elf has been written off. 2. NO FIRENZE. It was the Firenze's appointment as divination teacher that angered the centaur's. 3. NO SAINT MUNGO'S. They didn't even go to the hospital, which is where they meet Neville's parents and get to see Lockheart again. 4. NO PREFECTS. Ron and Hermione are made prefects this year and it would have been as simple as letting them be seen with badges on their uniforms to indicate this. 5. NO PEEVES! This is the movie in which Peeves plays his biggest role yet we don't even see him in a background shot. 6. NO QUIDDITCH! Not once does anyone even say the word quidditch. Even though this is the first year Ron gets on the team. Aside from these big omissions they also seem to cut short the Weasley twins grand exit, they cut the speech which is the best part, which is one of the things I was most looking forward to. They heavily downplayed the rivalry between McGonagall and Umbridge. And the had the students using spells they aren't even supposed to know until next year. Levi-Corpus was used multiple times and Harry learns that spell from the Half-Blood Prince. Not once did we get to see Sirius's mum or Buckbeak. So though it was a stupendous movie on its own, avid fans of the book will have to try hard not to be disappointed."
"jacobs768","8","1","3","12 July 2007"," Great movie, slightly disappointed
","I love how the film was made, the effects were brilliant but I was greatly annoyed to find how much had been cut. Some of my favourite scenes in the Ministry Of Magic were completely cut. These include when Nevilles' nose is broken, when Hermione is hit with the unknown curse and many other scenes. None were included. I found this to be greatly disappointing in terms of keeping to the book but I guess the movies have never done THAT much justice to the book anyway. I was expecting this to be the better of the 4 so far, in effect and humour ways it was. <br/><br/>Otherwise it was greatly amusing, and worth seeing."
"Brittany0328","8","1","3","12 July 2007"," Good Movie...But Not as good as book
","First off let me say that I love HP and I was hoping the movie would be like the book.<br/><br/>Not at all, I mean it got some good parts but in other parts it just completely left me blank. Like how would Harry go to tell Dumbledore about Mr.Weasley and then end back up at Grimwuald Place? it skipped a whole lot. But, Umbridge is the best character for this movie the expressions on her face were amazing!! I was wondering when is the qudditch coming or when are Hermione and Ron going to become prefects. And the ministry scene was way too short. It almost felt like we were going fast forward throughout the movie. But, it could have been worse and its not like that the movie was terrible i just expected better."
"AOrfanides","8","1","3","12 July 2007"," My least favorite of all the movies so far... but still good
","Well, as a certified Harry Potter (adult) addict, I must say that although this is technically a great movie, it does leave the die-hard book fans wanting more. While visually, this movie is stunning, and at the end of the 2 hours, you understand the basic plot, there were so many important plot lines left out. With an additional 1/2 hour of time, all plots could have been marvelously developed, and the watchers could have been brought into Harry's world with so much more understanding. Daniel's anguish was not portrayed at the opening. His loneliness, desperation, and isolation do not come through to the audience. Who are the Order of the Phoenix? Why are they there? What type of family was the House of Black? None of this was portrayed. Also, where was the mirror given to Harry by Sirius? Without it, how can viewers understand the mystery and guild Harry feels with Sirius's death? How can they understand that if he had only used the mirror, Sirius may have remained alive? All in all though, for non-insane book readers (unlike myself), who don't look for deeper meanings and connections, it is still a wonderful, although dark, story which leaves you with the basic understanding of the dark times to come. I'm still looking forward to all the rest of the movies, and hope that with a little extra play-time, which all Harry Potter fans are more than willing to sit through (as long as there's lots of popcorn), movie audiences can hopefully be brought into the extremely important next few movies with a deeper understanding of what J.K. writes about."
"melking1972","6","1","3","12 July 2007"," Not what I hoped
","Order of the Phoenix is the longest Harry Potter book thus far. So it's no surprise that they would have to cut a bit out of it to fit everything into a 2 hour 18 minute movie. However, while the part of me that was happy that this movie was only just over 2 hours because I was seeing it at midnight, the part of me that wanted the movie to be a little more true to the book was disappointed. The director and screenwriter consolidated quite a bit of material and left a couple of subplots out. I wasn't all that disappointed that we didn't get to see Herminone's efforts to knit scarfs and hats for the house elves, though I do remember on my recent rereading of the book that it would be fun to watch her magically knit a scarf. But some of the things that I felt were integral to the plot and feel of the book, were included but quickly, so as not to take up too much screen time.<br/><br/>I didn't really get a feel for how angry Harry was that no one talked to him all summer or that Dumbledore pretty much ignored him during the school year. When Harry finds out about Snape's past and his interactions with Harry's dad, you never really get a feel for how awful Harry's father was to Snape, how that colors all of Snape's dealings with Harry, nor do you see the outcome of how conflicted Harry is because of this new information about his father - who up until now, he's pretty much placed on a pedestal. These new revelations also inform Harry more about Sirius's past and other than seeing how much Harry loves and depends upon his godfather, we don't really see his character developed more (which is a shame since he dies at the end of the movie).<br/><br/>Some of the less important plot developments, but things I would have loved to see more of include the relationship Cho and Harry and Cho's conflicted feelings about liking Harry; Neville and his parents and how they are currently confided to the hospital because they've been driven crazy; the twins, George and Fred, efforts to thwart Umbridge; and how important the O.W.L.'s are to the students and the toll studying for them took.<br/><br/>Finally, I was disappointed in the final battle scenes. We didn't see anywhere enough of the Ministry of Secrets and what it took for the children to get to the room with the prophecies. When the children are fighting the Death Eaters, no one gets seriously hurt (quite a difference from the book) and it is all just flashing wands rather than a real battle. Finally, the fight scene between Dumbledore and Voldemort is so much more exciting and cool in the book. I was really looking forward to seeing the statues come alive and protect Harry.<br/><br/>Overall, I wanted to really like this movie. I thought the Goblet of Fire was a great movie and stayed true enough to the book. But as a fan of the books, I was let down. I also have a sneaking suspicion that maybe the movie skimmed over so much that it might be confusing to a viewer who hasn't read the book. Of course, I can't know this for myself, because I've read the book (and in anticipation of the movie and the final book, I reread them quite recently)."
"dajesmac","7","1","3","12 July 2007"," I Completely Agree
","The movie was fine, and great in the battle in the ministry. But it was hollow, and didn't really suck me into it. I often found myself thinking about other things in the movie rather than being glued to the screen. I completely agree about Michael Gambon as Dumbledore as being too alert and angry rather than the crooked nose old man with a soft voice and twinkly eyes like the previous actor in the Philosipher's stone and the Chamber of Secrets. in which he captured it brilliantly. Also I didn't expect Sirius' death to be so brutal, it was really quick but it was brutal, I can't believe I didn't expect it to be brutal! I guess it's always more relaxed while you're reading the book, damn that J.K Rowling is good. It's as if (referring to the writer of the first comment) you read my mind."
"unicorn_p3","9","1","3","12 July 2007"," Good movie...but missed some key points I think
","OK. This may contain spoilers so if you have not read the book or seen the movie, stop reading.<br/><br/>I saw the movie yesterday and while it was a good movie I have to say that I feel a bit jipped and disappointed. It seemed like it went too fast. It did closely follow the book, there were a few scenes or things that happened that was not in the book, like the entire DA in dentetion with Umbridge.<br/><br/>It seemed that it moved really fast jumping from scene to scenes. From the beginning scene at the park, which was not at night. No Harry under the window listening to the news. I was hoping that there would have been at least one scene in St. Mungos, so we could have seen what it looked like. I think that there should have been mention of Bode and the devils snare, that was a good point to add to the movie. I think they should have at least mentioned that Ron and Hermione had made prefect. The seen in the Astronomy tower where Mcgonagal gets hit with the Stupefy curse would have been a great scene to include. But that was left out as well.<br/><br/>There were many areas left out. They seems to take up air time showing scenery and all the daily prophets, that could have been used for something else. I think the Weasly's exit form the school, did not give them justice that was due, don't get me wrong it was great, but I think it would have been better if they had done it like in the book, while Harry was trying to contact Sirius.<br/><br/>All in all it was a good movie, but I have to say I am kinda of worried to see what they leave out of the HP and HBP. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and will continue seeing the movies and reading the books and I still think that all the movies are good, I just felt a little let down.<br/><br/>I will say that I wish Evvanna (Spelling) had more screen time, she was amazing and exactly how I pictured her in the book. Tonks was good, but she need more screen time as well. Lestrange was great but the scene at the ministry was a bit short. I wished they would have put the circular rooms with all the doors in there and Ron getting attacked by those brains. If they could have made this scene at the ministry longer adding in more of the what the book at, it would have been awesome. With that being said, the scene between Voldemort and Dumble door was awesome, that was the best action I have seen in a HP movie."
"CaliGurl141B1","9","1","3","12 July 2007"," Great effects, characters, and events! But...
","Okay, So all and all I have to say that wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I probably ruined it for myself by reading the book only a couple weeks ago, but still. I did enjoy the movie the effects were awesome and the storyline was great. But I guess my problem is because it was the longest book in the series and it was made into the shortest movie of the series that they sort of lost some of the pieces that would have made is an even better film. However, I don't speak for anyone but myself therefore I recommend you go and see the movie for yourself and tell us what you think of it.<br/><br/>The reason I gave it a seven was because I thoroughly enjoy movies, but for some reason that just didn't meet my standards for an excellent movie. As for the stars I do think considering how much work they put into a movie they did an excellent job."
"petsteph1","9","1","3","11 July 2007"," If Only They Would Fit the Movies to the Books...
","A very enjoyable movie and a great addition to the series - but I left the cinema wishing that they would fit the movies to the books rather than the other way around. My kids and I know going in that there will be large holes where sections of the novel couldn't be included due to time constraints, and we're resigned to this fact, however there is always a disappointment when some scenes don't appear on the screen. At least half of the disappointment is due to the excellent job the various directors and producers have done with casting the characters of the series so far; you tend to expect to see everything rendered in cinematic images to match or enhance the pictures you formed when reading the book. For example, there are frequent comments comparing Richard Harris to Michael Gambon. Michael Gambon suffers the fate of coming second in place - after most of us saw Richard Harris in the first film and thought 'Ah! Yes - THAT's Dumbledore!' The cinematic image matched the one in our minds. Now Michael Gambon - doing an excellent job in his own right - yet doesn't look like the image we agreed on... Therefore when some scene is not dramatized, or some moment is left out there's this vacuum of missing images and I guess the only way around that would be to make two movies, for example, of this book (which certainly deserves two movies). In a way it's a pity HBO didn't pick up the rights since they may have done a more complete treatment of the stories. When I compare these films with their many fascinating characters and story lines jammed into a couple of hours with other recent 'blockbuster' movies that surely were cookie-cut out of plastic, I can't help feeling cheated. <br/><br/>All that aside, it's a fine movie and a lot of fun, even when the fun is quite dark. Harry is pretty intense these days, and Daniel Radcliffe does it well. Hermione and Ron don't really get a lot of screen time which is too bad since these actors have remained so consistent over the years that you could really believe they spend the time between movies in costume. Imelda Staunton does Dolores Umbridge to perfection, including a small squeak before she speaks that does more to signal the character's cheerfully evil nature than anything else.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling has done us all a great service with these stories and added some wonderful people to our universes; the directors and actors of the series have done a fine job of bringing them to the screen and my only regret is that 138 minutes is too short a time to be able to visit with all of them."
"blackburn_e-2","9","1","3","11 July 2007"," Not the best Harry Potter film, unfortunately
","As a huge Harry Potter fan I diligently went to the midnight release of the film and after which I felt compelled to voice my opinion on it:<br/><br/>The acting was amazing as always, including the new members of the cast (Luna and Tonks you rock! Bellatrix and Umbridge were both deliciously evil and crazy), the story: written by a Goddess, the costumes: wonderful, the special effects: magical (literally), the sets were great (although I didn't think it was necessary to change the location and appearance of some already established places but whatever I'll go with it). However, the big problem with this film and the only reason it is only getting 9 stars instead of 10 is because of the plot itself. I firmly believe that a book and a movie are two totally different media and that even ones about the same material should not be compared and my complaint has nothing to do with that part of it. I don't know whose fault it was, the new screenwriter's or the new director's or the editor's (I don't know if he is new) or someone else's but the biggest problem with this film is that it was so choppy that a person like myself, one who usually finds it very easy to empathize with the characters on screen and who knows the story well, found it hard to keep up and fully enjoy the experience. I believe that if you have not read this book you will not enjoy the film and will have difficult time following the events that are thrown at you in this 2 hour plus film. This story was the biggest book, so it would have been forgivable if this was also the longest film (3 hrs even) but the people in charge tried to cram this loaded story into roughly 2 hours and in the process lost the real conviction that the audience normally feels when watching Harry's struggles. This is a true shame for this, of all the films, should be the one were people sympathize and worry about Harry but the lack of flow directs all of the viewers attentions to keeping up with the story and doesn't allow you any time to chew over the situation Harry and friends are headed for. And then before you know it, you take a breath and the film is over. Being the loyal and avid Harry Potter fan that I am (and out of respect for the actors and the crew who made the film; who, let me repeat, were awesome!) I will probably go see the film again and buy it when it comes out. I will simply have to grit my teeth and try to enjoy such a short and jerky ride.<br/><br/>P.S. I do sincerely hope that the director is not responsible for this chaotic tangle as he will be at the helm for the following film!"
"sampj","8","1","3","11 July 2007"," Order of the Phoenix delivers!!!!!
","I had a bad feeling about OOTP because of its length.2 1/2 hours just seemed too short.But stuff that feeling,this was a darn good movie.There might have been a lot cut out from the book but it was brilliantly adapted into a movie.Acting was fantastic,the best it has ever been,especially that of Imelda Staunton as Umbridge which was the standout.Special effects were again satisfactory as was the set design.A new thing about the movie is it didn't feel like a kids movie anymore.It was much darker and more violent.I still can't get over the fact that Harry,Hermionie and so on looked a lot older than in previous films.This could be a bit of a spoiler but the fight scene at the end of the movie is terrific so readers,look forward to the end.Overall an absolutely terrific piece of work and surpasses Pirates of the Caribbean 3 as my favourite movie of 2007."
"taratimbs","9","1","3","11 July 2007"," Leaving aside the book comparisons...
","Since I saw the midnight show last night, I have been reading a lot of things online concerning how much story was cut from the movie, or how the movie was good but could never compare to the book. As a devoted Harry Potter fan, I prefer to keep the movies and books as separate entities. The films are each respectively a director's interpretation of a book, and leaving aside Chris Colombus (whom I am not insulting whatsoever), each director chose to take certain liberties and focus on certain plot lines. I personally think that David Yates is a GENIUS filmmaker. I went into the movie NOT expecting a perfect replica of my beloved 900 pages. Instead I came in with an open mind and I left with a satisfying movie experience that left me talking about for hours. Between the often documentary-style camera work, the smart, plot outlining newspaper montages, the personal touch added to the CGI's of the dementors, Kreacher, Grawp, the centaurs AND VOLDEMORTS POSSESSION OF HARRY'S BODY (my personal fave visual effect) and the wonderfully elaborate set designs, I was more than pleased with this film. And, of course, the humor was spot on and the crowd at my theater must have found at least 20 triumphant moments that makes a HarryPotter fan need to shout out and cheer. And how much the young actors have really grown into themselves! THe filmmaker seemed to really have a grasp on a relationship such as Ron and Hermione's, and filled nearly every moment with the wonderful awkwardness ever present between them. Plus, our new Umbridge and Luna were forces to be reckoned with, both with strong grasps on their characters. Their performances also reminded me that each and every JKR reader does not imagine any character the same, and therefore each actor will be putting on display their very own interpretations. Only disappointments: the concluding parts at the Ministry seemed rushed, and I wish there was more Tonks, she was really just a visual addition rather than a character. Of course I was sad to leave behind ""Weasley is our King"", Luna's lion hat, the St. Mungo's visit, etc...but Yates was more than sufficient in making up for the absences of our favorite side stories."
"mrforgetful","8","1","3","11 July 2007"," Quite possibly the best of the series
","It's quite amazing to see the direction the Harry Potter franchise has come since the cheery, yet unyieldingly faithful Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. Although liberties have been taken with the text, with things shifted around or deleted altogether (with the source material over 900 pages, I hardly think anyone's complaining), the latest installment of the Harry Potter series offers some of the most entrancing moments of the year.<br/><br/>In Order of the Phoenix, Harry's world becomes decidedly more violent and vulnerable. Nothing seems as secure as it did before. This is a sign of two things: a changing world, and all the joys of growing up. Both are developed very well. In fact, I'd go as far as saying Harry enjoyed more character development in this movie than in at least two of the other movies combined. We also get to see brief glimpses of development in other characters including Ginny Weasley, Sirius Black, and Professor Snape.<br/><br/>It's hard to come by such an outstanding cast as what was mustered for this movie. Not only are all the veterans showing their mettle, but the newly christened actors of tomorrow are keeping up with them. The three child leads, though not so child anymore, are expectedly improving with age, but I think the improvement was most evident in this movie. New additions to the cast were all wisely made, especially Imelda Staunton as Professor Umbridge, who stole scenes as the school's new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.<br/><br/>Wise decisions were made all around, but as always there are little things missing here and there that could have made the movie even greater. One of my favorite things about the movie, however, is how it keeps referring to the previous movies. With all the movies differing from each other so much, it was nice to see the filmmakers taking some initiative and trying to wrap them together to make the story feel a little less uneven and bring some continuity to the franchise.<br/><br/>Hardcore fans of the book will probably be disappointed, but I think, with a few changes, this is about the best you could hope for. Any faults are no means on the actors or production crew, who all do an outstanding job, but on those whose decision it lies to make these movies continuously shorter than the previous one."
"XxLaurennDLxX","Null","1","3","11 July 2007"," Thought it was GREAT, but got Disappointed!
","OK, I thought Order of the Phoenix was really really great, but I was disappointed a bit. I mean they cut so much out of the movie and the beginning was all foggy. Luckily I had read the book twice already, so I understood everything fine. The whole Cho telling Umbridge thing was totally bogus and I hated that part. The way Harry reacted to Sirius dieing was a bit different then the book, but at first it happened just the right way. But at the Department of Mysteries it was pretty much just Neville and Harry because Ginny sprained her ankle, Hermione was like knocked unconscious, and Ron had those brain things all over him...what happened to Luna in the book, I forget. But honestly, I really really liked that movie!"
"aimforthehead","8","1","3","11 July 2007"," Very Disappointed But Worth Seeing *Spoilers*
","As both a fan of the book and the movies I was very disappointed by the film. It did not do the book justice. Though OoTP was a long book more of the lighter, funnier and better story lines could of been included in the film without making it run too long. Many details were changed such as Sirus calling Harry James, Cho was the one who ratted out DA, Luna and Harry meeting in the woods to discuss Thestrals, Harry drawing his wand in front of Dudley's friends and so on. Professor Trewlany who is a delight has minimal screen time which was disappointing . But what was more disappointing was the fact Sirius was barely in the film and that Luna had barely any screen time. Besides the Weasly twins Luna made the book more interesting. By cutting down the Luna story line this made the film very tense. Im am non plussed at this point. I thought the first 2 films stayed very true to the book and had that pardon the pun the magic that makes a movie great. I loved the fact the third and forth films were darker but certain details were changed or omitted much like this the fifth film. The acting from Radcliffe was different as if he no longer had to try and the acting flowed from him which made him more natural in this film. I was a little disappointed in the casting of Luna Lovegood but then the actress had such little screen time the made her seem meek. I was also disappointed because we did not see as much of the trio as in the previous films. Hermoine and Ron are important to the plot and they had been in more scenes the film would of been better. I have never really cared for the new Dumbledore this actor makes Dumbledore seem tense,uncaring and harsh at times. It was a good film but if you loved the book as much as I did don't expect to love this movie."
"adambuckeye","8","1","3","11 July 2007"," Couldn't have been any better...
","One of the best films of the series. I myself am a big fan of the books as well, and I think they did an excellent job of telling the story even with the cuts that had to be made. If you go in obsessing over the bits and pieces that they missed, you probably won't enjoy the movie. I thought the acting in this one was also a big improvement over the past installments. Everyone did a great job. Once again, awesome movie!!! My fiancé was with me when we watched the movie, and he loved it as well and he isn't even a fan of the books. There was a lot smoother connection between this movie and the one prior than in the past. I can't wait to see the next one."

Spectacularly done. -The Weasley's running out with a shower of fireworks: also spectacular -awesome emotion and feeling -the battle between the children and the death eaters: superb cinema<br/><br/>I don't have too many qualms. Just a few, as listed above. Any Harry Potter fan, big or small, will be just as enchanted by this movie."
"monstermayhem32","8","1","3","11 July 2007"," disappointing but it has it's moments
","The fifth chapter in the Harry Potter books and film Order of the Phoenix was the weakest of the five films to date for many reasons: the book version was too long and dragged in certain parts, the movie version felt too short and too many gaps that left a lot of unanswered questions. First, I will start off by saying what I didn't like about the film: returning cast members Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths, Brendon Glesson, and Julie Walters were completely underused. Other things I didn't like was some of the unanswered question like Percy alienating himself from his parents due to his beliefs of Fudge and the Ministry, Very little between the Harry and Cho relationship even though Daniel Radcliffe and Katie Leung are great kissers. Vernon's resentment of Harry was not shown, Petunia' feelings towards Harry and her sister were not mentioned. Trewlaney 's prediction of the Prophecy was not shown, Ron's qudditch scenes were cut, no mention of Ron and Hermione being prefects in the film. Fred and George's frustration of Hogwarts was not show even though their escape was seen.No mention of Dora Tonks being a shape shifter was ever mentioned or the duel between SIrus and Bellatrix. The best parts of the film were Imelda's Staunton's performance as the wicked Dolores Jane Umbridge and getting the feeling of her office with the pink Lace and curtains and even the cats were well done. Another good thing about the film was Helena Bonaham Carter's performance as the insane Bellatrix Lestrange cousin of Sirus Black even though she was underused. Gary Oldman was given more on screen time after barely being scene in the Goblet of Fire and bonded really well with Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have really matured as actors and work well together. Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom was given an expanded role and has really shined well, turning from a comedic relief character to a brave wizard. The Order of the Phoenix could have been a much longer film with more character development. Definitely a much darker film."
"rapiscrap698","9","1","3","11 July 2007"," Very Good Movie.
","Harry potter and the Order of the Phoenix is awesome. The only objection I had was the length of the movie. The first few movies contained more of the original details from the book. This was because they were based on books that were much shorter. I believe that they should have made it three hours long because too much info is left out from an 800 plus page book. The movie itself was great, awesome fighting scenes and spectacular visuals. It all went together really well. I believe this is the first time they show full grown wizards going at war with each other. Showing the full potential of what a mature wizard can do in battle with his wand. It seems that the acting is getting better as well. As the years progress and Harry gets older there's much more talent on screen which also makes it more convincing. There are a few new magical creatures introduced as well as some new concepts that were pretty neat.<br/><br/>If you are debating on seeing it I highly recommend."
"storkamoopid","8","1","3","11 July 2007"," easily the best Potter film yet.
","I have come to despise the Potter films. They were mediocre up until Goblet of Fire, at which point I realized just how awful they were in comparison to the brilliant books.<br/><br/>Needless to say, there were changes.. Aren't there always? But there weren't any incredibly significant changes. The one scene I missed was the scene at St. Mungo's with Neville's parents. That scene was one of my favorites in the book, simply because it was so moving and showed us so much about Neville. The scene at the Ministry seemed rushed, and Sirius' death did not do nearly what it could have. Sirius, being among many people's favorite characters, should have made about half of the sold-out theater cry. But his death was rushed.<br/><br/>At the same time.. other parts were brilliant. I was terrified that Evanna Lynch wouldn't do Luna justice, but she was brilliant. While she didn't get enough screen time, she nailed the character. And Umbridge.. she stole every scene she was in. She was absolutely perfect for the role. The film had many good laughs, and there were at least 3 or 4 moments of triumph at which point the whole theater burst into applause and shouts. All of the actors were strong, and it was quite true to the book.<br/><br/>It's rather funny. Order of the Phoenix is easily my least favorite of the books, as I've read it only 9 times. But its most definitely the best film to date.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"xlivestrong32","8","1","3","11 July 2007"," The film's alright!
","I saw this movie at midnight because I'm a big fan of the books. The fifth installment is also my favourite book from the whole series, by far. This gave me very high expectations for the film, and they were met to a certain extent.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure how this movie came to be shorter than Goblet of Fire, when this book was much longer. Due to the compression of the film, some details that could have helped people understand the film were skipped. However, the details I noticed that were missing did not have a huge part in the plot.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the film has its plus sides. The special effects were amazing and the actors are finally getting into the Harry Potter mindset. There were two big angst parts that were not included in the film and could have helped Harry's character. One, over the summer, Ron and Hermione could not write to them, and when Harry met them finally at 12 Grimmauld Place, he exploded, in the book. But in the film, it was a short burst of anger, when in the book he yelled for over a page. In capital letters. Two, at the end of film, when Voldemort had just possessed Harry to mess around with him, Harry was, of course, scarred. So when Dumbledore had a sit-down with Harry, Harry, in the book, was yelling and ranting about how no-one could sympathise and relate to him, and he tore up Dumbledore's office out of rage. In the film, he calmly told Dumbledore that he didn't know what it felt like, and did not tear up the office.<br/><br/>I have heard complaints of Hagrid not getting much screen time. This is perfectly in canon with the book. Hagrid did not come back until very late in the book, until chapter 20, which is past half of the book.<br/><br/>I thought Umbridge was perfect, in her sweet, nasty demeanor, she got things to go her way. However, one bone to pick: Her ""Hem, hem,"" was a little off. But that's just being too picky.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was very good for its length. However, the main action did not come until Grawp and Hagrid came back. But this was true for the book as well."
"Bacio83","9","1","3","11 July 2007"," Best adaptation of an HP yet
","I thought Order of the Phoenix was the best adaption of any of the HP books as of yet. It's a big book to tackle, that's for sure. But the writers and director uses tricks such as quick flashbacks and cutaways to condense the book into a mere 2 hours and 20mins. If I wasn't so tired at 2:30am last night I would have wanted more. And still I'd love for a directors cut when the double discs come out at Christmas time. Was it a perfect movie? No, but as an avid reader it was a perfect adaption of one of my favorite books. Again add an hour to it please, it would have been much better. I can't fault OOP though, this was the best installment so far. The angst and darkness of Harry's situation was played perfectly.<br/><br/>Some things that bothered me and of course spoiler warning abound: The use of Ginny Weasley and her ""Strong powers."" I'm guessing the slight nudge to the 6th book was needed there, for those of who know nuff said. But please, it's well known that Hermione is one of the most remarkable witches of her generation, probably the best. To have Ginny generating immense power, and packing a huge punch while Hermione can barely produce a spark is insulting. Let's stop with the insinuations here and stick to the facts instead of Ship preferences.<br/><br/>That was my only gripe. Other than that this was a service to the fans of the books and nothing more. I'm sorry if those of you still didn't get it, then go out and read the series you may be clued in. But I'm guessing those who felt disjointed with HP were prolly feeling out of the loop. And rightly so, this was one of the first movies as of yet to be a totally fan-service."
"silvanmellome","8","1","3","11 July 2007"," To fast, but still great
","CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS:<br/><br/>I just went to a midnight showing last night of HP5. It was shorter that most of the movies, but as a book the longest in the series. It was a VERY fast over view of the book. Some of the changes were fine with me, like when Luna describes the Thestrals, instead of Hagrid describing them in class. It went a lot faster and you still learned the information that was needed. I loved the scene where Fred and George do the fire works and leave the school. Kinda missed the swamp though... The only thing that I was disappointed in was the death of Sirius. In the book, I was almost in tears at the end. The death scene itself was not to bad, but afterward when they are talking about Sirius (like when Harry discovers the two way mirror)I was all teary eyed. They really didn't talk much about him after he died in the movie, and I didn't get upset at all. If it was a half hour longer, I think it would have been excellent, but it is still my favorite movie in the series... so far...."
"absion","9","1","3","11 July 2007"," final combat scene
","With such an overwhelming number of comments, I would like to emphasize only one thing which I think really deserves special praise: the final combat scene within the ministry is stunningly remarkable. The absolutely breath-taking rhythm, the way how a real ""mêlée"" within the wizarding world might look was portrayed, the extent to which the art of magic performed could be action-packed, all of these are realized to an indeed unprecedented - if not its nearly fullest, well, with at least two sequels awaiting - degree, which altogether make the whole of it not only totally fascinating but truly believable, to the extent that all of them seem to happen in a rather short amount of time. A masterpiece beyond, or even replenishing imagination. Simply adore it."

","There will be thousands of comments on this movie so I will keep mine brief: Brilliantly done movie from start to finish. Series actors have moved from portraying the characters to being the characters. Stunningly beautiful photography. The soundtrack wonderfully complements and accents the mood and tone of the movie. The new characters are wonderful: Delores Umbridge the acerbic Ministry of Magic appointee; Luna Lovegood adds a quirky charm and purity to her scenes and the Weasley brothers keep things wonderfully interesting throughout, and there are many more who deserve mention as well. The villains are more villainous and the heroes are more heroic. It is an amazing, well-told story that leaves you, at least if you are any sort of fan, hungering for much, much more.<br/><br/>The local megaplex where I went for the opening night showing sold out 8 theaters, out of 21 possible screens.

"lilqtpi8913","8","1","3","11 July 2007"," Marvelous
","Firstly I would like to state I have read the entire series (of course excluding Deathly Hallows, which has as of yet not yet been released - 9 days!) several times, and reread Order of the Phoenix before seeing the movie. Secondly I want to say that the score is Phenomenal! Honestly go buy the CD it is well worth the buy. Way to be Hooper. It rival's William's original score and that says quite a lot.<br/><br/>Now at last - I give the movie a 8 out of 10 because I found myself delightfully pulled into the story line, which was regrettably far too fast paced for such a lenghtly novel turned movie (especially with OotP being the longest of the six published), the believable, though at times simply odd acting, and stellar set's. Honestly the Hall of Prophecy (which was done all on green screen and reminded me heavily of 300's AMAZING and highly realistic graphics) blew my mind. The Ministry of Magic was wonderful, Grimmauld Place was dark, dank, and disgusting enough to pass as the once abandoned House of Black. It is true, the trio, Dan, Rupert, and Emma (playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione) have gotten better in their chosen profession, but hold nothing against their senior actors like the always amazing Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Imelda Staunton, Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, Jason Issacs, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Mark Williams, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, and of course (my personal favorite) Ralph Fiennes. Though of course the newest cast member, Evanna Lynch by far steals the glory of the teenagers. Her acting is spot on Luna's character, the whispy and distant voice, odd presentation of herself, and her enthusiasm for life. Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix again steals the glory for the adult actors, even though she had very minimal speaking lines. I was truly afraid of her, she was terrifyingly excellent. Of course Imelda was right on her trail as the pink clad, and completely mad Umbridge, who I have to give mad props for because Umbridge was far scarier in the movie than I imagined her in the novel. As I stated earlier the movie was far too short to really give Harry's anger and loneliness true time to be fully expressed, and the actually movie to make since. Though the plot line was not skewed dramatically as seen in previous films there were times when I muttered ""That doesn't happen. Why's it in the movie? This makes no sense."" My greatest disappointment had to be the cut of Dobby from the movie and Hermione's SPEW endeavor, of course I understand why it was cut, but I still have liked to see her geek side for once which is never really addressed in the movies (excluding ST, because she was rather a goodie goodie in that one. She lost that character little by little in each film). Another thing I would have liked to see, partly because it was not very important, but something to think about - Hermione and Ron becoming Prefects. I loved that Harry had to be alone sometimes, and found company with Neville and Luna. Further more many of the scenes were downplayed - giving the movie a less dramatic feel that the book inspired. Harry's anger is mellow, and not nearly as fussy as it should be, more of a depressed state rather than furry, which I found annoying. The whole movie was rather mellow - even Fred and George's ""escape"" from Hogwarts. The Department of Mysteries is probably the one scenes with real UMPH that gets your heart pounding, the other being directly before it where Harry and Hermione take Umbridge into the forest, where we see Grawp in (sort of - would have liked to see more) action, and a crap load of irate Centaurs.<br/><br/>And yet with the flaws I enjoyed myself more throughly than I had in the previous three movies - yes three, I absolutely loved The Prisoner of Azkaban. Harry Potter enthusiasts - like myself - have to keep in mind sub plots have to be dropped to make the film a manageable length that will keep people interested and excited to see more.<br/><br/>Order of the Phoenix was marvelous. Not necessarily a must see, but definitely worth seeing."

They truly show they are capable of handling the emotional complexities of the characters, not just the main three but all of the others.<br/><br/>The time simply flew by and I could have easily sat for another hour or more. Gary Oldman as Sirius will be missed (of course Sirius is missed in the books as well).<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing this film at least twice more in the theater. While my favorite may remain Azkaban, this is a very close second. It was definitely worth seeing at the 1201 showing."
"joeysantos_29","9","1","3","11 July 2007"," This is the best of the Harry Potter films yet
","Part five of the enormously popular Harry Potter machine has kicked off today and it does not disappoint. If you've seen the other 4 films that is. But if you're somebody who likes watching event films, regardless of continuity, then this is the film for you as well.<br/><br/>The story, like the previous 4 films, captured the essence of the books. That's definitely saying a lot due to the volume of the actual book. Sure, the writers had to take some of the subplots out and even added a few of their own in the story, but all in all, it didn't take anything away from the Harry Potter nostalgia. I loved seeing Tonks, Kreacher, Grawp, the Thestrals, Luna Lovegood, Bellatrix Lestrange and of course, Dolores Umbridge for the first time. And even if I've read the books more than once, it's still fun to see the story unfold on the big screen.<br/><br/>In the acting department, the kids definitely have more than improved. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter has shown more depth to the character. Gone is the bright eyed Harry that we've seen and read in book one and in comes the dark, troubled, and distant Harry. It's definitely a taste of things to come in the eventual 7th and final film. Evanna Lynch aka Luna ""Looney"" Lovegood did a commendable performance as well. All I liked about Looney, Ms.Lynch got right through her weirdness, her blunt honesty, and her carefree nature. But the actor that took the show away without a doubt would be Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge. Ms.Staunton had Umbridge, who is by far my most hated character of all the Potter Universe, down pat. To say she aced this role is an understatement. I absolutely despised her. Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, although shown briefly, did a great job as well. The rest of the adults, true to form, showed their consistent acting prowess. Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort,  Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall and of course, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black did their parts like it was written for them almost 10 years ago when J.K.Rowling thought about the Harry Potter universe while waiting at the train station.<br/><br/>The effects, as expected from an event movie like this, is up to snuff. From the Thestrals which could be seen only by people who has encountered death, to Tonks' color changing hair, from Kreacher's mumbling to Grawp's grunting, from the basic wand flicking done by the students of Hogwarts up till the eventual Voldemort vs Dumbledore finale, whatever you thought of in your mind while reading the book, the effects wizards made it happen.  <br/><br/>Having said all of that, this is the best of the Harry Potter films yet. It's worth every minute. Just make sure to be patient with people who know nothing about the series and tell them that you'll explain everything after the flick. Nobody likes to hear chattering while watching a movie."
"nightbiker-1","9","1","3","11 July 2007"," Enjoyable experience. Definitely worth the view
","Just a risk of spoilage, but I'll try not to just the same. It is true that (as expected, if you're like me and have read the series (time and again)) they could not put the entire book into the movie (lets be honest, thats just not easy to do unless the story is very basic and simple -and while that was true for the first two books, it certainly got depth and complexity after that. However, unlike previous offerings, this one did manage to hang onto the spirit of, and cover, most of the subplots in the Order Of The Phoenix. I was a little disappointed with how they revealed (and captured the participants) the room of requirement and the DA inside, but it still managed to keep the feel and intent of the story. The subplots that lead up to the main thrust of the movie were very quickly covered (and I'm not sure that those who never read the story will understand what happened anyway -but this has been true over the last couple of movies -the movies are clearly for the fans of the story, not the general public who doesn't bother to read it). This new director did a very good job, and I look forward to adding this movie to my list when it hits the shelves. Lastly, the one true measure of the movie was proved out when the audience sat quietly through the movie, laughing from time to time in the right places, but applauding at the end of the show. The patrons OBVIOUSLY felt that their hard-earned money was well spent. What more could you possibly say than that?"
"Quinoa1984","8","2","10","15 July 2007"," one of the best Harry Potters yet!
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has a gripping main story involving the continuing peril for Harry and his arch nemesis, the dark lord Voldermort (Fiennes, as sinister as possible), but what surprised me a little was seeing that there's even a kind of political subtext to the story at Hogwarts. This is personified by the ministry's new professor-cum-control freak Umbridge (Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton), who teaches theory instead of practice, and is every ultra-harsh, practically laughable disciplinarian you've ever had the horror to have over your heads. Odd for some other ""kids"" movies (save for Happy Feet), but for the Harry Potter universe the foreboding presence of the ministry makes the feeling of the dread that Potter has to face that much more pronounced, as a feeling of helplessness spreads out amongst everyone in the society despite the message from the messenger that 'everything's fine'. Staunton is perfect in the role of Umbridge, and helps to make the character as part of the ranks of those played by Alan Rickman (?), Gary Oldman (not really), and Ralph Fiennes (for sure) as one of the most dastardly figures in the Potter universe. Though she may even be more chilling, even as a momentary figure, because of what she represents for those who need to practice magic first hand.<br/><br/>The sense of rebellion with the Hogwarts school is a solid facet for the Order of the Phoenix storyline, and except for a tiny sub-plot involving Harry and Cho Chang, and some of the visuals involved when the kids finally take over during a big exam (kind of like a super-magical version of the Another Brick in the Wall music video), it's a great balance for the much darker elements at work. There's another facet, aside from strong performances (Radcliffe, by the way, is really coming into his own more than ever), which is that David Yates- primarily a director of British television- imbues a lot of extraordinary imagery here. Mostly, because, he makes what could be another 'kids' movie, as the first two films were, and makes a gradual progression from the third and fourth installments into the realm of a sort of pop-surrealism; the image of Voldermort at the train station moving his neck around could be out of a stark painting, same for the ""mystery"" room that serves for the climax of the film. It's much more sophisticated than one might expect, albeit some typical flashbacks used in the realm of the conceit that Voldermort screws around with Potter's mind a lot, and it's certainly the first time since 'Azkaban' that the direction and the script are at levels of quality that one might not expect in a big summer blockbuster. There's nuance in this struggle of good vs evil, and it's worth seeing it in the theater if only on that level.<br/><br/>And as foreboding and cryptic and always with the ominous foreshadowing- unless you've read Half-Blood Prince (from which I've heard, as I haven't read any of the books, is even *darker* than any of the others combined, with even truly disturbing imagery)- as Phoenix can get, there's still a sense of it being a crowd-pleaser. I liked the scenes where Hagard shows Potter and the others his half-brother, a huge ogre that marks as the least essential character story-wise but is a lot of fun to watch, and the scenes with Potter and the others in their secret training rooms gives the movie a sense of purpose for the audience to follow along. In a strange way there is some hope in Order of the Phoenix, though one needs to find it, and not in the way that the one ""we don't mention"" would go about it."
"yellow_star63","8","2","10","10 July 2007"," As a fan of the Novels & previous movies I was not disappointed!
","Being that I read all of the books I was a little anxious about what aspects of the book would be kept and how well other things would translate into the film.<br/><br/>Over all this was a very entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable film! It is above all a film about the importance of friendship and family. The action sequences were spectacular! And the acting of the 3 main characters has greatly improved over the years. I think it may be the best sequel released in the Summer of 2007!<br/><br/>The screen writers & director out did them selves in this adaptation of the book. I was amazed at how they were able to fit all of the important aspects of the book into this 2 hour 18 min movie. Sure they moved around some of the events so that they took place in a different order than they did in the novel, but it made for a better flowing movie. Sure there were things left out of the movie that I would have enjoyed seeing on the big screen, but none of them were really that important to the main plot, so I understand why they had to be cut. I also felt that the few plot items that they changed fit the movie... I understand why they were made.<br/><br/>I did sometimes feel as though they were rushing through the information so fast that it was hard to follow and that there were a number of references made to things in the book that weren't fully fleshed out in the movie. As a Potter fan and having read all of the books multiple times I was able to catch these inside references; but I had wonder about those who have never read the books. Would these references confuse them? Was everything going too fast for them who didn't know what was going to happen? I'm not sure. I do wish that the prophesy was more fleshed out and said in full rather than an abbreviated version, but does the audience of the movie really miss out by not having it in full? These questions I ask to you who don't read the books.<br/><br/>I also wish that my favorite character of this book got more screen time: Nymphadora Tonks. She was so delightful in the books, really made an impression on me. In the movie she kinda blended into the background. So sad. On that note I wish that they had at least given a little more of an introduction to the members of the Order since that is the title of the movie.<br/><br/>Two scenes stuck out... I don't want to give away too much info but if you read the books you may under stand this:<br/><br/>I thought that a major event for Mr. Weasley impacted me even more in the film than in the novel, I got genuinely upset. However a major scene for Padfoot was less significant than in novel. I wanted to feel Harry's despair more.<br/><br/>I think I NEED to watch it again. This time I will have to forget about the book and watch it through the eyes of a muggle. Then I will enjoy it even more!"
"ilovorlandobloom","10","2","12","10 July 2007"," Amazing Movie...fairly close to the book
","OK...so I saw the 5th movie yesterday at an early release party. And it was amazing. As expected it was sad and getting progressivly darker. But it is still amazing. They stayed pretty close to the book and didn't stray from the path too much. But they did leave a lot out. But that is also expected...how much info can you take from a 870 page book and cram into a 2.5 hour movie. The computer graphics are also amazing, but I must say that I'm was sad not to see some things in the movie that were in the book. I hope that I haven't spoiled anything for those of you that haven't seen it yet...I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did...:)"
"trixie-k-88","9","1","4","10 April 2012"," One of the best HP films
","It's the fifth installment of Harry Potter, and the characters are well into their teens. The fourth and final director David Yates has taken over, and brings even more changes.<br/><br/>Harry is still reeling from witnessing Voldemort's resurrection and Cedric's murder in the summer, when out of nowhere, dementors attacks him and Dudley. Harry casts a patronus to defend them and takes his dazed cousin home, only to immediately receive a letter saying he has been expelled from Hogwarts for performing underage magic. But that night Harry is rescued by the Order of the Phoenix, a society Dumbledore founded to fight Voldemort. They fly off to the headquarters at Sirius' house, where he is met by the rest of the Order. A trial is held to determine whether or not Harry should be allowed back into Hogwarts, and after the ministry decides to let him back everyone goes back to school. The already distraught Harry is suddenly an outcast, as the ministry is calling Voldemort's resurrection a hoax, and Harry a liar. Lonely and depressed, Harry finds solace in his new friend Luna (Evanna Lynch), an eccentric girl often bullied by other students. Things get more difficult when we meet their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Stauton). Umbridge has been appointed by the Ministry to keep an eye on Dumbledore and enforce the propaganda that Voldemort's return is a lie. Naturally this doesn't set very well with Harry, especially since Umbridge refuses to teach any defensive magic, in favor of theories. After Umbridge manages to take over Hogwarts and enforce excessive rules with painful punishments, Harry, Ron and Hermione develop a secret defensive magic club coined ""Dumbledore's Army"", or ""the DA"". Several students join, including Luna, Ginny, Neville (Matthew Lewis) and Harry's love interest Cho Chang (Katie Leung). When there is a jail break at Azkaban and Harry's visions of Voldemort's actions and emotions get more intense, he knows what he must do. Together with Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna, Harry goes to the front lines to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite HP movies. I like the tone, colors, acting and characters (or rather emphasis on certain characters). Yates' direction is much more emotionally motivated, and Harry's pain and struggles are palpable. We get a very good depiction of Harry's new loving relationship with Sirius, as his desire for a father is finally being satisfied. That being said, Sirius' death was absolutely devastating, and it's hard not to cry when you watch Harry's silent scream. The fight scenes in the ministry were pretty awesome, and probably my favorite part of this film. As for the characters, we get a deeper look at Neville. In previous films Neville was just the clumsy, chubby kid who the Slytherins picked on. In this film we see Neville's courage and determination, as well as learn more about his painful past—and how it is a parallel to Harry's. Evanna Lynch as Luna can only be described in one word: perfect! She is strange, sweet, clever, and has a perfect voice for the role. Helena Bonham Carter is equally perfect for the role of Bellatrix Lestrange. She is crazy, volatile, evil and twisted. Katie Leung isokay. She was in Goblet of Fire as well, but I never found her character that interesting or likable. Imelda Stauton does a great job as Umbridge, and while not hideously ugly like in the book, Staunton gives a creepier aspect to this character with her sickeningly sweet performance. I also enjoyed the look into Snape's past, and the audience's realization that Harry's dad was quite a jerk as a teen, and his bullying of Snape is why he resents Harry so much. This film is establishing the connection between Harry and Voldemort, setting it up the next three films. While he brought a lot of great things to this series, Yates has made some visual changes that make the films look very inconsistent. One change that irritated me is Sirius in his dog form was a Scottish Deerhound, as opposed to the black wolf-like dog in the third film (and described in the book). He also changed the garb of the Death Eaters, forfeiting Newell's pointed hoods and skull eye masks for simpler hoods and full faced metallic masks. While many disagree I did like Newell's wardrobe better, especially since it felt reminiscent of KKK hoods and the skull masks reflected the ""death"" aspect of the Death Eaters. The film also left out some details, especially about the Ministry, but nothing too damaging to the plot. But these complaints are just nit-picks. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of the best Harry Potter films, and a strong comeback from the fourth."
"kneiss1","10","1","4","8 November 2010"," And the movies are turning even darker
","With each movie, Harry Potter is more grown-up - and so are the movies. I am damn sure, that I personally wouldn't show this movie to a 6 years old kid. It is aimed at people around 15-17. But it also appeals to older people - like me. Especially if you like fantasy - like me. <br/><br/>I also do love the combination of comedy (which is usually appearing a lot in the first half of the movies), and the dark and serious notes of the Harry Potter movies. Those always dominate the end, with a great finale. This 5th part had one of the greatest finales. The action was a hell lot of fun to watch. The movie was full of dark atmosphere and suspension - I loved it."
"bob the moo","Null","1","4","12 April 2008"," Dark, professional, engaging and enjoyable
","Another year begins for Harry with more challenges than ever. The Ministry seem intent on having him expelled and it is only some timely interventions that save him  but they come at a cost to those involved. Back at Hogwarts proper and changes are afoot with the addition to the teaching staff of Professor Delores Umbridge as the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher. Umbridge's refusal to actually teach the class sees Harry and his friends secretly practicing themselves but cannot stop her rise to power, displacing Dumbledore. This all occurs while the shadow of Voldemort looms over Harry's life.<br/><br/>I've still not bothered to read any of these bl00dy books and I'm rarely that bothered about seeing the newest films but I must confess that the Harry Potter films are often pretty good when I actually do get around to seeing them. It is a surprise then that I'm not more into them in the way that some other series have held my attention but there you go. Anyway, Order of the Phoenix eventually came to me on DVD and I settled down expecting professional big budget entertainment. And this is what it delivers and it is hard to fault it for what it does  again its failure to really grip me across films is not one I can pin on any one thing and certainly not in this film.<br/><br/>For my money the series has got stronger as it has gone along and it does feel like it has become more comfortable in itself and its audience but, rather than complacency that this guaranteed box office might produce the films have worked harder. Phoenix is stronger than Goblet of Fire, which itself was better than the one before (the first two films didn't really do a lot for me even if they were ""good""). Opening with a tremendously stylish and gripping extended sequence, the film marks out its darker material from the start. It continues with this pretty well and the happiness and carefree introductions of the first few films are pretty much gone. I imagine that this will not be to the pleasing of parents of young fans but for me the menace and fear is pretty well balanced out, although I'm not a great judge as for me I like the idea that films meant for children would have dark themes and not just be a collection of soft shapes and bright colours where everything is right with the world in every regard.<br/><br/>The story provides some strong set pieces and the series has improved yet again in the area of effects. The final fight sequence producing convincing and engaging effect shots as if it was doing it just for fun. Yates' direction is effective and he holds well to the look of the other films but yet brings stuff of his own. He doesn't let it sag often and the film does feel tighter than earlier ones even if at times the ""bigger picture"" was lost on me as we seemed to have very specific narrative threads going on. The characters are stronger and parts of the cast step up to this; Radcliffe in particular impressed me with his range and he genuinely (and literally) has grown with the role. The supporting cast is as usual deep in British stars but this was not as distracting to me as before. Fiennes is a great force in the background and his limit time is well used. Oldman, Rickman, Smith, Issacs, Thompson, Carter and others all provide quality even in small roles. Staunton is a nice addition and does well in what she has to do even if I felt the film gave too much time to her here and there. The young cast are good in some areas (eg Watson, Grint) but the non-speaking roles are annoyingly overdone with their facial expressions and they bugged me hanging around the edges of action (""ok kids, act INVOLVED!"").<br/><br/>Overall though this is a very engaging and enjoyable film that seemed to effortlessly fill the time. Something about the series is still failing to hold me to the long game and I think it is the development of really strong characters but this is getting better as it gets darker. Regardless though the film is very professional with strong effects, starry cast and a consistently engaging plot. More importantly it is better yet again than the film before and is a credit to the series at a time when most film series tend to fade rather than grow."
"greenylennon","2","1","4","14 July 2007"," Harry Potter lost somewhere his magic
","What a disappointment! What an huge disappointment! I want my money back! Where did the true Harry Potter series go? I remembered films where you could perceive magic always and everywhere, you could feel an heart beating behind all that computer graphic, you could daydream watching the gripping adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermione. This time it's a complete failure. The story hasn't heart, hasn't point, hasn't characters you can relate and grow attached to. Why does Harry kiss Cho Chang? I couldn't feel any sentiment between them. Why did they push Ron and Hermione away? Ron and Hermione were Harry's moral support in every situation, they were the friends everybody wants to have. Now they're merely two flat figures without any personality: where did Ron's liveliness go? Where did Hermione the friendly swot go? Maybe they lost somewhere between the special effects. The pacing went too fast, luckily I had read the book, otherwise I wouldn't understand anything. The only things I liked were Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. They're perfectly cast and show remarkable acting skills: about Staunton and Bonham Carter that's natural because they're very good actresses, but about Lynch wow, she doesn't play Luna Lovegood, she is Luna Lovegood! Don't waste your time with HP5, go see something else."
"rkeaney","8","1","4","14 July 2007"," I loved it
","A Harry Potter movie for the first time in the franchise's history seems almost overshadowed by the fact that the final book in this extremely successful series is due just over a week after the cinematic release of one of the book adaptations. However this brings nothing away from the fact that this movie will be extremely successful.<br/><br/>Before i got to see this movie Prisoner of Azkaban was by far my favourite of the adaptations with Goblet of fire close behind (mostly for it's action as i felt that it is almost disappointing after re-watching compared to its magnificent book) First and foremost i must say that i thought David Yates' version of Order of the Phoenix was as near to perfect as i could hope from the shortest movie in the series ( although it was the longest book). Daniel Radcliffe has for the first time in my opinion portrayed Harry perfectly compared to some of the weak acting we have grown accustomed to from his previous outings in the franchise. Obviously Radcliffe has matured more as an actor having a lot more confidence in his role and funnily enough this has been the hardest challenge for his character yet in terms of acting having to bring across realistic sympathy for this character who is going through all the angst and confusion of someone slowly being possessed by Voldemort. I say this because for the first time i don't think i cringed once at one thing he said in this potter movie. We may put this simply down to the fact that he bravely got his wand out on stage in ""Equus"" and that this gave him some confidence but i really think that Radcliffe is beginning to blossom into a good actor(perhaps a little late in the franchise but time will tell.) Now to the story, as i said the shortest movie running at 2hrs and 18mins even though it is based on a 736 page book. Of course things were going to be left out and they are, but unless we wanted a 15hr long movie there is bound to be things left out. I think where Newell failed in GOF, Yates thrived in OOTP, Yates has perfectly captured the feeling in this story showing us how alone Harry feels and the beautiful relationship he has with Sirius his godfather. This was very important for the ending of the story which i do not want to ruin for people who are not fans of the book.<br/><br/>So Yates brings us the story perfectly setting up relationships that we know are going to be significant in the next movie by leaving nice little subtle hints here and there. Also by using a mainly TV experienced director we have the potter series in a totally different way with completely different techniques. Never before have we had flashbacks from the other movies ( which i thought was a success) or slow motion sequences which do not come across as tacky but slotted in perfectly to catch the audiences attention or to arouse emotion also the use of the shaking camera which would usually be more of a TV thing is perfectly used in the start which makes the audience feel much more engaged in it.<br/><br/>The acting, well what can i say i don't think that there was one piece of extremely weak acting this time around as all the teenagers are growing into young adults and becoming much more asserted in their roles. As for new castings, Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge the High inquisitor at hogwarts was amazing. I don't think i have seen someone that deliciously evil on screen for sometime giving us a shocking performance that if an actor from a harry potter film was ever to get an Oscar nomination this would be it. A great performance in which even the slightest giggle or "" so silly of me"" can come across as evil.<br/><br/>Evanna lynch as Luna Lovegood, an Irish girl who is a major fan of the books and probably the best bit of casting in this franchise and that is not an over-statement, her dreamy voice and manner bring across the eccentricity of the bewildering character that we can't help but fall in love with.<br/><br/>All the cast deserve honourable mentions, Michael Gambon,Emma Watson, Rupert Grint,Gary Oldman and Helena Bonham Carter all playing their parts brilliantly.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a brilliantly crafted tense thriller throughout relying on the eerie atmosphere throughout the second act to catch the audiences attention, we can feel a great sense of growing danger but not one that we can fully put our finger on. Also, This movie is probably, the most touching,moving,and funny of the series so far with great thought put into character development and relationships between the characters.<br/><br/>Harry is growing up having his first kiss in this movie which i thought was a well done scene but surpassed by the one that followed in which Harry is asked by Ron and Hermione "" How was it?"" ""Wet"" He Replies.<br/><br/>Also with Michael Gambon back on form as Dumbledore the scene in which he escapes arrest is perfectly done with a great sign off from Shacklebolt, "" I know you may not like him minister, but you gotta admit Dumbledore's got style"" This movie sets us up for what is to come since POA we have known that harry ain't no little kid with silly magic tricks and the darkness in the the 5th movie of the potter franchise perfectly conveys this with the amazing third act at the ministry that will leave you literally begging for more.<br/><br/>I give this a slightly biased 10/10 which some people may think is a lot.. but i loved it and i highly recommend it to everyone but i think it will be much more in the taste of the book's fans."
"twillis_stuff","4","1","4","14 July 2007"," in my humble opinion
","By far this movie is my least favorite in the series, while the special effects were to die for and the wizard battles were good the rest did little for me. The worst part is they added a ton of new characters and didn't give you any back story on them what so ever, in my opinion this movie seemed to almost be a direct rip from star wars episode 2. My suggestion is to go buy the books that way you can actually meet the new characters and gain a better perspective of what the movie should have been like. If your gonna spend money to go see a great movie I suggest that you go see Transformers and save order of the Pheonix for a DVD rental."
"mgos23","10","1","4","13 July 2007"," My favorite HP movie, by far
","This was an excellent film in all aspects, and not just because I am a hardcore Harry Potter fan. First off, the acting was superb, and you can easily see how all the actors have grown to make the characters their own. David Yates did a great job capturing the darkness of the 5th book without drowning us in unhappiness. The cinematography was absolutely fantastic. Though a few scenes which I thought very important were left out, the movie effectively covered the book without dragging along and without jumping from one event to the other. Daniel Radcliffe did a great job portraying Harry's disgust, misery, and hope. What I loved most about his movie were the relationships between the characters, and how even when we were about to witness a story-altering and epic scene (the kiss and the battle!!), the way they interacted with one another still made us laugh. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, the die-hard fanatics and those just looking for some entertainment. It's got a little something for everyone."

","Considering the fact that the book is the worst of the lot being too long and rambling, the film is excellently adapted ! It didn't follow the book too closely like the first two, so there were quite some surprises for those who know the book by heart. It didn't seem rushed like the fourth film. The pace was just right. Neither did it feel too far out like the third film. The best thing about this Potter film is that it stands well on its own without the book. Both the people who have read it and those who haven't will enjoy this movie. Acting and cinematography was top-notch. Soundtrack was great. The climax was very well done. By the way, Filch has maximum screen-time here compared to the other four ! Adapting a 700+ page book to a highly satisfying 153 minute film is no mean feat."
"TroubleTobS","8","1","4","13 July 2007"," I'm lightly disappointed...
","...don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but it wasn't as great as i expected it would be, when i saw the trailers. When i heard that they didn't stick to the book completely, i thought, ""never mind, i wont let that bother me"". But they really left some things out, i thought were very important. Quidditch for example. I'd like to know, how the explain Ron being a keeper, when there's Quidditch in the sixth movie. And the thing with Harry and Cho...well, someone here wrote it ""Cho didn't do it, damn it!"" The way it looks now, Harry broke up with her, though it went the other way around, as far as i remember it. Things like these were one factor. Another one was the editing. I don't know how to describe it, in some scenes it was just strange...for example: former scene: Harry's sleeping and rolling around in his bed, cut... Harry's on his way to the subway station. know what i mean? The thing, bothering me the most was the music. i so looked forward to another awesome soundtrack, but in my opinion it didn't came out as good as in the former movies.<br/><br/>for the rest it was a good (not great) movie. the fight-scene rocked and Imelda Staunton alias Prof. Umbridge and Evanna Lynch alias Luna Lovegood made an awesome job!

"Diva_star91","9","1","4","13 July 2007"," Different to book....but still bloody good
","Exceeds expectations....however, I must say that I felt the makers of the film left out some of the best scenes (such as the St.Mungos//Lockhart/Nevilles Parents scene). The score (as in the music)was not as uplifting/scary/whatever it needed to be to fit in as it had previously been in the other films. However, compared to the other films, the settings, costumes and makeup have improved vastly.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe carried off an angsty, arrogant teenage boy to perfection, perhaps due to an increased growth in his acting skills (not to mention his new, admirable body that he probably spent many hours working). Rupert Grint was likable in this film as well, however, I believe he had not as much lines or camera time as his acting skills deserve. Emma Watson, on the other hand, seemed somewhat out of place at the beginning of the film, her acting not comparable to that of the other films. However, by the end (the most exciting/interesting part of the film) her acting had somewhat improved, and she no longer irritated me.<br/><br/>Newcomers Imelda Staunton (Umbridge) and Evanna Lynch (Luna) shocked me. Not only were they better then I imagined, but they actually were better then the rest of the original cast. And Helena Bonham Carters (Beatrix Lestrange)'s entrance sent a shiver down my spine.<br/><br/>Althogether, this is the best of the 5! Can't wait till the next one!"
"Jasmine0728","8","1","4","12 July 2007"," It was okay
","I go see Harry Potter every year that it comes out and this year was no different.I actually got to go to the sneak peek. I really enjoyed this one but at the same time I don't think it was one of the best. I know reading the books and watching the movie are two different things but this time it was way off course. Lots of the details and scenes that were described in the book didn't show up in the movie at all. It wasn't a major loss but I don't think I would recommend people trampling over each other to get inside the theater. =/ I really would like to see what the critics have to say about the film this year and I want to hear from other people who saw the movie as well."
"witthayu","3","1","4","12 July 2007"," Just bad, don't see it
","Well that was just a bad movie. Boring, bad computer graphics and a Harry Potter who just does not look like a boy anymore. In fact, I never liked that boy they casted several years ago for the role. His main bonus was that he looked like Harry Potter, but now he clearly does not. His acting is so wooden ie bad. And since I saw his gay bear pictures, I just can't think of him as HP anymore. Even the girl looks too old by now. The red headed guy is just funny to watch, but nowadays he has got rings under his eyes lol, probably too much party going.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is a total flop. Even my gf who is really into HP and never too critical said it was a waste of time."
"ringbearer87","10","1","4","12 July 2007"," Very different from the other films, but fantastic!!
","Firstly lets point out that I am a Harry Potter fan. I am a big fan of the books, and though the films will never be as good, they have done well at capturing JK Rowling's wondrous world on the screen.<br/><br/>So far each film has improved upon the last, perhaps owing to the fact that the characters/actors grow older with each film, thus each installment becomes more adult. So it would be fair to say I had high expectations for this film, the 5th in the series.<br/><br/>Director David Yates and screenplay writer Michael Goldenberg had their work cut out for them, with the Order of the Phoenix book structured in a way that could present difficulties when translating to screen.<br/><br/>Phoenix takes place after Voldemort has returned, yet the wizarding world is in denial, labeling Harry Potter and Dumbledore as liars, rather than believing their claims that the Dark Lord is back. Yet Harry is faced with more serious problems when he develops a psychological link to Voldemort which channels the Dark Lord's emotions through him.<br/><br/>Unlike its four predecessors Phoenix does not play out in the conventional 'Harry' format. The first four books' plots progress with purpose, obviously building up to its climax, and the character's motives are clear throughout. Pheonix, however, is not so. The book almost plods along with less action, but heavier emotional and psychological underpinnings.<br/><br/>This could have created a dilemma when translating the story into an engaging film; suitable for the broad audience the Harry Potter series attracts.<br/><br/>It is clear from the first scene that Pheonix is going to be a very different film to the other in the HP series, with the use of a steady cam, and jerky filming techniques common in war films (a filming style which has not been used in any of the previous films).<br/><br/>Phoenix has a much darker feel then the other Harry films, the enjoyable and exaggerated teenage drama of The Goblet of Fire replaced with angst and aggression.<br/><br/>This new dark tone is very suitable to the story, and though this 'heavier' feel might not impress those fans who have become comfortable with the fun and fluffy tones of the other films, it is a needed new approach to a film series that could have easily become mundane.<br/><br/>The heavy psychological aspect to the story could have been a challenge to adapt for film. I found myself nervous as the movie started wondering how they could possibly make Harry and Voldermort's mental link understandable and convincing.<br/><br/>The fact that Harry feels the same emotions as Voldemort due to this link could have been hard to communicate on screen, yet Goldenberg and Yates have not shied away from the challenge tackling it head on. The result is awesome.<br/><br/>The scenes in which Professor Snape delves into Harry's mind are  in the words of Ron Weasley  wicked! The use of flashbacks to previous films (look how little and cute they all are!) and the rapid editing are extremely effective and really add an emotional feel, reminding viewers of their connection with the three lead characters, whom they have practically watched grow up.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter has come a long way from the wide-eyed young boy in The Philosophers Stone. He convincingly portrays a young man that is tormented mentally, adding enough aggression to his character without becoming unlikable.<br/><br/>Dumbledore, the character that stands out most in the books, yet seems to have been neglected in the films, has a stronger presence in this movie. Phoenix finally touches on the greatness of this character and strong bond he and Harry share. The climactic battle between him and Voldermort will have your chin on the floor.<br/><br/>The Verdict: This film follows the book more closely than the others,and though this may come as a relief to die-hard book fans, it does result in a slower moving film. Those viewers who are only loosely interested in the series may not find it as enjoyable, with viewers needing an interest in the character's emotional journeys in order to fully appreciate the film.<br/><br/>The new darker approach to Pheonix, means the film is not a 'kid friendly' as the others, however the subject matter does not allow for sugar coating.<br/><br/>This film is the best of the lot; the new style and tone a very welcome change. Phoenix is the most well made of the series with fantastic and original ways of piecing the scenes together (watch how they utilize the Daily Prophet newspaper). The psychological and emotional aspect of the film makes it very interesting and engaging, and will have even the adults on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>All I can say is: bring on the next one!"
"tman90","10","1","4","12 July 2007"," Superb. The Best Film Yet.
","FIRST WORDS: I implore you to go see this movie. It is worth your trouble. <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix, the longest book in the fantastic JK Rowling novel series, is the shortest movie in the film series. This is really noticeable. I could go both ways on deciphering whether the length is good or bad. Bad because of plot pieces cut out. Good because the movie never hits a dragging point or slow point. Unlike the previous films, this film doesn't get dragged down with the boarding school styled life. This film concentrates on sending its many main themes out. <br/><br/>Lines are changed, things are switched, but all in an artistic way. David Yates, the director, sews together the darkest film yet and the most creative in shot choices, tied with Alfonso Cauron's Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>So there were things I loved, and things that disappointed me, but that's how all the movies are to an obsessed fan who read the books first. You Need to See this movie. The acting is amazing and the music is spellbinding, and the finale is EPIC."
"keeno32","10","1","4","12 July 2007"," Magic never felt so good!
","Lets get one thing straight, I am a big Potter fan. I have read all the books, seen all the films blah blah blah. The fifth book for me was one that seemed to drag, I didn't find it as interesting as the other books although it was still good. With this in mind, I approached the film with a little apprehension. But what I didn't expect was to be this blown away.<br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>The acting in this film is excellent, the children really step up to the mark of the gritty theme of this book and deliver some of the most developed performances of the series. Daniel has come on bounds, most likely due to his stage debut, and really fills the shoes of his troubled character. Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is excellent, her distant expressions coupled with her flitting voice create a very interesting character. I was disappointed though with Rupert Grint's character as he has not been allowed to be the comic relief in this movie. In previous movies his little lines have really made me laugh.<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton gives a haunting performance as Dolores Umbridge and you really feel how taking over the school is affecting the people within it. I was close to tears with the firing of Prof. Trewlawney. She had one of the best performances in the film, well done Imelda. I am still concerned about Gambons violent approach to Dumbeldore and hearing of his lack of research into roles in other films gives me reason to believe that is what he did here.<br/><br/>Book Relation <br/><br/>I have only read this book once and I don't remember it vastly. The film was very true to the book in my opinion and carried the important scenes throughout the book to create a cohesive storyline. <br/><br/>The only points in the book I remember not to be in the film are any events surrounding quidditch and St Mungo's hospital. To me these weren't greatly important to the storyline so the film still worked.<br/><br/>Sound and Visual Effects <br/><br/>The special effects in this film are phenomenal. They completely surpass the effects in previous films and give a gritty feel to an already dark art style. The climax stood out particularly as the special effects were put to most use here. The action seemed incredible and I loved watching the death eaters fly away as a stupefy flew at them. <br/><br/>The Dumbledore and Voldermort fight was utterly spectacular. Not only the tremendous special effects but the sound effects. Loud humms and whirrs in the absence of music to me felt amazing. I swear I started sweating it was that good.<br/><br/>Direction <br/><br/>I feel that although there were some things I wouldn't have included such as shaky running cameras, the direction was excellent. I love how gritty the film felt, it really links with Harry's emotions and the dark times that lay ahead for the wizarding world.<br/><br/>Little blips of humour help to liven the film up and keep viewers enthralled and the high octane action of the fights in the ministry keeps your blood pressure high. Harry Potter has grown up, and so have the films. All in all MAGIC NEVER FELT SO GOOD!!<br/><br/>10/10 Excellent"
"lore_pichu24","10","1","4","12 July 2007"," The book and the movies: Worlds Apart
","The only way to really enjoy a Harry Potter movie is forgetting everything about the book, 'cause even if they are based on them, no one will ever be able to be completely faithful to the book, and so it happens with OOTP, in my personal opinion is the best one yet, but that is my opinion it's up to you if you like or no. Of course it could have been better, for it is very short, but I do think it has the essence of book 5, which is quite hard when you have to fit 800 pages into a 2 and a half hour movie. most of the complains are about the lack of details, but it may be these details weren't as necessary as we thought or whatever the reason is; these movies are movies and we have to enjoy them as such, for we would never be completely satisfied with it as an adaptation of the book."
"MassiveReader24","10","1","4","12 July 2007"," Amazing, although it leaves some out...
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was amazing, and everything that the director included was done exactly how I wanted it to be done. However, it's what they cut out that detracts from my rating. Three of my favorite scenes from the book were cut (Umbridge in McGonagall's Class, Rita Skeeter's interview (cutting out Miranda Richarson should be a crime), and Umbridge trying to sack Hagrid), and they limited the ""War on Umbridge"" at Hogwarts. Although I put my rating at 10, it's really a 9.5. <br/><br/>Aside from that, however, it was an absolutely fantastic movie. Imelda Staunton was perfect for the part of Dolores Jane Umbridge, and Helena Bonham Carter's Bella (Bellatrix Lestrange) was also superb. I particularly enjoyed her cackling at the battle. Evanny Lynch was also a wonderful addition to the cast as the quirky (Loony) Luna Lovegood. The previous actors also continued to show their excellence, and they display a lot of talent.<br/><br/>Of particular note was the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, which was one of the most exciting scenes the movie has to offer. I especially liked that the black clouds surrounding the Death Eaters made them look almost demonic, while the white clouds made to Order members look angelic. Other amusing aspects include the increase in the number of Education Decrees, and D.A. lessons, Dumbledore's escape, and the dialogue in general (especially Luna, Umbridge, Bella, and the interactions between Ron and Hermione)."

","I came into the theater last night, looking forward to the newest installment in the Harry Potter franchise. Yeah, the previews looked good, but I hadn't know they put all the best parts in the preview.<br/><br/>I thought Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix was one of the worst of the series. The director was the worse so far (Why couldn't we get Alfonso Cuarón back?), and the writing was trash. It seemed like David Yates was more focused on making the film look pretty then entertaining or advancing plot. Every other scene had unnecessary sweeping camera angles or unneeded CGI.<br/><br/>The writing, God, what were they thinking? They had all sorts of characters to work with, yet nobody had any lines? We sure heard Dolores Umbridge talk. She spent half the movie yapping her mouth off. But how many lines did Lupin have? How about Tonks? Ginny? Even Ron had what, four lines in the entire film? But there were good parts to this film. The casting of Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood was perfect. It's a shame they turned her quirky character into nothing more than a flirt. The final 15 minutes of the film were, surprisingly, very well done. Perhaps it was a lack of landscape for Yates to try to show off, I don't know.<br/><br/>Over all, I thought the writing was trash and the director was way out of his league. This film had by far the most potential. Luckily it didn't fall as flat as the abortion that was the first movie.<br/><br/>4/10"
"3xHCCH","9","1","4","12 July 2007"," Way Better than the Book!!!
","I watched this IMAX version this morning and it was well worth the expense. This is one of those rare times where the movie is WAY BETTER than the book! The Order of the Phoenix is my least favorite of the six published books so far. The adventures were repetitive of previous books. I felt that nothing original was introduced. I also felt that it was not well-written since the action is not clearly described. When I finished the book, I did not feel any sense of awe that I felt especially with the fantastic 4th (Goblet of Fire) and 6th (Half Blood Prince) books! But this film was the total opposite. After sitting through disappointing film interpretations of the 3rd (Prisoner of Azkaban) and 4th books, this movie is a vast improvement over the book. I guess I have to credit the writer for distilling the ponderous text into this coherent and action-packed adventure script. And the director, David Yates, who is relative newcomer, who created an amazing vision from the lackluster printed words. The story is easy to follow, and logically sequenced. The action scenes are very well choreographed and executed on the big screen.<br/><br/>The IMAX version features 3D rendition of the last 20 minutes of this 2 hour 20 minute film. This was from the scene where the gang flies off to London to fight Voldemort on flying beasts, through their dangerous magical adventures in the Ministry of Magic. The 3D effects of the flying around, the perspectives of the doorways and corridors within the building, the destruction made by the violent spells being thrown around were nothing short of amazing and impressive.<br/><br/>The three main kids have really grown up. Daniel Radcliffe really turned out to be the perfect actor for Harry. He grew up well with the series, and can indeed carry off the heroics and angst of the title character. Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron)have less screen time here, but they also did their job well. The chose well for the actress (Evanna Lynch) to play Luna Lovegood, who is quite annoying in the book, but very well portrayed in this movie. Those small clues regarding Ginny Weasley were also excellently hinted in many scenes, and very well underplayed by Bonnie Wright.<br/><br/>The esteemed senior members of the class do their best with their limited screen time, such as Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson (so good as Sibyl Trelawney!) and Maggie Smith. I still miss Richard Harris as Dumbledore. There is something amiss in Michael Gambon's performance in my opinion.<br/><br/>Their nemesis in this installment is Dolores Umbridge played so sinisterly by Imelda Staunton. I have only heard of this actress from ""Vera Drake."" She is so good at being so hateful! She interpreted this villain as I imagined as she was described in the book. With a shorter villain role is Helena Bonham Carter as the mad Deatheater, Bellatrix Lestrange.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent film!!!"
"usitilidie","7","1","4","11 July 2007"," good film, but still not nearly as good as the book
","For me, Order of the Phoenix was the hardest of the books to get through and also the one that I enjoyed the least. But, as it was the longest - it condensed easily enough. I always feel like the HP movies jump around a lot, and I'm often confused as to how someone who has never read the books can follow them. Regardless, this movie was indeed entertaining. I cheered, I scowled, I laughed - it was all there. I still do hate that so many of the story lines from the book are changed, but I understand that you just can't have everything...and sometimes things need to be simplified here or expanded there to allow for some ""movie magic."" To all you Potter fans out there, do go see the movie (just keep an open mind) - BUT then go read the book again to remind yourself what really makes this series truly wonderful."
"alindsay-al","10","1","5","9 August 2016"," An epic more intense film
","I have enjoyed all of the harry potter films so far but I must say this film is easily my favourite so far. The premise sees the ministry of magic accuse harry and Dumbledore of lying about Voldemort's return. Daniel Radcliffe was a fantastic choice as harry potter and this is by far his best performance as the character to date. There is allot of depth to the performance as he tries to move on from the events of the previous film and how it just weighs on him in this film and it is fantastic. Rupert grint and Emma Watson have truly grown into the roles of Ron and Hermione and they are great in this film. Especially Hermione who develops into a more fun character in this film which I liked. Gary oldman is back as Sirius black in a bigger role and he is great in this film as a real father figure to harry in his life. Dolores umbridge is introduced in this film and my goodness she is a horrible person but she really works in this film as the horrible antagonist. Every character in this film and some of the lesser characters roles are expanded on which is good to see. The story is really good in this film as you see harry truly disturbed by Voldemort's return and how he has to deal with it. I also enjoyed the slightly more serious plot involving the state of Hogwarts that helps make this film excellent. The script has allot of great drama to it that makes this film a bit more epic. There is also good humour in this film that helps add to the humanity to the characters. The style has some great action scenes in it that make you feel the scale of wizard powers. Also this film is definitely the best paced so far. Overall I truly loved this film and think it is the best of the harry potter films so far."

"funkyfry","7","1","5","18 July 2007"," good entry in the series
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  the name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but it's one of the more entertaining films I've seen so far this summer. Since I've read the book, it's a little hard for me to judge how good this movie would be for me if I had not read it. But all in all I found it more entertaining and convincing than the 4th film, not quite as good as the 3rd. It really seems like the more the filmmakers try to avoid slavish devotion to the books the better they are as films.<br/><br/>In this installment of the series, we see the menace of Lord Voldemort growing while the ""Ministry"" sticks its head in the sand and denies that what Harry Potter saw at the end of the 4th film actually happened. This leads to various humorous and dramatic situations, although the story somewhat lacks focus. Unlike in all of the previous HP stories, in this book we are not primarily concerned with the discovery of a treacherous tutor or former student, so the mystery component present in previous Rowling stories is missing. In its place we have the development of a more complicated character for Potter and we see the Ministry itself emerging as a confounding villainous influence, particularly when they recruit Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as the new headmaster of Hogwarts. She introduces a regime that is low on educational content and high on pink accoutrements adorned with kittens.<br/><br/>Umbridge's slow descent into outright fascism is certainly the story's most compelling element, and Staunton's performance is just as excellent and brilliant as Rowling's description in the novel. I could see the audience around me go from being sort of annoyed and amused by her, to being deeply annoyed at her, and finally as her tortures grow more intense the audience reaction descended to hisses and other vocal forms of anger. Very effectively done. I'm glad the writers left former-educator Rowling's commentary on education in the story  it's a rare thing indeed for a popular fantasy story to convey to the audience at least some hint of the difference between pointless theoretical memory-based learning and a more practical application-based learning style.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe's performances as Potter are becoming more and more interesting and capable. Wish I could say the same for the other two actors in our primary triumvirate, although the addition of Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood was solid casting. Unfortunately a lot of the parts of the story involving Ron and Hermione were excised on the way from book to screen and the actors seem to feel the need to over-act as if to compensate for their lack of screen time. I also think downplaying Harry's argumentative and jealous relationship with Ron with regards to his Quiddich playing damages several other scenes in the film, particularly when he tells Sirius (Gary Oldman) that he's afraid he's becoming a bad person (which we've seen very little evidence of in the film). We see virtually nothing of some of the better character actors in the series including Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape). But on the plus side, what we do see is good, and we now get to see much more of Ralph Fiennes fun Voldemort portrayal.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, it's a fine film for Potter fans."
"cerulean_blue_2000","9","1","5","14 July 2007"," Gets the gist well
","I am a die-hard Potter fan, I dissect the books! But I actually *do* make allowances for the transition from book to movie. I do this by looking at what is missing - ""why was it in the book?"" ""what purpose did it serve there"" - and then decide if the same end was accomplished in the movie even though it might have been skipped or altered.<br/><br/>In the end, I was good with this movie. I enjoyed it, I thought it got the 'gist' very well, and I could see why some of the changes were made. Sure, a couple things bugged me but overall, bravo!<br/><br/>*spoilers* -The Dudly/Harry/Dementor thing *did* bug me, as I felt Harry would not haul out his wand in front of D.'s cronies, and I was annoyed that Dudley knew there was a threat - in the books he had no clue it was dementors and thought Harry was doing it all. So overall, thumbs down for missing the gist that Harry is unfairly accused not only by the ministry, but ALSO by Dudley.<br/><br/>As for the missing letters - what did they say? Oh...that Harry wasn't expelled and would have a hearing. They put it in dialogue instead. Same result, less time. As for missing howler - I will reserve judgment to see if future movies pick up the slack in explaining why Harry *has* to spend time on Privet Drive.<br/><br/>-Grimmaud place: I *did* want to see the portrait and am disappointed it wasn't there, but otherwise, I can see why it got rushed. I know a lot are annoyed the locket and RAB are not mentioned as we all feel these are relevant to book 6 & 7, and I sort of agree, but overall I felt they did a decent job with condensing the important dialogue.<br/><br/>-Missing St Mungos: Well, the dialogue about the stitches is some of my favorite in all the books, but essentially the point of it in the book is to provide backstory for Neville - what happened to his parents and his connection to Bellatrix. Neville ends up telling Harry instead - so to me, the point is still accomplished.<br/><br/>-Cho as the snitch. Well, I loved the cleverness of Hermiones' hex and was sorry to see it go, but I understood why it was done. Let's look at what happened in the book: Harry + Cho, first kiss, date that goes bad, things just ""dont work out"". Its very real, yet anticlimactic. The director is then left with *having* to put in the first kiss, because its important for Harry's ""coming of age"" - yet stuck with all this ""how it didn't work out"" stuff, which would be boring for some, and drag down the pace. <br/><br/>By making Cho the snitch, he deftly provides a good reason for a breakup without having to try to portray that date and how they just kind of ""didn't work out"", He salvages Cho's character by having Snape say the serum was used on her, so it wasn't of her free will. So, I have to give it a ""same end accomplished"" in less time.<br/><br/>-Snape, and the missing pensieve: Honestly, the reason Snape PUT those memories in the pensieve was so Harry couldn't see them in exactly the way he saw them in the movie, so all the movie did was skip a step. The end result is exactly the same: Harry sees the memories, we see a tormented young Snape and the reason for his hatred of Harry, and Snape stops the occlumency lessons. <br/><br/>-Missing rooms in MoM: Honestly, sure we would ALL have liked to have seen all the rooms, but it is a movie. You cant fit in everything. The rooms are not relevant to the ""gist"": The 2 important ones were included so that works for me.<br/><br/>-The prophecy. I did have a problem with this on several levels, and is the only real place I was disappointed in the transition. As the ""Secret weapon"" *and* the explanation of why Voldemort tried to kill Harry to begin with, I felt it was glossed over and not explained. I didn't like that everyone there heard it, and especially didn't like that Harry handed it over. I really thought Nevilles connection should have been mentioned.<br/><br/>Skipping this misses the most important point of the books *as a whole* - that is commentary on the power and importance of *choice*. Now, to the director/writers credit, they put the point about choice in later (in the possession scene) so it remains, but I liked the added depth of knowing that *who* the prophecy referred to (Harry or Neville) was never ""predestined"" but instead ""chosen"" - by Voldemort himself."

Characters more believable too. Apparently it took 2 years to write the screenplay - two years well spent. The final fight scene and different flying scenes gives us a welcome break from Quidditch. Brilliant casting of Dolores and Luna and Bella Lestrange - and excellent Grawp. Don't listen to / read from other people, go and see the film for yourself."

","First off, I didn't like the movie. Actually, I left after 1 hour, it was just too long and boring.<br/><br/>Special effects are nothing new, copy-pasted from the previous opus.<br/><br/>Now, I'd like to talk about the scripts Hollywood produces lately.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 and this Harry Potter have in common they both feature heroes fearing to become evils. It's funny to notice this similarity in two of the 2007 blockbusters scripts, while USA is struggling in Irak.<br/><br/>It's somehow all about an America, considered by itself and by many as a Hero - saving the world and spreading democracy - but coming to a point where the hero turns evil, spreading more deaths than saving lives.<br/><br/>I mean, just think about it : Hollywood movies have always been in the past somehow a reflexion of what the society was up to, with subtle hints. Take ""King-Kong"" (1933) : it's interesting to notice that when it takes place in New-York, the first people to die by the monster are all afro-Americans.<br/><br/>The creation of super-heroes, such as Superman (1934), Spiderman or Batman coincides with History contexts.<br/><br/>An influence on early Superman stories is the context of the Great Depression. The left-leaning perspective of creators Shuster and Siegel is reflected in early story lines. Superman took on the role of social activist, fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements.<br/><br/>Thus my opinion, is that movies such as Spiderman 3 and this episode of Harry Potter feature self-questioning heroes, because that's exactly where we're at with our mission in Irak, asking ourselves : <br/><br/>Leave, or Turn Evil ?"

The movie goes by quick but it will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film. It is packed with action, intensity and surprises. Even though they cut out much from the book, i enjoyed it, unlike my brother who disagrees and finds the movie terrible just because they cut too much out, they still leave the main parts of the book in the movie. Who ever seen this movie will agree with me that Helena Bonham Carter plays Bellatrix Lastrange perfectly and without any problem. MUST SEE MOVIE OF THE SUMMER!"

","I actually got the opportunity to see this today and was mesmerized by the increasing maturity of the movies in the series. It actually was more of an adult film that the previous ones and makes me think that we are in for a treat with the next two.<br/><br/>The usual gang is back, and there are some great performances. I particularly liked Richard Griffiths (Vernon Dursley) in his brief appearance; Natalia Tena (Mrs. Henderson Present, About a Boy) was the first really attractive adult in the films; Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) was also excellent; Alan Rickman (Snape) is a favorite; and, of course, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Valdamort.<br/><br/>I really liked the performance of Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. I am looking forward to seeing her again. And the addition of unknown Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood was brilliant casting.<br/><br/>The ending fights were spectacular and worth the price of admission. This was definitely the best yet and makes me anxious for number six."

","OK, so now that is out of the way, this is an excellent movie, and I do not know or care how closely it follows the book, because the film was so entertaining. The focus of this film allowed for significant character development and involvement, which I felt the last two films were lacking, more importantly we get to see a circle of friends truly unite. This film was exciting and full of energy the special effects were certainly entertaining and the dialogue although slow in places was excellent. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson were a joy to watch each showing a little more of their character's true nature. The show stealers where by far Gary Oldman, and Helena Bonham Carter turning in brilliant performances All in all this is still a film you should see in the theatre this tale continues to grow much larger than life."

","I have seen all of the Harry Potter films and I have to say I really think this one is by far the best. For those who have read the book, you'll be really surprised at how loyal the movie adaption is. It definitely keeps the magical spirit of love and friendship that JK Rowling writes. It's definitely not mushy though, it's full of action and dark magic though not like Goblet of Fire where Harry just seems to jump around and there's no storyline. I could definitely tell all the actors had been really pushed to give their best possible performance, even a few of the regulars who are usually pushed up the back had heaps of lines to say. I was really glad about this because I think all of the actors really have a lot to give to the movie and they never get the opportunity. Usually Harry Potter films only stand out for special effects but this time there are plenty Oscar-worthy performances. I rate it eight out of ten only because there was the occasional weird moment that came out of nowhere and some story lines like 'the kiss' were simply done for the sake of it and eventually abandoned. Other than that it's a great movie, I've never seen the cinema so packed!"

","I haven't read one single word of the Harry Potter saga; I did see the first film and thought it okay but not much more.

It's not that bad but then neither is it extra special, at least not to one who has never read the books and therefore needs help in figuring out the back story. By far the best elements for me were those satirizing the English Education system because it's quite a trick to satirize something that doesn't exist thanks to Tony Blair.

"Kostale","7","0","1","31 May 2020"," Now, the situation is becomes serous!
","I can't say that the plot of this part of the film is as interesting as the plot we are used to in previous parts of the film, but I can definitely say that this part breathed life into the idea of a new dimension of the film. To everything else in the film (characters, scenes, dialogues, etc.). All this heat-up of the plot, accompanied by the development of Lord Voldemort in the background, is a very nice way to say goodbye to the elements of the film that make it childish. Watching this part of the film, the world of magic we are used to becomes more realistic and thus better in the domain that no matter how much we know that magic is beautiful and useful it can also be dangerous and uncontrolled and that is a good effect. The plot in this part of the film is not as interesting to me personally as it was in the previous parts of the film, but I am willing to relax and let JKR do what it intended to do, and that is to finish this story spectacularly and as much as possible realistically. Introducing the character of Professor Dolores is a great idea but I think her tyranny could have been portrayed a little better with stronger effects to the detriment of other actions in the film that were unnecessary. I don't like the way Dolores was eliminated because I think it could have been a more spectacular way to symbolize the end of a disgusting tyranny. The Order of the Phoenix is a great idea, but unfortunately it has not been given the attention it deserves. I believe this is because it is impossible to screen a book, which we are used to when it comes to Harry Potter books. Perhaps we could have paid a little more attention to the Order of the Phoenix itself as well as Dumbledore's army because somehow Professor Dolores, the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army and Lord Voldemort are key elements of the film. I see this film as a continuation of the seriousness of Harry Potter, which in the last scene in this part of the film made it clear that the next sequels will be more serious, darker and more realistic and therefore worthy of the name Harry Potter and his fame in the world. Finally all the children go into oblivion and all the adults enter the game. I would praise the murder of one of the main characters, at the end of the film, but I personally didn't like the way it was done because I think it was supposed to be more emotional and somehow stronger and bigger. Either way, I am ready to enter the final phase of this film from which I expect a dramatic and screenwriting spectacle."

","I think Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Of course, I love all the films of the saga, but that one is my favorite. Based on the book by J.K Rowling, it is a perfect mixture of action, suspense, adventure and mystery.<br/><br/>Harry, Ron and Hermione enter the 5th year at Hogwarts, which is controlled by the Ministry of Magic, notably by Dolores Umbridge. She sets up a directorial regime and forbids students to practice defenses spells. So the three friends created ""Dumbledore's Army"" to practice defense against the forces of evil under Harry's teachings.<br/><br/>I find Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) are so great for their roles. They are so realistic. They are just perfect for their characters. Because they make you feel the emotions of the character well.<br/><br/>And the director David Yates made a very fabulous final result. The story is extremely imaginative and is, in my opinion, one of David Yates's best. The composer for the soundtrack of this film was Nicholas Hooper and he made an amazing job. When I listen to one of them, I feel so good. They are so expressive. They reflect very well the moments when they are used. They are so pretty.<br/><br/>This film was produced by David Heyman and David Barron, and I find their work extremely amazing. The costumes are absolutely awesome and fun. I think they are a big part of the extravagance and the originality of the movie. And last but not least, the special effects are so beautiful. Between the Dementors, that are so fantastic, the duel between Lord Voldemort and Dumbledore in the Ministry of Magic, the chamber of secrets, that is well done... that's so awesome to watch.<br/><br/>So honestly, I really recommend this movie! If you are a person who wants adventure, suspense and mystery, this is the film to see! You must see it.<br/><br/>Amandine"

"ThomasDrufke","8","0","3","10 November 2016"," Harry Takes on the Leadership Role
","I'm sure it's difficult for any filmmaker to adapt a beloved novel, but David Yates had an extraordinary task attempting to cut down the longest Potter novel into what happens to be, the second shortest film in the series. I didn't read the books, so I can't specifically comment on the quality of the adaptation, but I do know that Order of the Phoenix is one damn good film.<br/><br/>As much as I love the inevitable singular adventures each film in the Harry Potter series brings, I think Harry's emotional journey in each film is equally as intriguing. That journey is perhaps most drastic in Order of the Phoenix. After the horrific events at the end of Goblet of Fire, Hogwarts, its students, and the rest of the Wizarding World are at a split feeling surrounding the reemergence of Lord Voldemort. The ministry refuses to believe that that the dark lord has returned, while Harry and a select few at Hogwarts are truly preparing for what's to come.<br/><br/>Harry faces a difficult case against him at the ministry after it's revealed to them that Harry used magic in the presence of muggles. It's another truly eerie opening as the dementors nearly killed Harry and Dudley. But Dementors are only the beginning to what is probably Harry's most difficult task in the series to that point, defeating the dark lord and his ""army"" he's been recruiting.<br/><br/>We've seen plenty of great adventures from the main trio thus far, so I guess it was about time the team expands a bit. Alas, Harry starts ""Dumbledore's Army"" with the help of Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Neville, Cho, and the new cast member, Luna Lovegood among others. It's probably the first time in the series' history where Harry willingly takes on a leadership role in order to get ahead of Voldemort's plans. This all isn't taken too well from the newly appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge. Umbridge is easily one the easiest characters to hate in the series, but I can't picture anyone else bringing more to the role than Imelda Staunton did. It's a complicated character to like, but it fits in with the tone of the movie in a strangely satisfying way.<br/><br/>Another strong point in The Order of the Phoenix is the impressive set design. Unlike Goblet of Fire, we get to spend much more time at Hogwarts as well as getting a look at a few new sets outside the campus. Just simply taking a look at the gorgeous cinematography and production design of the final showdown at the Department of Mysteries. To me, it's one of the finest sequences this series has ever given us. Seeing Harry and a good portion of his team take on the Death Eaters was cool, but nothing compares to Dumbledore (and sort of Harry) take on Voldemort. That along with the death of Sirius Black leaves the series on a satisfyingly somber note.<br/><br/>It's difficult to compare this film to the others. There are aspects to the Order of the Phoenix that are great, like the climax and Harry's emotional arc, but it's hard to not feel like there's something missing from the story. You don't necessarily feel that way during the viewing, but perhaps looking back, it could have used an extra 15 minutes or so of scenes.<br/><br/>+Production design <br/><br/>+Harry's emotional arc <br/><br/>+Dumbledore vs Voldemort<br/><br/>+Harry takes on a leadership role <br/><br/>-Could be an extra 15 minutes of plot to add <br/><br/>8.8/10"
"gollumsmeagolrocks","9","0","3","6 July 2016"," A fantastic, self-contained side story
","The writer of this film is brilliant. He managed to turn what was a major problem for the story into an advantage FOR the film. The problem? Well, the bad guys (Death Eaters) are finally back to their full power and ready to strike. Therefore, there is only one logical thing for them to do at this point, which is go after Harry. But that clearly can't be the story told until the final film. How do they fix this? How do they tell another complete story without the forces of Voldemort as the villains?<br/><br/>Simple: The bad guys are the MINISTRY! <br/><br/>It's a brilliant solution! It's clear that there's nothing left the Death Eaters need to be ready to go after Harry, so that's the only story that can be told about them. But through the ministry being the villain, this plot is able to be postponed while still telling a compelling story.<br/><br/>The Ministry is filled with fear by the notion that the followers of Voldemort have returned. Their fear causes them to try and silence anyone spreading this, as they don't want to face the truth. This causes so many equally imposing obstacles Firstly, the Ministry goes out of its way to make sure that the students at Hogwarts can't be trained in magical defense and combat. This means the heroes won't be prepared when they eventually have to face Voldemort. Secondly, part of their actions is to stop anyone who attempts to build up forces or an army like the Order Of The Phoenix to fight Voldemort's army. This means that the Order can't gain enough followers or Aurors to fight the Death Eaters, as they'll get caught. Lastly, this also leads them to try to lay off anyone who believes or promotes the idea that the Dark Lord is really back. This means the people around Harry who can help him to become strong enough to face Voldemort are disappearing.<br/><br/>This is ultimately a side-story, but the presence of the enemy is still felt. The enemy was the ones who filled the once kind Ministry with such fear that it transformed into a twisted, contorted force of malcontent.<br/><br/>The only major problem I have with this film is the same problem I had with the otherwise fantastic Goblet Of Fire. The third act is a complete 180 degree shift from what the film has been up to this point. While still interesting in both instances, the climax focuses on some completely unrelated thing that doesn't close out the narrative of the film but instead goes out of its way to build up a plot thread for later. It's not as bad in The Goblet Of Fire, as at least the ending was somehow prompted by what had transpired in that film to that point. Here, the plot about the Ministry's corruption is literally abandoned completely as Harry has a vision about some unrelated problem, they take care of that, and then the film ends. <br/><br/>What? That leaves the ministry plot as a loose end that isn't wrapped up. And unlike the Goblet Of Fire, it doesn't go back and address the narrative it abandoned after the unrelated tangent, it's just never mentioned for the rest of the film as if it was never there. The film literally BECOMES a completely different film for the last 30 minutes or so. This tangent is interesting, but doesn't address or relate to anything that has happened in the film thus far, serving as a rather abrupt ending to a completely different film.<br/><br/>But outside of that, the Order Of The Phoenix still fights to keep the series alive long enough in a compelling side-story, to allow patience from the viewers for the epic final battle ahead..."
"InaneSwine","8","0","3","18 February 2016"," Expertly thought out and put together
","Unpopular amongst some viewers and readers alike, Order of the Phoenix is the most politically minded film of the series, the most down to earth, and possibly the smartest. Visual effects and wondrous magical spells - while present of course - definitely take a back seat, and the focus is shifted onto the threats of corruption, power, censorship and the media, as it is revealed that the magical government is unfortunately as crooked as our own.<br/><br/>In one of Rowling's smartest moves, her personification of everything wrong with the education system is delivered in the form of Dolores Umbridge, a character so morally bankrupt and far more threatening than Voldemort himself. Imelda Staunton is almost too good in the role, as the skin crawls and the blood boils every time she steps in front of the camera. The maturing cast continues to improve, with a breath of fresh air provided by Evanna Lynch as Luna, whose comic timing never fails to bring a smile. Also welcome back are Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson, not to mention the intensely threatening Jason Issacs and his fabulous hair.<br/><br/>Though the important themes of the movie come first, the cinematography and the visuals must be congratulated. The pace of the film is somewhat inconsistent, and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg seems to lose his grip on the material at times, which may confuse viewers who haven't read the book. And while the final battle sequence is the most intense and brilliantly shot yet, it seems over far too quickly.<br/><br/>In spite of its few drawbacks, Phoenix is so expertly thought out and put together, and is the first film of the franchise that really forces its Muggle audience to think about their own world."
"lesleyharris30","8","0","3","19 January 2016"," Entertaining, albeit Slow Moving,
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. For a fifth installment, the series is still fresh and exciting as ever, I don't feel one bit bored of these characters or watching their latest adventure. It's different from the other four in that it is a lot more dialogue based, much less action, although this isn't a huge problem as the cast is so fantastic that's it's nice to see them shine as actors in scenes that literally just involve them talking. The film is certainly anti- climactic, there's a constant build up throughout, as the characters discuss Voldemort's return, we are anxiously anticipating his arrival for the entire movie, and then once he comes, he's gone before we know it, they could have dragged out the scene much more and trimmed others to make it a more pleasing finale. Returning cast members are still as great as ever, Ralph Fiennes further develops his role as the series main villain and is as terrifying as ever, the movie also features great new characters portrayed by talented actors such as Imelda Staunton, Evanna Lynch and Helena Bonham Carter, all playing very strong female characters that steal every scene they're in. Though it may be lacking the intensity of previous installments, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is still a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. <br/><br/>A new teacher soon takes power at Hogwarts after rumours of Voldemort's return begin to spread. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe"

"vishaal811","8","0","2","28 June 2015"," A Magical Experience
","Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix was the longest novel in the entire series but the film adaptation is one of the shortest of all the Harry Potter movies. Harry, Ron and Hermione return once again along with some new characters such as Luna Lovegood, Dolores Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange. Each one of these characters is well played with the role of Umbridge being especially good. The direction is fairly decent with the magical world being replicated through extravagant sets. The filmmakers are able to extract the essence of the novel and present it without going for every little detail. This results in a taut, tight movie which is just over 2 hours long. However, the only sin that the movie has is that it feels like an abbreviated version of the novel as a result of which the movie feels extremely rushed and therefore it is not as enjoyable as reading the novel."

","Goblet I thought really took a step forward. This film sort of did, it has promise, but overall it feels like filler to build up for the later films. The first half is about a government conspiracy to shut up Harry who's talking about Voldemort returning, then it jumps to the second half about training for the battle against Voldemort like the second half of Rocky. I liked the whole idea of the government not wanting to start a panic, so they're denying the inevitable, but after it goes to training it's just training scene after training scene, the only thing we're missing is a montage.<br/><br/>It's nice to see familiar faces in this one, like Sirius Black and Molly and Arthur Weasley, seeing Harry interact with them is just nice to watch, like he has such good friends and family by his side. We get a couple new faces, most notably is Doris Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who is also a worker for the minister of magic. She's a promising villain who you just love to hate.<br/><br/>Overall, it works for the most part, if they tried to do more to make it standout then it could really work, but it's just trying to build up for the later films basically. Even though it does it well, because you become pretty invested in the cause, it needs a little bit more to keep us interested in its 2 hour 20 minute length."

","""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the fifth from 8 Harry Potter films. It is the first directed by David Yates. So far, directors switched quickly, but Yates continued and returned to the franchise for films 6, 7 and 8. The screenplay comes not from the guy who made it all the other movies based on Rowling's novels, but from the writer of ""Peter Pan"", Michael Goldenberg. This is one of 2 (I believe) Harry Potter films that did not score a single Academy Award nomination and were ""only"" honored by BAFTA.<br/><br/>The film starts with Potter being put on trial and Dumbledore acting somewhat as his lawyer. Apart from that, this film was pretty interesting because of the introduction of several new relevant female characters. These would be Luna Lovegood, Nymphadora, Dolores Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange. Personally, I always found Lovegood the most interesting and best choice for Potter in contrast to that Asian chick and Ron's sister. Umbridge is probably my favorite villain in the franchise. She is just so downright evil and all that seemingly nice pink fluffiness surrounding her adds a lot to her creepiness. Admittedly, I found Potter also a bit provoking her initially during their first lesson, but that does not make her less evil and can be seen as a justification for her torturing methods. The only stereotypical thing was how Maggie Smith's character was written and the way she portrayed her dislike towards Staunton's character on at least two occasions. By the way Umbridge reminded me a bit of the evil queen from ""Alice in Wonderland"" (Bonham Carter's approach), but maybe that is just me.<br/><br/>One of the most entertaining parts for me (and probably most other lovers of cinema) were the King Kong re-enactments including Umbridge and Hermione. The fight between Dumbledore (water) and ""he who must not be named"" (fire) was also one of the highlights. As was the fate of Oldman's character, even if he was not featured as much in this film as before. Apart from that, I also liked the music sequences that reminded me of ""Les Misérables"". ""Order of the Phoenix"" was the fifth most successful film at the box office for 2007 and I definitely recommend watching it, especially for Imelda Staunton's magnificent character. Also, I liked that it was not as Potter-centered and putting the focus on him as the huge hero as it was the case in previous films."
"msloane1","10","0","2","9 January 2015"," Harry Potter's Order Achieves an Outstanding O.W.L.
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a fantastic movie and the most entertaining movie in the Harry Potter series. David Yates manages to pull off the impossible in staying true to the spirit of the book while also giving the movie a personality of its own. Overall I consider this movie to be very faithful to the book even though it may not include everything. My only complaint is the omission of the traitor Marietta Edgecombe. Cho Chang should have been omitted from the film, not given Marietta's role. The pacing of this movie is wonderful and two hours just seem to blow by because of how caught up you get in this movie as a viewer. Although I like the book, the movie is better. This is largely because the movie moves at a much better pace because unneeded details such as about housecleaning are omitted. And some of the changes they made for the movie work quite well. Some viewers were disappointed that the meeting with Neville at St Mungo's was omitted. Apparently this was because the filmmakers did not wish to pay to build a set for the hospital that would not get much use. What they did worked quite well. Having Neville quietly tell Harry about his parents both allowed for more sense of a Harry-Neville friendship in the movie and Neville's uncomfortableness regarding the topic is retained when he says ""I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet."" Apart from omitting Marietta I'm quite pleased with the book to movie transition. The movie keeps itself going while being true to the spirit of the book. The acting and casting are splendid. I especially love Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. Her portrayal of Luna is so picture perfect and so awesome that this movie would be worth watching just for that. David Heyman had said that other girls they auditioned could play Luna but that Evanna WAS Luna. This really shows on screen. Ralph Fiennes continued his mastery of Voldemort and Jason Issacs depiction of Lucius was delicious. We have two ruthless cahracters whose true colors show through in their performances and the feeling of danger they present is real. And of course Bellitrix Lestrange passion is awesome captured by Helena Bonham Carter. She really delivers on the madness of the character. We all know how great Daniel and Emma had become in their roles by this stage. Daniel and Emma got better and better with each film in the series and by this point they've totally mastered both the skill of acting and portraying their characters. And even Gambon has improved in his role as Dumbledore. I also like that Harry and Luna are on friendlier terms earlier in the movie than in the book as is evidenced by the forest scene. I always saw a bond between Harry and Luna as a natural so I liked that the filmmakers put some emphasis on that. I can feel the bond between Harry and Luna through the screen. Nicholas Hooper's score is very good albeit not on John Williams classic level. The special effects and visuals are outstanding and the overall production quality is a wonder to behold. The duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort was epic and awestricking. Perfectly shot, perfectly paced, perfectly acted. And I like the progression of darker color schemes as the series progresses as it fits in with the darker tone the stories take. And the filmmakers had a good feel for what fit. The ending shot where the Department of Mysteries Six, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Luna are all walking to the carriages together was a perfect example of this. This movie should only be viewed by people in middle school or older. Though less graphic than in the book, the Umbridge punishments scenes are still an issue. Harry's dream scenes and flashback scenes would be too intense for elementary school children. And although the movie depicts Sirius's death as less emotional than Cedric's death in Goblet of Fire, Sirius is a known favorite of many fans. Overall Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an awesome movie! Faithfulness to the book: 9 out of 10. Casting and acting: 11 out of 10. (Bonus point for Luna.) Pacing: 10 out of 10. Music: 8 out of 10. Special effects and visuals: 10 out of 10. Overall: 10 out of 10. Loved it! :)"

","After witnessing Cedric Diggory's death, Harry Potter is worried that things could get worse.As they arrive at Hogwarts they find out that Dolores Umbridge is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She gives false information such as denying Lord Voldemort's return. When Harry tries to say that Voldemort has returned, she gives him detention and makes him write ""I must not tell lies"" repeatedly. She gives him a quill that engraves the words into his left hand. She later sacks Professor Trelawney and tries to banish her, but is stopped by Professor Dumbledore, who tells Professor McGonagall to escort Trelawney back inside. When Umbridge begins to argue about his actions, Dumbledore tells her that she has the right to sack teachers but she can't banish them from the grounds. At the same time, Dumbledore distances himself from Harry, knowing that Harry's mind is connected to Voldemort and can see visions of Voldemort when he gets a big emotionally charge such as happiness or anger.And a lot od different things happinig in harry's life to the end of the history."
"Tyson14","8","0","1","17 August 2014"," A great adaptation but I expected more
","I think that when you take the longest Harry Potter book and turn it into the shortest Harry Potter film, that a large number of complaints by fans as to what has been cut will be inevitable after they watch ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" Not that this means that the legions of fans will be bitterly disappointed by the film version, but rather that there will be regrets over not getting to see favourite scenes on the screen. For example, Quidditch is completely out of the film, denying Ron of his best moments in the sun (start singing ""Weasley is our king""). So do not be surprised when your mind keeps shifting to what has been cut and distracting you from time to time while watching this summer's latest blockbuster.<br/><br/>When last we left our hero, Harry fell victim to a trap to bring back Lord Voldermort, which cost Cedric Diggory his life. The Ministry of Magic wants things hushed up, but Dumbledore tells the students at Hogwarts that Diggory was murdered and Lord Voldermort murdered him. As this fifth film opens Harry and his wicked cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors. Harry uses his wand to defend them and is summarily expelled from Hogwarts for using magic in front of a muggle. The good news is that Harry gets reinstated, but the bad news is that the Ministry of Magic uses the opportunity to appoint Dolores Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary at the Ministry, as the school's new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. However, Umbridge teaches only the theory and not the practise because she insists Harry is a liar and there is nothing the students need to learn to defend themselves from. Then things get progressively worse.<br/><br/>""The Order of the Phoenix"" was the most maddening book to read, not because it was the longest, but because I detest Dolores Umbridge. As far as I am concerned she makes Voldermort look good, because he knows he is evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty inside, while Umbridge thinks the ends justify the means. She is puritanical, sadistic and hypocritical. If there were not going to be children reading this review I would tell you what I really think of her. Suffice it to say, she makes me sick and I do not even take pleasure in loving to hate her, which is why my only requirement going into the film is that the Weasley Twins get their moment of glory when they become the disloyal opposition to the new order at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe continues to have the tote the heavy load in these films as Harry, with Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley being reduced more and more often to reaction shots while Emma Watson's Hermione Granger remains the Mistress of Exposition in these films. Alan Rickman as Snape remains pitch perfect casting and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is also a joy to watch, but I discovered in this film that I really like Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore, mainly because he always plays up the character's intelligence and I find I prefer his interpretation to that of the late Richard Harris, forgive my heresy. Imelda Staunton does not look as much like a toad as Umbridge does in the book, but she captures the character's detestability from start to finish. We are always painfully aware how dangerous she is, whether she smiles or not. Also, Evanna Lynch steals more scenes as Luna Lovegood than Katie Leung does as Cho Chang, and it is certainly interesting to see Neville (Matthew Lewis) towering over everybody, with Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) in the silent but strong role for the pivotal sextet.<br/><br/>After seeing this film I raced home and got out my copy of the book and starting cataloguing things that had been cut. Such comparisons are, as I suggested up top, inevitable for anyone who has read the book. At this point what I missed the most were some of the conversations between Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Umbridge where Minerva verbally flaws the Inquisitor. The omission that I am focusing on the most is the whole bit about why Neville's family was a target of Voldermort (I agree with Harry: always say his name and thereby reduce its power), since that suggests implications for what will happen in the final book, which gets released in just ten more days. I also would have liked to have seen an over reaction to Harry discovering his father bullied Snape at Hogwarts. My favourite part ends up being the impressive wizard's duel between Voldermort and Dumbledore. Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg does a good job of whittling down Rowling's book and director David Yates does a competent job, but fans will simply want more. Also, we know what happens in the next book and all of the bad things that happen in this film cannot help but seem inconsequential in comparison. Plus, fans will be distracted by mining this film for clues as to what will happen in the last book."

"thesar-2","8","0","1","3 March 2013"," The Phoenix has Risen Indeed
","I would begin my review of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix with the statement I've made before: A return to greatness, but sadly, the series, to date, has never been even close to this level of quality.<br/><br/>True. And it's one of the biggest sequel-improvements of all time. Where Goblet of Fire (#4) was almost an entire waste of filmmaking, Order of the Phoenix (#5) leapt countless bounds past it and wasn't just a great Harry Potter chapter, but a fantastic film on its own merit.<br/><br/>Let's see, when have I felt this way before during a series? Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1/5 Stars) to the follow-up: Halloween: H20 (4½/5 Stars.) But, to be closer to home, or from a Part IV to V we have: Batman & Robin (1/5 Stars) to Batman Begins (4/5 Stars) or Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1/5 Stars) to Superman Returns (4/5 Stars.)<br/><br/>Order of the Phoenix was a fantastic ride, filled with very good special effects, funny lines, the most beautiful cinematography since Prisoner of Azkaban (#3,) a (much needed) tight, well paced and crisp story with the most depth given in the most realistic way to the characters, a incredible story of good vs. evil, friendship and connection and had the best, the most exciting and suspenseful climatic finales of the series. In fact, if it had ended here, aside from the obvious doors left open, I would've been okay with that.<br/><br/>BUT above all that, the fifth Harry Potter movie FINALLY contained direction, intensity, passion, a clear vision and lacked all the randomness that was thrown into the previous four installments. My main complaint, so far, was the chaotic and haphazard scenes that did not further the stories and were blatantly obvious scenes from the books to only appease that one demographic (the book-club fan) and not a new-comer like me. I have felt the series, leading up to and including number four, had been irresponsible in the sense they chose to be narrow-minded and forgo the art of making a movie to stand on its own two legs. Order of the Phoenix, didn't just have that; it had wings.<br/><br/>I digress, Harry uses his powers in front of a non-wizard in order to save him setting off a chain of events leading up to the over-powering and blind Ministry to slowly, but surely, take control of the school. In real life, this would be called: the TSA.<br/><br/>The most obvious of bad people, Miss Pink, is inadvertently causing Harry and his (this time) extended gang of friends to fight for themselves, literally, because The No-Nose, Man in Black is back.<br/><br/>I wouldn't just recommend this movie to Harry Potter fans. I wouldn't just recommend this to normal Muggles. I would simply tell people to skip the first four and begin the series here. I'm almost joking.<br/><br/>For the first time, from what I recall, the use of flashbacks and background events from the first chapters were shown. Gather what you need to put the pieces of the past together and save your time as this, the – THANK YOU! – shortest of all Harry Potter movies, is the tightest and best paced of all of the films.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I had a ball here. It's the kind of story I want to see, the depth of characters, namely Harry Potter himself (FINALLY), that I want to enjoy and it's an adventure with heart that made me care for those on the screen. This is the first time I have said this about a Harry Potter feature: I can't wait to see this one again.<br/><br/>(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)"

","By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.<br/><br/>A trenchant commentary on the failings of the British educational system, the British press and the dystopian future that awaits us all, with a clear nod to George Orwell. (Well not so much a nod as a total reworking of 1984 with extra Harry Potter and Hogwarts).<br/><br/>New thesps introduced in this episode include Helena Bonham Carter playing herself and Imelda Staunton channelling Margaret Thatcher. Staunton is particularly good as the hate figure appointed to run Hogwarts along Ministry lines and for whom the audience expends its mental energy on looking forward to her comeuppance.<br/><br/>Another good entry into the series and it really does manage to get in some social commentary about the press, health and safety gone mad and Big Brother. It's nice to see Harry, Ron and Hermione now starting to take much more responsibility and teaching skills to the other students. It's a bit of a mystery why parts of London and the Ministry look as though they are back in Victorian times and why the nearest village to Hogwarts is still set in medieval times but I'll let that pass.<br/><br/>I know I should be re-educated by the thought police but for me the highlight of this film has to be Fiona Shaw's legs"

You can not successfully make a book into a movie that is that long if you do you wind up with this where the movie leaves so much out of the book thats its almost a complete failure. Though Im sure if you never read the books this would be a fine movie but after reading the books these movies just seem more and more rushed.<br/><br/>This movies takes place after their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>This was a decent movie and the acting and special effects are getting so much better but its just so disappointing to see some of my favorite series of book be rushed like this. And I understand its hard to do so each movie would have to be 5 hours to be a decent replecation of the book and that can not be done.

"Bruce722","9","0","2","3 June 2012"," Would've been perfect if not for one error:
","This was easily the best movie of the set to this point. They changed a lot from the book but almost all of them worked well in the scope of the film. The acting was the best it's been yet, the plot developed really well, and the darker cinematic vibe was perfect for how Harry was feeling throughout the book. Honestly, there was really only one negative and it's something they changed from the book so if you haven't read it you might not mind at all. As I said before, ""almost all"" of the changes worked well. This particular change, however, is being looking over. In my opinion, the most intensely emotional and dramatic sequence in all of the first five books happens in Dumbledore's office after they all returned from the Ministry of Magic. In that moment, the emotions of what took place at the ministry almost literally pour out of the pages. The director felt, I suppose, that this gut wrenching portion of the book was sufficiently covered in a mere 30 seconds of filming where Harry and Dumbledore barely scratch the surface of what occurred in the actual book. I think this scene should've met the book completely. Only then could they have done it justice. Without that flaw, however, the movie would've been darn near perfect. I hope the movies continue to get better and better."

This book was the longest, which makes it incredible that Yates squashed this down into the shortest of the film adaptations. It does not feel squashed together though, Yates understands our need for a good pace and that is what he incorporates into his filmmaking here. His direction is not as fragmented and uneven as Newell's and he does everything Newell tried to do in The Goblet of Fire, which is getting down the emotions of the characters while telling his fictional fantasy tale.

When Ron and Hermione notice those scars, they were outraged and suggests that he should to go to Dumbledore; but Harry refuses.

But there is better satire in this and it's not dull to sit through. I don't know if it's because of the passing of time, but the cinematography is getting a lot better and so is the acting. Not amazing acting but much better this time around. But most of all the franchise seems to becoming darker. What I also liked was how there is more wizards and witch battles this time around which lacked in the previous novels. And it's good to see that Harry is growing up and using magic to fight while teaching others to do the same and even getting a girl. The choices come in to play big time with characters that are good and characters that are presented bad or some even in the middle is starting to make important choices that can change there original characteristics and direction. Again the book is long and it's kinda disappointing how short the movie is, in fact it has the shortest running time in the franchise. Even thought he book is really long, it just seemed to be missing a lot from it. I know it's not possible to fit everything from the book into one movie, but could have fit a lot more.

","Before I watched this movie, I especially liked Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but when I saw Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I realized that it is the best movie adaption of the series, certainly! Yes, I agree that many elements from the book are not shown in the film, but still, the filmmakers have been able to make this a wonderful movie. I liked this movie very much, firstly because of it's wonderful musical effects, and secondly because of the adaption, and thirdly, because of the casting. You know, casting is an important element of a film. If the cast is good, then the film is good, and if the cast is bad, then the film is bad! Daniel, Emma and Rupert give, as general, excellent performances, as do Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Bonnie Wright and others. I would also like to praise the new actors and actresses of the series, for example, Evanna Lynch, Helena Bonham Carter and others.<br/><br/>In the role of villains, I think, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix and Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy are the best.<br/><br/>The film is full of adventure.

","The previous movie was slightly depressing I'd say. It was very well done as I said in the review, however it was sort of dramatic and ended without much of a high note. However, this movie continued the story and ends up with a high note, to me. It's obvious the story has yet to finish, however seeing the characters become more aware of this, and interact with the plot more, is what makes this movie a bit better than the previous.<br/><br/>The special effects yet again totally outdo the previous movies. The plot is interesting, as it seems to integrate politics a bit. Basically, people are scared to accept the fact that a feared badguy it out there, ready to get them. So instead of facing their fear, they decide to become sort of a badguy themselves, by restricting everyone and being really cruel. It isn't until the end of this movie that things end up intense. Unfortunately some deaths occur (as with the previous one) but this one looks on a more positive note.<br/><br/>Rated 8/10"

But the comments and reviews for ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007) are generally so off-the-mark that a few supplemental comments could be of value. And hopefully my comments gain useful perspective from the distance of a few years since the release.<br/><br/>As has already been said this chapter of the story is a relatively small-scale one. The Ministry of Magic is worried that Hogwarts presents a security risk, and so it plants a mole (Dolores Umbridge - slickly played by Imelda Staunton) to discredit Dumbledore and to prevent him from training students to defend themselves against the dark arts. The Ministry is in denial about the return of ""he who must not be named"" (i.e. Lord Voldemort is back and preparing for an attack).<br/><br/>Personally ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is my favorite of all the films up to now. I have a lot of reasons. For one, while the three principle actors by 2007 had begun to look a bit too old for their characters (Rupert Grint especially so), the disparity is not so great that a lot of energy must be expended suspending disbelief; as is the case with the later films. And Daniel Radcliffe uses his maturity as a actor to bring a sophisticated internal life to Harry; something he could not quite manage in the earlier films. Another reason is that it represents the midway point of the overall story and therefore strikes the best balance between serious elements and elements of whimsy. And things stay fresh with the introduction of new characters like Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helen Bonham Carter) who fit the film's dark/light balance by being evil characters who are amusingly overplayed.<br/><br/>But I suspect that the biggest reason I favor this particular film is that it does not flinch from the book's theme of existential despair. And they economically pull this off through the inspired casting of Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, my all-time favorite Potter character. Harry suffers a lot inside, which is one of the things that makes him different from the other students at Hogwarts, most of whom tend to avoid him. And he in turn tends to isolate himself, even from his close friends Ron and Hermione. The film version of Luna is the only friend who really gets Harry and he is energized by their interactions. ""The things we lose have a way of coming back to us, even if it is not always in a way that we expect"".<br/><br/>Rowling and others have pointed out that Luna is Hermione's alter ego; an illogical and impulsive counterpart to Hermione's analytical realist. Both process more information than their fellow students, but Hermione has filters to define and dispense with the information. Luna is less judgmental, for her processing is experiencing.<br/><br/>While these comparisons help define Herminone, Luna herself is important because of her similarity to Harry. The subtle similarities regularly amaze him and they allow her to repeatedly demonstrate to him that he is not alone. She is his bridge to everyone else in a story where he must subordinate his desire to go it alone if he hopes to successfully engage the forces of the Dark Lord. The film was especially focused on illustrating this special quality of their relationship.<br/><br/>Overall, what has most amazed me about the whole Harry Potter series is the evidence that Rowling had the entire story pretty much outlined in detail at the beginning and engaged in considerable foreshadowing; something you do not appreciate with the first reading of each book. The ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" adaptation provides an interesting example of how this foreshadowing can be done visually. Ginny Weasley is destined to become Harry's love interest but up until this point it has been mostly a little sister / big brother type relationship (Bonnie Wright was only 10 when featured in ""Chamber of Secrets""). In ""Order of the Phoenix"" Harry is still preoccupied with Cho Chang (Katie Leung who looks considerably older than Wright). What to watch for are the scenes in which the Harry - Cho relationship progresses; each time the editor goes out on a static shot of a grim Ginny observing their interaction.<br/><br/>The two-disc special edition DVD does not include an extended version of the film. Instead the second disc includes a number of special features. ""Trailing Tonks"", a tour of the film sets hosted by offbeat Natalia Tena is especially good. There are also a number of humorous deleted scenes of Emma Thompson portraying Professor Trelawney, scenes that do not fit the tone of the film but are amusing on their own.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","It's blistering. Harry is overcast with lonesomeness, bullied by his abusive cousin Dudley, also in the testosterone throes of puberty. And this is when Dementors attack, those hellish soul-eaters, the terror keepers of the wizard prison. What they're doing here is unknown at present, but that's what makes it especially tense. Newbie director David Yates' refusal to go easy on his audience, regardless of age, is evident right away. There's magic here, but there's nothing saccharine or bright about it. This is magic as power, as an illustration of familiar human urges both dignified and horrendous, as something as real, bleak and patent as the tattered, graffiti-scribbled pedestrian tunnel, severely lit in gray-green, in which the Dementors assail.<br/><br/>This fifth installment in Harry's imaginative and budding chronicles perfectly amalgamates the nimble humor and frivolous charm of the first two films and the cockeyed growing pains of the brilliant third and troubled fourth. Unlike so many fantasy stories, each episode provides new perspective, as here when Harry familiarizes Weasley with the experience of riding the London Underground, upturning the awe you'd expect from a Harry Potter movie: The wizard folks in awe of such commonplace phenomenon as we Muggles undervalue. Indeed, this wholly achieved world seems newly fertile and vivid: The wizard newspaper all of a sudden gives the impression of Minority Report's dynamic newspapers. Maybe highly developed magic is more or less interchangeable with technology.<br/><br/>As opposed to The Goblet of Fire, the hormone-racing gravity being introduced in The Order of the Phoenix to the once very light-hearted saga is smartly balanced, not relying so heavily on whose dates are successful, whose crushes are requited, rock bands, dances, and instead looking to the rebellious impulses of our largely anti-authoritarian, autonomy-seeking teen years. Instead of a focus on mawkish romantic tropes, there is a sense of hormonal aggression. In the climactic sequence, the use of magic wands practically resembles a stand-off with guns a la the video games and action films teenage boys grow attached to at the age of the characters.<br/><br/>In addition, a Roald Dahl-style new touch pops into the magical assembly of eccentrics, Imelda Staunton's scene-stealing Delores Umbridge, a fully engrossing character whose only flaw is her way too on-the-nose name. She seizes more than a small amount of interest as the conniving schoolmarm in blush-shade attire and weird feline fixation, as voodoo is paradoxically reimagined as genuinely shocking pink. She's a new teacher who brings a tyrannical say-so to the esteemed classrooms and hallways of Hogwarts, as she coaxes her way to despotism. It's a pitch-perfect concept for this particular stage in the saga of Rowling's maturing character, and neither Staunton, Yates or screenwriter Michael Goldenberg make any missteps in bringing her to the screen.<br/><br/>Rather than placating and patronizing the sensibilities of teens in a Twilight-oriented manner, Order of the Phoenix speaks to the defensive rising of the teenage attitude. Hogwarts is under relentless bombardment by the venal, undemocratic Ministry of Magic. Miss Umbridge is persecuting him and wreaking fault on him. He and Dumbledore are objects of a propaganda crusade. Harry's ""love"" interest is found to be less than loyal. He's wracked by shame and perception of pending peril. Harry is one estranged wizard.<br/><br/>On the face of it, it may appear Yates, already an old hand at British television, is simply meant to continue the franchise in a practiced but not unique way. No, Yates brings a new visualization to the series and gives it pulsating vivacity that was sadly lacking in Goblet of Fire. He is a clever, elegant stylist. He is cinematically practiced, and character is a main concern for him. He uses black in a way very keenly attuned to the coming of age not only of the characters but their fans. In most fashionable modern movies, CGI grows unnecessary and mercenary almost as soon as it appears. However, Yates uses special effects as an internal part of the magicians' real world. The effects never engulf or overpower character. They're exceptional, largely because they unite with characterization and Mark Day's supremely artistic editing. Like Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban, it does not reinvent the wheel. It just keeps it ever spinning."
"neil-476","8","0","1","19 December 2010"," Darkening but enjoyable
","Things were dark in the HP universe for Harry right from the start: now they are starting to get darker for everyone else, too. Unfortunately the Minstry of Magic has ostrich syndrome and chooses to manifest this by installing the petty-minded bullying bureaucrat Dolores Umbrage in charge at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton's pitch-perfect portrayal of the odious Umbrage is one of the highlights of this movie (joined by Gary Olman's Sirius and Evanna Lynch's delightfully delirious Luna), although (as usual) all the support cast is excellent.<br/><br/>The film works as a coherent narrative telling its own story and carrying on the larger narrative (unlike its successor). And the climactic battle at the Ministry succeeds dramatically, visually and emotionally.<br/><br/>This is one of the better films in the series."

","Yes I know the books are not scripts, and all movies have to trim content to keep them from being too long, or because some director wants to ""improve"" them. In Order of the Phoenix the thing I noticed is that Luna Lovegood was not barefoot, due to the theft of her shoes, except for one scene in the woods with Harry. She should have been unshod for pretty much the whole story. This avoided several small sub-plots so perhaps that's why they did it. I also would have appreciated less low speaking, and more enunciation. Lots of the dialog is difficult to make out. And of course while integral to the feel of the story, would it have killed them to lighten up the exposure a bit? Difficult to make out the dark clothed kids against the dark shadowed background!"

","OK, Harry and the Order of the Phoenix blowing the International Statute of Secrecy while flying level with the boat and under a bridge in plain Muggle sights really put me off but seems like David Yates heard my thoughts and instantly vowed to make the rest of this movie a memorable one. And boy did he succeed! Hats of to 1)Daniel Radcliffe 2)Rupert Grint and 3)The girl who makes the most ingenious metaphor or simile look stupid in front of her radiant beauty, Emma Watson, this is what I always do but I don't know why this time they pulled out all plugs and gave really superb performances.<br/><br/>The cast is too big in both size and talent to be praised individually so here's a joint hats off to all of 'em. Go for this darkest movie in the Harry Potter franchise yet and you won't regret it."
"Sanou_san","9","0","1","7 December 2009"," Excitingly newer than that its predecessors
","Funny to tell that I've first reviewed Half-Blood Prince than this one. Order of The Phoenix, as it is generally regarded as the thickest book of J.K. Rowling had much to be shown on scree. I've even thought before it came that probably Goblet of Fire has more twists and story. Equally however Order of the Phoenix simply stood than the latter because of its more enthralling and bewildering revelations. The filmmakers did well honestly with the book. But of course there is this clause that ""Everything in the book aren't entirely visualized in a motion picture"". But this what made the consecutive Harry Potter film solid in the film industry. Order of the Phoenix has to be a fatty revelation. The latter books of course would be considered to be ""fattier"". As a distinguishing but similarly striking quality of the film, Order of the Phoenix possessed this darkish aura which I felt evidently since the Prisoner of Azkaban. The third film was my favorite and seeing this fifth installment gave me new excitement and merited expectations on how J.K. Rowling's remarkable creations materialized on screen. I loved the film's dark air which complemented well how the story progressed. The duel scene at the near end was also spectacular. Since I saw Harry's first encounter with Voldermort, slew a Basilisk, fought Dementors, join the Triwizard tournament and now created an army of his own to fight alongside Dumbledores loyal supporters. Likewise the characters of the film are understandable and the actors playing them are reasonable how they acted their character well. One more thing lovable about the film is you see the characters alongside the actors to grew together. I've felt this evidently since The Godfather. A success to David Yates guiding the accomplishment of this fifth film."
"freemantle_uk","9","0","1","29 November 2009"," Exciting Potter Advantage
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of the best Harry Potter films, a very close second to The Prisoner of Azkaban. Here is an exciting fantasy film, with the darker elements of Harry Potter being brought to the screen, and has additional character depth.<br/><br/>Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) had raised once again and he starts recruiting his forces. He is able to send Dementors to attack Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling), where Harry is forced to use the Patronus Charm. The Ministry of Magic expel Harry from Hogwarts and an enquiry is launched. Harry discovers that the Minster for Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) denies that Voldemort has risen, fearing the backlash and started a media campaign against Harry and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). After Harry is saved by Dumbledore, Fudge sends his loyal employee Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to serve as Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. The aim is to undermine Dumbledore, and spread Ministry Propaganda. She is a horrible woman, sickly sweet on the outside, but has no problem torturing students and harbours 'racist' thoughts about non-humans, like centaurs. The ministry aims to avoid teaching practical magic, so Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) form their own class to teach students, calling it Dumbledore's Army. Harry shows that he is a good teacher. The classes also gives Harry a chance to get close to the lovely Cho Chang (Katie Leung); but both still suffer from guilt of the death of Cedric Diggory. Harry also suffers nightmares and imagines involving Voldemort. He is aware Voldemort wants something from the Ministry and wants to stop him. Snape (Alan Rickman) tries to teach Harry have to block the imagines.<br/><br/>After Mike Newell left the director's chair, a number of directors were approached, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Michael Vaughen and Mira Nair. In the end David Yates was picked to direct, a man who proved himself on British television, and has a nack for the darker elements of life. He ends up being a good fit for the series, showing a good hand with the special effects, brought in his own vision style (e.g. the newspapers), kept the film well paced, had an exciting eye for wizarding battles and shown to be good at casting. This was a very dark film, with deeper themes about politics, the media, and the psychology of grief and isolation. He is one of the best directors the Potter series had and he is the man who is going to finish the series. As well as the main cast returning showing their talent, there are new additions. Imelda Staunton was good as sickly Umbridge, and Evanna Lynch shows she is a promising young actress. Helena Botham Carter was perfect casting as the psychotic Bellatrix Lestrange; she is one of my favourite actresses. Gary Oldman is given a lot to do and shows why he is one of the best actors around. Radcliffe brings out the fact Harry becomes an angry and isolated teenager, wanting to fight but unable to do much about it. Ralph Fiennes does not have much screen time, but still shows what a great villain he is. He plays Voldemort also like the Emperor from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.<br/><br/>This is the only Potter film that was not written by screenwriter Steve Kloves. Michael Goldenberg is given the tough task of adapting the longest Harry Potter books, and one of the most entertaining into a film. He does it and somehow with David Yates makes the shortest Potter film. He is forced to cut subplots like the Quidditch matches and the scene at St. Mungo's Hospital, but the key plot reminds and he keeps the dark tone of the film. Out of all the Potter films this is the most serious (and I like that). I do however criticise the changes to the Harry and Cho relationship, I would have liked to have seen more of that.<br/><br/>Very enjoyable fantasy."
"bealanna","10","0","1","25 November 2009"," On second thought...
","Actually, I only registered to give my first voting ever. I just finished watching this movie (and reading the book) for the second time and I am very impressed. I am an avid book reader and among the fiction books I've read all of the Harry Potter books. The first time I saw the movie I was bothered by the changes they made to adapt the book to the screen - but this time around, a couple of years later, I noticed what great work the screen writer did! Even though certain events happen at different times or they made slight changes to the plot, it catches the atmosphere and every vital part of the story (and still fits it into 2 1/2 hours). I guess the time brought the wisdom and I was open to the movie without constantly thinking what happened in the book in the exact time. Let's be honest, why watch a movie which is basically the book acted out - every line, every movement... It would be like listening to a professor who tells everything word by word that is written in the textbook which, by the way, you have already read. Besides, the cinematography is excellent as well as the music, the camera movement, the actors (I would have loved to see Miss McGonagall more often)... I thought I am not going to write this but I don't seem to be able to keep my mouth shut: This is a awesome and a very good quality movie (the best in the series so far) which is far above certain other, totally over-hyped movies that occupy the screens right now (that is no dig at the people watching those or the fuss everybody makes about it - it is about the lack of quality). <br/><br/>Summarizing, if you can get beyond the constant comparison to the book and just open yourself up for this screen adaption you'll be drawn into a wonderful fantasy world (thanks due the cinematography, music, camera work, animation,...) and have a great movie experience."
"vanilla_panda12","9","0","1","25 November 2009"," Stupified Me!
","I want to start out by saying that for every person that likes something, there are going to be 3 people that hate it. That is very much the case on IMDb, as it is also in the world. There are many negative reviews on this movie, going on about how so many things were cut out and out of order and blah blah blah... I, being a HUGE fan of the books, approached this film with an open mind. I knew things would be cut. I knew it wouldn't be exactly like the book (because if it was, the movie'd be 5 hours long). So I looked at it honestly, and it was really good.<br/><br/>I have had very high expectations for the movies so far, and most of them, I thought, were pretty good. The first and second were charming, the third was great and getting darker, the fourth was good except for its terrible climax(so HIGHLY dramatic! Voldemort was seriously prancing around like a ballerina!), and I was really looking forward to the fifth. With a new director comes a new way of interpreting J.K. Rowling's brilliant series, and David Yates did not disappoint.<br/><br/>In Order of the Phoenix, Voldemort has returned, but the only living witness (who isn't a death eater or Voldemort) is Harry Potter. Dumbledore and his friends believe this, but the rest of the world is in doubt, especially the minister of magic, Cornelius Fudge, who is so scared of the possibility this might be true that he's convinced himself that Dumbledore is trying to form a secret army against him. In response to this, the ministry sends a seemingly sweet woman named Dolores Umbridge (who works for the ministry) to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Sickeningly sweet (as shown by how much sugar she puts in her tea) and evil, she punishes anyone who says Voldemort is back (and severely). Because of this notion that Dumbledore is making up an army of students against the ministry, Umbridge won't teach the students in her classes how to do spells, so as to make a ""safe, risk free environment"". Harry's friends then convince him to start a secret club where he can help students learn practical Defense Against the Dark Arts to prepare themselves for the wizard war that lies ahead. Meanwhile, Voldemort is in search of a ""weapon"" that he needs to reach his goal of wizarding world conquest, and Harry's having very strange dreams about a mysterious hallway...<br/><br/>Now that that's out of the way, I'll talk about the acting, and wow, was it good. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic as Harry. He's really developed into a great actor and showed a lot of emotional range in this one. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson portray their characters great too - Emma's really grown up and Rupert's not just comic relief anymore. Evanna Lynch (who plays Luna Lovegood) is fantastic and is absolutely perfect for the role - strange, wise and mystic. Imelda Staunton was a perfect Umbridge - she made us love to hate her, and especially to hate her pink cardigans. Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy was fantastic - he really gave me the shivers, as did Ralph Fiennes who was a truly terrifying Voldemort. Michael Gambon was great in this one as Dumbledore - his way of portraying Dumbledore was just right for this one. As always, Alan Rickman continues to be a perfect Snape, and Gary Oldman as Sirius was fantastic too. Helena Bonham Carter proved to be a great Bellatrix Lestrange - wild, insane, and scary. For the cast, I give the cast a 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>The story was a bit distorted at times, and some things were left out, but overall I really enjoyed it. The climax was changed quite a bit, but in a way, almost for the better. It's strange that the longest book turned out to be the shortest movie, and I think they could have afforded to keep some of the scenes from the book. I was a bit disappointed that none of the Quiddich scenes were included in the film and that we saw Drako Malfoy so little. I found that some parts were a bit unclear, especially to people who haven't read the books. The script strayed a bit from the story, but they kept all the important things. I'd give the script a 7.5 out of ten.<br/><br/>The sets were amazing, especially the ministry of magic sets. 10 out of 10. The effects were superb. I couldn't believe that everything in the prophecy room was CG! Everything looked real and amazing, especially *spoiler* the battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore - it was done beautifully and was epic. 10 out of 10 for effects. The music wasn't as good as the other films, but gave more of a sense that things were getting darker and that it was the real world, so music gets an 8 out of 10. Cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Overall, I definitely think that OOTP is worth seeing. With a stunning cast, amazing effects, and everything else, this was a really great, entertaining movie. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! 9 out of ten, just because I wish they'd included the Quiddich scenes."

","I enjoyed this much more than the last film. I have read the books and as ever I would have done things a bit differently but this is a good movie for anyone who is a Harry Potter fan.<br/><br/>The usual suspects return to Hogwarts for their 5th year to continue their schooling but this time the film concentrates far less on this. Harry and his friends once again battle against Lord Voldermort producing fight scenes which lived up to my expectations, with the final fight a spectacular battle. <br/><br/>I love the way Rowling wrote these novels with each one becoming less of a children's book to keep in line with her readers as they became older and this has been reflected well in the movies.<br/><br/>If your a Potter fan you will have already seen this and I hope like myself you enjoyed it. If your not a Potter fan, why not?"

THe Goblet of Fire and The Prisoner of Azkaban were amazing films. THe day I left for Europe, the fifth film was released and I couldn't see it. I had high hopes for the fifth installment. Many weeks later I saw it. I was a little disappointed. The fifth book was the best book. The fifth film wasn't the best. It wasn't exactly the worst either, it was the Potter film that was in between. THe problem with it was that Umbridge lady. She was so evil...she was like Dick Cheney. She was even more evil than some of the other witches in the film. All she was was some British woman walking around wearing pink. The other problem was that Harry (the usually good Daniel Radcliffe) just walked around the school getting into arguments with people. I don't think I saw him smile once throughout the entire film, no exaggeration. I liked it the least for a long time. Then recently,before I saw The brilliant Half-Blood Prince again, I thought I'd watch them in order. Then I saw Order of the Phoenix again and was more impressed by it than ever.

"ametaphysicalshark","Null","0","1","15 July 2009"," Succeeds as a film adaptation with both dazzling visuals and (finally) good storytelling
","The actual events in ""The Order of the Phoenix"" are generally speaking outside of the explosive finale, the least interesting of those in any of the bigger Potter books (3-7), but the film version stands as, a week or so away from the release of the sixth film in the series, the best Potter film to date. I am absolutely flabbergasted at the criticism aimed at the film, particularly at director David Yates, whose TV work I enjoyed a great deal and who has made a pretty film here, and one which employs many cinematic techniques both new and old-fashioned in telling its story. While the narrative is again rushed I found the omissions and changes from the book made much more sense here than in ""Goblet of Fire"", and the storytelling to be overall superior to ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" (where I think Cuaron chose dazzling visuals over solid storytelling at times). Good acting from most of the cast and really I found Yates' work to be quite exceptional. I trust he will do a bang-up job with the far better source material for the final three films in the series."

","Its odd that this instalment has been said to be the best thus far, as although I enjoyed it there was somehow a bit of lingering disappointment after it was all over.<br/><br/>I think most of the problems I have with the movie stem from being an avid fan of the books. However of all the books Order is the worst and the most difficult to adapt into a film, and yes lots had to be cut and with good reason in the main, yet I felt at a running time that was little over two hours from the longest book in the series, it could have afforded a little more time to explain things that are left open ended. I believe the overall spirit of the book has been well adapted but the smaller details have been overlooked altogether. The romance with Cho for instance simply seems to fizzle out and is never properly explained. Who sent the Dementors after Harry, that is never explained, or how the order manage to show up out the blue at the end of the movie. But most of all the prophecy was not given enough of a mention or an explanation. In cutting the book to the bone some of the best bits are lost.<br/><br/>Like Arthur Weasley being attacked by the snake. In the book this is a good bit full of tension and in the film it is skipped over so quickly that it barely registers. Kreacher too excellently realised is underused and the whole bit with the locket was cut which will cause problems when it comes to the last film.<br/><br/>What is in the film is excellently done there""s no denying it. It looks fantastic and the end battle is great. The acting too is improved more back to the standard of Azkaban.<br/><br/>I m not someone who wants a page to page adaptation of the book I know that is impossible and as it stands it works as a movie well, but it is one that will appeal more to non fans of the books and as a fan obviously I would prefer a movie that would speak more to the actual fans."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","1","7 July 2009"," A spectacular fantasy film, with brilliant performances and lean direction!
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter film to date, either tied with or surpassing Prisoner of Azkaban. The new director, David Yates, is very lean and confident, and his direction helps make this new Harry Potter film more mature. It feels more like a regular film, while in ways that is a downside, but also an upside seeing as how sometimes the Harry Potter films might be seen as children's' films. It's cinematography and photography is handsome, but not in the visual way that Prisoner's was. It is more bleak, more moody as well. It has a certain gloomy feeling, while it might turn off a lot of viewers seeing as how how it is different (especially after Goblet of Fire's more cheery and happy tone), I find that an improvement because it demonstrates a feeling of growth and maturity, in both the characters and the film itself. The new screenwriter was impressive. He was able to cut a lot of things out, and still leave a lot in while still not making it sort of all over the place, a flaw that presided in Goblet of Fire. Daniel Radcliffe's performance here is actually quite good. It took him five films, but he is finally able to demonstrate all of Harry's emotions and feelings very well. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson play their characters well. But the performance to talk about here( or rather, performances) is that of Imelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter. Imelda Staunton delivers a perfect performance, identical to that of the book's character. She is menacing, villainous, arrogant, obsessive, controlling, and she plays that all with a bit of humanity. What a performance! The Oscars should have caught on. Helena Bonham Carter delivers that same presence, and she plays Bellatrix with such force. Every second she is on screen(which is not a lot, maybe a minute overall) you cannot help but look at her. I just wish her role was bigger, and I hope her role in Half-Blood Prince is larger. She definitely deserved a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination if she can conduct that much passion for a character. The effects and the production designs are all fantastic as always, and the score, ranging from happy tunes to gloomy melodies, is perfect! Both Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban and Order of the Phoenix are the two films of the franchise that manage to be amazing films. Two of the best in fantasy for sure, and I hope Half-Blood prince does not disappoint."

","At first, while ongoing euphoria around me of the Harry Potter series was at the peak, I didn't watch any of the films because I had a little aversion towards them, cos I thought they were another ''make a lot of money film''. I read all the books of course and they were pretty good because of the mysterious atmosphere and really good plot. When finally I watched movies, I can say they are more than decent adaptation's of the J.K. Rowling's book, although I prefer the books. What makes the movies great is at first brilliant cast. Severus Snape is the best ''felt'' character, Gary Oldman was as always brilliant. Jason Isaacs is actor who surprised me the most with his role as Lucius, especially after I heard that he pretty much redesigned the character. These are the three actor's who impressed me the most with Alan Rickman as the the best actor in all five movies and I'm sure he'll do excellent to the end. All in all, I wouldn't say they're not a masterpiece's, far from it actually, but never the less terrific movies."

","While the dark mood and feel of this chapter in the Harry Potter saga may startle some, I thought the style and tone were a less of a departure from previous films, and more like the biggest step in the shift that began with Prisoner of Azkaban. I also thought that director David Yates the least well known of the directors in this series really captured the feel of the book and I look forward to his return for Halfblood Prince.<br/><br/>I found the pace of this film as it built towards its final confrontation to be the most exhilarating in the series. While I understand that some may have found it a bit choppy, for me the jumps that caused problems for others were simply filled in for me from what I consciously or sub-consciously recalled from the book.<br/><br/>The size of the book necessitated drastic editing to fit within the available running time and while I may miss some of the flavor I think the final result captured that which was essential. As always I look forward to the DVD for the deleted scenes and I would love to see an extended version someday.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed all the films (as I have the books) in the series for different reasons and though for me Prisoner of Azkaban was the weakest it was still for me an enjoyable film. It is very encouraging to see a series of books so consistently well adapted to the screen.<br/><br/>While it is somewhat unfortunate it was also wonderful to be able to see this veritable who's who of a generation of great British actors appearing briefly in what are essentially cameo roles. Just look at this list; Richard Griffiths, Ralph Fienes, Brendan Gleason, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Michael Gambon, Imelda Staunton, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter and Robbie Coltrane.<br/><br/>While the performances of the three leads could easily be over shadowed by such a stellar supporting cast I believe they have continued to develop and portray their characters effectively."

","I've been reading Harry Potter books for a long time, and this was one I was looking forward to seeing. I expected things to be cut, seeing as the longest book would have to have parts omitted to make a decent-sized movie. Though knowing how people are, they would pay to see a three hour film...such as ""Lord of the Rings"" takes all day it seems. So why not add things? More like keep things in. Personally my favorite out of all of them is the fourth one, but I was still some-what impressed with the quality and how it still remained a fairly good film despite half of the book being cut out. If you've read the book, be prepared to be at least somewhat disappointed with the cuts. But otherwise, you will be entertained and who ever comes with you will like it too."

","The book was overall awesome. I thought the movie wasn't that great. Half and half. I'm reading Half blooded prince and love it.

I use audio tape and read the book while listening. :] that probably sounds crazy but, hey. That's what i do. I can't wait for the next movie and i'm flabbergasted that they made the last movie in Part 1 and 2. I was so happy. I was like about time. One more thing i'd like to say.

","Let me just say that I have been constantly impressed with the work that is done by the Harry Potter movies' cast and crew. Their improvement has shone brightly throughout the saga. I was especially impressed with the scene at the Ministry of Magic where Sirius is killed. Daniel Radcliffe's emotion is fantastic and the music and sound editing is spot on. I love how its in slow motion and mute for part of the scene, and then transfers smoothly into sound and movement. I also was impressed in a scene shortly after that where Harry is being possessed by Voldemort and he is laying on the ground, watched by Dumbledore. Yet again, Daniel Radcliffe provides emotion and dynamics.<br/><br/>I was thrilled by the choice of Imelda Stauten for Dolores Umbridge. Her sickly sweetness is overcast by her love for torture and hate for children. Yet again, a spotless performance.<br/><br/>I am also continuously impressed by the music soundtrack. The songs add dimension and feeling to every scene.<br/><br/>All in all, i feel that the great legend of Harry Potter is perfectly portrayed in its movie counterparts."

","Harry Potter (Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts to find the Ministry of Magic and their new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher (Staunton) are interfering with their education.<br/><br/>After a long two year absence since Harry Potter's last outing in Goblet of Fire, fan hype was higher than ever. As this film was released, the last ever Harry Potter novel By J.K Rowling hit shelves and shops all around the world, smashing records as we discovered what was to happen, which made this film a more appetizing feast, and we were treated to the most scrumptious Potter to date.<br/><br/>Radcliffe, Oldman, Gambon, Smith, Fiennes and Coltrane, all the established franchise makers returned along with a collection of new characters including an exceptionally brilliant Imelda Staunton as Professor Umbridge and Helena Bonham Carter as the wicked Bellatrix Lestrange. All stunning, all perfect in their approach to their protagonists but significantly the new face was David Yates replacing Mike Newell in the director's very much debated chair and Yates with his delicate and sophisticated approach helps makes this 2007 release the best in the series.<br/><br/>David Yates had only worked in occasional TV series which included a stint in the Bill and became a big surprise to the series, and what a surprise. His appreciation of the book helps him achieve the necessities of what happens on screen. We see delicate montages, a wicked series of fantasies and some simple but effect emotion reflexes from the Merseyside director. The newspaper scenes are very impressive reflections on the times at Hogwarts. Yates blends the trend of drama, fantasy and some exquisite comedy into the mix to make for a high standard of family entertainment. This is also the funniest Harry Potter out of the five.<br/><br/>The adaptation of Rowling's fifth book is in many ways a more riveting instalment to the story of the young wizard than the book. Rowling's work, though excellent standard, seemed to lapse in places as it became politically driven without a key idea and mystery to get going but this is irrelevant in this picture. Always interesting and consistent in its adaptation Order of the Phoenix is riveting viewing, maintaining a fine balance of magic whilst giving fans that sense of what happens behind the enchantments.<br/><br/>Whereas there isn't that sense of mystery that was present in the first two releases and the fact Potter is slightly more annoying as he goes through the typical teenage phase of life, this is still riveting and entertaining and thanks to David Yates, the best Potter to date and fans will sit up and wait for his adaptation of the sixth part."

","There is no earlier Harry Potter film that can better this. From the beginning to the end the spectacle, suspense and excitement never stops. All the characters are at their best and the new director has given the film a special emotional touch.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radliffe) is now in his fifth year and facing more difficulties than ever before. He is nearly expelled when he performs the Patronus charm to defend himself from an attacking dementor. While Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) are making his life miserable he is rescued by the secret organisation known as the Order of the Phoenix. Among them are Alastor Moody, (Brendan Gleeson) Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) and Harry's godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman.) When he thankfully arrives at school he finds that the ministry has planted an undercover worker Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher and the high inquisitor. This horrible woman devastates the students and the teachers including Professors Albus Dumbledore, (Michael Gambon) Minerva McGonagall, (Maggie Smith) Sybil Trelawney, (Emma Thompson) Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and even Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) with her numerous rules and cruel teaching style. So a group of students including Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) have formed a club to b e taught Defence against the Dark Arts properly by Harry. When they hear that the that the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his death eaters including Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) and Sirius' cousin Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) are planning to break into the ministry of magic their skills are put to the test as they fly over to stop them.<br/><br/>The film also includes spectacular visual effects and the tragic but mysterious death of a main character. Directed by David Yates and co-starring Mark Williams and Julie Walters."
"Scarecrow-88","7","0","2","18 January 2009"," Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
","Harry Potter's internal struggle with the evil Lord Voldemort is at the heart of this cerebral installment, taking a break from the overpowering action we are used to seeing(..tournament wizard contests and such)instead focusing on a potential threat towards Hogwarts school in the chuckling new professor, Dolores Umbridge(Imelda Staunton)with her wide-eyes and seemingly modest exterior harbours an aggressive desire to have full control of the school, operating by her strict standards, attempting to remove wizardry, enabling the students to practice their craft. Secretly a war is brewing between Dumbledore(Michael Gambon)and Voldemort with Harry playing a vital chess piece. It will be revealed that either Harry or Voldemort will live but both can not co-exist, a prophesy most certain to propel the next film. But, this film does follow Harry' further growth as a powerful wizard, and his nemesis particularly in this movie is Umbridge who wishes to silence the young man from even mentioning Voldemort's name. Pursuing the knowledge of casting spells which can protect them from harm, and thus enabling them to join Dumbledore's army, Hermoine(Emma Watson)and Ron(Rupert Grint)will convince Harry to train volunteers secretly behind Umbridge's back. Harry also converses with his godfather, wrongfully accused serial killer Sirius Black(Gary Oldman)who keeps him informed of the latest news regarding what Dumbledore wishes to remain hidden for his safety. We witness a very paranoid Minster of the Ministry of Magic believing that Dumbledore may be enlisting a force against him(..perhaps in part to whispers from those who might wish to see Dumbledore out as headmaster of Hogwarts)and it's visible as the newspapers increase the unease as Potter's claim of Voldemort's return has many split, some considering it bogus, others worried that he's correct.<br/><br/>Film still features state-of-the-art special effects(..such as our introduction to Hagrid's giant half-brother and the frightening dementors working for Voldemort), but the emphasis is more towards Potter as a central figure as turmoil rages within the world of magic and wizardry. While growing into adulthood, the teenage students are forced into adult decisions as secret evils await them and the political order of things is a boiling pot where Voldemort is on the thoughts of everyone even if many would rather remain blinded/oblivious to such a horrifying truth. You get a nifty showdown between Dumbledore and Voldemort and the teen wizards even face off with Voldemort's brood who escape Azkaban. Potter's emergence as a powerful wizard whose humanity is his strength(..Voldemort considers him weak because of his emotions for those he loves)an unfolding character arc because he will be tested against the dark powers with Voldemort desiring to take control of his body. And, a very important plot-point emerges regarding Severus Snape(Alan Rickman)and why he holds such a grudge against Harry, concerning Potter's father. Once again we realize that Lucius Malfoy(Jason Isaacs)is a dangerous presence in that he's an agent for Voldemort working on the inside, an intruder who can disrupt things within the Ministry of Magic. Helena Bonham Carter returns in a small role as sorceress Bellatrix Lestrange, murdering a major supporting character who was such a guiding force in Harry's life. Above all, the importance of friendship is at the very core of this installment..Harry needs the support of his friends and allies more than ever before. There's a lot going on and it's clear that the screenplay tries to fit as much as possible from the source novel."

"vip_ebriega","8","0","1","2 January 2009"," New 'Order' is darker but still dazzling, enjoyable.
","My Take: Darker than its predecessors and rather ordinary and rushed in quality, but it's still a magical and imaginative adventure. <br/><br/>""Difficult times lie ahead, Harry"", says the wise Professor Dumbledore at the end of HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, and in his 5th year at Hogwarts, our young Mr. Potter is about to discover what he meant. HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, the adaptation of J.K. Rowling's much-anticipated 5th novel in the successful bestselling series is a surprisingly shorter movie. For a movie that prepares a no-longer-too-young Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, also not too young anymore) to confront the inevitable Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), this movie is a must-see, but falls short of the mark. <br/><br/>In his 5th year, Harry recollects with his friends, including the ever loyal Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), to create a certain ""Dumbledore's Army"" to fight against the evil Voldemort's forces, including a sinister maniac called Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), much to the disapproval of the domineering new Dark Arts teacher Proffesor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton, who can make a dark lord cower any day). <br/><br/>The film is fairly shorter than its predecessors, with so much to do with the new director David Yates, who cuts what might be the longest book in the series into the shortest in the film adaptations. Events move too fast that the movie feels like a rush job. Don't mind me, but I preferred Colombus' and original screenwriter Steve Kloves safe cover-to-cover faithfulness than the otherwise rushed narrative of Yates and new screenwriter Michael Goldenberg. I haven't read the ORDER OF THE PHOENIX novel, but I don't need to to figure out that there's something lost in translation. Even the new score by Yates veteran composer Nicolas Hooper was underwhelming; John Williams' whimsical score for the earlier films have been replaced by cues that any composer could make. <br/><br/>But, shorter or darker than its predecessors, There's still enough magic left in ORDER OF THE PHOENIX to make it an enjoyable and highly imaginative adventure. With great characters (with the addition of the intriguing Luna Lovegood, played by newcomer Evanna Lynch), a few compelling plot twists (a revelation of Snape's depressing past is a revelation), imaginative special effects and maybe even a few startling creatures, I enjoyed HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX even if I was a little letdown by my memories of its highly superior predecessors. <br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

"Heath618","9","0","1","16 December 2008"," Beautiful Film, but Soundtrack Found Lacking
","I would like to reiterate every single word that Kingtrio9 said in her review. Best acting yet. The movies, like the books, grow and mature as their characters do. Single complaint--the soundtrack. Nicholas Hooper fails to provide much of a canvas for the movie to play out on. Sometimes the moments of silence are fitting and dramatic, but they happen too often. The Harry Potter theme, John William's ""Hedwig's Theme"" is played only 2 or 3 times in the movie and it is never the original--it is a Hooper adaption. Most of the background music sounds like mischievous tinkering. It doesn't do justice to any Harry Potter movie, but ESPECIALLY one as serious as this.<br/><br/>He fails to capture the pure magic orchestrated by John Williams in the first two films and the medieval mystery he wove into the third, as well as the dramatic, sweeping, epic feel provided by Patrick Doyle in The Goblet of Fire. One exception--the end scene in the Department of Mysteries; there I must say, ""well done.""<br/><br/>Let's hope he gets a bit more creative for the next films!"

A major terror event is staged to shock the public and thereby push through all kinds of anti-terror policy which eventually degrades human rights and speech. Everyone is terrified all the time except the few wealthy persons in power. The good guys are made out to be the bad guys. We are primed everyday to fear so eventually nobody dares challenge any policies. Other national governments go right wing as well.

","I loved the movie, regardless of many uptight interpretations on the content of the movies, which I will not rant upon at this time. Umbridge was cast so well that I wanted someone to torture her with a whats-it-called crucio curse. I would have laughed. Bellatrix was so good that I actually admire both the actress and the character. Harry is such a courageous and tortured character that we should take a leaf from his book, fictional or not. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint (I always get a giggle from his name) were as outstanding as Daniel himself. The three of them were a brilliant casting from the start, an amazing work of intuition on the part of those that chose them. The movie, all in all, was fascinating and emotionally charged. The humor was great, as well as the effects were astounding. I would have loved to have seen it in the theater, but I was forced to wait *very impatiently* for the DVD to come out, and after watching it I bought a copy for all of the Harry fans in my family. I recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a great good vs evil storyline that evolves over time."

Coming up behind POA and GOF.<br/><br/>After the magical HP3 and HP4 you think they would have chosen a more experience director. David Yates(some of you might be saying who?)is the guy who directed a few the Bill episodes and a few short films. Now they got him directed one of the biggest movie series on the planet. Also he is set to direct the rest of the movies. That is a very big risk. I am not saying he didn't do a good job but i felt they should have use a better known director.<br/><br/>The acting is like it was in the previous movies.

","I first saw the movie not long after it had been released here in Australia. I had really liked all the previous films( thougth no where near as good as the books) and went in with high expectations and fortunately was not disappointed.<br/><br/>First with the negative. Firstly the incredible amount of parts of the book that were cut from the final film. The lack of quidditch, Ron and hermione's promotion to prefects, Hagrids class with the Thestrals, Harry and Cho's disastrous date and several other significant parts of the plot which were either cut or shortened. Understanably the scenes set in St Mungos were cut because another set would have to be build but scenes which were necessary for the plot and had sets to film in should have included.<br/><br/>Now the positive. Special effects were brilliant. The scene around the archway with all the order of the Phoenix fighting the death eaters was done superbly.Daniel,Rupert and Emma's performances were the best out of all the films. They seem to improve with every film. The minor characters like Gary Oldman(Sirius Black),Imelda staunton(Dolores Umbridge) and Bonnie Wright(Ginny Weasley) were also great performances from these terrific actors.<br/><br/>Over all Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix was a great film and makes me long for the next one."
"aura772","10","0","3","27 July 2008"," ~*-He's back!-*~
","Warner Brothers proved themselves worthy of yet another well done ""Hary Potter"" movie. The movie manages to capture everything in the book, except minor subplots, but the story continues and the director did a great job, I'm happy he'll be making the next movies also. After all those style changes from the first movies, the fans of the movies need to focus on the story rather then the new uniforms, or other things directors usually change.<br/><br/>I don't think the screenplay was quite bad, and the Hermione-Ron relationship is getting a little bit awkward, since Ron is even jealous of Grawp and Hermione is looking all the time so subtle at him. It's getting more like the two of them and Harry, but the team grows bigger now. Also, Harry has Cho, while Ginny watches them jealously, yet subtle.<br/><br/>In this film, Sirius Black, Harry's only living relative dies, killed by Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry is absolutely shocked, he performs the Cruciatus curse on her, but he's not cruel enough to really want to hurt her. Harry grows stronger and angrier (He has his Hulk moments), while the desire in him, not to get revenge, but to defeat evil and make sure all the persons left that he cares about are unharmed.<br/><br/>With the ""Harry Potter"" films is never the question if this movie has a great story, because most of us read the books. The question is, was it a good adaptation? I cannot answer that, because all the directors brought something new to the movies and each of them represented the magic world of ""Harry Potter""."
"aldrid02","Null","0","2","13 July 2008"," Another Amazing HP film
","I think that David Yates, the director, did an amazing job of keeping the Harry Potter theme going and did the book a wonderful justice. It can not be easy taking a book that is 870 pages down to a 138 minute film even with some assistance from the author J.K Rowling. <br/><br/>Daniel Radcliff (Harry Potter) does a wonderful job as a teenager that is growing up and having additional pressures added to his life. Of course Lord Voldemort (played by Ralph Fiennes) is back and wants to have his revenge on the one person he has not been able to kill. And unknown to Daniel Radcliff (Harry Potter) this year will be a year of many trials put upon him and Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore) by the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry of Magic does not want word to spread that Lord Voldemort is back, because this will create havoc in the wizarding community and they do not believe it themselves. <br/><br/>As always the trio Daniel Radcliff (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) come together to solve a problem without thinking through all the consequences first. This is nothing knew for teenagers or for this trio. The movie shows many teenage struggles for Daniel Radcliff (Harry Potter) including his first kiss and the chance of losing someone else close to him. <br/><br/>The computer generated images of the thestrals were unbelievable. When trying to imagine the images of the thestrals while reading the book is nothing like seeing the creations on film. All of the special effects were masterfully done and made you feel like you were really watching a community where wizards really exist. Just wait until you see what the Weasley twins come up with this year. <br/><br/>The teen conflict in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is also seen in the Star Wars series of movies. In Star Wars Luke has to overcome the anxiety that his father is Darth Vader and decide whether he should continue to fight for what he believes is the right way to go. Daniel Radcliff (Harry Potter) also has to make decisions on which side he should be on and if this is the best decision for him. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of the past Harry Potter movies, then you do not want to miss Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."
"Aussie50","8","0","1","11 July 2008"," third time lucky
","when i first saw this movie in the cinemas i thought it was the worst harry potter movie yet, being a reader of the books. they seemed to cut out almost every memorable scene in the movie or else change them into boring digital effects. whats more characters that should have been given more detail we were just given glimpses of, e.g. tonks and Bellatrix. tonks was only given about 1 or 2 lines and if you hadn't read the book you probably wouldn't'even know her name as you never clearly hear her called tonks, just""don't call me nymphadora"", she didn't even say ""wotcher harry"" which is kind of like her trademark greeting. Bellatrix was played perfectly by Helena Bonham carter but same as tonks she just wasn't given enough to do. dumbledore as usual since Richard Harris (who played dumbledore in the first two movies) passed away had me angry watching him because he is the worst possible dumbledore they could have chosen. he is uncharacteristically angry and aggressive all the time, i still haven't gotten over how he violently shoved harry after reading his name out of the goblet of fire. still he's not as bad when watched over. after watching the movie on DVD a second time i still hated it. but i watched it a third time recently and decided to try and forget all i had read in the book. now it is my favourite of all the potter movies. its dramatic, exciting, funny, and action packed. two new characters i think really saved this movie and that was umbridge and Luna lovegood. they were both perfectly played and were exactly as i imagined down to the last detail.the DA club was done well, and even though it was cho who dobbed them all in, i didn't really mind as i don't really care if cho is hated. Fred and George's exit was great, just as it should have been. kreacher was excellent but still should have had the big role he had in the book but i'm just happy he was shown at all. the thestrals were made excellently. the final battle was good as long as you don't compare it to the book, which was much more dramatic and heart pounding. this movie was simply put superbly made and shouldn't be missed by fans, no matter what bad reviews some book lovers write."
"MLDinTN","7","0","1","23 June 2008"," one of the better Potter films but....
","still too much left out from the book. I thought this fifth installment of Harry Potter was better than the first few. But, after having read the book, I know that there is a lot left out. All these books should have been given 4 plus hours like the seventh book will be. Then maybe all the great smaller story lines would not end up on the cutting room floor. The movie left out a lot of what Kreacher did and there is no quiddich for Harry to get banned from. A lot of the back ground of Bellatrix Lestrange is left out of the movie. That was a very interesting part of the book. Where the book focuses on why Harry got attacked by the Deatheaters in the beginning and the increasing power of the Dark Lord, the movie seems to center around Dorlos Umbridge and her taking over Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Pluses are the battle between Dumbledoor and Voldermort was cool. And I liked that they included a little of the Dursley's in the beginning. Too bad more wasn't included because that is often the funniest parts of the books.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you've seen the first 4, then you should watch the final 3 films. The movies are OK, but I highly recommend reading the books."
"falconesque","8","0","1","8 June 2008"," A few jarring moments
","After the theatrical viewing: Wow, the production hit the highlights, though severe pruning remained obvious and, in places, greatly disappointing. The big battle scene was impressive, though impossible to follow who was fighting whom. Couldn't wait for the DVD to rewatch that scene.<br/><br/>Alas, even in slow motion the tiny figures are mostly indiscernible between the black and white whooshing around and the fast cuts. And the other disappointments become glaring.<br/><br/>The noncanon bits of ""atmosphere"" -- sugar spooned into cup, overlong closeup; portraits tipped out of paintings; pounding decrees into the castle wall -- even more so on repeated viewing feel as if they steal time better occupied by other missing moments, such as Molly's boggart or the brooms being impounded, or by fleshing out the twins' bits, which are astonishingly anemic.<br/><br/>Imelda was truly inspired casting, but OotP is her film at the expense of everyone and everything else, which is a shame. Yates goes too far in having McGonagall cowed as well, with the ham-fisted (and frankly, insulting) stair-stepping oneupsmanship about ""loyalty."" He already had Sybil Trelawney to cow to his heart's content (and Hagrid, though Hagrid was largely overlooked, too). McGonagall never caved to that woman, an inspiration sorely lacking in the film, where most of the adult roles are reduced to caricatures.<br/><br/>Gambon does well as an aloof Dumbledore, especially his exit with style, though his final sentiments almost prove too hard to swallow.<br/><br/>One uncomfortable gaff was using levicorpus in D.A. sessions. Though seen in memory, the jinx isn't introduced until HBP. The spell's execution is also off (a floaty levitating body, rather than a nonverbal wrenching of someone into the air), but that's a quibble.<br/><br/>Another quibble is where the effects work goes inconsistently thin. Hagrid in the forest and Mad-Eye in the photo spring to mind.<br/><br/>There's a lot of ""floaty"" going around OotP (particularly obvious was Sirius's bit about being ""a good person""). There is enough atmosphere and plenty of inspirational lines within the texts as written for the director to pick something else; attempts to invent more, while cute once, fall flat and have as much perseverance as candyfloss.<br/><br/>Here's hoping Yates does better with the content as well as the flash in HBP, slowing down the action just a *tad* for comprehension and serving the story. And if not, here's hoping he's replaced for DH."

Therefore, I know this book better that any of the others. It always has been my favorite book because Sirius is much bigger than ever before, but that was just foreshadowing to is imminent death at the end of the book. When I walked out of the theater, after seeing the biggest film of the year (for me), and meeting the actors who portrayed the Weasley twins, I was ecstatic. Afterward, though, I felt somewhat flat. This was my favorite movie in the series. However, as an adaptation of the book, I thought it was awful. But, I didn't want a carbon copy of the book. That's what makes the movies exciting. To see what they do with it. I hated the fact that Ron and Hermione were pushed outward, how short Harry cut his hair (Harry wouldn't do that, the scar wouldn't show, but you see it here anyway), and the removal of Quidditch. I know what they wanted to do with this movie, and I liked David ""Montage Man"" Yates as director. I'm glad to see him return. Overall, I think that this is the best entry in the film saga, but falls short as an adaptation of an 870-page-long novel."

","They say a picture can say more than a thousand of words. In this case... I say the book said a lot more that the movie.<br/><br/>First of all the director tried to make an accurate-in-every-word-of-the-book movie. But he forgot that it can never be done without disappointment. The other movies had a few dialogs directly extracted from the books, but only a few. Here you can watch for every scene at least 5 lines from the book. <br/><br/>The events happens so fast that the entire movie looks like a merely summary of the book and does not give it a proper picture. It had funny times and well act performance , but its surpassed by a bad direction. Watch it if you are a fan of Harry Potter but... well you'll see. I expected SO much more from this movie. I think The First Trailer had more better times. What the hell with this temperamental, angry and grumpy Dumbledore? In the book Harry love Sirius, in the movie it was a crap attempt to make you feel that love and the frustration when Sirius dies. <br/><br/>It's entertaining but Like a friend said: ""It's a movie you don't manage to feel ""Inside the Movie"" and you merely watch it as a TV cartoon series."""

","Harry Potter's saga goes on in a pretty good shape. New mysteries are revealed and the story approaches step by step to the final face to face between Harry and the Dark Lord. . As Potters grows up and becomes an adult so does the story, and now everything is darker and there's a bigger presence of evil and death.<br/><br/>David Yates has made a good job, just like Columbus or Cuarón did before. It seems that it does not matter that much who directs the movie 'cause Mrs. Rowling's plots are addictive enough by itself. You can't tell which movie of the saga is the best because you can see the seven movies (the five already released and the two to come) as a whole, just like The Lord Of The Rings or Star Wars first trilogy.<br/><br/>*My rate: 7/10"

","I was VERY upset with the 5th installment of Harry Potter. I have been reading these books in a matter of days ever since they came out and have always had a great deal of excitement when I saw a new book or movie out. When I went to see OotP I was very disappointed. I was expecting an uber long film with detail about EVERYTHING instead we got a choppy 2 hour version of a (i'm going to guess and say) 800 page book. I hated how they cut out scenes and used the newspaper to give the audience information about scenes that weren't ""good enough"" to make the movie. I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>And I also have a question; I have heard that there are plans of cutting the 6th movie into 2 different installments that will be about 6 months apart in the theaters.. does anyone know the truth to this?"

","Daniel Radcliffe made a huge leap forward in his acting for this film and also the pace the cinematography was fantasitc and the music for the film especially accompanying the order's flight to the order is simply breathtaking in nature. The best scene in the whole series for my opinion it was all there. The story I know everyone knows by now. Of course there are detractors who feel the film was streamlined and marginalized in order to make the pace better I feel this is true and I could not agree more with the decision you can make a film shorter that is usual and still make it feel epic and grand in spite of that very fact."

","A very watchable thriller that held my attention all the way through my first viewing. An okay achievement. I started with Harry Potter in March 2005 and this is nothing like the same, just it was still very watchable.<br/><br/>Except that it also feels rather empty to me. Empty of solid Harry Potter 5 content and empty in all sorts of other ways too. So, a story that is very watchable, gripping for the first viewing, while also being remarkably empty. I can easily imagine Ron of the novels watching this sort of thing and coming to such a conclusion.<br/><br/>This is the first where I have read the novel beforehand. The feature felt very much like a summary of the novel, with some detail changed in order to allow the summary to flow well. I had expected this, given the previous features. I had not expected this to be a portrayal of the novel and in this particular case this mostly felt to have a worthwhile integrity, despite the emptiness.<br/><br/>Further, I was impressed by the quality of the FAQ for this feature at March 2008.<br/><br/>I was going to re-watch OOPS HP 5 in May 2010, just before posting this update to my comment. I re-read the novel instead. I do not watch this DVD all that often."

","I've just finished watching all 5 of the HP movies back-to-back.....with my husband, who has not read the books.<br/><br/>For the entire first 4 movies, I had to provide a running commentary for him to understand what was actually happening on the screen. ""Oh, Sirus, James (Harry's dad), Lupin and Pettigrew were all close friends. They actually wrote the marauder's map--that's how Lupin knew how to use it."" We couldn't get through 10 minutes of ANY of the movies without that! However, for ""Phoenix,"" the screenwriter did something amazingly intelligent---he let the film stand on its own! He TRANSLATED the book to the screen, instead of just trying to film chunks of the book exactly as they were written. Every time I thought I would have to explain something to my husband, the brilliant screenwriter did it for me. And he did it naturally, in the proper context. Nothing seemed forced or contrived.<br/><br/>I have to give a major ""THANK YOU"" to the director as well. The previous four movies were almost exercises in special effects. In #2, for example, it was, ""Ooooh, let's see how scary we can make a Basilisk look!"" But, they left out Ginny Weasley's ENTIRE STORY--- until she was brought in at the end, like a lousy Deus Ex Machina contraption. ""Phoenix"" actually focused (gasp!) on the STORY, and the effects were there to enhance it. The director is a master of visual story-telling. We could feel the love Sirius had for Harry in the first glance from Gary Oldman's amazing eyes. We felt slimy every time Umbridge walked into a room. We were SHOWN what was happening, not told the plot in these stupid little summary/exposition dialogs by the characters (which dominated the previous four movies).<br/><br/>The actors have grown by leaps and bounds. (thanks again to the director?) Everyone wants to whine about how much worse Michael Gambon was as Dumbledore, compared to Richard Harris. Well, with the crappy lines he was given (especially in #3) he didn't have much of a chance. But he shines in the hands of a competent writer and director. Daniel Radcliffe's range has expanded exponentially (he was amazing in Sirius' death scene) and Matthew Lewis took Neville Longbottom from gangly nerd to budding hero.<br/><br/>I just read that the same screenwriter from the first four movies (Steve Kloves) is being brought back for ""The Half-Blood Prince."" Please, please, sack him and bring back Michael Goldenberg for the final installment. The man knows how to write. Steve Kloves has shown that he knows very little about adapting these books to the screen.<br/><br/>Thank you, thank you, thank you, David Yates and Michael Goldenberg, for bringing such a fantastic story to the screen."
"arthera09","7","0","2","21 February 2008"," not a great movie, but a good companion to the book
","This just did not work as a movie. Being a fan of the books and having read all of the books I am quite familiar to the world and the storyline. For those who have never read the books though this movie is a mess of story lines that just does not make sense. Having read the books and this one being one of my favorites, it was a great movie because it showed things that I loved to see. Luna Lovegood was perfect and was more perfect than I could have imagined. That little actress was so good I could not believe it. I really felt for the character and thought of how great it would be to have her on your side. The wizard battles were totally awesome, but could have been longer and showed some more action. I wish I saw the statues come to life in the last battle like in the book, but they did not. The statues looked better in the movie than I had pictured, but they did not spring to life. I don't want to say none of the kids in the movie can act, but I think they were just given with some pretty weak material. The only reason this movie gets a 7 and not a 6 is because one of the best characters in the book came to life in a such a way I could not imagined. A really big beef I had with the movie was that they left out my favorite scene in all of the books. The one where Neville is with his parents in the hospital grounded the whole world and gave the kids something to fight for that everyone can relate to. There is no destiny involved with Neville's character and he did not deserve the life he was handed. He deserved to have the loving parents that were taken away from him and the movie almost ignores that part totally. Neville was turned into my favorite character in that moment and now he just another silly kid who has a reason to fight, but we aren't able to see into his character like the book let us. Like my summary says it is not a good movie, but having read the books it was really nice to see the world we have come to love."

"McQualude","8","0","3","10 February 2008"," Daniel Radcliffe front and center
","Another new director to the series, David Yates, takes the helm for this iteration of Potter. Less stylistically flared than it's predecessors, Phoenix is more even in tone. The visual richness of Hogwarts is lacking as all takes a backseat to Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are pushed farther from center stage and the spotlight narrows on Harry Potter. Some of which is worked into the plot and it may be the books work the same, I've only read the first so I can't say. Potter is once again in trouble for using magic outside the school only this time the consequences are more severe and he is expelled from Hogwarts. Overall, I think this may be my favorite of the series, perhaps because it is the least kiddish."
"husks","9","0","2","1 February 2008"," This movie struggles to distill Rowling's longest book yet.
","This fifth film should please fans who rate the films based on their fidelity to the canonical texts. But for the uninitiated, it's a dry and slightly dreary introduction to the world of Hogwarts and Azkaban, where enchantment and mystery  good and bad  lie beneath a placid surface of English railway platforms, call boxes and pedestrian underpasses. It feels like a placeholder, not because little happens but because so much plot must be served in order to set up subsequent events that there's no room for the gentle human moments that anchor Rowling's heroic fantasy epic to the everyday world.<br/><br/>It opens in a miserable little excuse for a playground in the cookie-cutter suburb where orphaned wizard Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) grimly spends school holidays with his loathsome relatives, the Dursleys. Trapped in a rank underpass by a sudden, highly suspicious storm, Harry resorts to magic to rescue his unspeakable cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) from a soul-sucking Dementor and is promptly expelled for using magic in front of a civilian. In short order Harry is hauled before a Ministry of Magic tribunal, whose intent to railroad him is thwarted only by the fortuitous intervention of Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Harry's much-loved mentor and substitute father figure. But though Harry is cleared, his already sullied reputation has been further besmirched: Head Minister Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) has taken the position that Harry is deluded at best, lying at worst, when he insists that the dreaded Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned from hellish exile, reiterating it regularly in the ministry's house organ, ""The Daily Prophet."" And many of Harry's classmates have begun to wonder aloud what really happened when he and popular student Cedric Diggory entered a mystical maze from which only Harry emerged alive. Harry has allies, of course, including his oldest friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and his godfather, the fugitive Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). But he also has an implacable enemy in ministry lackey Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), whose cheery pink wardrobe and saccharine smile hide the soul of a lace-curtain fascist.<br/><br/>There's more  much, much more  crammed into the 138-minute running time; it's the shortest film in the series, adapted from the longest book. Both screenwriter Michael Goldenberg and U.K. television director David Yates are new to the series and do an admirable job ratcheting up the darkness. They're supported by cinematographer Slawomir Idziak's icy color palette, which truly does look as though all the happiness has been sucked out of the world. As always, the performances are top-notch, from the series veterans  many reduced by the sheer volume of plot to virtual cameos  to ethereal newcomer Evanna Lynch, who plays witchy little Luna Lovegood. But for a tale suffused with spells and portents, the magic is oddly elusive. --Maitland McDonagh"
"spectre1110","Null","0","2","25 January 2008"," Liked It, But It Could Have Been Better!!
","OK, first off I know this is just another somewhat useless comment about this movie, but here it goes anyway.<br/><br/>This movie was good, not great, and could definitely have been better, and they wouldn't have had to make it extremely long to do so. Now don't get me wrong Davit Yates and the entire crew did a great job all in all, because everyone knew that there were going to be omissions from the movie. However, there is some content that should have made it into the film that didn't, such as Ron and Hermione becoming prefects; which could have been done with a relatively short scene and it would have kept more continuity with the books, and I'm slightly confused as to why Draco Malfoy seemed to suddenly drop out of the picture, when his character is such a great foil to Harry's. Why didn't Dumbledore conjure his comfy chair at the hearing, they could have added that and barely changed the scene, but it would have helped to set the mood and give everyone a better feel for Dumbledore's thought process at the time. Instead Dumbledore does not look as calm, nor nearly as cool, as in the book. I also would have liked to see the addition of Ron as Gryffindor keeper for the quiditch team, or the inclusion of any quiditch at all. They could of even only shown the tryouts to show us that Ron made the team and then not bring it up until Umbridge releases the decree about not having teams, clubs, etc. Another thing I would have liked to see (and I'm sure others would have as well) is the trip to St. Mungo's; even if they left out Lockhart and the closed ward, and just showed the Atrium and then Mr. Weasley's room. This would have helped to show everyone more of the wizarding world that they so desperately want to see...I mean isn't that why we all watched this movie in the first place? We hear nothing of Hedwig being intercepted, nor do you see Umbridge's hand in the fire after Harry talks to Sirius. These are all easy details to add, especially when they added scenes like the entire DA doing Umbridge's lines in detention...when did that happen? Oh, yea it didn't!! Or Fred and George consoling some first year about the scars on his hand, because that scene really added something to the movie for everyone (and if you couldn't already tell that was oozing with sarcasm). I also feel that they could have done a little better with Snape's worst memory, though I can see why the didn't use the pensieve, they could have made the scene better. And what the heck happened with the battle in the Ministry?!?!?! All of a sudden the Death Eaters are just apparatting and disapperatting everywhere and becoming just black vapor chasing the students....what happened to the fight?!?! And what happened to all the other rooms in the department of mysteries?, because it would have been cool to see all the weird stuff in there.<br/><br/>Now having said all that of course I knew, and expected omissions from the movie. It made sense not to include Marietta in much of the movie as her role was easily filled by Cho who is a much more established character, however it was nice to see that the pimples made their way into the film via Filch and his fudge. It's understandable that they didn't put in many scened from Grimauld Place (the cleaning scenes with the pixies, etc.) because they merely helped us to pass time and keep the reader engaged, but served no purpose in regards to the plot (with a possible exception to the glimpse of the locket horcrux, of which we didn't even know of while reading the book anyway). As stated above, the whole no quiditch thing kinda bummed me out, but did seem necessary to help keep the movie from becoming too slow. The exclusion of Neville's whole side story made a lot sense to me, though some are undoubtedly disappointed by the decision, it would have slowed the film down tremendously and would have been very confusing to everyone who only watches the films and does not follow the books. The same can be said for the omission of Firenze, as he has no loyalties to the plot at all. For those of you that feel that Fred and George got cheated out of their theatrical exit....they kind of did, but they got the essentials down.<br/><br/>All in all it was a good movie and was definitely worth seeing in theaters for all of the special effects. Finally, I just want to say that if anyone finds this useless, it because it probably is, but I had to get it off my chest and now I can eagerly await the release of The Half-Blood Prince to theaters."
"Terrell-4","8","0","2","27 January 2008"," Get to know Harry Potter, his friends and teachers, first in the books, then enjoy the movies. This movie is fine
","If Harry Potter at the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix feels sorry for Voldemort because the dark lord can never know love or friendship, I feel almost equally sorry for those who don't read J. K. Rowling's novels and just rely on the films. As good as the movies are, including this one, they are scarcely more than sketches compared to the books. Why should this be important? Because Rowling has created a classic epic with the books, and stuffed them full of mature ideas, boundless ingenuity and clever humor, life lessons that aren't preachy or icky and with characters we come to really like or detest. No, this isn't Dickens, but as a literary tour de force, the story of Harry Potter and his growth into adulthood is unusually vivid and satisfying. <br/><br/>The Order of the Phoenix isn't simply the exciting adventure, tinged with a bit of mystery and dread, that the other books and films were. With this one, the angst, worry and danger move front and center. The movie still works as entertainment, however, because it's not a stand- alone film. Those who may try to judge the relative worth of any one of the books or films needs to take into account that Harry Potter is one story, and each story in each book or movie builds on all the others before it. For me, trying to figure which is the ""best"" book or film would be like trying to determine which bite of pumpkin pie was most satisfying, the third bite, the fourth bite or the first bite. <br/><br/>The movies, especially this one, do provide one satisfaction that the books can't. Before our eyes, literally, Harry Potter and his friends are growing up, changing from children to young men and women. We see it happen because all the original young actors, who must have signed long-term contracts or are getting a great deal of money to sign up picture by picture, also are growing up before our eyes. Harry Potter is now a young man because Daniel Radcliffe is becoming a young man. Hermione Granger's growing maturity is because Emma Watson is growing in maturity. It's odd in a pleasurable way to see small Neville Longbottom now towering over Harry, just as Mathew Lewis now towers over Radcliffe. <br/><br/>Rowling's books are so good, and the movies are so accomplished as good cinema, that the ""Oh, no, I'd never read those Potter stories"" reaction set in sometime ago and is still prevalent among some. There is a category of individuals who automatically react condescendingly to anything which achieves great popular success. This isn't intellectual prejudice. Those who enjoy things of the mind - intellectuals - are driven as much by curiosity as by an appreciation of what rigorous things a mind can deliver. Those, however, who shiver in delight at Sondheim and only smile indulgently at Berlin, who swoon over Updike but find Dickens just adequate, who condescend to Rowling but preen over Goddard, miss the point: A good mind, a fine intellect, a curious person can find pleasure and value in all of the above. Why? Because they're all good at what they do. Intellectual appreciation of good work isn't a zero sum game. <br/><br/>See the Potter movies, including this one, and be touched and entertained. Read the Potter books, including this one, and be touched and taught."
"ShootingShark","6","0","3","26 January 2008"," Fun, Fast-Moving, But Slightly Stilted And Doom-Laden Harry Potter Adventure
","Harry Potter's fifth term at Hogwarts is marred by his dread that the evil Voldemort is abroad and assembling dark forces, and a rift between the wizards who believe Harry and the Ministry of Magic, which insists there is nothing to fear. Worse, the sadistic Dolores Umbridge is appointed as a new teacher and sets out to make the pupils lives a misery ...<br/><br/>This is the fifth Harry Potter movie, and the series is starting to flag a little under the weight of its own plotting and the familiarity of its conceits. There are at least twenty key characters in this movie, which is really about ten too much for any film, and some of the plot strands seem unnecessary (such as Hagrid's giant half-brother, or Snape's tutelage against mental invasion). Abridging weighty books for the screen - J.K. Rowling's novel is just shy of eight-hundred pages - is tricky stuff; cut out too much and it becomes incoherent, but don't cut out enough and you rush through the magic of the story. There are plenty of agreeable thrills and spills here, but nothing we haven't seen in the previous movies. The quieter moments - like the scene where Harry and Sirius reflect on the Black Family tree - are curiously more effective than the hocus-pocus extravaganzas. It's still great quality entertainment though, doubly so for fans of the books, and this one has three wacky new characters; Luna Lovegood, an agreeably weird blonde girl with whom Harry identifies, the catty, mauve-bedecked, neat-freak-psycho-headmistress Dolores Umbridge and the gleefully-named Bellatrix Lestrange, a Gothic villainess escapee from Azkaban. It also brings back a lot of earlier characters, and develops more of the kids, notably the lovably weedy Neville Longbottom and Harry's sporadic love-interest Cho Chang. All of the ensemble are good, even if a lot of them are only in one or two scenes, but Radcliffe, Gambon and Rickman especially keep it going and Oldman steals the film as the esoteric Sirius Black. If I have one main problem with this movie it's that it's a bit heavy-going, a bit like adolescent angst meets C.S. Lewis; what made the original movie so much fun was its sense of comic innocence and imagination. As the overall story moves towards some good versus evil climactic battle, I hope the films aren't going to take themselves too seriously. Good blockbuster entertainment however, with excellent production design by Stuart Craig, arguably the only major player to work on all the movies thus far."

"XweAponX","10","0","3","13 January 2008"," Order of the Phoenix - Best Potter Yet!
","I saw the first Harry Potter film amidst a flurry of criticism that kids were being taught ""Witchcraft"" through these stories. Highly Unlikely, and rubbish. I guess the purple Teletubby is also gay and evil, as is Barney the Dinosaur. J.K. Rowling has created something that most American moviegoers do not grasp very well- English Humour and Morals. These movies show that anything can be used for bad, or good, whether it is ""magic"" or Technology- And are an encouragement for kids to always use any advantages they have to do the right thing. Therefore, the Jerry-Fallwellian idea that kids are badly influenced by the Potter series must be discarded.<br/><br/>In the films, these stories are rapidly changing from Kiddie stories, to exquisite interesting young adult mysteries- And I like the way the kids are growing up. What I really enjoyed about this one, is the return of several of my favourite characters. Mad Eye Moody, Padfoot, Remus Lupin, Professor Trelawney, Hagrid, and even Lucius Malfoy and my favourite, Ralph Fiennes as ""He who must be not be named"" - Everything about this film is done well, and as always I love the little vignettes at the beginning of each Potter movie, where there is always something that tries to prevent Potter from returning to Hogwart's. I especially liked this one... And the interaction between Potter and his cousin. Eventually Potter will have to have it out with The Dursleys, and this will be something that I will savor when it comes to pass.<br/><br/>There are a couple of things that are not explained... That archway? What was that? I suppose there was a reason why there was an Archway in the center of the department of mysteries... And why there was a pointed lack of discussion about it, except for Hermione's passive comment about the voices she could net hear (But we know Harry could hear them).<br/><br/>When I saw the first two Harry Potter films, I thought 'He who must not be named was to be the perennial antagonist, like Lex Luthor and Superman. But so far the progress of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's attempts to come back to the land of flesh have been from slightly irritating to very deadly. In this film the malevolence takes full adult form, and Potter deals with it in a mature way. And so it is not just about a silly little kid now... It is about a young man who has been confronted by darkness, who makes the best of the lot he has been given, embraces his friends, and asks all the questions about life any boy who is growing up would ask... And basically, that would be, in Potter's case, ""Am I Turning Bad?""<br/><br/>And if this movie, and the books and films based on the books, are filled with bad things, then I suppose Harry Potter would not be asking Dumbledore... ""Am I turning bad?"" - So instead of a manual for kids to learn magic spells, I rather see the Potter series as an entertaining way for kids to be influenced in a positive way. Who are the children that read and watch Harry Potter books going to imitate... Harry Potter, or Draco Malfoy?<br/><br/>Beginning with Prisoner of Azkeban, the films took a more mature and malevolent turn. I'd say the 3rd movie was the turning, and the ending of Goblet of Fire movie was hideously, fantastically, dark, leading directly to Order of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>And so all 4 of those stories set the tone for Order of the Phoenix, and the first half of the movie, I feel Potter's frustration, which is magnified by Professor/Undersecretary of Magic Umbrich. (I love cats, but any woman who has a collection of CAT-PLATES on her wall, er, has got Problems!)<br/><br/>It took me about 3 years to realise that I Love these stories, and I almost do not want read the books, because I am used to the stories unfolding the way Chris Columbus told us the first 2... Alfonso Cuarón gave the series a sharp NUDGE into the surreal with Prisoner of Azkeban, Followed by the slap in the face we get from Mike Newell in Goblet of Fire: David Yates had really no problem building on what had gone before, and he reminds us in most forceful way of the events following The Prisoner of Azkeban... So now a momentum has built up, and regardless of who directs the next film, all the pieces are now set in place.... (Except for the Womping Willow, where is the Womping Willow?)<br/><br/>My One Complaint is that movies 4 and 5 are desperately Lacking in Quiddich..."

","This movie just blew me away! Now, first I would like to say that I haven't read all the books, I've seen the first film before reading the first book, and my reading stayed behind my harry potter theatrical viewings ever since. I liked all the Potter movies, especially the third one, but this one just so much outshines all of them its not even funny anymore. The first thing I would like to point out here is the phenomenal acting. The cast of older English actors is great, as always, but the real surprise are the young talents, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grind and Emma Watson have made so much progress since the last movie, I could not believe my eyes! Watson is definitely the weak link here, though still being very good. Grind is spot on, displaying the little less goofy than usual Ron, as for Daniel Radcliffe ... It seems like he has finally grown up as an actor. He displays so much depth to the Potter character, he definitely steals the show. And there is another thing that needs to be mentioned: the incredible directing. This movie is by far the best envisioned, scripted and directed of all the Potter movies, the direction is a fine, never before seen mix of genres, taking elements from the LOTR movies, horror, thriller, drama, teenage romance, comedy, with little intimate moments, like the scene between Harry, Ron and Hermione after Harry gets his first kiss that add immensely to the reality of the characters. This movie is a complete 10, see it even if you didn't like the the Potter movies of past. If you can appreciate a finely crafted masterpiece you WILL love this movie."

In Order of the Phoenix, they've certainly delivered on his prediction.<br/><br/>In my opinion, one of the main reasons for the success of the Potter films has always been the culmination of a intelligent and committed crew with a exceptionally talented cast. On these terms, Phoenix met all of my expectations, delivering sterling production values along with a great deal of soul and energy emitted from the terrific cast.<br/><br/>There are some moments which may disappoint or confuse viewers, but not so many as to leave you with a sour taste in your mouth. For viewers who haven't read the books, some plot points might be a little tricky to follow, but there aren't many of these moments, and you can easily catch up with the story during later events. Some characters may not have much screen time, but with excellent supporting actors such as David Thewlis (Professor Lupin), Brendan Gleeson (Mad-Eye Moody), Alan Rickman (Professor Snape) and Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) on board, they won't feel underwritten, at least until you've finished watching the film.<br/><br/>The team which deserves the most praise for this wonderful film is the team of director David Yates, writer Michael Goldenberg and star Daniel Radcliffe. They have channelled all of their efforts into making this a sleek, efficient and tremendously entertaining film for both book and film fans alike. Yates, in particular, does an astonishing job, seeing as this is his first motion picture, directing with great skill and visual flair.<br/><br/>Goldenberg has written a superb screenplay, which delves into the characters (especially Harry and his godfather, Sirius Black), producing complex, heartfelt and compelling results. Although he has missed out elements of the plot which would have made the story clearer, he mostly constructs a fluid and gripping story. He also includes several good moments of humour, which help to counter the growing darkness which leaks from almost every scene. <br/><br/>Radcliffe delivers a brilliant performance as the titular wizard. Harry's situation may be more fantastical than normal events, but Radcliffe's main skill is that he never lets the character slip into fantasy mode, acting with an incredible weariness and humanity. His character makes mistakes, and he has to deal with their consequences. In other words, this is Radcliffe's best performance in the series, and probably the best performance of his career so far.<br/><br/>Indeed, some of the most impressive moments in the film aren't the excellent wand battles or the moments which are based around the visuals, but the more quiet scenes. Two grand examples are the tapestry room scene between Harry and Sirius (which was extremely moving), and the moment near the climax of the film which sees Harry being tortured by Voldemort within his mind, which packed intelligent and haunting power. It is scenes like these which provide the necessary emotional link to the hero, and that is why they are so compelling. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast also delivers. Alongside Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson give great performances as Ron and Hermione, Gary Oldman brings Sirius Black (my favourite character in the books) to powerful and charming life, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Bonham Carter's character and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort make superb villains and Imelda Staunton is utterly despicable as Dolores Umbridge, a political messenger who attempts to take over the wizard school of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is stunning. All of the creations are utterly convincing and well conceived (except perhaps Grawp, a childish, muddy giant who is a little too cute for my tastes). The spells that the pupils and adults use have a great range, from spells which cause light to spring from wands to spells which cause imminent death. There is also some cracking action, which I will not spoil for you.<br/><br/>Overall, Order of the Phoenix is a tremendous achievement, and one of the best films in the series thus far. If you haven't seen it by now, seek it out immediately!"

","After the first 15 minutes, I could sense that this wasn't going to be like the other HP movies. This one has a dark, gloomy mood about it which isn't helped by Harry's frequent temper outbursts. As Dumbledore put it towards the end of Goblet of Fire (HP4) ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead"", so this installment says it all. That means that for Harry, Ron and Hermione and their friends it's no longer enjoyment and pleasure as usual.<br/><br/>However, despite the dark mood of the film, it was great entertainment as the main actors have shown that they have matured with experience. Radcliffe, despite his dark moods, has matured with his age and shows that he could be a great star in future. Grint is no more the usual inferior Ron but has also matured with his age. And Watson? She simply gets better and better and is now growing into a real English rose with her looks. Ralph Fiennes (who I regard as a very handsome guy in reality) looks better as Voldemort and meaner too. Matthew Lewis is more assured as Neville and Bonnie Wright is also making her character Ginny more likable.<br/><br/>As for the new characters, Imelda Staunton is really mean as Umbridge and played her so well and I think that Helena B. Carter was quite good as Bellatrix Lestrage. But for me, among the new characters the one who really stands out is Evanna Lynch, who plays Luna Lovegood. Lynch is as pretty as the character she plays and I think she portrayed Luna almost exactly as Rowling described her. I believe she can get better in the next HP movie.<br/><br/>I heard people complaining that the film was not exactly true to the book and, in truth, I have a few complaints. But it doesn't take anything from this movie. The complaints of most people are mainly that several scenes in the book were omitted from the movie and not that the acting was terrible. If the acting was terrible then I would have cause to complain. But it wasn't and that's what makes this installment tick. For those of you who are complaining, you should not have expected everything in the book to be cramped into the movie, otherwise we may have gotten a 5-hour-long bore instead of a 137-minute flick. See the movie as a movie that it is and you will enjoy it. But if you are going to whine about the plot, then here's my verdict: If you think that because of the omissions, this movie is rubbish, then NO MOVIE (AND I MEAN NONE AT ALL!!) WILL MAKE YOU SATISFIED, AND YOU SHOULD NOT WASTE YOUR TIME TO WATCH ANY MOVIE AT ALL!! Because I know that several good movies in the past have thin plots.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a 9/10 and despite the dark atmosphere, there is a lot about it that is worth remembering. And that's great!"
"ihatethinkingofusernames","8","0","1","22 December 2007"," I Loved It
","Don't listen to all those other people--watch this movie!! Overall, I loved it. I am not a huge fan of the previous movies, and the books, (besides #3), but i loved this movie. Ties for my favorite with Prisoner of Azkaban. The other movies and books I really can't stand all that much.<br/><br/>David Yates does an excellent job. Others have said that they leave too much out, but come on--the book was amazingly long and you cannot keep every minute detail. All the characters' acting has also improved greatly.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie includes a great flying scene throughout the city, with some very good music accompanying it. The story moves along and does not get bogged down. The acting is sincere. I actually think it is an extremely good representation of the book, but also makes an extremely good movie in of itself.<br/><br/>I love the basis of this installment, that the students are assembling Dumbledore's Army to fight against Voldermort. They rebel, holding Defense Against the Dark Arts Practice in a secret room in Hogwarts. This whole sequence has to be my favorite.<br/><br/>You will literally begin to hate Mrs. Umbridge, as the actress does an amazing job portraying her. Dan, Rupert, and Emma all do an excellent and improved job at their roles. Sirius and the whole gang also do great.<br/><br/>The end sequence is one of the most exciting and best put together. There will be moments where your heartstrings will be tugged, and you will marvel at how long its been since the first movie and book came out and how everyone, including yourself, has gotten older.<br/><br/>Even if you are not a Harry Potter fan, you will like this movie. Even if you are, you will like this movie. It's very good--go see it!! (and I heard the HD version is amazing!)"
"zarembazwoman","Null","0","1","21 December 2007"," I'm shocked at how few have actually read the books
","I'm shocked at the number of questions that readers of the books would know the answers to are asked on your ""FAQ"" board. Haven't any of you people read the books? The films are nice, but they are no way to really get the ""Harry Potter Experience"". There is so much more depth to the people and the stories in the books. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is my favorite of them all. I haven't yet seen the film of it and I may never see it, because I don't want it to ruin my favorite book. (I've read OOTP five times.) Also, nobody talks about how brilliantly Rowling has depicted the rise of fascism in her tale of the takeover of Hogwarts by the Ministry for Magic. I'll bet THAT doesn't come across in the film.<br/><br/>I think it is most important for young people to read the book and learn what rising fascism is like. After all, this is happening in the real world right now, and I believe J.K. Rowling has performed a real public service in addition to writing a terrific story of the world of magic."

","Well there was very few things bad to say about this movie. I would rather see a summary of the movie then, lets add this because it would be cooler than what was in the book. The Dragon Scene in the 4th movie was a waist of time and money. Now there are going to be fans of the movies turning to the fourth book going where is the Dragon fight with harry? As for the 5th movie great job on keeping to the plot but they need to remember they didn't start the series so they Should not have change the Demntors look. They look like flying death eaters. They should have stayed with how the originals look from the 3rd film.I wish they would have spent more time on the department of mysteries like all the rooms they went through they could have done each room briefly. I wish the would have done the magical hospital and had lock hart there too."
"anifanmc","8","0","1","19 December 2007"," Not the best, but definitely not the worst
","As a foreword, I'll say that this is definitely one of my least favorite out of the seven books. No question about it. However, as far as film-making goes, Yates managed to put it in at least a somewhat tolerable light.<br/><br/>The film concentrates on Harry's isolation as he and his group of friends - and later on, his Army - are ridiculed for even suggesting that the dark lord Voldemort has returned to power from what seems like death. The Ministry of Magic has deemed him nearly a threat to national security and has started running a smear campaign against him and his idol, Albus Dumbledore. However, looming over all of this is the fact that Voldemort *is* still alive and that he is trying to kill Harry, but for a reason that few people know or understand.<br/><br/>The movie manages to omit nearly half of the book, but does so in a way that makes it proceed with grace instead of clumsiness. The tone of the movie is considerably darker than most of its predecessors (the notable exception being Alfonso Cuaron's Azkaban) but brings a new dimension to the films. The musical score gives a gentle but powerful feel to the film for the viewer. Harry's character is moderately more three-dimensional than his performances in Goblet, and seems to take the screen time at face value and perform accordingly. A few of the more minor characters are given their due, including Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley. This is all, however, at the cost of the development for Ron, who seems to have been relegated to a humorous sidekick role rather than Harry's most trusted friend and confidante. Emma Watson as Hermione seems to fill the role somewhat but it doesn't bring about the feeling of compatriot-ship that Harry and Ron share.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw is Michael Gambon's portrayal of Albus Dumbledore. As a self-professed disliker of Gambon's performance from the start, I will admit that his performance was marginally better than that of Goblet (throwing Harry against the trophy cases killed that one for me) but he eschews the book's serene, majestic Dumbledore for that of a Gandalf in Harry Potter's world - that too, an angry Gandalf. In fact I have no doubt Ian McKellan would have fit into the role with much greater ease. Gambon doesn't deny these allegations - he admits having never read the Potter books - but scenes which would have been pivotal in defining the audience's view of the headmaster, such as his meeting with Harry after Sirius's death, and his explanation of the prophecy, were completely botched. Gambon simply doesn't fit into the mold, and viewers can recognize it.<br/><br/>Other than that, Fiennes' Voldemort and Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange were fantastic additions. Jason Isaac's Lucius Malfoy was no less well scripted. A must-see for a Potter fan."
"b92g","5","0","1","17 December 2007"," This isn't a ""Movie"".....
","it's a collection of out-take scenes from the book that are lumped together to fill the run time.<br/><br/>To be fair, Rowling's books are simply too filled with things we all want to see. There is so much to choose from that the director and the producers have the unenviable task of deciding what to include and what to delete from the film.<br/><br/>Any of these films could easily be twice their length, and we would all stand in line, happily and willingly, to gain entrance to the four, or five, or six, hour experience.<br/><br/>That said, this film is just too choppy to be enjoyed. There's just enough of the story to move the film along, but there isn't enough continuity to be satisfying. And, you absolutely have to have read the book to have any understanding of the fleeting snippets you get, to understand what occurs.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the out-takes, by-all-means enjoy the film. For me, there is so much left out, even understanding why, that they're (the films) just not enjoyable any more.<br/><br/>I'll likely skip the last two movies...and re-watch the first two, or three."
"d1494","Null","0","1","17 December 2007"," A hurried, dark, loveless affair
","Despite the hysterical protests of Harry Potter fans who seem willing to accept anything Hollywood dishes out, OotP is such a poor serving it wouldn't give anyone enough soulful nourishment to make even a wispy patronus. As one of the most important books in the series, OotP has to bring the movie audience along with Harry and his friends as they finally start to take a more adult portion of life. Unfortunately most these elements are left out and the three friends' time together seems uncomfortable and disconnected for the first time in the film series. The director's shallow emphasis on 'darkness'' totally misses the point of this film, which is Harry fighting his feelings of isolation, vulnerability and guilt as he begins to access Voldemort's thoughts and feelings. And it is Harry's developing sense of leadership as he takes on the mantle of the number one foe of Voldemort. I first saw the film in IMAX and the 3D sequence was dazzling, but when watching the film on the small screen, one misses the human moments which make up the core of the Potter stories. One also misses the sense of wonder the first films managed to convey. As a fan of the books, some compromise is needed in order to enjoy the films because so much is left out, but this time the journey seems not worth the effort. I'd give this film a 6 out of 10."

","First, let me say, I have not read any of the books in this series.<br/><br/>ALSO: Let me state,. Film Studios have been changing Books & Plays for as long as they have been making films. There have been instances where the entire story of the book was junked & only the title and a few names were used from the original novel.<br/><br/>I just read a few comments on what they altered here. Do these writers realize that to put all of the novel in the movie would entail an 8 hour or more film. I am also quite sure Miss Rowling approved all the changes made.<br/><br/>Harry & the other young actors are growing up & acting more adult now. THANKKFULLY.<br/><br/>Everyone one the cast is first rate, BUT I must single out Imelda Staunton, In her cheery disposition, she comes across as evil personified. A villianess of the first order. She deserves an Oscar nomination for her performance,.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe as Harry will become one of our better actors when he advances to more adult roles.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman, thankfully has more to do in this chapter, I wish David Thewliss had more to do as well..

","I have always like the Harry Potter and after I saw the third which I loved and the fourth I really like I could not wait for the fifth and which I was told that one was the best book by my friends. When I first saw the trailer I knew this movie was going to be great and then when I saw the movie when it came out I got a little more than I thought I would. This movie mood and feeling is very dark and you kinda felt what Harry was going though. The directing is fantastic for someone just come to the Harry Potter series and kept up with the good movie. The acting like the other movies are great and even better. I really don't know if the film keeps true to the book but I have heard mix reactions with that and other than that the writing is pretty good. If you are a fan of Harry Potter and fantasy film this is no question you have too see this film."

","As a story, Order of the Phoenix is easily my second favorite of the series (behind Deathly Hallows). In the first four films we never really experience the true girth of the story at hand. It's all about the children developing into mature young adults who fully comprehend the wizarding battle and, more importantly, the danger of Lord Voldemort so that by the time we get to the last three stories they are prepared for battle against him and we can fully focus on the war at hand. There's always a great story/mystery with the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and how they always end up being the complete opposite of what they appear to be, and of course the genius of Sirius Black's introduction in Prisoner of Azkaban always amazes me but the story always centers around the children and their growth.<br/><br/>Order brings the series up to the dark, epic scale that makes Harry Potter's overall journey so phenomenal. It let's the audience know that there is a war coming. Each team is gathering their forces (the Order is rejoining and finding new members, especially in the form of Dumbledore's Army created by Hogwarts students who know there is a war coming and prepare to fight when it does and Voldemort gathering his Death Eaters and attempting to find the prophecy that he didn't have the first time) and the connection between Harry and Voldemort that was subtly mentioned in the first four films really takes center stage in this one. The final thirty minutes kept me glued to my seat with the sensational battle that is only a precursor for the epic war that's going to take place in the final two films, and then the epic duel between Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort that was beefed up from the novel and ended up being one of the most astonishing experiences I've ever had watching a film.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about how brilliant the overall story of the series is, and Order of the Phoenix brings the idea of war right on the surface preparing everyone (the characters and the audience) for the epic scale that's going to take place in Half-Blood Prince. As always the visuals, cinematography and art direction are some of the best I've ever seen and possibly the best of the year. Overall, the performances are fantastic. The regular children are getting better and better as time goes on (Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were magnificent in this one) aside from Daniel Radcliffe who is just keeping a steady pace of horrific acting; his scenes of anger and frustration ended up being absolutely laughable.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is flawless as always. I wish they hadn't cut so much out of the occlumency sessions but they still presented what was integral to the story and added a lot of depth to Snape. Gary Oldman's return was also very well-done and he once again proved that he's one of the finest actors in the series. As always, everyone is underused (particularly David Thewlis who is one of the best actors alive, delivered one of the series' best performances in Prisoner of Azkaban and was insulted with not a single word of dialogue in this film) but that's to be expected. However the film does introduce quite possibly the two greatest performances of the entire series. Feeling as if they were ripped from the pages of the book and put onto the screen, Helena Bonham Carter (as the sadistic, maniac Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange) and Evanna Lynch (in her film debut as the whimsical Luna Lovegood) perfectly capture their characters like I could never have imagined.<br/><br/>As always there were some exclusions from the book that upset me greatly; the final conversation between Dumbledore was over ten pages in the book and left me in tears (a conversation which also explains why Harry has to go back to the Dursleys every summer instead of removing him from that terrible place) while in the film it was a barely-memorable minute chat and they cut so much out of the ending (Harry's conversation with Luna about the fate of the dead and Moody's threat to the Dursleys, in particular). But exclusions are to be expected and they weren't nearly as horrific as they were in Goblet of Fire, so it's easy to forgive. Order of the Phoenix is by far the second best film in the series, behind Azkaban, one of the most entertaining films of the year and a perfect epic journey from start to finish. The best apart about it all is that it's just a precursor for the epic scale and sensational wizarding war that will take place in the next two films. I can't wait."

","Of course it isn't the same as the book. If you want that then stay in your room and read the book. Your imaginings are not the same as Freds or Georges or the girl next door. They are yours. So that when a directors view is presented, then, go with the flow. I enjoyed this movie as pure escapism with great characters and wonderful creatures, and yes even the Directors view of how the film should be, given the fact that the film cant be 20 hours long and he cant put in every fullstop and comma. I also viewed the deleted scenes and can only say that it would have been nice if Emmas extra bits had been left in as she was so funny (and I am a great admirer of hers and her illustrious parentage)But apart from that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found the part of the story where all the pictures where removed and the halls bleak, so reminiscent of Dickens, to be quite poignant. I would (as many other reviewers have) like to give a Gold Star to Luna who was played so ethereally Evanna. To my mind she played the role perfectly. As far as Mr Gambon well each must make the role his own and I feel that he did, again as someone said earlier we all like at least one of the Bonds. Oh and if Daniel is reading this (as if!) then I wish he would wear his glasses when he appears as himself in public (buy different ones if you feel that you are still in character) as he always has the look of someone who cant see too clearly without them (sort of faraway and distracted{more than ever like Harry than he realises})"

","Harry Potter movies are the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. They aren't brilliant by any degree, but they are so freakin' entertaining and engrossing they have me on the edge of my seat like a pre-pubescent school girl. YAY! 'Order of the Phoenix', by...(read more) far the most captivating of the five movies, is completely satisfying from beginning to end. The entire cast is back for this installment and all are great as always. The stand-out of course is Academy Award Nominee Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake, Chicken Run) who is absolutely delightful as the ruthless Hogwarts teacher who always has a giddy smile on her face. My only complaint with these movies is the fact that Harry Potter never loses. The movies never have an unhappy ending, and life isn't like that. I hope the next movie ends with Harry Potter defeated. Not dead, but just in a bad situation. They did it in the Star Wars saga with 'Empire Strikes Back', why can't they do it with this? What kinda message does that teach kids. That no matter what the good guys always win. Pbbt! That's bullshit, if you teach your kid that you shouldn't be a parent. Anyway, enough of my little bitch-fit rant, all in all 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' was a wholly enjoyable film that any Fantasy movie fan could appreciate. Will the next one be better? I dunno, I don't read the books. Grade: A-"
"rn_light_under_darkness","7","0","1","18 November 2007"," Normal Harry Potter experience
","I'm giving it a 7 because of the fact that the only original thing they did was improve the special effects. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, well as good as you could expect from someone trying to turn a book into a movie, never quite comes out right. Once again the acting of the cast is sub par, quite appalling for the now 17+ actor Daniel Raddcliffe, his acting is choppy, sometimes even over dramatic, and that's saying much for the limited actor that he is. Actors Evanna Lynch(Luna Lovegood) Mark Williams(Mr. Weasly) and a few of the others, including Emma Watson (Hermione) are the only ones that really play a convincing character. Not to mention the fact that Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) is an over dramatic actor, the Goblet of Fire movie can completely complement this statement, where he shrieks at Harry Potter when his name comes out of the Goblet. Often times he either over-reacts or under-reacts. They couldn't have chosen a worse replacement for the original Dumbledore. Besides the obvious flaws, one being that Harry Potters scar changes sides during the duration of the film, switching from the right to the left side. It's what I've become to expect from the Harry Potter movies, they've switched directors more often than one changes a light bulb, every new movie has a new director, and the only director I've seen that can hold par with the books is Chris Columbus. He is by far the best director the movies have seen, keeping in context with the books as close as one could, unlike the director in the third movie, it seems that all of the directors try to ""make it their own"" they like to take things that hold nothing in common with the books and try to incorporate them into the movies, you could take something completely irrelevant and they would try to use it with the movies. The director of The Prisoner of Azakaban tried to over-do a lot of the aspects of the movie, he let them walk around school with their uniforms untucked, when they have a dress code for a reason. I personally have never had a dress code when I was in school, but if you go to a boarding school where they make you wear a uniform you get in trouble for not wearing it, or if it's disheveled you have to fix it. One of the major problems I had with the Order of The Pheonix is the way they went about the film, they made it look like news paper clippings in between scenes. Completely uncalled for, seeing as you're not exactly reading a newspaper, why incorporate a newspaper into every other scene, or in fact when trying to speed up time. It doesn't make sense does it? The fight scenes are well done, I'll give them that much. But overall, I wouldn't go see it in the theaters again. Nothing too spectacular from this movie, just sub par acting on top of a sub par screen write. My advice is to wait for the DVD."
"Pianoman9182","Null","0","1","18 November 2007"," Only a couple of flaws....
","Okay first off I should say that i am a huge fan of the books. As well as the movies(but more the books). I also must say that the 5th book is my least favorite of all the books. But this is not a review on the book, its a review on the movie. So here we go: First I will review it as just a movie and pretend i haven't read the book: The acting I believe is the strongest it has been in all the movies, from the kids as well as the adults. Imelda Stauton does a brilliant job at playing Umbridge and is exactly like the way I imagined her. The action is awesome. The end fight is just amazing. Although the movie seems to drag at some points but you can easily get past that. The characters are strong and the direction as a whole is quite good, it sets a much needed dark tone casting away the happy go lucky 1st and 2nd movies.<br/><br/>Now on to the criticisms as I review it keeping the book in mind: Again the 5th book is my least favorite of the HP books. My main problem is a big one. The adapting of the book into a screenplay. Ugh where do I begin: Okay first off let me just say it plain and simple, I BELIEVE I COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB ADAPTING IT!(and yes i am a writer) I mean did the guy even read the book?!?!?!??! They not only left many parts out but they even left character development out AND put in stuff THAT Wasn't EVEN THERE TO BEGIN WITH! Even though the KEY elements were there, there just wasn't enough story from the original book.They left characters out and plot lines and ugh I'm just getting angry thinking about it. I think that i am angry because i am such a fan of the books. <br/><br/>But EVEN WITH the writing flaws it is still a good movie, and probably my 2nd favorite out of the movie series which means this is the first movie ever that i liked the movie better than the book (well not entirely true i like lord of the rings better than the books). Which is why i give it 8 stars out of ten. Because really there is just ONE big flaw. Thank You."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007, Dir. David Yates) <br/><br/>It's another year at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his friends. The previous year, he witnessed not just the death of Cedric Diggory, but also the return of the Dark Lord, Voldemort. The ministry of magic doesn't believe everything Harry says and will do anything to keep everyone calm. Hogwarts begin changing, especially when Dolores Umbridge arrives to take over the school. Now, with Voldemort's army getting closer, Harry and his friends must teach themselves and form an army to take on the upcoming threat.<br/><br/>With 7 books in total, the fifth movie is released. Question is, will it be as great as the previous four movies. It's not as great as the other movies...it's better! All the acting amongst the younger cast is improving, with all the wonderful characters. The story is much more improved upon the previous films. In this film, you can feel more emotion in the characters and you can really feel hated towards the characters you have to hate. The special effects are great as always, but there are the odd scene which does seem as they were nearing the end of their budget. The action scenes are the best yet, with an amazing wand battle at the end, which is so eye opening and like nothing you've seen in the 'Harry Potter' series before. Roll on the sixth instalment.<br/><br/>""LOOK AT ME!"" - Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)"
"megaman421","3","0","1","11 November 2007"," My problems with this films are as follows:
","1) Comic relief The line, ""I don't want my brother coming out of that bathroom with nothing but his dick in his hands"" from The Godfather, apart from being a seemingly out-of-place humorous line, helps us to identify with the character and underscores the tension of the scene.<br/><br/>Granted that you can't compare The Godfather to Harry Potter, but this does illustrate how badly comic relief was handled in OotP - it is used in almost every scene in the film, and makes it impossible to take many of the villains, and in fact much of the film, seriously.<br/><br/>Example. When we're given a scene where Umbridge is giving a negative assessment of Trelawney's teaching skills that is clearly presented in a comedic fashion, it makes it impossible to empathize with Trelawney for being fired almost three minutes later.<br/><br/>In fact every scene involving Umbridge, Malfoy, Fudge, or any other antagonist is injected with comic relief, usually in the form of deliberately exaggerated acting or slapstick. But then again, if seeing Filtch sitting at a fold-out table eating an American-cut ham sandwich waiting for the room of requirement to open doesn't impede on your ability to suspend disbelief, then be my guest.<br/><br/>2) Time budgeting.<br/><br/>I'm hardly one of those fan boys who picks apart every scene from the book that didn't make it into the film, but given that we've seen the longest book made into the shortest film, I'm not going to accept it when major plot points are eschewed to fit in twenty-five additional minutes of meaningless banter.<br/><br/>Example. Given that the ""Snape's worst memory"" scene is debatably the most powerful scene in the entire series, would have killed anybody to devote thirty seconds of screen time to it rather than ten? Scenes with the kids hanging around in their dormitory listening to Rooney seem to never end, but the climactic scenes go by at such a fast-forward pace that if you turn your head and cough, you will miss at least several important occurrences. Given that if the film had even been as long as what was previously the shortest in the series this could have been less of a problem, there is no excuse.<br/><br/>3) Actual budgeting.<br/><br/>In GoF, we get an extremely visually compelling scene in which Harry talks to Sirius through the fireplace. We see a pile of ashes and embers start to mold into a human face until they vaguely resemble Gary Oldman's. In this film, for the same scenario, we see Gary Oldman's disembodied face floating around in what could have been a tenth-grade graphic design student's submission to Youtube.<br/><br/>Oh, and why does Grawp look like George W. Bush? In conclusion, this doesn't even need to compare to other actual films for it to fall flat, all you need to do is compare it to earlier entries in the series to see that it doesn't hold up in any way. Compare any actor's performance here to their performance in a previous Potter film (the flat of direction), compare the special effects, the costumes, the way the subject matter is treated, anything, and this film comes across as amateurish, hurried, and impotent. The fact that this same director has already signed on for HBP proves that Euripides was a very wise man."
"jamiesampson","8","0","1","18 October 2007"," The most deftly handled and exciting one yet.
","There's a moment in the latest Potter instalment that makes you feel really old. It's a flashback from the very first film of a minuscule, bowl-haired Daniel Radcliffe staring into a mirror. It's hard to imagine that charming young moppet strutting around a Westend stage in the buff or flicking condoms at Diana Rigg on BBC comedy Extras. It's enough to make you say with a sigh: ""my hasn't he grown?"" Yes it seems hardly yesterday that Warner Bros.' fantasy franchise first obliterated box office records with Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, way back in 2001. Six years, five films and millions of dollars later Warner Bros.' star pupil is still on a roll, but things have changed slightly. Clearly it's true what they say, time flies when you're having fun. <br/><br/>While the Potter films have been getting better for years, growing along with their audience, Order of the Phoenix would appear to be the first genuinely cinematic offering. Sure Mike Newell upped the scale to impressive effect with Goblet of Fire, but as a result the British boarding school familiarity that's so much a part of Potter's charm was lost in the din. It would appear that David Yates, the fourth director to take on the challenge, is the first that confidently tackles the text and successfully blends all its elements. Seemly unconcerned by his unwieldy source material (at a monstrous seven hundred and sixty six pages it's the most rambling of Rowling's series) Yates and scribe Michael Goldenberg effectively hone in on the central threads of the book and cast off the baggage. After all, do we really need to dwell on Harry's career advice and exam revision sessions? The result is a slick, stunning and often downright spectacular fantasy treat, grand but still with its feet planted firmly on the ground. Unlike its predecessors, which often created the sense of a hurried flick through the novel's key chapters as a series of disconnected scenes, OOTP flows nicely, with several terrifically staged montages accompanied by a rousing score by new composer Nicholas Hooper. The most innovative of these moments are when we literally soar through a series of blaring propagandist newspaper headlines, rejuvenating that overused cliché and effectively propelling the narrative forward without losing the pace. The first Potter to really experiment with editing, the boy wizard's internal struggle with Voldermort is strikingly portrayed with dramatically spliced images and the occasional surrealist flair. But there's also plenty of time for laughs, provided largely by the sickly sweet new teacher Dolores Umbridge and the leering school caretaker Filch. As the pink-wearing, kitten-loving, well spoken Umbridge, Imelda Staunton has created the most loathsome Rowling creature we've come across so far, topping even Fienne's histrionically 'eeevil' He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. A deliciously toxic combination of Vera Drake and Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, Umbridge defines the 'wolf in sheep's clothing', embodying those most terrifying of women who disguise malevolence with middle-class manners. Also joining a cast that will surely include every notable British thesp before long (I'm holding out for an appearance by Bill Nighy, surely an essential addition to the rogues gallery) Bonham Carter does a great job with limited screen time as cackling lunatic Bellatrix Lestrange. The regular kids hold up well, although Watson's Hermione is still too god-damned earnest, and newcomer Evanna Lynch is ethereal perfection as the kooky Luna Lovegood. Meanwhile, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Brendan Gleeson make welcome returns to take control of the drama as the Order, lending some deftly handled gravitas to the affair. Now most of the players are introduced and Rowling's world is well established it's time to roll up robe sleeves and cut loose. A frenzied penultimate magical skirmish in which the members of the Order go head to head with Voldermort's Deatheaters finally propels Potter from fun kiddie romp into an adult world of real peril and violence. Coupling awesome effects with a breathtaking, adrenaline-fuelled pace, we're not left wanting. And that's even before the Voldermort vs Dumbledore finale: a vicious, super-scaled, explosive showstopper easily deserving a place alongside fantasy cinema's greatest stand-offs. <br/><br/>Despite all these improvements and triumphs, Phoenix, like its predecessors, remains a companion to its literary counterpart rather than a film in its own right. Warner Bros. having denied themselves the perspective afforded other filmmakers who are able to observe the overview of a completed literary series before adapting it, there's now also some inevitable groping around in the dark. With the retrospect now afforded us with the release of Rowling' seventh and final novel we notice some small omissions in OOTP which, though not immediately necessary, might prove problematic later on. Unless she's deliberately trying to sabotage these adaptations, you'd assume Rowling would have thought to point these things out. Furthermore, whilst the variety of directors has lent the franchise new perspectives, it's also affected the continuity from film to film. Newell's decision to end his GOF on an oddly upbeat note instead of a foreboding cliff-hanger could lead to some confusion at the start of OOTP which returns to a decidedly traumatised boy-who-lived. But at least through some neat flashbacks there's now some attempt to draw things together, and with the news that Yates is signed on for Potter number six, these transitional hiccoughs will surely be a thing of the past. Roll on Half-Blood Prince."

","After ""Goblet of Fire"" I wasn't so sure seeing any subsequent Potter movies would be really worth it, considering the books keep getting longer and longer and the movies, by mainstream default, must cut a lot out to fit comfy feature presentation time. However, enough people were actually pleased with this movie that I figured I'd give it a whirl, and it turned out all right.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna bother tedious comparisons with the book or trying to summarize that plot: let's face it, if you're at all interested in watching this movie, you've read the book and will notice the differences between book and film yourself. It's kind of a moot point, really. Here, however, is the breakdown that matters: For the very first time, it seems that the filmmakers have managed to take the best and most important scenes from ""Order of the Phoenix"" and string them together in a relatively hole-less film narrative. There's some things to be wanted with Cho and Harry's relationship, and the Occlumency lessons could have offered more, but for once the film version manages to feel a little more stand-alone than the other movies, which pretty much depended on the audience's familiarity on the books to explain how one scene fit with any other. That, my friends, is a good thing.<br/><br/>Also, of key importance is the fact that it seems they've finally managed to get casting relatively down pat. Natalia Tena as Tonks, Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange all do their roles well and all, except in the case of the latter (and I love you Helena, but it's true) fit pretty much pitch perfect into the characters described in the book. Now Imelda Staunton as Umbridge... THAT was absolute perfect casting with absolutely perfect acting, and not only does she delight in the role (which helps it work so well), but I think director David Yates delights in it as well, as she pretty much gets more screen-time than any other character minus Harry himself. In fact, I'm sure some fans will bemoan the pushing of Ron and Hermione into much smaller supporting roles as a necessity for making room for these two giants of the story, but honestly, it's nice to have evil-with-a-relish without having to rely on Alan Rickman all the time.<br/><br/>Finally, I express some disappointment that the action in the Department of Mysteries had to be so cut short, but it's made up for with a pretty gorgeous battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort that's pretty much worth the price of a rental alone.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, Harry is back as a moody and grumpy teenage who is having a crush on his school senior. We all remember Harry as the cute and adorable child whose life changed overnight when he was brought to the Hogwarts, school of wizardy and witchcraft, but in this 5th installation, Harry is not just going through adolescence but is also disturbed by the rise of he-who-must-not-be-named, what the heck, Voldemort.<br/><br/>Before I saw the movie myself, I heard a lot of bad reviews from fellow friends who watched it. Being more dark, and scary, the book version of this movie in fact that concerns from the Malaysian Censorship boards, accusing the books for being too scary for the kids (i think the censorship board itself got spooked out). Gone are the scenes of introduction to the wizarding world and enchanting creatures.. the only creatures you see in this episode are the ones that are trying to kill Harry, but why you may ask, thanks to Tom Riddle (many don't know this is Voldemort's real name) he has managed to collect support from many creatures to be a part of his Death Eaters.<br/><br/>What disappointed me in the movie is that the lack of certain plots that were not portrayed as well as the book. And the character development (except Harry) is horrible, his friends have been turned into cheap side-kicks that we see in cheap action flicks. Dumbledore himself has been cut into very small part, but yet an important one, and Professor Gonagall, is almost non-existent. Nevertheless,even with the minimal footage on Voldemort, he has made a huge impact, played by the good-looking Ralph Fiennes, in fact a lot of work must have gone into giving him the skinny, pale, nose-less face look, which reminds me of another person who could have played the role to the tee, Michael Jackson perhaps? I hope the spoof makers of Epic are listening.. LOL... lastly cho chang doesn't look as good as the Goblet of Fire movie, or maybe my DVD was just a bad copy...<br/><br/>The impressive parts of the movie, no it was not the 'wet' kiss between Harry and Cho Chang, but the graphics and cinematography.. it is amazing how they visualised the story conceived by JK Rowling, and most amazingly, I still do not stop wondering, how did JK actually came up with this huge amount of imagination.. it is just Amazing with a capital A. Dementors are getting more terrifying, in fact they get more footage compared to Harry's friends.<br/><br/>Final verdict, don't watch the movie, grab the book, start all the way up from book#1."

Stunning special effects, high-quality sound and musical support – all it’s during all film – the Order of the Phoenix is gripping, thrilling, colorful, entire!<br/><br/>Since the first minutes the film grips the attention and holds it to the end! This part emotionally intense. There is an confrontation with (with the certain high power, authority) that it should seemed to be with good side. The struggle reaches maximal form of the expression. If happened one incorrect step, Hogwards would be under threat. Is obvious also the resistance of a school environment.<br/><br/>There are themes of a fidelity, faithfulness, trust, loneliness, friendship, steadfastness. All characters and events are explained, everything is clear.<br/><br/>The film appeared very entire, as against the previous part! All events smoothly spill over in others. The excellent plans, flights of camera, dynamics and shot change. Lessons of penetration in memoirs – good montage, this illusion is also realistic.<br/><br/>The film impresses very much! The Order of the Phoenix is full of all attributes of the magic world: Dementors, magic wand, post owls, flying and speaking letters-envelopes, moving people in pictures and newspapers, exciting flights on brooms over night city, house-spirit elves, fabulous magic underground city, Thestrals, flying candles under a ceiling, portals, effective magic lessons and trainings, levitation, magic Christmas, splendid fireworks of George and Fred, giant, centaurs, stupendous magic battles in the end (separate thanks for battle Dumbledore with ...) etc.!!!<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe is genius!!! Radcliffe ideally lived the role, played emotionally, psychologically, dramatically. It can be estimated everywhere in this film, for example, on the takings before forming of Dumbledore’s army, in dialogs with Umbridge, when Potter is teacher in Dumbledore’s army, or after collective final battle in dramatic moments … Everywhere Radcliffe was real Potter, simply got used to an image of Potter. Feeling, heartfelt, sincere, pathetic, thoughtful, pensive eyes, look!!! Bravo Daniel Radcliffe!!! Bravo Potter!!!<br/><br/>Dumbledore in this part has shown his greatness, wisdom, firmness, power. Excellent!.<br/><br/>Hermione is good. There were many smiles – to the side of one of the characters - but at the first meeting with Harry (about injustice after law-court,), it seemed, after she has said the phrases, her further smile was not in a theme. But all actors did their utmost! It was impressive story!<br/><br/>And finally, I shall note the important words were said in “The Order of the Phoenix”: "" Certainly, training is necessary. But there is something more important - is your belief in yourself! Don’t forget that all great wizards in a history were such as we - young! If they could – so we’ll be able!

","I don't know if anyone else has pointed this out or not but during ""Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix"" there was a mistake. Though a small mistake, storyline wise it was actually quite big. You see the whole story starts in 1981 when Harry was just over a year old and so at the beginning of this film when harry's supposed to be 14 going on 15 it would be 1995 not 2007, so how come in the common room scene you could hear ""boys will be boys"" by ordinary boys. This song was not around in 1995. This is to me a big plot hole. Hope you don't find me too sad for noticing, but to a book reader there are bits were the time-line is mentioned more than in the film and surfice it to say that when the last film is done the none book readers will suddenly click to such a mistake."
"folsominc2","1","0","2","7 September 2007"," Harry Potter has run PAST his course
","On Friday night, I went to see the long awaited Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix release 2007 and heaved a strong heartfelt sigh  when it finally ended. I couldn't believe the mess of hodge-podge facts, characters and special affects tossed into two hours wasted sitting in the theater. Boring from the beginning to end, I was sorely tempted to leave prematurely.<br/><br/>The first two Harry Potter films were rather unique and unusual and had a significant depth of plot, characterization, and enough surprise affects to make it interesting. By movies three and four, the characters were getting hackneyed, the entire landscape of Hogwarts changed, and of course, the cast lost the artistic genius of Richard Harris who had perfected Dumbledore.<br/><br/>However, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the entire movie was one special affect after another with no gradual build-up of the characters. More and more new characters were brought in up until almost the final scene. The flow of the movie gave no release to the viewer with highs and lows but just continual adrenalin charges.<br/><br/>Which is even a worse film-making crime than introducing new characters in a movie/plot in the last scenes is finishing a movie with even one subplot without closure which was done to at least five. Apparent cheating in this movie by tossing ""newspaper"" details at the screen to wound up a few of the subplots was a cheap step and the headlines were presented too fast to read the gist of the story so the viewer is left without a feeling of completion.<br/><br/>Another obvious cheat to film-making is cutting from scene to scene without any gradual fading and killing off more and more characters that are considered ""loved"" ones of Harry, but are not really dead, are they? Put all this with the entire thread of the plot that weaves through all sequels  Lord Voldemort's connection with Harry is getting stronger  is giving a flavor not too unfamiliar to that of the 1970s Star Wars Luke Skywalker's connection to Darth Vader. Harry's father's new character flaw in correlation with Professor Snape seems to lead in this way as well.<br/><br/>Remakes and sequels are very tricky films to make successfully and to be believable. I think the Harry Potter series has run to its dreary conclusion, although another one is probably coming."
"colonel_green","10","0","1","4 September 2007"," Fantastic.
","Top marks; an excellent film. I'm not sure if I prefer this or Prisoner of Azkaban, but the films are neck-and-neck.<br/><br/>One of the things I find about watching any of these films is that, as a die-hard fan of the texts, I find it difficult to escape critiquing the film as adaptation as a watch it; I know how the scenes play out in the books, who gets the cool lines, and how plots intersect, and so I observe how the filmmakers rework it on film; this was true to an extent in this film (moments like when Sirius, rather than Moody, gives Harry the photo of the old Order; or Kingsley getting Phineas' ""style"" line), but, as I was on my way home, I realized that I had completely overlooked the way the filmmakers rerouted the villains' scheme in the end, jettisoning Kreacher's involvement entirely. So, they can pull me out of the canon on occasion, and that's pretty impressive.<br/><br/>Also, the repeat of the ""I must not tell lie"" line (which I guessed two seconds before he said it) was an excellent addition.<br/><br/>The only things I really miss here were the encounter with Neville's parents at the hospital (the scene between Harry and Neville in the RoR is a decent substitute) and all the Umbridge v. McGonagall stuff (we get a truncated version, but I really wanted the career consultations scene; Maggie Smith would have been awesome in that).<br/><br/>The action the Department of Mysteries was excellent; in particular, the arrival of the Order of the Phoenix as clouds of white smoke was a real ""yeah, the cavalry"" moment, and the choreography of the initial encounter between Harry's team and the Death Eaters was brilliantly claustrophobic. By comparison, the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort fight was kind of anti-climactic (in an interesting choice, Voldemort seems to really overpower Dumbledore here, while in the book it's more of a clear stalemate).<br/><br/>There were the usual clutch of stellar performances from the entire British theatre guild. It's become perfunctory to say that Alan Rickman absolutely rules all, but he still does. The kids are all terrific here, and there's actually some effort made to set Ron and Hermione up (although Radcliffe and Watson still have more chemistry on film). The girl playing Luna is really, really good. On the villain side, Jason Isaacs delivers another of his ""smooth criminal"" performances, and Lucius remains the series' best villain; at the same time, Ralph Fiennes' Lord Voldemort is way, way better here than he was in GoF (where I was a bit underwhelmed); Helena Bonham Carter has few lines, but she's effectively creepy/deranged. And Imelda Staunton is great as Umbridge (as I knew she would be as soon as I saw Vera Drake).<br/><br/>Yates' direction is great (very much like Cuaron's), and he and the screenwriter make some inspired stylistic choices (they get a lot of mileage out of the things the Room of Requirement will do to suit the needs of the people inside). I also want to mention the way that Ron and co. escape the Inquisitorial Squad, which I have to say I like much better than the method in the book."

I saw the movie in I-Max, but you only wear the 3-D glasses for the last 20 minutes. And those last 20 minutes absolutely blew my mind. Special effects galore, explosions, magic... this movie probably had more special effects than any of the other Potter movies, possibly two Potter movies combined. But it wasn't all about the eye-candy; the acting was superb, the storyline seemed to flow very smoothly, and Dolores Umbridge and her antics had me cracking up.

If you're a HP fan (as I am of the books and movies until now) you have to go see it of course but I'd advise against getting your hopes up.<br/><br/>Too much of the storyline is incoherent and many plot events occur for little discernible reason. Characters and their back story aren't fleshed out and motivations are therefore sketchy. The group I went to the movie with consisted mostly of book readers and they were unanimous in thinking the movie needed to be longer and to have more depth. My hope is that a directors cut with extra footage may remedy this. The non readers in our group were confused by and uninterested in the plot. Maybe you'll disagree with me and think it was a great movie but I and my friends didn't. Probably worth a 6 but my disappointment makes it a 5."

","""It's not as good as the books"", ""they didn't include half the stuff they should have"", ""it's not how I pictured it, they should have..."" these are all various complaints levelled at this fifth instalment in the Harry Potter franchise and to be honest I tend to ignore these reviews and focus on these wizardry tales purely on the basis of being a film, and not a novel to screen transfer. As a film, how does our wand waving hero compare to his previous outings? Well, not so good. What has dissipated is a sense of mysticism, the fear of the unknown, now it is purely a fear of will Emma Watson be able to give a competent performance before they're all thirty and starring in Harry Potter And The It's Not Over Yet sequel.<br/><br/>There is a new director at the helm here, and it is instantly noticeable. The compositions and frame work are still eye catching, but there is notable lack of drive through the camera work, and often, especially in the latter magical battle stages the camera can pan right across everyone fighting everyone and you have absolutely no clue as to who is doing what or where anyone is. But surely it looks better? Well, yes and no. There is a crispness to the post- Valdermort infected world, and it does look darker if not feel it, but there is an unnecessary usage of CGI in places where real life props would have sufficiently sufficed. It makes the world seem less magical, and the plot can do that easily enough by itself. <br/><br/>The evil Lord has entered into the fifth instalment as we continue from the end of volume IV, but nobody believes either Harry or Dumbledore for one reason or another and the explanation given is completely ludicrous (it's far too, it is so because it is so). So what is the drive in this particular film? In all the previous outings there was a means, something which needed doing or someone who needed protecting as a means to keep the one whose name shall not be said at bay, but with him existing in the world now as an entity the film lacks enough drive, things are going on, but they don't really constitute anything towards the characters or plot line, apart from some untimely departures. I'm well aware there are many Potterites who found this to be the most enjoyable of the books, but in the contextualisation of cinema I found this one to be the most boring and most tedious. It told me nothing I already knew, it introduced a new character, and..? That's about it. It's over two hours of bone-fide Catherine wheels and sparklers flying around a screen with Harry throwing a hissy fit in the background and Emma Watson still sending shivers down everyones spine with her ineptitude.<br/><br/>So does Harry Potters fifth outing actually provide any saving graces? Well the performances of both Grint and Radcliffe are standout, and the two are achieving quite a name for themselves through this as each performance grows in stature and conviction. The storyline, whilst in fact going nowhere and being far too clustered moves along at a brisk pace which keeps interest, and makes the outing somewhat more worthwhile and enjoyable (perhaps even durable) during its tenure. Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon provide respectability, particularly the former on this occasion, but otherwise there is little to write home about. The story is far too stop-start, stop-start, and without a discernible direction you wonder whether or not this a particularly necessary fifth film (I haven't said book potterites so be patient). Yes Order Of The Phoenix follows on from Goblet amiably enough but as a whole, the experience is comparable to the added special edition scenes in The Lord Of The Rings films in that, yes they're entertaining to have there, but the story drives along just as well without them."

But a close second was the final battle between the Order of the Pheonix and the Death Eaters. It had me on the edge of my seat every time I saw it.

He was a great godfather to Harry.<br/><br/>I think that PG-13 is the right rating for this movie because it's a little bit more violent and has more intimate love scenes in it. It's a very enjoyable movie. Although if your child is under 12 don't take them.<br/><br/>Great movie, great acting, great costumes, production, everything. The movie and book go together very well. It's great to see that everything is met here."
"Lara2006","10","0","1","17 August 2007"," Sensational. Best one so far - easily !
","I really don't understand some of these terrible comments ! Order of The Phoenix is EASILY the best Harry Potter film so far with real quality in every area. It was fast moving, funny, exciting, touching and quite frankly had far and away the best acting from the younger cast that has been seen up to now. The choices made by the Director of what to cut from the very long book, were smart and didn't destroy the story (for me) one bit. It flowed very well and the only thing it asked of the audience was that they had a little bit of knowledge of what had happened in the previous movies and that they just soak up the story as presented on the screen. David Yate's direction of the actors was superb, Nicholas Hooper's music wonderful, Tim Burke's special effects were truly spectacular and what I've read about Yates using a dance choreographer to devise the wand combat scenes was an inspired idea, as Paul Harris created exciting, artistic and graceful choreography for the wand duelling scenes. Those scenes were so thrilling that they will be one of the highlights of the entire series of Harry Potter films when they are all done and dusted. The kiss was handled brilliantly - given the massive age range of the audience it couldn't have been exploited any more and both actors pitched the scene perfectly. For me, David Yates has taken something by the scruff of the neck and made it totally thrilling. I kept falling asleep in the second film and was also bored by the fourth. The other films already seem dated to me, but the style of this will stand the test of time much more successfully. Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix is a really great film for Potter fans and Potter newbies alike."

","The 5th movie is the best rendition of book-to-movie in the Harry Potter series since The Chamber Of Secrets, though there is a whole emotional level missing to it, admittedly. Daniel Radcliffe has exceeded himself once more as an actor, as have his co-stars Watson and Grint. A general round of applause for the effort made, and hopes that The Half-Blood Prince will be better yet still! (the following paragraph contains a few spoilers!) As a character, it is nice to see Harry fight back not only Voldemort, but all those who do not believe him. It's also nice to see Radliffe's portrayal of (his) fame-winning character truly portray the frustrations that Potter is feeling. He'll win an Oscar yet (the actor, not the character)! The fifth begins the most interesting arc of the series yet: the truth coming through and being explained. A shame that Harry's scene in Dumbledore's office after the battle has not only been toned down but mostly cut. A shame, but still a good movie; a must-see!"

","i was waiting so long for this movie, i watched it today and i have gotta say, IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME. I made so many things in my head while i was reading the book but when i watched movie,i figured out that, the director had changed whole script! for example: it wasn't cho who betrayed dumbledore's army,it was cho's friend, and during the final battle between voldemort and dumbledore, the statues in the pool had to come alive and protect harry from battle. and where was dobby!? it should have been the one who finds the secret room for the army. and we haven't heard any screams from Sirius black's mother in the house. in the book there was no voldemort part in the train station, but in the movie he was there in black suit! what i am trying to explain is book was great and wonderful but the movie is very very different from book and for the fans,disappointing! i wished the director hadn't changed the script,it is so sad.<br/><br/>i hope next movie will be much better and more like book, because the fans want to see what they create in their mind while they are reading the book."

Because fifth book is NOT child book. Deads, love, everything. I thought this film become masterpiece.<br/><br/>I'm so wrong.<br/><br/>First mistake in start point. Harry should crouch under the window and trying listen news. I said OK, then Dudley came. Oh my god, his face like baby, no i'm serious, in book Dudley is boxer, he is strong, he is not have baby face. I can't deal with first shock, second came. Dudley and his team provoke Harry, but in book they don't. Harry want Dudley annoy himself even.<br/><br/>Where is Ron's and Hermione's badge? Where is Bogart in desk? Where is cleaning? Where is Ron's Nimbus 2000? And most important think is why Harry did not yell at Ron and Hermione? I was shocked. I didn't touch my popcorn even.<br/><br/>I doubt to directors and writers reading the book. Harry met with Luna in train with Neville and Ginny. Neville's plant blow off suddenly Cho open the door blah blah blah....<br/><br/>WHERE Ä°S QUIDDTCH? I'm so mad. Quiddtch is important. I can't believe there is no Quidditch.<br/><br/>I got more things to say but i'm so demoralized, i walk around like ghost and said ""How? How did they make this film so bad?""<br/><br/>Actually this movie's rate is 3 but images was brilliant, Gary Oldman Rupert Grint and Imelda Staunton were fabulous so rate is 6/10"

","I will admit that by this point the films may have become just a little dark for the younger members in the audience, but this fifth instalment in the series is never the less, as with the others, great viewing. Basically Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) are attacked near Privet Drive by two Dementors, forcing the young wizard to summon the Patronus charm, but of course spells are forbidden by young wizards in the Muggle world. So he is devastated to be told he has been expelled, but he is going to the wizard court in the Ministry of Magic to plead his case, with the help of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) and other members of the society called the Order of the Pheonix. After being cleared of the charges, he is allowed to go back to Hogwarts with friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and they also meet student Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), seen at Harry's hearing, and appointed by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy). The Ministry do not believe the claims that Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned, and Umbridge is severely punishing Harry by forcing him to write with a cursed quill, carving the words ""I must not tell lies"" onto his hand. Her control over the school grows and grows as more rules are brought in on behalf of her and the Ministry, and she is not even teaching the students the right spells and skills in the Dark Arts classes that they will need to fight off any threat coming. Therefore Harry, Ron and Hermoine, along with many other rebellious students, find the secret Room of Requirement that can be hidden away, and they use to become ""Dumbledore's Army"" and train their skills, with Harry as teacher. While Dumbledore seems to distance himself from Harry, and he and Cho Chang (Katie Leung) develop romantic feelings that leads to a kiss under the mistletoe, Harry also experiences more nightmares seeing a dark room full of shiny globe prophecies, dark forces attacking Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) and his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), so Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) trains him to block out these dark thoughts. The Dark Lord meanwhile is slowly gathering his army, realising nine Death Eaters and Sirius's deranged cousin Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), known to have killed the parents of Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), from Azkaban prison. After discovering ""Dumbledore's Army"" and Dumbledore himself escaping arrest, Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress, and things fall apart even more, until a revolt finally comes in the form of the Weasley twins Fred (James Phelps) and George (Oliver Phelps) causing chaos during an exam with fireworks and flying papers. After this Umbridge threatens the illegal Cruciatus Curse on Harry unless they reveal their intentions, but Hermoine tricks her to follow them into the Dark Forest where the brother of Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Grawp, and the herd of centaurs get rid of her. Seeing a vision, Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Luna, Neville, and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) fly to the Ministry of Magic, where Sirius was last seen, and find the Department of Mysteries where thousands of prophecies are kept, including the one revealing truths about Voldermort and Harry's fates. Dumbledore's Army end up in a small fight against the Death Eaters, including Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) when he does not get the prophecy they want, and all are eventually caught and threatened to be killed unless Harry hands it over. Just when he does give it to Malfoy all the Order of the Phoenix, including Nymphadora Tonks (Natalia Tena), Kingsley Shacklebolt (Raiders of the Lost Ark's George Harris),Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), and Professor Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) show up to join the fight, the prophecy is destroyed accidentally, but in the process of battle Bellastrix Lestrange manages to kill Sirius, and Voldermort shows up before she can be tortured by Harry. Dumbledore shows up to have a quick battle with the Dark Lord, and before vanishing he quickly possesses Harry's body in the hope of killing him as well, but the love inside the young wizard overpowers and he leaves his body. In the end Fudge and all the Ministry accept that Voldermort has indeed returned, the school returns to form, Dumbledore explains the distancing was because of their connection, and Harry accepts that the prophecy is that he or Voldermort will kill each other in the end. Also starring Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall, Julie Walters as Mrs. Weasley, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Emma Thompson as Professor Sybil Trelawney and Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick. The casting is spot on, with the young actors still giving great performances, but also the new addition of Staunton normally really nice characters but here actually quite sinister as the Nurse Ratched style teacher, the action is exciting, and as always the special effects really engage you and take you into this magical world, a terrific family fantasy fantasy. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Special Visual Effects. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!"
"brindle_greyhound","8","0","1","6 August 2007"," My favorite book---my favorite movie
","**contains spoilers**<br/><br/>Up until now, I have found the Potter movie franchise to be a bit of a mess. Director after director---each with his own stamp, for better or worse. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a refreshing change, especially after that disaster of the Goblet of Fire. Finally, there is heart and the editing, for the most part, makes sense (crazy thought I know.) The visuals are simply stunning. Snape's memory is well shot. The final confrontation with Voldemort is amazing, and the possession scene is fabulous. And I couldn't be happier with the thestrals. Casting is well done. Luna is perfect, Umbridge is fun to hate, and Bellatrix is wonderfully over-the-top. The main characters are really coming into their own. Radcliff(I think Equus helped) is finally showing he has some damned talent. Watson has improved (though she is still the most wooden out of the group) And, due to Dumbledore's seeming lack of interest in Harry, Gambon is finally doing well with the role. Oldman finally gets the screen time he has deserved. I was quite pleased that essence of Snape's lessons were kept intact. Alan Rickman is wonderful. And Jason Issacs got his chance to shine finally as the somewhat desperate Lucius. And Voldemort really seems like the most evil wizard to ever live. Overall, this movie was quite good and definitely worth seeing. Though some will find everything possible to critique and pick at (like infinitesimal details like Kingsley's hat), I think most people will be pleased with it. Despite the fact that some of the plot omissions are disappointing, this movie is definitely an 8/10."

","With a very impressive directing, flawless acting skills and, precision in technical data OOTP deserves accolades or higher ratings when compared to the previous movies of this enchanting series (with an exception of POA).<br/><br/>But when it comes to certain details of events in the book, the movie fails to impress Harry potter fans, like for example the st mungo's hospital has been totally eliminated in the movie ,still the most necessary event that occurs in the hospital which is the history of Neville's parents is not lost . Another problem it faces is the pace at which events happen which happens to be skyrocketing in a baffling yet understandable way (hence those haven't read the book is in for utter confusion) .the visual effects are just beyond comparison with any other movie (Fred and George's weasleys fireworks are fantabulous). The final showdown that takes place at the ministry was deliberate but still impressive.<br/><br/>This part of the series was hilarious in many ways and mostly triggered by umbridge (the new teacher for the so told jinxed post of defense against dark arts).taking into account the fact that this book in particular is longest of all the books from the 7part series, the director did a pretty appreciable job. All in all hp fans are in for a visual treat, comparatively less disappointment whereas a fan with no knowledge of the stuff from the book is bound to get confused but still a visual feast awaits."

Of course it is possible for the next movie, if it's not to late, she is able to change her look at a whim. But, in the next movie she looks a tired, worn, emotional wreck, unable to change from her actual look. To bad, she would have been better for the part. P.S. I have no investment in her at all!

Yes the reason so many things were taking out was due to Goldbergs screenplay (but if J.K. Rowling. approved it then I am sure there's a purpose for the missing material) However, David Yates is what made it brilliant, everything he had the actors do was fantastic and i think it is one of the best Harry Potters yet. One thing i didn't like about the movie was the fact that the book was so long but the movie (although still a good time) did seem rather short. But the effects that were produced and the final 20-30 minutes of the movie were just breathtaking. i recommend this for anyone who is into fantasy movies, whether you like the Harry Potter series or not. this is still just an amazing, interesting, breathtaking movie that will keep you wanting more."

Well, I loved the images and the colors, the landscapes and the visual effects. But the scenes were so dis-coordinated. The scenes weren't on the right spot, for instance, when Sirius Black shows Harry the room with the portraits of Black's family - the scene was supposed to appear in the beginning of the movie and it appears almost in the end... I also think that the scenes appear and disappear too fast. But what could the Director do? I mean, he had to transform a book with 750 pages into a movie with 2 hours... It's a movie to see but it's not a great movie. Sincerely I hope the next one to be a little better... I've enjoyed all other Harry Potter's movies and this one just...well, didn't appreciated it."

"paulmamak","6","0","1","2 August 2007"," The film had potential, the child actors went ahead and let the film down though.
","This film made a good attempt in bringing the book to the screen. Nevertheless, this film seemed to have it all an outstanding British cast, an excellent location and a great story, but somehow it did not result in the masterpiece for what it should have been. My conclusion is that David Yates was not the right person to direct, I looked on his profile and so far he has only done television work. This explains why a lot of the final scenes were so woody and why the editing was so poor that the film was barely able to flow. I think it was therefore wrong to enter him into the Potter franchise, where he is still a novice when it comes to blockbuster films.<br/><br/>The main problem for this film was that not enough depth from the book was obtained. If it was aloud to run over 3 hours, as opposed to 2 hours 18 minutes than a more stronger grasp of the story would have resulted. Instead the film just seemed to scratch the surface and ended up becoming more light hearted than exhilarating.<br/><br/>What made the film were the actors, such as Imelda Staunton who portrayed Dolores Umbridge, Helena Bonham Carter's role as Bellatrix Lestrange and Ralph Fiennes molding of Lord Voldemort. These actors in the limited time frame they had made the best use of it and brought what little electricity there was to the screen.<br/><br/>Whereas, the rest of the perfect cast was wasted due to their limited screen time. You have the modern British greats working on this film Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson and Robbie Coltrane. Yet they were literally given a couple of sentences each and that was their lot, I don't even though why they bothered to turn up on set. In particular it was heartbreaking to see Gary Oldman, to me he is my favourite actor, but Gary you have gone from being bad to good and somehow you have lost your ways of stage presence. The way they killed you off really did not leave much to the imagination, go back to your old ways. Alan Rickman you did not have as much screen time either, but I am glad to see that your are now providing a better portrayal of Snape.<br/><br/>The kid actors were another story, they were all either just a bunch of moody teenagers or just overly enthusiastic. Hats off though to Evanna Lynch, who played Luna Lovegood, you not only provided a great acting debut, but you separated yourself from the rest of the pack. <br/><br/>Overall, I expect to see more depth in the next film with better use of characters or you might as well just write off the Potter franchise now."

","In my opinion, this was a absolute masterpiece. They could have put in a little more, I'll admit, but it had wonderful emotional value.<br/><br/>There is still the matter of things being omitted, but that's understandable, since if they had added too much, the whole thing would have been a mess. Therefore, it was probably better to make it seem to go really fast.<br/><br/>Ron plus Hermione fans, be on the lookout! They don't seem to fight as much as in the last one, Ron seems to care a little more, and when they are in the forest and Grawp picks Hermione up, Ron rushes to her defense, taking a huge branch and hitting Grawp with it. This has absolutely no effect as Grawp knocks him down too. When Hermione is released, Ron says in a quavering voice, ""Are you all right?"" to her, then turns to Grawp and says ""Just leave her alone from now on, all right?"" and is at her side to make sure nothing else happens to her.<br/><br/>And lastly, Umbridge. The new power-loving, sickly smiling character you love to hate. She doesn't work for Voldemort, but she certainly could pass as one of his Death Eaters. She shows no remorse to causing pain, considering that detention is writing in your own blood.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie. I almost personally guarantee that the money you spend to get tickets is absolutely worth every penny."
"Tolbert","10","0","4","31 July 2007"," Great addition to a Great Series, Nice Adaptation of the Book!
","I've read all of the books, a few of them more than once. It's very hard to adapt one of these books to the big screen without making them twice as long as Lord of The Rings. There's so much to cover.<br/><br/>There are a few details of the book that were particularly powerful and it's too bad that they left them out. One of them (Spoiler Alert) this is admittedly more of a book spoiler than anything now. In the book, there is an interesting little event that becomes quickly swept under the rug. While at Grimuld Drive, they find a locket that no one can seem to figure out a way to open. In the next book, it's discovered that Voldemort has many Horcuxes. We come to find out that those are a big part of what's keeping him from dying. Then there's the painting of Sirius' mom who yells at everyone calling them blood traitors, half breeds etc. There's only a subtle hint of Sirius and Bellatrix being cousins. They also didn't play out two scenes I was really looking forward to.<br/><br/>One was toward the beginning, Mad-Eye Moody was chiding Harry for putting his wand in his back pocket. He said something to the effect of ""More than one talented wizard has blown off a buttock that way!"" To which Tonks replied: ""Who do you know who's blown off a buttock that way?"" Then Moody replies ""Um, Nevermind."" Everyone in the room kind of chuckled for a bit. When Harry addresses Moody as Professor, he kindly reminded him that he didn't actually do much teaching.<br/><br/>Last but not least, we find out that Lucius Malfoy, Crabbe's Dad, Goyle's Dad, McNair (the would-be executioner of Buckbeak from ""The Prisoner of Askaban"") and a few other death-eaters were ambushed at the ministry and arrested. The boys were none too happy about their Dads getting arrested and Malfoy vowed to get Harry at the end of the book.<br/><br/>The other parts I missed were kind of silly but that last one was a particularly powerful part of the book. It really kept you waiting for the next one which picks up right where the last one left off. A very nice touch if you asked me.<br/><br/>All in all, excellent movie! The darkest one in series of movies (so far) and proof that the books are not just aimed at a younger audience. True that the younger audience tends to be intrigued by it but this is a great series."

"andreas_soerensen","5","0","1","30 July 2007"," Rushed and watered down...
","I watched this movie with low expectations, having been disappointed with the previous efforts of bringing Harry's magical universe to the visual realm. It is obvious that only a few of the key plot points of an 800 page book can be included in a 2 hours movie, so I will not comment again on that.<br/><br/>Positives first: This was an entertaining movie which flowed much nicer than the previous adaptations, I thought. The cinematography and general ""mood"" of the colours used were very fitting for the theme of the story. The books get generally darker, and so should the movies. As an example, I felt that the scenes leading up to the dementor attack were well done in therms of lighting and pacing. <br/><br/>This leads me to the negatives: The CGI was very overdone, everything from magical creatures to the whole magic aspect of casting spells was made into a disneyesque, sparkling pretty mess. The dementors had none of the tangible physical aspects that make them so scary (I recall them being described as ""smelling of rotting flesh"" in the books). Instead they become floating CGI ghosts that pass through walls. And wizards don't duel while flying around in clouds of smoke and wind! It was as if they were half ghosts too! <br/><br/>In general I think the watering down of all the violence and sadistic evil increasingly associated with Voldemort and the Death Eaters, while understandable given the target audience, makes it impossible to portray the rest of the series in the way JK intended it. Their pure entertainment value can be reasonable, such as is the case here, but can not come close to the mood and ultimate philosophies of the books and will remain mass-market family fare."

The beginning of the movie was trying to be a suspense flick with jump outs and mysterious setups and then it changes into your basic follow the plot film with minimal character development. So much could have been done with this material (and yes, I realize there was nearly 900 pages of source material) and sadly, I left the theater disappointed...and I wasn't alone in that feeling.

Maybe the studio have realised that it'll turn over squillions of dollars no matter how drastically the source material is disregarded or changed. It's a case of ""get it out the door as quickly as possible before the younger characters don't look so young anymore, bearing in mind there's 2 more episodes to get into the can"" If King Kong had been treated like this the first 5 minutes would have played out something like this: ""Oh Mr Denham, there's so little work going around in New York in these depressed days""....""OK, come film a movie with me about a mysterious island""....Cuts to boat rowing ashore...steamer in background....""What's that moving the trees over there?""

"sterrekooi","9","0","1","30 July 2007"," Outstanding, fantastic acting and full of excitement!
","I was really excited to go seeing this movie, because I've always loved the Harry Potter books/movies and I'm a huge fan of Emma Watson (Hermione Granger). So today was the day. Already in the beginning, the movie is exciting, when Harry en Dudley get attacked by Dementors. And the excitement doesn't stop there: the whole movie is full of exciting moments, flashes, lines and whatever more can be exciting. I'd almost say that the most beautiful thing of this movie is the outstanding acting of everyone. With every movie, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson grow (not only literally, but also in their acting) and I'm not surprised about the great reviews of Order of the Phoenix. Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) is obviously fantastic: his way of talking/doing things is almost moving, and the feeling between him and Daniel Radcliffe is really special, as if they are really godfather and -son. With his movie comes a new character named Luna Lovegood, portrayed by the lovely fourteen year-old Evanna Lynch, whom got casted for this part out of 20.000 other girls. Her remarkable appearance, her high, soft voice and her dreamy eyes make her exactly the right person to play the part of Luna. She's pretty much like I thought Luna would be like, and she's really doing very well. And then we have Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore). Thinking he wasn't the right person for this part (too restless, much more different than Richard Harris was, he was always more like I had Dumbledore in mind), I sort of changed my mind today. He's an outstanding actor and has a very remarkable, beautiful voice. Daniel Radcliffe is doing a very good job as Harry for the fifth time. I hope those who've seen Equus in London, the piece in which he's naked, will be able to get that picture out of they're head for a moment and enjoy watching Daniel as Harry Potter, and not as the sort of mental Alan. Emma, my lovely favorite actress, is once more outstanding as Hermione. She really seems to UNDERSTAND this character, she's thought about it, and that's the right thing to do when it comes to acting: make sure you understand the character you're playing. So does Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, though a pretty small part, played very well. David Yates prooves that he's a good director, and I am really happy that he'll be doing the next HP movie too. Overall, this movie is great, though it was a pity they cut out a lot of things that are in the book. The kiss of Harry and Cho is sweet and kind and romantic, I loved it. The movie is one big story full of excitement, wonderful music and outstanding acting. I recommend it certainly."

","Well, Order of the Phoenix - the first complete Harry Potter movie I watched and I am left with the conclusion what the heck had I been doing all these years. In fact, I had watched bits and pieces of Prisoner of Azkaban but I wouldn't say I enjoyed the movie because I was horribly lost and didn't understand the basics of who is who just for a simple fact that I hate dimly lit sets and dark night shots. I hated LOTR for that reason, I disliked the Pirates and I was simply uninterested in the Harry Potter movies. Unfortunately, now I realised how wrong I'd been about movies that cut down on lighting department's costs. The meaning of the movie lies deep within it's soul and not how brightly are the sets lit. Dimly lit sets are vital to films with dark themes and HP is one of them.<br/><br/>With mind in muddle and having no tickets for The Simpsons Movie, I reluctantly entered the theatre showing HP5. Then the very next day, being so impressed with the fifth movie, I immediately hired the DVD of Goblet of Fire, and um, loved that one too. The Order of Phoenix begins with kind of amazing but I must tell I never knew they ever came out of the Hogwarts. Then as the film paced I felt a strange type of propulsion in the subject content and the artists' performances. Daniel Radcliffe has evolved as a fine young man ( I won't lie but I did watch snapshots from Sorcerer's Stone and Azkaban.) He has a great future ahead once he's off the HP franchise. I can't say a lot about Ron Weasley character because I feel it's unjustified and has more of a comic punch than the required gravity it ought to have. The special effects are great and I simple loved Gary Oldman's presence in the film. The convertible house (Sirius's home) has some spectacular special effects involved and kudos to the technology involved.<br/><br/>But more than that I must say I loved the presence of pretty young women. Both Hermionie Granger and Luna Lovegood are magnificent character created by Rowling and both Emma Watson (pretty as always) and Evana Lynch do full justice to their performances. I must particularly talk about Emma Watson because her evolution as a fine lady has definitely added a new dimension to the HP movie, I was more of looking forward to a warm relationship of her with Potter. Unless I was told she finds Ron at last (I hope that isn't a spoiler - I read it in the Deathly Hallows,) I would have expected something between Potter and Granger. However, there had been Rachel Weisz, Kate Winslet, Keira Knightley, and now it's Emma Watson's turn, go dear just go ahead, Hollywood awaits you.<br/><br/>However, the fondest character of HP5 to me happens to be Dolores Umbridge. That character is so real and doesn't for a moment make me feel like it's a magical character from a fantasy novel. However, Imelda Staunton adds the real essence to the character and no one else would have suited it so much that it in fact, she reminds me of my very principal in school. She is just so real and cruel and I must applaud the essence she has added to the HP5 movie. And Lord Voldemort's character is so scary and the depth is simply frightening. I learned about him later when I watched the preceding movie.<br/><br/>Finally, my aggregate review for the Order of the Phoenix would be that it's a nice movie with all the essentials included and it's a value for money. Everything is big and thankfully this time there are shots of the contemporary would that I had been badly missing. The tube station and flying over river Thames gave me ways so that I could relate to the film. The shots over London city were simply exhilarating and my favourite scene in the entire movie. The second one that closely follows is where the Phoenix army is flying into the horizon over the Hogwarts on Thresals.<br/><br/>However, the most important thing that this film makes me do is 1. watch the remaining three movies and 2. read the novels. Now I am curious and want to dive deep into the world of Harry Potter. I had carried my reservations with this franchise but now I feel I was wrong, indeed, Harry Potter movies are worth cherishing. Can't wait to see the other movies."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","0","1","29 July 2007"," The Good and Evil in Harry
","Director David Yates's ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" takes a distinctively dark turn, and is the most compelling of the Harry Potter movies. In ""Order of the Phoenix"" the dark Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) returns, and the prophecy revealed regarding his bond to the emerging Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). Introspective and tortured Harry asks his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), "" What if I'm becoming bad?"" Sirius Black reassures, ""You're a good person We all have both light and dark inside us. What matters is the power we choose to act on."" Harry sees own his darkness. ""Harry Potter"" becomes classical hero mythology. Harry must use his powers for good and not evil, at the same time fearing that he maybe becoming that which he despises. In the prophecy either Harry or Voldermort will survivethere can be only one. Their destiny is intertwined and ultimately mysterious. During the climatic battle with Lord Voldermort Harry's mentor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) tells Harry (Radcliffe), ""It's not so much how you are alike, but how much you are not..."" ""Order of the Phoenix"" is engrossing I suspect like the J.K. Rowling's book, because it is about the conflict of good and evil within Harry. As Harry, Daniel Radcliffe is powerful and commanding.<br/><br/>I am not a ""Harry Potter"" literatehave not read any of the books. Although, Michael Goldenberg's screenplay of the J.K. Rowling's book is articulate and coherentquickly resuming the story since last movieI had to defer to my bud Chuck for some Harry Potter 101. For example, in the opening I did not know what the soul-stealing creatures threatening Harry and his friend were. However, in evoking his powers against the creatures to protect a human or Muggle violates Wizard law. The Ministry means to expel Harry from Hogwarts for this breachwhich seems more of conspiracy. Hogwarts Headmaster Dumbledore (strong and wise Michael Gambon) defends Harry, and in the process reveals Lord Voldermort return. His possible return is dismissed vehemently by the Ministry. Harry is free to return for the school term at Hogwarts along with Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). Joining the School faculty is Dolores Umbridge (very good Imelda Staunton) as the new instructor of the Defensive Arts, who seems more interested in theory than practicing actual magic. Umbridge seems evil in that her world seems to reside entirely inside her head. Harry takes it upon himself at Hermione's prodding to instruct fellow students in the Defensive Arts (magic that can be used against the Dark Lord). Meanwhile, Harry enlists with his godfather Sirius Black (Oldman) and the Order of the Phoenix that originally formed to battle Lord Voldermort the first time around. Harry himself as a child survived a vicious attack from Voldermort, but now questions his prowess and virtue for their inevitable conflict. Desperate times require similar action as Harry is trained by the morally ambiguous Serves Snape (slithering Alan Rickman). There are several more story lines with the main focus on Harry and Voldermort. Rowling's story of choice conveys that in the darkest of times, true magic comes from love, courage, and community.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is impeccable starting with Daniel Radcliffe. Maturing Radcliffe brings an authentic teen angst to Harry. Radcliffe has a powerful and compassionate presence as the hero accepting his responsibility and destiny. He is also up to the challenge of Fiennes' menacing presence. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint seem to have reduced roles as Hermione and Ron with focus on Harry and Voldermort. Watson remains charming and radiant. Grint is becoming a talented comic actor. Michael Gambon is commanding as Dumbledore. It's great to see the venerable wizard in battle. Gary Oldman is charismatic and noble as Sirius Black. Ralph Fiennes may not be on the screen all that much as Voldermort, but his presence dominates ""Order of the Phoenix"". Fiennes embodies a visceral evil and evokes a powerful presence. He is awesome.<br/><br/>Acknowledge David Yates and Michael Goldenberg for their captivating and visually stunning storytelling. I saw a digital projection of the movie that was spectacular. Theirs is a classic story of the battle against great evil, and the compelling internal conflict of good and evil within Harry himself. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" has courageous heroes and powerful villains all in a great movie."

","I gave Harry Potter and the OOTP an 8 out of 10. It was very entertaining and exciting. If you love the books like I do and you have seen the movie, then you know that there is some differences. Personally, I like the book better, but they couldn't have made the movie all like the book or it would have been over four hours long. The new director did a very well job keeping the magic in this movie. Still,Chris Colombus(director of the first 2 Harry Potter movies)has first place in directing this series. <br/><br/>I really loved all the new characters in this movie.

","First of all I'm one of the few who haven't read the books yet, rather an avid fan of the movies. From the very first HP I've been hooked to following an inspiring, adventurous and magical journey of these magical characters.<br/><br/>The 5th installment doesn't disappoint overall. The plot, cgi's, actors, action, the dark theme and amazing visuals and presentation overall was just as impressive as it's predecessors. Though as a movie fan I had very high expectations specially after the goblet of fire. It was just as impressive yet something was missing. The other 4 left me satisfied, almost like a metaphor for a full circled movie. There were no holes everything was explained at the same time provided immense entertainment.<br/><br/>This one left a little hole, maybe I expected more explanation of all the characters actions, or maybe I wanted to see more wizardry namely more wizard action. Or maybe more development of cho's and Harry's relation. But ultimately the fight sequences were just flawless.<br/><br/>Different director, different projection. A minor flaw, because what really matters is the magic was still there, it was intense and most of all entertaining. Another masterful installment of the brilliant novel. 9/10 - Lets hope this is Yates last endeavor."
"thrmlb5","3","0","1","28 July 2007"," Waste of money
","There is not anything new in this movie at all....twirling wands? That was 3 or 4 movies ago. There was no real additional character development either in this movie with Harry's friends doing next to nothing in this movie. They could have been cardboard cutout stand ins for all they did. Then there is the tired old story of an unjust evil or manipulative teacher or principal? Come on..that is very unoriginal. This was just a punch of the clock for cold hard cash in the series...a money making killing for capitalists and a bust for movie audiences. I'd recommend seeing some of the first 3 movies over again instead of seeing this one."

My husband really isn't much of a fan but really liked this movie.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and would see it again myself.It was an action and adventure movie that was very thrilling for everyone regardless of their age.My only regret is that the series is almost over as their is only one book left.

","I'd been looking forward to this film for a long time. Ever since I read the fifth book, around the same time the fourth movie came out. So, I was really excited to finally find out how this book translated to film.<br/><br/>I felt the relayed the essential points of the movie very well, at least those points I remember most. I thought they did an excellent job on Umbridge. She was definitely a ""pink nightmare."" I also loved Luna Lovegood. I thought that actress did a wonderful job. I could forget she was acting and just see her as Luna during the film. I can't wait to see how she does in Deathly Hallows! And of course, the Trio (Harry, Ron, Hermione) were great as usual as were all the other regular, returning characters. My daughter loved how Neville could never get his spells right! ;-)<br/><br/>There were a few differences in the movie from the book and some scenes were left out, but that has been true of all the books (and not just HP books that have been turned into movies). A movie can never be as good as the book unless the book was written after the movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>But for what it was, I think that this latest Harry Potter movie installment was just excellent. It prepared me well for the next movie to come. It did carry along at a pretty fast pace, hardly giving one time to breathe, but considering all the scenes that did have to be put in, it's amazing they did it in only two and a half hours. I though wouldn't have minded if it had been three hours instead. I'm excited to find out what deleted scenes will be added to the DVD version as extras or more movie...<br/><br/>And now I am eagerly awaiting how the next two books will be changed to fit the movie format and fit in with the already established Harry Potter movie universe (which does differ a bit from the HP book universe).<br/><br/>So, if you liked the other movies and felt they did do a fair job at keeping the essential parts of the books in the movie, then you won't be disappointed with this latest Harry Potter film. If you have only seen the films, then you should love it! My four-year-old and her seven-year-old cousin did! And the side of me that can watch it for movie value alone also thought it was wonderful ;-)! <br/><br/>For the rest of Harry Potter fans that don't think any of the films quite lived up to their own vision of the books, well then this one probably won't either. But for the rest of us, we can all enjoy our popcorn and candy and enjoy the movie for what it is. And know the people making the movies are doing the best that they can.<br/><br/>I must add that I hope much of what was left out or edited out is added back when this movie comes out to DVD, and not as extras but as actual footage in the film."

This movie was missing a lot BUT all that was made up in the wonderful performance's by the cast Sirius was funny and courageous Dumbledore was calm cool and collected Kingsly was funny and bright but overall the characters that shined the most were that of Daniel Radcliffe who gave his Best performance which is of much relief do to his poor acting in 4. Evanna Lynch shined in this movie as the fan favorite Luna Lovegood and she is Oscar worthy for her performance. Imelda Stanton made you hate umbridge so much she played the role magically truly a horrible person in the film which she made you hate so well.<br/><br/>all in all this film kicked ass not as good as book but its close."

","Okay, lets get started, so. i came to the movie, never had read any of the books with no intention to. As i am an average teenager who only reads books assigned in English class. But for me, these movies are enjoyable. For most, and myself, whether they end up corny, i always feel i have to see the next one. This movie left me disappointed in areas, and Loving it in others. i couldn't decide which. For reasons i didn't like it, the movie didn't have to much detail to it. Like, in the other movies, there is just MORE to it, like quiditch matches, and all that stuff. This was to plain. and yet it was a good length of a movie, it seemed to only go on like an hour and 15 min. I did find that they didn't ad as much to Ron as usual, which for me, was GREAT. I am not a fan of his character, or the actor. Another plus was when i met in the movie.....Luna. Her character was almost perfection for me. She Made the movie for me. Her voice, wondorous acting, the look, and the personality. What does make me mad is that the connection between her and harry will not last. =[ Though it was perfect for this movie for her to be in it do to all his anger junk. I give this movie an 8."

I did not read any of the books, so that's not why i have this opinion. I say this because it felt like i was watching a compilation of story twists placed in sequence to represent a movie. ..The storyline is jerky, with gaps everywhere...i thought this was a complete waste of time, and i really wanted it to be good. I can only hope the uncut version is better. If you have wanted this movie to be nice as well, go see Roald Dahls Mathilda. It is practically the same story, only much better compiled.

","As an avid fan of the Harry Potter books I always get quite defensive when the film goes against the book or misses out important bits. I found the other four films enjoyable and well done even if they didn't quite follow the books but this film, I did not feel, met their standards. The best aspect, I feel was the casting, as the characters were well chosen, especially Luna Lovegood! However, the acting wasn't great and the pace of the scenes were too slow. I didn't feel that the characters were as easy to relate to and they seemed awkward and wooden. I also felt that the film didn't go into enough depth and for someone who had not read the book, it would have been confusing and vague. Overall, I felt that the film wasn't up to scratch and found it vague, slow and slightly dull. I understand how hard it is to adapt a book as great as Harry Potter and of course the film is worth seeing... just, don't expect a great deal."
"lpchels","6","0","1","26 July 2007"," Disappointed but expected. Spoiler
","I do believe a lot of parts were glossed over and the acting could have been much better. And I'm leaving out most of the little errors and things that shouldn't have been left out.<br/><br/>2 key hits were Umbridge and lestrange.<br/><br/>I would have liked the scene at the ministry to have been a lot better. Had it been I would have been satisfied with the movie as a whole, but it seemed just as glossed over as the rest of the movie. I personally would have rather liked it better as a longer movie with a little more in-depth parts than just the touching they did.<br/><br/>When Sirius dies it isn't felt near as much as it shouldve been but you really do HATE umbridge as much as you should.<br/><br/>Sadly, i do expect this to happen with all the movies. They were started before the series was finished and J.K. Rowling does have a habit of having a purpose in every detail throughout the book, so it is hard to distinguish what is important and what is not. One of the reasons I was disappointed in the fight scene was because it was the one thing the movie could have surpassed the book with. Although J.K. does a good job of describing the fight scene a movie should do a better job visually. In every other aspect it is easier to capture everything in the book, so the fight scene is key. I hope that in the following movies it is done better.<br/><br/>I also hope that a huge fan completely remakes them into epic movies with more detail and consideration in the future, after the time has been taken to consider the series as a whole."
"rwest-24","4","0","1","25 July 2007"," The weakest Harry Potter film to date
","I found this a disappointing film though it has some successful new characters. Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge may not be in the least toad-like, but she so perfectly captures the smiling, 'girly', evil of the book, while Evanna Lynch has captured Luna Lovegood perfectly.<br/><br/>I am unsure whether the problem lies with the script or the production, but I left the cinema feeling I had seen only the highlights and not the full story. This is not simply a matter of condensing a long book: while The Goblet of Fire omitted much, it still had a sense of coherence  a sense of being a whole. Another reviewer on this site (and I had not read this or any other review when I saw the film) summed it up well by saying she felt the produced was given a list of key scenes and just filmed them.<br/><br/>If you have seen the earlier films, be prepared for disappointment."

","This film was alright.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but it's probably the best of the 5 out so far.<br/><br/>There was some pretty good cinematography involved in this. Quite impressive on occasions. I especially liked it where the camera backs up through a pain of glass, and pans down to scene. (look out for that)<br/><br/>The whole thing was acted well. Daniel Radcliffe is very convincing. Harry Potter seems much less geeky than he did in the first film.<br/><br/>The visuals are quite nice. There are some very good special effects throughout the film, including make up, and CGI.<br/><br/>The actual story wasn't excellent, it was a bit boring and uneventful. So I imagine the book isn't too great. There were some quite funny moments along the way, but nothing particularly interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was not brilliant. I went to see this with my Girl friend, something i'd suggest. It's quite a nice film to watch together, especially in the cinema. There's a part where Harry kisses a girl, as the camera pans up to the mistletoe above their heads. At this point the entire audience is under the mistletoe. A little crowd pleaser thrown in there.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film, however, you'd probably be quite board on your own. The experience contributed a lot to it."

","Well what can I say? I had high hopes for this film, especially after the end of the Goblet of Fire! Voldemort finally appearing, the actors beginning to show signs of maturing (finally!) and a fantastic plot........but then I had to sit through 2 hours of Order of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>In all fairness, they took a risk and appointed a new different director (David Yates) and the gamble didn't really work for me. The reason? Well, Yates was going for a darker, scarier more intense look to the film, but ended up making it intensely difficult to watch. The plot was rather pointless - (#SPOILER#) I mean, we all knew that eventually either Harry or 'he-who-cannot-be-named' would have to die didn't we?! So we sat through 2 hours just to learn what we already knew???? Hmm, just doesn't work for me you know?? The acting was, to say the least, poor. Although there were some shining performances - Daniel Radcliffe is finally starting to adapt to his role and his intensity in the OotP was nothing short of special. However, even though most people are raving about Imelda Staunton who plays Dolores Umbridge, I found her to be rather drab and incredibly annoying!!! All in all, if you're a fan of the book, prepare to be disappointed. However, if you just like seeing Harry and co beat the bad guys, then you may find this film is to your liking."
"madpigmadpig","9","0","1","25 July 2007"," An incredibly powerful movie.
","To begin with, this film is visually stunning. This was the best use of special effects and computer graphics I've seen in many years, it also included some very fine cinematography. Not even once was I taken out of the plot by a poorly shot or improperly lit scene. This was the only Harry Potter movie that I can truly say is best viewed on the big screen, from the spectacularly rousing fireworks scene to the truly phantasmagoric battle scene I frequently felt moved to rise in applause for the magnificent visual feast I was experiencing (especially after the recent run of films currently in theaters that leave one with only a sickly sense of empty boredom).<br/><br/>Secondly, this movie had a compelling story and was tightly edited. The continuing moral of the Harry Potter movies, that love conquers all, is very poignantly made clear by the Harry gradually being forced to realize throughout the story that he is surrounded by people who love and care about him and that he is not alone. These ideas are finally crystalized by denouement of the film when it becomes clear to him that (much like Luke skywalker in Star Wars) Voldemort is using his negative emotions (anger, loss, hatred, sadness, etc...) to take over his mind because they are his weaknesses, and that all along his survival and strength has come from happiness and love. The depicted change in the political climate is, of course, drawn from much of history and is an accelerated portrayal of the actions of many paranoid world leaders- past and present. I also thought that this was a very convincing portrayal of how a hero (Harry) might suddenly be forced into leadership in order to subvert a cruel tyranny that is taking hold. I have very few qualms about the editing or directing in this movie. The stair trick in the argument between Umbridge and McGonagall was a little long, but it was a nice bit of staging. And I suppose Hagrid's brother was necessary to the plot, even if he did seem corny and superfluous.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was another component that I felt was much improved from the previous Harry Potter films. All the kids did an excellent job and, for once, they seem to have found a way to make Gambon almost work as Dumbledore. I really liked Luna, she has the same sort of ethereal presence as The Childlike Empress in The NeverEnding Story. Staunton did an unusually good job of playing someone who's just evil as sin, really makes your blood boil to watch.<br/><br/>This is a funny, moving, and uplifting film. If I wasn't so loyal to the first Harry Potter movie I would say that this was the best one. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix really is a tour de force in film-making.<br/><br/>Bravo!"

","When the director, screenwriter and producers sat down and planned this film, something must have gone totally wrong. The essence of the book: Harry's loneliness, his fight against the Ministry and Voldemort's mind has been discarded or has been done poorly. The first three minutes were good(Daniel Radcliffe has changed dramatically) and gave me that very feeling of an eerie world. Sadly, that is where I lost track. The movie flies through the book's pages as if it was some kind of tabloid-newspaper without anything important to tell. And before you know it, Harry arrives at the ministry. As Harry battles his way to the final meeting between Dumbledore and Voldemort, we are served spectacular(!) effects, but sadly - thats about it.<br/><br/>The acting throughout the movie is more or less rather good, Daniel Radcliffe has matured greatly since the fourth installment. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson never really manages to grab us, but that is heavily due to a poorly written script. Emma Watson has a tendency to overact(even though her character in many ways is over-the-edge) which is sad, given her talent. Rupert Grint performs well, but could use a bit more aggressiveness.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is horrible, and I can't stress this enough. What should have been a deep and sentimental moment when Harry and his friends fly to the ministry to save Harry's godfather(and many other scenes), is turned into a pile of Hollywood poo given the appalling into-the-sunset strings and orchestra sound - the director obviously doesn't know how to conjure feelings at all.<br/><br/>Someone ought to take action and show the director and screenwriter how to make people cry, for I can't stand watching HFB and DH turn into another happy Hollywood money-machine."

"dawsonleery74","8","0","1","23 July 2007"," A very enjoyable movie
","Finally, after the failure of Goblet of Fire, another good Potter-movie! First of all I'm not a huge fan of the fifth book: too long, especially in the first part; too much elements and a little sense of boring during the reading. So I came to the cinema yesterday night without great expectations and...surprise I saw a really good picture. What I like: 1) The new characters: Dolores Umbridge, Luna Lovegood and Bellatrix Lestrange are absolutely fantastic in this movie adaptation: especially Brenda Blethyn did a wonderful job with her acting. 2) The screenplay: the first, boring part was cut off and this choice is really good for the rhythm of the entire movie. 3) Daniel Radcliffe: this young actor improves his acting movie after movie and the scenes of the nightmares and of the Voldemort's possession are absolutely terrific! 4) The atmosphere: finally a really dark, scaring harry Potter movie; Harry's nightmares, Dementors first attacks are only a few scenes that can create, during the movie, the sensation that now the childhood is over and that a really, cruel wizard world is going to begin. What I dislike: 1) Cho Chang's story: too short; it's not clear how she felt in love with Harry and the reason of their kissing. Plus, the reasons of their breaking aren't so exhaustive as in the books. 2) Grop: generally I appreciate the special effects in this movie but Hagrid's brother is really too false to seem real. Isn't impossible to choose a real actor and make him appear bigger than the other characters ? Doesn't Lord of the Rings movies teach anything about these technique ? 3) The Story of Neville Longbottom: yes, his role is getting bigger and bigger in every movie but the book was able to create a sense of big suspicion regarding this boy (what if was Longbottom the boy of prophecy?), in the movie there isn't no words about that. What a shame! But these lacks doesn't change my review; I went out the cinema really enthusiastic. It was fun, it was scary, it was intriguing. Best Potter's movie with the Prisoner of Azkaban"

","The Harry Potter franchise is, to be quite honest, rather over-hyped. This fifth instalment was full of endless teenage angst moments, which bored the hell out of me. The acting, particularly in so-called 'emotional' moments, was moribund at best. The film features surprisingly little magic for a film about wizards; rather, it dwells on never ending references to the baddie, who turns up at the end of each film for a ding-dong with Potter. Boo-hoo. The special effects had all the panache of a squashed orange. So what happens in this film? Well, not much. Harry uses a spell in front of a 'muggle' which translates from geek to standard English as 'non-magician'. The powers-that-be get all hot and bothered and say he's out of Hogwarts. Sadly, he doesn't seek gainful employment, but weasles his way back in, as if there was ever any doubt! Harry bags himself a filly, for a snog, but seems to have eyes for some Irish lass as well. On the whole, a very poor effort this film: JK Rowling is one of those champagne socialists who's lucked into a few hundred million because people are so easily pleased."

","The next chapter of the Harry Potter series begins with the gifted young wizard temporarily banned from Hogwarts for misuse of his power. When he finally does return, he tries to warn his classmates of visions signifying the return of the dark Lord Voldemort, but unfortunately his warnings are refuted by a bureaucratic new teacher who places a ban on all use of magic. Believing that he and his classmates may be in grave danger, Harry unites the Order of the Phoenix to prepare for a definitive battle against the treacherous Voldemort. The fifth installment of the series is enthusiastically performed but surprisingly uninspired; story isn't compelling enough to sustain the film's length, and there isn't much magic or adventure until the finale, but even then it's not very awe-inspiring. Die-hard fans of the series will probably enjoy seeing their favorite characters, but there isn't much to take in beyond that. **"

","At a little over two hours long, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is tightly plotted, requiring at least an informal acquaintance with the first four movies. But it's also very well imagined, and what director David Yates did choose to show on the screen was more than sufficient to tell the story of Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>At the end of the fourth movie, Harry emerged from the Triwizard tournament with news that Voldemort had returned, and that Cedric Diggory had been killed by him moments earlier. Of course, this news was met with quite a bit of skepticism by the rest of the magic world, most prominently the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet, the two places to which ordinary wizards look for solid, substantiated information. Even some at Hogwarts are dubious about Harry's claims, although not the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Because the Minister of Magic believes Dumbledore is out for his job and because he's jealous of the relationship the great wizard has with Harry, Hogwarts soon is beleaguered by a brand-new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge, whose lesson plan seems to be to prevent students from learning how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, an act of repression that stirs Harry to begin to teach his fellow students on his own, away from the watchful eye of Umbridge, whose unctuous demeanor and oleaginous personality get her appointed as Grand Inquisitor of Hogwarts, allowing her to enact decrees of such oppressive, hate-filled magnitude that the students are more determined than ever to fight back.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, poor Harry is having terrible visions and nightmares, as he shares some sort of psychic connection with the Dark Lord. Seems Voldemort desires something, something tangible in the Ministry of Magic - but what? Harry's burning forehead scar tells him little, but what visions he does get aren't merely prophetic - they're of things happening right at that moment.<br/><br/>The denouement comes with a terrible, terrifying battle royale at the Ministry itself. Sadly, one of the Good Guys doesn't survive.<br/><br/>I enjoyed a lot of things about this fifth movie: the performances of newcomers Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), Imelda Staunton (Umbridge), Helena Bonham Carter (a delightfully unhinged Bellatrix Lestrange) as well as the veterans of the series - Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Ralph Fiennes, Julie Walters, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, and Michael Gambon; the jaw-dropping special effects, especially those of the ghostly thestrals, which only Luna and Harry can see, among their friends; and the wonderful Room of Requirement and Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place (Sirius' parents' home).<br/><br/>Quite a bit of the book's plot is missing from the movie, of course, including all of the Quidditch scenes and the many scenes in which the students practice for and take their O.W.L. exams; there's also an important sequence in which Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit St. Mungo's to see Mr. Weasley and see Neville visiting his comatose mother and father - up until that point, only Harry knew about the Longbottoms' fate.<br/><br/>About an hour after watching this movie in the theater (a week after it was released), I read the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series, making this a true Harry Potter weekend. Really, I'm about Pottered out entirely right now. Reading the book and then writing this review means I may have forgotten a few things from the movie that I wanted to mention; did I hear about such and such via the seventh book or via the fifth movie? Hmm.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is about what it should be - it's compelling, wildly entertaining, and it keeps in the spirit of the books, if not the preceding movies; the tone continues to darken as we rocket to the the finale of Harry's life at Hogwarts and as the bonds of friendship and loyalty tighten around our collective inquisitive minds."
"harrysaxon","6","0","2","22 July 2007"," Harry Potter 5 brief overview
","Harry Potter 5 was a good as a film, but its relationship to the book was terrible. It cut out too much main stuff, including Ginnys storyline almost entirely-she shouldn't be just in as an extra (she said roughly 5 words), and she deserves to be credited as a main character, as she is too important in the books to be cut out of the films. (As you can probably tell, I like Ginny) Harry and George's fight with Malfoy after the Quidditch match should have been in the film, as there was room for more stuff. The only people who really got any lines in the film were Harry, Ron, Hermione, Lucius Malfoy and Voldemort. Draco Malfoy should have had more than 1 or 2 lines, as again he is too important to be left out. The best scenes were the practise's in the room of requirement, they were the only bits with any look of effort (apart with Dumbledore and Voldemorts fight). I also enjoyed Fred and Georges escape and the scenes with Kreacher in (he was only in because Rowling walked up to Yatesey and told him to put Kreacher back into the script after him being omitted). This director did a decent job on HP4 but an absolutely abysmal job on this film, and I was gutted when i heard that he signed up for HP6. Don't get me wrong, I liked the film, as the good bits made up for the bits that were missed out (approx. half of the book) but Yatesey needs to do a better job on HP6 or the film will lose my vote."
"dannie_lu","4","0","2","22 July 2007"," hardly worth seeing
","As a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, both the books and the films, I came away from watching this film feeling extremely disappointed. From the moment the first scene appears, you can tell that it is poorly directed. The scene showing Harry and Dudley running away is filmed in such a modern, snappy, messy way that you wonder what film you are actually watching. The camera shots used are nothing like the ones in the other films, which makes it distinctly different.<br/><br/>As always, the plot from the book was changed, but not in an effective way. There were too many scenes where Harry was snapping at people, and with Ron and Hermione casting worried glances at each other, but never talking to each other about it. Snape's occlumency lessons were not explained properly, and the people I went to see the film with had never read the books, and failed to understand what on earth Snape was doing to Harry. Cho and Harry actually have a relationship in the novel, but in the film all they got was a snog and a few seconds of muffled conversation.<br/><br/>The most annoying aspect of the film was how everything was crammed in as though the actions of characters weren't significant enough to take up a large amount of time. For example, the whole beginning of the film happened so fast; with Harry getting expelled, the Dursley's leaving, members of the Order coming to pick him up, flying to Grimmauld Place and the hurried explanation of the basic plot. Nothing flowed properly, but a large amount of time was wasted on close-up's of Harry's emotionless face, panting at the camera. Ron and Hermione barely had anything to do with the plot, and probably only had a dozen lines to speak between them.<br/><br/>Many of the events of the film were not explained properly; such as the dismissal of Trelawny, which should have been a more chaotic scene - it seemed as though the actors were improvising on a badly written script at times. And the Weasley twins did not explain why they were escaping, or where they were escaping to. Sirius' death was an extremely badly portrayed subject, as it seemed Harry didn't even grieve for him, or mention him again in the film.<br/><br/>Even if you haven't read the book, the film doesn't break any hearts or convey any emotion. It's far too focused on amazing stunts and scenery rather than conveying the story to the audience. The explanation of the prophecy at the end left many people in my cinema bored, and the whole message of the book was explained at that point. In my opinion, the book is a million times better, and I can only hope the films improve from now on."

","I have never read the Harry Potter book series but I have watched the movies, and I am now sure that this was the best one out of the others. Never had I seen a fight with Dumbledore and You Know Who. I really liked how the professor was trying to take over the school and in the end, she gets the punishment she deserves, also it was pretty funny.<br/><br/>The beginning was quite interesting. Right in the beginning, the action starts when Dudley is attacked by strange creatures, then he comes home all ""loopy"" and blames it on Harry. Harry is also expelled for trying to rescue Dudley using magic and he has to go to a hearing. That's where they meet the evil professor who later tries to take over the school and make everything too strict and dismisses a teacher.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie if you have seen the other Harry Potter movies and/or read the book."
"BernMaya","10","0","3","21 July 2007"," Best movie adaptation of a Potter book
","In my opinion, this is the best movie adaptation of the Potter books. I enjoyed seeing the visuals that I could only picture in my head while reading the book. The battle at the department of mysteries was choreographed really well and I really enjoyed seeing the DA in training as well as the old picture of the members of the Order. The portrayal of the dementors attack at the beginning of the story was so much darker than I imagined. I'm so glad we had a brief glimpse of Kreature. I just wished Jim Dale did the voice over. He is amazing in the audiobook. I never expected the movie to be able to retain all the details in the book, but I wish we had more of the Weasly twin pranks and were able to see more details about James Potter's torment of Snape. The movie also failed to explain the reason why Harry was lured into the department of mysteries ***warning spoilers*** as only the subject of a prophecy can retrieve the record. Noteworthy was Daniel Radcliff's acting. He really matured as an actor in this movie. The actress playing Luna was outstanding, she really brought her to life, with so much softness and so much humanity. Gary Oldman did a real moving portrayal of Sirius Black and dominated every scene he was in. This actor has an amazing ability to express so many emotions without saying a word. When he got hit with the Ava Kedavra curse, I made a loud gasp, even though I knew it was coming. The look on his face was a mixture of surprise, sadness, fear and love for Harry. He is just an outstanding actor. Helena Bonham Carter was born to play Bellatrix Lestrange with her evil laughter and her piercing eyes. Snape appeared much nicer than he is portrayed in the book and we do not see Lilly Evans defending him like in the book. Finally, the lady who played Umbridge was phenomenal. I know she got an Oscar for Vera Drake, but she certainly deserves one for this movie. She delivered an unbelievable performance as the sadistic, manipulative and cunning bureaucrat that sucks the joy out of life. We also never learn that she sent the dementors against Harry in the summer. My only disappointment is that the fountain statues did not come to life like in the book.<br/><br/>I cannot wait for book 6 to be made into a movie. I wonder who will play Slughorn. Can't wait."

","I went early in the morning on a weekday to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, in order to avoid big crowds. After I saw it, I kinda wished I could've been in a big crowd, because big crowds usually applaud after movies. I really wanted to applaud after this film, because it was just so incredible.<br/><br/>I only read the first few chapters in the book, but my brother had told me everything that happens in it. The movie was so well-made that I was on the edge of my seat, even knowing all that happened was going to happen.<br/><br/>I was especially excited during the scenes where Harry is training ""Dumbledore's Army"". The scenes very well-scripted and to the point.<br/><br/>The most exciting scene in the movie is the battle between ""Dumbledore's Army"" and ""Voldemort's Army"". The battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort was thrilling too, and both battles displayed a triumph of good versus evil, and that good always ultimately wins.<br/><br/>The screenplay and directing alike were spectacular in this film. The acting was great too, and is really displaying how much Harry, Ron, and Hermoine have grown up since ""The Sorceror's Stone"".<br/><br/>This is by far the best film in the entire series."
"soxgirl18","10","0","3","20 July 2007"," Favorite Book. Favorite Movie. ""Sirius""ly.
","A novel spanning 870 pages cannot possibly fit entirely into a 2+ hour movie. A movie cannot be, like, 239587 hours long to allow every detail of the book into the movie. Obviously, things from the book are missing in the film version of ""Order and the Phoenix."" However, what is there...is fantastic.<br/><br/>Like ""Goblet of Fire"" before it, ""Order of the Phoenix"" delivers the main theme and plot of the movie - the rising battle between good and evil and the changes within Harry. Unlike GoF, however OoP does this incredibly well.<br/><br/>Also unlike GoF (compared to ""Prisoner of Azkaban""), OoP truly is darker than its predecessor. Much darker. The actors aren't lying this time; this film really is very dark. There are some humorous moments, but overall, it is serious and grave. At the same time, though, it's an excellent movie.<br/><br/>The climactic battle is exactly how I pictured it in the book - hectic, fast-paced, and completely chaotic. It ends almost as quickly as it started, and (as I knew it would since the corresponding pages in my book are tear-stained) that ending resulted in tears streaming down my face.<br/><br/>The acting in this installment, from every actor, is terrific and greatly improved, especially from the young actors...and most especially Daniel Radcliffe. His conflicted angry/calm Harry is believable and honest at all times, and greatly matured. Gary Oldman's Sirius Black is dead on. As every reviewer has said, Imelda Staunton is terrific as Umbridge, completely loathsome, evil, and irritating. She doesn't steal the show though. That honor goes to someone who has only a brief amount of screen time, but she eats it up and, evil murderess lunatic though she is, leaves you wanting more of her character. Casting Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix LeStrange was simply genius on the part of David Yates, whose entire direction of this movie was genius.<br/><br/>So, yes, there are things missing from the book, but if one just focuses on what is in the movie, even a die-hard OoP book fan like myself will be at least satisfied. I was completely surprised, and thrilled, by this movie. GO SEE IT!"

","Well Harry potter is in his fifth year at Hogwarts and these time they will have to face the fact that Voldemort is on the strike again, despite the fact that the Minister doesn't want to recognize this. Well, it is interesting to remark the fact that, as long as the books are better the movies are worse. In the fourth one, we only saw the tournament and well it was not bad, these time there's a bunch of things that happen together in the book and the movie doesn't focus in any of them, then, there's no concrete plot, as the movie wants to tell lots of things but tells any. None of the stories are well developed and it i hard to follow how the movie goes. In addition, the special effects, that used to be impressive, this time are just invisible, there's almost any scene where they are the most little astonishing. Only the fight in the Parlament is decent, but we have seen lots of this before. Unluckily for Potter's fan, this movie is not good, I hope that the next are better. Anyway, is Harry POtter, it is still enjoyable."

","Saw the film last night and what can I say? BRILLIANT! The great thing about these films is that they keep on improving, which seems like a hard thing to do as they are all extremely good films.<br/><br/>Critics say this is the best one yet, and they are not wrong. These films have the knack of turning Non-Believers into major fans. It's great to hear professional critics rave about the films.<br/><br/>It is sad also, that just because these films are a ""franchise"", they are written off as something not worthy of an Oscar or any other prestigious awards. They are constantly being compared to their predecessors and so it can be hard for them to get the positive recognition they deserve.<br/><br/>It sux, because if these films were not in a series (say if Order of the Phoenix was released as an independent film) I would bet just about anything that it would be nominated for an Oscar or something.<br/><br/>But enough of that, this film follows Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) personal journey of being suppressed by authority (authority comes dressed in pink in this film) when most of the Wizarding Community (Harry's only real home and comfort) feels he is lying about the return of the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).<br/><br/>There are claims that this film has too many plots and is hard to follow, but I found it quite straight forward (more so than the last film). Director David Yates has a great knack of explaining all the necessary details clearly and in minimal time. (This is the shortest film, which comes as quite a relief).<br/><br/>For all of the media attention to how ""grim"" and ""dark"" this film is, I entered the cinema thinking all I would leave with severe depression. But I was surprised. This film has quite a few funny moments, but yes, it is grim and rather sad towards the end, but it wasn't that depressing.<br/><br/>Yates has a good sense of visual imagery, despite what some may believe (a shot I particularly liked was after Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) murdered Harry's Godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). Harry (after a moment of slow-motion grief whilst he watches his Godfather die) is overcome with anger and charges after Bellatrix. The camera work is shaky (for a ""rush of anger"" effect) and is just simply brilliant. These kind of rare shots are the kinds of things you wouldn't see in a previous Potter installment.<br/><br/>A sequence I enjoyed (and it hasn't been done in a Potter film before) was when Professor Umbrige (played brilliantly by Imelda Staunton) was exercising her power as High Inquisitor. It is tied to together with a series of juxtaposed scenes. It's fresh and ingenious.<br/><br/>The special effects are again, great. I loved the scene with Grawp (Hagrid's giant half-bro). It was hilarious. Watch out for the hint of romance between Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) not only in this scene but throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>On the subject of romance, the kissing scene between Harry and Cho (Katie Leung) is beautiful. It actually made me a little sad because I wished I was in Cho's position.<br/><br/>Speaking of the actors, I'm not surprised someone wanted to kiss Harry, he's looking damn fine in this film. The three main actors (Radcliffe, Grint and Watson) are all looking more handsome and beautiful, but not only that, they give their best performances to date. They seem to slip into their roles so comfortably.<br/><br/>Grint's performance isn't just about stupid jokes this time, he gets to show more depth in his character (though he does have a rather funny line when he calls another student a ""tosspot""). Watson is still as bright a star as she ever was, and I'm becoming so concerned she's going to leap off of the screen anytime now she's that good.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe has this ability to slip into the role of Harry and give a raw and deep performance, making the audience really sympathize for him. (I wanted to cry in several parts of the movie). He really give a great performance in this film. I was so impressed.<br/><br/>There is a real sense of unity between the three; you can really tell that they have spent the last 7 or so years together. One especially beautiful scene in this film is after Harry gets his first kiss. The trio are just sitting by the fire in the Common-Room together talking. It's a real stunner of a scene.<br/><br/>The adult actors are brilliant, all of them. It's altogether a phenomenal cast.<br/><br/>All in all, these films are not really kids films anymore (ever since the 3rd film). This film is the most mature out of the lot. And as I said, the best.<br/><br/>As a book fan, I was very pleased with what had been left in the film. It was a good adaptation, but moreover a stunning film. The books and the films are two different mediums, so everyone stop moaning about the films not being ""faithful"" and get a life.<br/><br/>Loved the film. Loved it , loved it, LOVED IT! Go see it, everyone."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the longest book of J.K. Rowling's impressive series, turns out to be the shortest of the moviesand it works ! I first must say 'hats off' to director David Yates, a newcomer to the series, and books, who manages to pull off the best Harry Potter screen adaption yet. Using more of artistic film techniques, he crafts an engrossing film that from the extraordinary opening scene, quietly but swiftly draws you into it's taut pace without missing a beat or letting up until after its' spectacular climax.<br/><br/>Although the list of scenes that did not make the cut is very long and may disappoint fans, it works well for a movie adaption and the 2 hours and 18 minutes it clocks in at seems like the perfect length and balance. It shows only what is necessary and important to the core storyline as well as preparing you for the future installments.<br/><br/>I was greatly impressed with the improvement in acting from the younger cast. Some of the emotional scenes Daniel Radcliffe does are so real they sent chills up my spine. The wonderful group of talented adult British actors once again display its' amazing talent as the various teacher's in the famous Hogwarts School. This time around the group has two new additionsImelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter whose two performances border on scene-stealer as they both are wonderful in their roles, Staunton as the Hitler-style teacher, and Carter as the crazily demented follower of Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>The special effects have improved even more, and the magnificent sets are still breath-taking. Another newcomer is the composer, Nicholas Hooper. He fashions a wonderful vibrant score that match most scenes perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall it is a brilliant film adaption of yet another wonderful book."

","It's phenomenal. David Yates brings ""Order of the Phoenix"" to life with the same dark humor and amazing scope that Alfonso Cuaron used so memorably with ""Prisoner of Azkaban."" He has brought the franchise back on track after a misfired fourth film with a delightful but often creepy mix of fantastic effects, stellar performances, and fresh dialogue.<br/><br/>""Order"" moves at a rapid pace, Yates having removed the duller scenes from the book, and it fits very well. as Yates himself said, for as long as the book is, it condenses very nicely. Still, this has been a problem for many fans of the novels who seem to have found too many cut scenes from the book. I have grown up with the ""Potter"" book series, and was vastly disappointed with the parts cut from the last film. For ""Order"" however, the cuts made seem to have enhanced the film rather than hindered it. In fact, some of the parts missing are barely noticeable for even the biggest fans of the novels (myself included) due in large part to some of the performances.<br/><br/>When judging an actor or actress in their portrayal of a book character, I too often find myself judging for appearance (does he/she match what I pictured). Instead, for this film I simply judged them based on whether or not they evoked the same emotions in me as they did in the book. I'll start with the highlights of the cast. Evanna Lynch is perfect as the misty Luna Lovegood, delivering her lines in a chilling, yet comical manner. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Jason Isaacs, and Emma Thompson all reprise their roles very well too. Even Helena Bonham-Carter shows up as the maniacal Bellatrix Lestrange, acting in a pitch-perfect manner that only she could obtain, not to mention the fact that her makeup and costuming is perfect.Still, the best performance in the film is Imelda Staunton's portrayal of the real villain in the story.<br/><br/>Ms. Staunton plays Dolores Umbridge, Harry's sinister new teacher. Her scenes are all immensely funny due to her crazy hilarious range, but she still manages to be quite real and very frightening. She deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod at the Academy Awards. Unfortunately, not all of the performances are quite as good, though they don't really hurt the film.<br/><br/>The only truly bad performance in the film is that of Katie Leung as Cho Chang. She delivers her lines very oddly, and never manages to be sympathetic. For those of you who have seen the third ""Godfather"" film, her performance is very reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's. Luckily, she doesn't have enough screen time for it to be a problem. Michael Gambon plays Albus Dumbledore, and he certainly has the vigorous inner strength that he is supposed to have in the books, but unlike Richard Harris, he can't be soft and gentle. He is always forceful and commandeering. Nonetheless, he does fine in ""OOTP,"" considering the fact that most of his softer moments with Harry have been removed. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint are fine at conveying the simple emotions, such as anger and intense happiness. Unfortunately, they don't have a lot of dramatic range. As Harry, Dan over-acts or under-acts whenever he has to show a subtle emotion. For this reason, he comes off as an overly emotional teen throughout the film. Rupert is not a bad actor, but he's given very strange lines to say, and he says some of them in a rather corny way. Emma Wason is more talented than either of these actors, but she's not given enough to do. Still, these performances don't damage the film. They simply keep it from being even better than it already is.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of ""OOTP"" are incredible. The cinematography shows immense skill and depth, and the film is filled with dark and misty tones, just like the mood of the novel. The art direction is also amazing, perfectly capturing the tone of different scenes. ""Order"" has a lot to serve in terms of visuals, but it's really more about the story. Though the campus has never looked better, the thestrals look very real, Fred and George's fireworks display is awesome,and the dementors are disturbing, the film is not a visual gimmick. It's a story about adolescence, early romances, corruption, and governmental stupidity. It's really quite amazing."

","If you see this movie from outside the box, and not as a Harry Potter Fan, then yes, the movie was a good 2 hour and 18 minutes entertainment. But all the loyal Harry Potter fans have to be completely disappointed. As the series goes on, the movies have become very weak plotted and rushed. Very crucial details are missing. Storyline has changed, and it almost feels like these movies exist in different world than the books do. I walked out of the theater completely disappointed along with my friends, who are Potter crazy. We all thought that the movie was a disaster. The movie provides decent entertainment, if watched in Imax 3D. The enhancement of the picture is very good and worth a few bucks more. Watch this movie as a person who doesn't read Harry Potter books, and you will probably enjoy it more. The biggest book of the series is crunched in the smallest movie of the series? How fair is that? Warner Brothers have to think again, and make sure they deliver better product with the next two remaining movies."

","No, I'm not a big Harry Potter fan. I've dutifully taken my wife to all of these boring,dimwitted movies over the years. In my opinion, each one was a waste of film. The stories, centered around ""Hogwash"", are tedious, wretched, and self-absorbed. I'll never know how the books sold so well. My wife has read all of them. They're probably as ridiculous as the movies. This one in particular was awful. Hermione and Ron had no lines except to react to whatever Harry says. The dialogue is atrocious. My wife kept pinching me because I snore when I sleep and she was afraid the usher would ask us to leave. And what's up with the retarded giant who's tied to a tree? Yes, the gameskeeper has a retarded giant for a brother and although he's an adult, he wears a diaper and is tied to a tree. The special effects weren't that great. Centuars and other creatures bounce around so quickly, it's hard to appreciate their appearance (or or lack of). It was a crashing bore interspersed with zapping fireballs.

","After five films I have come to realise that it is very difficult to translate these books to the screen. Imagination is far more powerful than CGI,and we all have favourite bits that end up being left out, unless we want to sit through a 15 hour movie that is.<br/><br/>After the disappointment of the last movie, I was apprehensive about this one, though hopeful, there was much that could be dropped from the book, which was a touch overlong. I am pleased that we are now back on track.<br/><br/>The film flowed, what was changed worked well and did not feel disjointed, like No 4. It built up to the action well and the cast have developed strongly. The three leads all putting in solid performances. Those that stood out for me were, in no particular order, Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, an odd character handled in a subtle, gentle way, top marks. Matthew Lewis' Neville Longbottom has come to the fore and the scene where he tells Harry about his parents was moving. The two adults that I enjoyed the most were Imelda Staunton as Delores Unbridge and Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange, admittedly both parts were showy so were already larger than life, but the danger with any part like that is the temptation to go over the top. Neither actress fell into this trap.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the DA classes, which cleverly developed the story line leading to Harry's first kiss, Ginny's spell strength, Neville as already mentioned above and much more, each scene drew you in as if you were part of the action and you cared. The final action sequence was gripping and just a little confusing, which was what I felt when I read the book, by confusing I mean not the plot but the fact that so much is happening all at once, the group are living on their wits, on the edge of death they are fighting for survival against a much stronger enemy.<br/><br/>So all in all much more enjoyable, better edited, thought out and directed than NO 4, the skill of the young actors is growing and we have two more films to look forward to. With the new book out on Saturday, let's hope Harry lives."
"Mush_Man29","8","0","1","19 July 2007"," Finally, a Harry Potter film worth watching without throwing up
","Having seen (and being bitterly disappointed by) the previous Harry Potter films, filled with cheesy grins and superfluous acting, I went in to see The Order of the Phoenix without too much expectation.<br/><br/>Ironically, my least favourite book in the series instantly became my favourite film. Yes, there is a LOT in the book(s) that have not made it into the film - the inclusion of Kreacher was barely added by special request of J.K Rowling - apparently it has reference to the final book according to her website. However, all these cuts are understandable. An author works with an endless budget of words, while Warner Bros were restricted by money, time and practicality - yet it has managed to make a fair movie worth remembering.<br/><br/>Great action sequences, screenplay that works well, and that touch of British humour (as was seen in The Goblet of Fire) lets us laugh, shudder, and cry. However, this time around, we're not laughing at how corny it is, nor shuddering at how much of a failure this movie is, and crying at the death of the Harry Potter ""magic"".<br/><br/>The film itself is wonderful. The attention to detail and the dedication put into the film, as well as the visual stunners - as with all Harry Potter films - make it a must watch for anyone who has seen a Harry Potter film, or indeed read a book."
"carly_hope","10","0","1","18 July 2007"," It gets better with each movie.
","I will start with what was great in all the previous movies and that is casting. our old friends did yet again a great job. Oliver & James and their grand departure were simply splendid. Heartbroken Bonnie was so touching. the banter between Rupert and Emma batter then ever. and Daniel - he was simply wonderful. since Harry practically carries this story on his shoulders he was asked to do a lot and he held out, with honors. the adults didn't have as much space as before but were incredible as usual.<br/><br/>the new additions to cast were perfect. Imelda was unbelievable as the sweet cruel and fanatic new teacher and Helena played the crazy Bellatrix with gusto. but the one that truly shined on screen was Evanna. the girl from a different place, her mind never really present but so indispensable.<br/><br/>as for the story there was lot missing from the book and the ones who didn't read it might be confused at times but as an ending result it is a pretty compact tale. <br/><br/>humor is another thing that makes the books so unique and it was there, carefully portioned in between all the darkness, insecurities and fear.<br/><br/>the editing on this one was great too. sometimes the pictures flowed like a stream, calm and peaceful, other times the sequences changed in a video clip fashion and every time in the right moment.<br/><br/>this movie, however had what I missed in the previous ones the most - a great finale. the anticipation was built perfectly and exploded into a battle that was long enough to not disappoint or get lost among the other scenes.<br/><br/>the fact that David Yates is directing the next movie too thrills me to no end.<br/><br/>so what is the conclusion? it was funny, it was breathtaking, it was heartbreaking, it was magical."
"jokern24","6","0","1","18 July 2007"," You Need to Read This!!
","I must say that i thought this movie was semi-horrible and semi-okay!!<br/><br/>I agree with Java 5989, when he/she says that the best films were the first and second because the screenplays were very close with that of the book. In this movie, i wondered where the director got the scenes from.<br/><br/>I also agree that Richard Harris's portrayal of Dumbledore was amazing. He became the character described in the novels. I found Dumbledore to be comforting. I felt at ease when I saw, heard, and/or read about him. Michael Gambon does not have that effect on me. To be honest I feel the complete opposite. He scares me, especially his voice-it's so harsh. I have not liked him since day one. <br/><br/>I am disappointed that they didn't show the St. Mungo's scene, the howler sent to Petunia (i believe it to be important),Quidditch (tear), etc. I know that not everything can be put in the films, but I can't help but feel critical, very critical. <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the novel that showed Harry's emotions the most. He feels angry all the time and he is impatient and frustrated. At first I was excited to see how the film would display these emotions. When I saw the film I was definitely disappointed! Daniel Radcliffe didn't display any anger. He seemed stoic. I was expecting him to be yelling and in everyones's faces. When talking to Sirius he merely said ""I just feel so angry, all the time."" He had a great way of expressing that! And what upset me the most was the scene in the room with the veil. Oh My Gosh!!! They made Harry look weak! In the book he was adamant about not letting Voldemort get the prophecy. He would have died before handing it over but in the film Harry gives it to Lucius. That p.m.o!! The director is off his rocker. I hope he's not directing the next film because if he does i won't watch it. Sorry! That angered me the most. <br/><br/>And when does Harry talk to Voldemort in the novel? Someone please show me where that happened because the dialog between Harry and LV kinda ruins the point of the series. What Harry says is relevant but that should be down the road,like in the last film.<br/><br/>There is a positive among my opinions. I did like the effects especially at the Ministry of Magic. That was incredible. The fight scene between the Death Eaters and Order members was cool; the black and white twirling in the air( i don't know where in the novel it is described but oh well)<br/><br/>The movie series are nor consistent nor cohesive. The movies don't flow because of how the directors see the book. I know I'm not a professional critic but i think viewers should know. Hopefully the next two films will be better."
"Dizzdazz123","10","0","1","18 July 2007"," As a Harry Potter fan, LOVED IT!
","I have seen this film and can only come up with one word to say 'AWESOME!'. This could easily pass as the best Harry Potter movie in the series at the moment. It's just like the book, gripping and very dark. The characters were played very beautifully and the new characters weren't on for too long or too short but the times were just right. <br/><br/>I am a big Harry Potter fan of both the books and the movies and can easily say that whatever bad things you hear about it, they are wrong. The effects was mind-blowing, the acting was superb, the characters were amazing and the battle scenes was fantastic. Before I watched it, all I heard was ""not enough action"" and ""the acting was too frozen"", I say that all of that is absolutely wrong. Sure, there wasn't so many action scenes but God were they good! And as for the acting, they were so wrong it's unbelievable. Imelda Staunton was great as the bitchy evil teacher, Professor Jane Umbridge and also Evanna Lynch who played Luna Lovegood played her amazingly. I would say that everything, and I mean everything, was just right. So, to all of you people in doubt, especially Harry Potter fans, don't be! But if you are the picky type, then don't whinge and whine about it because there is nothing wrong about this movie, FACT!"

","how could a Pottter fan go wrong with this one? blissful visuals. I don't know where they found David Yates, but I am pleased to know he will be directing Half-Blood Prince as well & will be looking forward to his future projects to come.<br/><br/>exciting plot/story. It almost hardly bores. It may have a lot missing that was in the book (subplots, etc.), but that happened for the two films before it (azkaban & goblet) and they are probably my two favorites next to OotP.<br/><br/>an amazing cast that truly grows better & better one release after the other. At first I was disappointed that the Order themselves weren't in it more, but now that I recall, they weren't really in the book that much either, at least for anything truly important or worth adapting, especially when trimming a book that was almost 900 pages down to almost two & a half hours of screen time. Also, Daniel Radcliffe shows us a new dimension of Harry Potter, and a new side of him as well in acting prowess. I believe this to be his best performance to date.<br/><br/>As my heading states, I like to call Order the Empire Strikes Back of the series. I don't say that to compare it to the Star Wars film or series, though I'm sure Rowling has borrowed many epic formulas which Lucas himself adapted from hundreds of films & stories before his time. I call it that because it made me feel the similar atmosphere as Empire: tragic losses, angst, betrayal, the overbearingly bad outweighing the good , the distresses & personal conflicts & pain the protagonist(s) must face. I could go on, but refuse.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, this may not be your favorite HP film, but it is my own favorite so far. I doubt anyone will see this and not be disappointed at what they see. Really the only thing I can think of that would tick any of the fans off is how much they cut out from the book, but as peeved as I was about it, after awhile I just learned to accept it for what it was: a great, entertaining movie, & deep down, a faithful adaptation."
"mikee_pie","6","0","1","18 July 2007"," No ""Magic"" to this movie
","Coming into the cinemas, I had high expectations for this because I read all the comments and mostly all of the user comments was commendable, so I went to the movie thinking that I'd have the time of my life watching it but boy was I ever disappointed...<br/><br/>I guess for the first forty or so minutes of the movie, it was all talk and no action. One or two members from the audience behind me were already half asleep when the action started. I confess myself to be a Harry Potter die-hard fanatic which is why I felt rather disappointed with it. The special effects were fine, the acting was OK, there were just no magic for me when I watched the movie. Probably because the people on the cinema where I watched were just casual fans, and through the whole movie it was just quiet and stuff. There were no cat-calls during the Cho and Harry kissing scene, there were no applause during the escape of the Weasley twins, nothing. I didn't feel very involved with the movie. Granted I will say that the Cinema facilities in the States is more superb than what we have here in the Philippines, but still--it was a disappointment for me overall. Although I will admit that the last scene at the fight at the Ministry was very well made, and the fight of Dumbledore and Voldemort was a visual feast in the eyes but other than that, nothing...<br/><br/>I will say this however, that this movie is better than the last one (which isn't saying much because Goblet of Fire sucked). Overall, I'd give this movie a B- for the efforts of the actors (specially Daniel Radcliffe, he improved so much)so take my comments for what its worth but there you go..."
"igorkresic","6","0","1","18 July 2007"," Lacks the freshness of Previous Potter films
","First off, the last two Harry Potter movies (Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire) were standouts in the series and although Order of the Phoenix is a very good looking film it has lost some of the spark of previous Potter adventures.<br/><br/>A noticeable problem in the movie is its duration, which at 138 minutes makes it the shortest film despite it being based on the longest book. Despite being known as the weakest novel, which it isn't, some of the many concepts in the book are therefore not fully realized. The pacing at times seems a little off and throughout the film there is a definite sense that something is missing. Harry Potter fans will notice the absence of a quidditch match for example, a previous hallmark of the series.<br/><br/>A wonderful aspect of the film, however is the great casting, Alan Rickman is again fantastic, Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is perfect, Helena Bonham Carter's introduction to the franchise is marvelous and last but definitely not least Imelda Staunton as Umbridge is pure casting genius. Her performance is a highlight of the film and warrants the price of a ticket itself. Less flattering to the movie however is Daniel Radcliffe's performance (as Harry), which although with its highlights reaches a stage nearer the end where it becomes slightly unbelievable and laboured. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have done a good job with the screen time they were given. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore despite some rumblings does a great job as a distant but highly relevant mentor to Harry.<br/><br/>This film will undeniably delight Harry Potter fanatics despite many omissions, (some of course are understandable given the novel's length) but to many moviegoers it is an experience which although providing visual sensation at times is not quite up to the standard of previous Potter films."
"ananirtudosi","6","0","1","18 July 2007"," Why Yates?
","I read the books, I like the books but for some reasons The movie versions seems to be so,so... So, well, honestly I wasn't too interested when a friend of mine asked me to watch this movie on the first day of its release. <br/><br/>Thankfully I wasn't expecting much, and got just it. I knew it's not going to cover the whole story line as in the book and I knew that with the recent release of Transformers, the visual FX of Harry Potter would seem like a century behind. The fact that I've already forgotten most of the book-version story helped. <br/><br/>For the fans though, story line isn't that important. They already knew, so all they have to do was just memorizing which is which. The fanatics will cheers on every occasion while the purists may having a bit of grumpy mood over some neglected scenes in the book that supposed to be there.<br/><br/>I consider myself as a neutrals, having read the book but not a devoted fans though I have the tendency to be a bit of a purists. So I'm a bit critical about how the director visualize the scenes in the book. I must say that I feel sorry for David Yates and whoever that is going to direct the next Harry Potter. But that doesn't mean that I'm going to be forgiving as to how Yates tells his version of this fifth Potter. While some of the actors give a noticeable performance, Radcliffe did much better than he was in the Goblet of Fire, Yates doesn't seems to be able to grab how Potter should be told. He was merely doing a copy and paste, and worse, some cutting too, here and there. Pacing has always been the most difficult part in making Harry Potter movies, and Yates can't do much of it either. Imelda Staunton and Emma Thompson though, might have been the savior for us, neutrals, as they keep the movie alive with their acts. <br/><br/>So the verdict is, well, fair enough. The fans, no matter what the critics say will have to watch the movie, Yes, of course, you must."
"becky-mead","9","0","1","18 July 2007"," A film that finally lives up to the book and fans expectations.
","When i saw the last Harry Potter film (Goblet of Fire) i was incredibly disappointed, i found the performances of the characters slightly strained and it seemed more interested in showing the action of the Triwizard tasks rather than the underlining plot. So i went in to this film expecting much of the same thing. But by god i was in for a surprise. For starters the music to the film was far more grown up, giving the mood of the film its dark atmosphere as it is felt in the book. But by far the best part of the film was the performances of Daniel Radcliffe and the cast. They all really came into their own, the characters were finally true to the books. I especially loved Luna Lovegood, i thought the acting was bang on the spot by Emmerline Vance. I did however think that Bellatrix could have had a bigger speaking part but understand that timing in the film would have been an issue. Like in the last film i found it dragged on far to long. I also think that Umbridge could have been slightly more nasty, as i didn't quite feel the hate reaction that is felt when reading the book. Many hints were also dropped during the film that true die hard fans will pick up immediately, it makes me smile how JK Rowling has put these in as a tantalising glimpse of what can be expected in Deathly Hallows. So all in all it is a must see for any Harry Potter fans, but if you are new to Harry Potter, it is probably best that you read the book first, as i fear you may get rather bored as plot line is the key part of this film, rather than constant action like the previous film. I cant wait for Deathly Hallows, and the next film. So, enjoy the film, Bibi xxx"

","o.k the main quarrel people have with this film is that it is far too fast paced and unexplained as it cuts out major scenes from the book.<br/><br/>however, as much as i think that the books are outstanding and do deserve to be represented more accurately on the big screen , it has to be said that i enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>albeit some aspects such as Gabon's portrayal of dumbledore wound me up a little but i don't think there is any denial that above all the film entertained me for 2+ hours, without the """"cringe factor"""" which i got in allot of the other films especially the second and third e.g. ; the choir with toads at the start of POA. the plus points were that in all honesty the director did do a fine job, i think it is ludicrous to think that anything more could be expected, the book is huge and to make it into a film which makes sense and develops the plot well is a fair achievement in itself.<br/><br/>i fail to see why so many hate this film,, in all honesty it is the best one so far and puts the last three to shame. no one can honestly say they were bored in the cinema watching it, would anyone have considered actually walking out on it?? if not then how can you rate it as poor , when clearly like me you were entertained by the marvellous effects, battles and performances..."

","Being a moderate fan of the series of books, I approached this movie with reserved hopes and was still disappointed with the final product. In a movie with so much potential, some bad directorial decision coupled with some bad acting sink this film from the very start.<br/><br/>The movie fails to explore many sub-plots instead choosing to ignore major issues that these sub-plots will undoubtedly lead to in favor of smoothing them over, making the story less complicated, but also far too thin and in some cases seemingly meaningless.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe once again shows that he was clearly cast for his appearance over his talent with a very wooden showing. His scenes of ""anger"" were always missing something and instead of seeming like he had troubles, he often appeared more as a jerk. The saving grace of the acting was the ever-brilliant Gary Oldman who can make even the most unimportant conversation feel like it carries the entire message of the series. it is also worth noting that Imelda Staunton did an admirable job of playing such a pathetic character.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Daniel Radcliffe missed a step here in what has thus far been a passable career, Gary Oldman continues to be an incredible acting talent and Mr. David Yates should pass Alfonso Cuaron the rights to make the next Potter film as he has crafted the best one so far."

Yes, I gave it 6 stars but that's simply for the fact that the smallest tiniest bits they did manage not to completely screw up were excellent. (and the fact that Alan Rickman as Snape and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy were SUPERB in this film) All I have to say is I want Alfonoso Cuaron and Steve Kloves back. This Yates guy and the idiot screenwriter they had on OotP need to never ever touch the HP series again.<br/><br/>Unfortunately they are doing the next film (my favourite book) so I can only imagine how horribly awful that will be. I'm sure they'll reduce Rickman/Snape's screen time to about 12minutes.<br/><br/>oh and btw: do NOT see this film in IMAX 3D for your first showing. It's already insanely too fast to comprehend normally, let alone jumping out at you on an enormous screen.<br/><br/>to summarize-- this film was too fast, edited BADLY (I mean, baddddddly, maybe 60% of the book shows up in the film), and too dark (and by that I mean actually too dark, lighting wise, you could hardly see what was going on half the time) otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed it. *shrug* sorry, pointless review, I know."

","It's here! It's here! With the long awaited book #7 on the verge of release, Harry Potter mania is at frenzy level and this has transferred over to the newest movie, which is based on book #5. It may be the adolescent girl in me, but I am a Potter fan. I have read all the books (okay, okay, yes, more than once) and book 5 is my favorite so far, so my expectations may have been a tad high going into this one, but this is the worst Potter movie effort thus far. Although, still an enjoyable film, the editor's knife was a little sharp here. Although, it is already just over two hours, this is the longest Potter book and has been made into the shortest Potter movie. The result is short, almost choppy scenes that seem more suited to the trailer than the main feature. If Yates had put in another half hour or so, this effect may have been eliminated. The story is good, however, and the young cast is improving. The effects are good but also missing are the slow tacking shots that gave Hogwarts much of its wonder.<br/><br/>Harry, Hermione and Ron are all back and times at Hogwarts are hard. The Ministry For Magic is denying the return of evil incarnate, Lord Voldemort, and is out to discredit both Harry and Dumbledore who is played rather emotionally by Michael Gambon, who plays him like he has never read the Potter books. The Adult characters have formed a secret society (The Order of The Phoenix) to combat the Death Eaters, while Harry and friends prepare to defend themselves in these dangerous times and battle against the new ministry-approved Hogwarts presence, Delores Umbridge (played very well by Staunton), by forming a secret defense against the dark arts club. The characters are getting older and teenage romance is here, as well. Yates tries to make up for compressing a long novel into a movie through use of montages and short, quickly cut scenes. This hurts the end product, but it is difficult for me to gage how this affects non-Potter readers' ability to follow the story.<br/><br/>Potter fans will flock to this film, of course, and enjoy seeing the book brought to life on the big screen. The story here is darker and more about conflict than mystery. The growing numbers of characters compete for screen time, but it's still an entry in a top-notch fantasy adventure series. I'm sure that many of the legions of Potter fans will take issue with any criticism and I certainly have been critical here. Perhaps, this review has turned out harsher than I intended. This is still a good movie, I just can't help thinking how much better it could have been.<br/><br/>(This work first posted on realmoviereview.com)"
"phantom_causes","3","0","1","17 July 2007"," Disgrace to Harry Potter Series
","Before I get eaten alive by fans of this movie, I'd like to stress that my review is based upon having read the books. As I die-hard HP I was sincerely looking forward to this movie until I saw it in theaters. Initially though, when I heard it was only 2hrs & 18 minutes long, I wasn't sure if such a short film (by HP standards) would live up to its predecessors. Unfortunately, my premonitions about the movie were dead on.<br/><br/>One of the movie's major down-falls is that it completely fails to do the book justice in movie form. Inaccuracies fill the movie in droves throughout every major scene of the movie. Many key plot pieces or events such as Quidditch or Ron & Hermione (not to mention Malfoy) becoming prefects. Others seem completely disorganized such as Fred & George's escapade on their broomsticks because so much was left out. Then of course come the blatant alterations, such as Harry's collapse during the escapade scene.<br/><br/>The movie seems to have lost the luster of the previous Harry Potter movies because there is simply not enough of the story present to determine otherwise. Although many critics say this is due to the darker undertones of the movie, I believe it's simply a product of poor directing. Maybe the writers would've fared better producing at least a 3 hr movie. A final thought: What happened to leaving the movies true to the books?"

","OK ill start with what you may expect:read the book by reading the book u will understand all of this film and thus you will find it more interesting,and in the contrary this is simply the best potter movie yet. One thing is certain this movie isn't for kids.now things get complicated,twisted and a bit scary sometimes therefore a more advanced age public will enjoy it best The only drawbacks about this film can be found at the duration.Fans will want a 3h film to explain all but lets take it like this: potter fans want a 3-4h film to explain all the gaps while the casual public prefers a 2h film with loads of action therefore the film satisfied both parts because it contained the most important scenes in the book masterfully changed(few) to fit the time without reducing their intensity. Still if u are a book reader fan think it like this:does the film make you feel like the book,if not watch again the scenes with umbrage,snape's past and even poor serious. Finally the battle with voldemort was simply superb,on some places it was better than the book.the effects of the death eaters fight with the order were superb to,it showed a true threat this time making things look darker as they are."

For once let Hermoine not act as if every word she says is grave! She can really have a more than a concerned expression on her face! The first two were awesome movies! The second really kept you on the edge! From then on it has become a so-so affair! Even Snape was too unrealistic in this one, he did not bring about the apathy or sympathy one feels for the character in the book, or even in previous films!<br/><br/>But what really irks me is why do they change the plot line at all!!?!? Isn't it captivating enough! Why make Harry seem such an innocent bystander at the Ministry battle? We feel none of the pent up fury Harry faced all along summer! He doesn't even seem angry when he meets his friends! Kreacher's all too important bits from the book are out! Ginny doesn't get to say any good lines... The battle scenes were well made, but seem too short. I didn't feel a thing when someone died!<br/><br/>All in all, if you haven't read the book go see the movie and you'll really enjoy it!

","This was easily the worst of all the Harry Potter movies. I don't know if I should blame the embarrassingly slow screenplay, or the terrible direction. The only reason it even got a four is because the film looked good and the acting (Daniel Radcliffe excluded, he was terrible)was because just about all the other actors were good. I have never read a Harry Potter book and never will, but this either was adapted poorly or it really is the weakest of the books because it made the worst film by far. Right now this has an 8.1 rating here, and I believe it is because of all the fan-boys that give it a 10 don't really base the film on it's ACTUAL merits. I would not recommend this film to anyone less than 13 years old. I wouldn't even recommend this to people that are fans of the book because it can't be any worse than this. I always feel that movies, yes even sequels should have some sort of conclusion to them. There is absolutely no sort of conclusion to this film at all; it is 2 hours and 18 minutes of setting the viewers up for the inevitable fight between Harry and the Bad guy! That's it and that's all? If you were to take out all of the special effects, there would have been nothing to take out of this film. The director David Yates, I have never heard of and hope that I never do again. It amazes me that they would trust a multi-billion dollar enterprise with a basic unknown. I know it did really well Box office wise, but that is just because of the Harry Potter name alone. If this was the first of the Harry Potter films, we would have never seen another one. If you do see this film, just watch the last 30 minutes and you wouldn't have missed a thing."

","I'm sorry, but this movie reeked of poor craftsmen ship from the start. I went in to this believing a darker take would bring new material or possibilities to the forefront, but all I kept thinking was why is nothing happening. Constant repetition of irrelevant plot points driving home that they are at a school of magic. Nothing new was created or expounded upon. I just kept thinking is something interesting going to happen. Then I remembered that the author was a hack and basically ripped off things from Tolkien, so I didn't feel so bad. I remembered that she cranked out books for profit and not artistic merit or value. The filmmakers created their own mess with erratic cutting and jumpy plot shifts. Then I checked the no-name director with unheard of credits and realized again this is all of money and the masses are ignorant enough to feed the beast. Harry Potter is the easily digestible knock off hack bus. Everyone that gets on knows no better because they are either below the age of 12 or completely uncultured and without pedigree. I found this movie completely boring and I went into believing it would be entertaining. Boy, was I wrong. What garbage."

","First of all,let this thing get straight:""If you are to make a movie entirely according to the 800+ book, it would take 6-8 hrs of a movie"".So die hard readers of HP book- be ready to get disappointed when you go for this movie as the movie does not entirely portray the book.But as in whole it has tried to get the essence of the book but being the shortest movie(only 2hrs and 18 mins!!!) its natural that we readers would feel disheartened.This is exactly what happened to me when i went to watch the most awaited HPATOOTP.The only thing i felt they should have tried to show us more, was about the prophecy.In the book,the prophecy has been given so much importance and had been explained so much ,well, in the movie it gets over in 2 mins(making only the part"" should kill each other as neither can survive when the other is alive"" clear to the audience) The remaining part of the prophecy(how Neville came close to being the ""Boy who lived"" has been left out and there is no further explanation of the same(sigh!!)Furthermore i was surprised to see how the character of Dumbledore was changed: He is being shown as an extremely powerful and a strong character whereas we all know how he is in the book.Well to say it short, the director has done a good job in putting across the essence of the book to the audience in just 2hrs and 18 mins.They could have stretched the movie a little more( thats what book readers would say i guess :-) ),otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable,fast paced movie(with gripping climax and effects)."

","I couldn't help but feel as if the entire film was rushed, it varies from the book significantly along plot line's both major and minor. I found the order of the phoenix the most enjoyable book of the series however this film seemed to squeeze the life out of the book and utterly ignore a lot of the story. In the end the film just felt as if it was an excuse to throw together a few action scene's coupled with a lot of special effects. The final fight sequence is cut down to the bare minimum along with the Weasleys departure from Hogwarts which did not fully express the reaction of the people or the actions of the twins and a lot of the deeds that took place in the house of black seem to be completely overlooked."

","As I said in my subject, I totally agree with you. Although, for some reason, I liked the 3rd and 4th movie better, I agree with everything you say concerning Order of the Phoenix. I know a lot of people complain of those who are picky about details, but this is not what it is about. I went to the movie feeling that it's was gonna be great and although as a whole the movie was good (Dolores Umbridge and Luna Lovegood were brought to life spectacularly) that was it, the movie didn't set ground for more. I do wish to add though that I'm extremely looking forward to the DVD release mainly because this film was edited after the Grindhouse flop in the box office due to fear of the movie being too long. I'm hoping that maybe, if an unedited release is made, I can finally see the movie I was hoping for to see all summer."
"HilaryevaE","5","0","1","16 July 2007"," Mediocre
","Good Points <br/><br/> Fantastic special effects! Technology has changed over the past few years. The first Harry Potter movie was very simple and filmmakers simply could not produce the tough and unique details that the film needed. As more films have been released the special effects have gotten stronger and the capabilities of some high-tech devices used for movies have become extraordinary. <br/><br/> Imelda Staunton played Dolores James Umbridge extremely well. Imelda really captured the characters personality and feelings and made it her own. Imelda gave Professor Umbridge an edge that brought the character alive. It's so mysterious and yet scary when someone portrays themselves as the nicest person in the world but underneath that innocent smile is a devil with horns with a mind of evil and cruelty. <br/><br/> Daniel Radcliffe really understood his role and the deep emotion that came with it. Daniel really was in his character and seemed to be in tone with the characters feelings. This movie is about Harry Potter battling with himself. As the main character is trying to decipher things for himself he has to fight other dark forces while staying in touch with his inner emotions.<br/><br/>Bad Points <br/><br/> Emma Watson and Rupert Grint did not get a lot of screen time in the movie. This movie would have been better if these two main characters had a larger role. Emma Watson however did not do Hermione Granger justice. Emma wasn't really into her character and most of her screen time was spent talking extremely fast and there really was no emotion attached in her role. <br/><br/> This whole movie seemed to take on a very dark and scary persona. As the movies progress there seems to be less cheerful times and it seems that horror and darkness take up most of the movies time. The only good part of the movie was when Fred & George Weasley flew on their broomsticks and disturbed testing. <br/><br/> The filmmakers didn't care to explain what happened to Professor Umbridge after she was attacked by the centaurs. They also didn't explain who attacked Arthur Weasley. <br/><br/> Lots of important things were left out of the movie that was in the book. I would have loved to see St. Mungo's. The movie all in all was a complete and utter embarrassment to the Harry Potter name."

","I am an avid reader of the Harry Potter books and I didn't expect them to be able to fit everything that's in a 870 paged book into a two hours and eighteen minute movie. I was thoroughly impressed by Evanna Lynch's performance as Luna Lovegood, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, and Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge. In nearly every scene, Emma Watson is still acting as though she had just shot the scene after running a mile. I noticed that Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint's acting has improved. Tom Felton(Draco Malfoy) has been given less lines despite the fact that he has to play a big role in the next movie. The special effects are like nothing we ever seen before and we get to see the even darker side of the magical world than we did in the first four movies. Overall, this movie was in my opinion the best Harry Potter so far."

","I was disappointed that they skipped Quidditch. i wanted to see a bit of that . like when Ron was heaving trouble with it and stuff, Wesley is the King!<br/><br/>i really agree Teaker1228 on what he said. the movie was nothing when you have read the book. but the movie the fight and when voldemort showed up . and what happened to harry then . it was all so cool . but i gave it three because of the story and the book . if i had not read the books then the movie would have been great . like Teaker1228 said . The first Harry Potter book was just over 300 pages in length. The movie was roughly 152 minutes according to the DVD in front of me at this moment. The fifth book was 870 pages. and this is true to Overall, it was like they took the book, cut out all of the pages, added their own to the pile, and then pasted it all into an order that they saw fitting. You'll notice however, that the film did in fact get a 4 from me. You may ask why. That answer is simple. The soundtrack and special effects were amazing. Fight scenes were rather enjoyable, and the music was wonderful. Really, I think the people responsible for these things should have been the only one to receive any recognition. So if you've read and enjoyed the books, this movie really isn't for you. If you've read the books, enjoyed them, but are there for special effects, you may enjoy it. If you've never read the books and your knowledge is based purely on the movies, you'll probably find this one an enjoyable addition to the series. so it was alright"

It still is a must see I'm not saying i hated it or anything, but i just didn't like it so much; I LOVED IT! So yeah you should watch it but if you want LOTS of fun IMAX would do, but not necessary you can still go to your local multiplex, regal, AMC Theatere, etc. So overall this movie deserves an A and if it was a notch better A++. And even though, even though the movie had LOTS of talking, it was interesting and there were so many FUNNY PARTS AND ACTION SCENES. So I'm about to change my mind to the second best! Still close to the best! So just watch it no matter what, where, when (well actually before it gets out of theaters!)"
"MartaRusek","10","0","3","16 July 2007"," An Exciting, Mature Leap Forward
","Of all the films in the Harry Potter franchise, the fifth installment marks the first time our hero truly earns his place in story. This time around, Harry must contend with the newly-enfleshed Lord Voldemort, the media (or the equivalent of one in the wizarding world), and the prim and proper Dolores Umbridge, the newly appointed Defense Against the Dark Arts prof. Times have changed in the world of Hogwarts, and not for the better. Harry and Dumbledore face an uphill battle against the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet, both of which seek to discredit the duo's claim that He Who Must Not Be Named has indeed returned to re-ignite his reign of terror. Believing that they are in grave danger, Ron and Hermione persuade Harry to school them and his fellow classmates in the art of defense. <br/><br/>Thankfully, director David Yates takes a cue from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban director Alfonso Cuaron utilizes a motif to unify the story and its many complexities. Whereas Cuaron used clocks and the concept of time to movie the story forward, Yates opts for newspapers and the idea of truth. Yates and company cleverly make use of newspaper headlines in the Daily Prophet as a means to deliver information quickly and concisely, but at the same time shows audiences the often biased nature of printed media. We the audience believe Harry wholeheartedly because, after all, we did see him take on the Dark Lord in the previous installment. But this is the wizarding world, and although witches and wizards are capable on conjuring up magnificent spells and potions, at the end of the day they are very much like Muggles - they only believe that which they see with their own eyes. <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is decidedly more violent than the previous films, which, despite the PG-13 rating, did very little to deter children from attending (or in my case, failed to deter parents from bringing their infants and overactive two-year-olds to the theater). Despite the darkness of the story or the on screen atmosphere, it is hard not to see this film as somewhat of an allegory to our world today. As the controlling Dolores Umbridge points out to a defiant Professor McGonagall: ""If you question my authority you are questioning the authority of the Ministry of Magic itself, and that is considered disloyalty!"" Umbridge's remarks represent the sorry state of things today, where questioning even the most remote of issues conjures up the terms ""loyalty"" and ""disloyalty,"" and the brazen accusation that you're ""with us or against us."" <br/><br/>There can be no doubt that is Harry's film. Daniel Radcliffe proves that he is the definitive personification of the character, and he earns his keep in this harrowing segment of the saga. For the first time, he is truly on his own and taking advantage of his true leadership potential. Before, from The Sorcerer's Stone to The Goblet of Fire, his adventures were more like unfortunate mishaps with lucky breaks, which Harry himself admits to his friends and his viewers during the course of this film. This time, Harry is strong enough to stand up to the people who mean him harm. He still lets his emotions get the best of him, as we see in the first five minutes of the film, when he stands up to his bullying cousin when Dudley and company tease Potter about his dead parents. As the film progresses, the message regarding Harry and his intense relationship with emotions comes clear - lose the emotions or lose your life. In the world of witchcraft and wizardry, unprotected and carelessly kept emotions provide Voldemort a suitable path into the head of an unsuspecting wizard, where he can wreak havoc and mayhem to the point of insanity. So it would seem that men with emotions, real or fictional, are highly contemptible, but for different reasons. Even with the frilly cloaks and velvet wizard caps, there is a still a strong sense of masculinity alive and well in the Harry Potter universe.<br/><br/>A rich, exciting journey worth experiencing again and again, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix proves that delivering a Harry Potter film word for word from the book from which it is based is a practice of the past. We have thankfully left the territory of Chris Columbus and entered into a realm where detail-oriented viewers are rewarded and the director isn't afraid to take the them into more intelligent territories. It is obvious that these young actors and actresses have been given more room to explore the dimensions of their characters, and their performances are better for it. Most importantly, the audiences are given room to interpret and enjoy the film as they choose. As an adaptation of a novel in a beloved series or even as an anti-war message, the fifth Harry Potter film gives everyone, especially the lagging film industry, a much-needed summer boost."
"staffermom","9","0","2","16 July 2007"," The best Harry Potter adaptation so far...
","My first piece of advice is the same as it would be for any other cinematic adaptation of a book. Read the book before you watch the movie. There are a couple things (Who sent the dementors after Harry, why Fudge refuses to believe Voldemort is back, etc.) that are never fully explained in the movie. For anyone who didn't read the book and wants to know Umbridge sent the dementors after Harry in an effort to discredit him. As for Fudge: he is, to use Dumbledore's words, ""blinded by the love of the office"" he holds. Voldemort being back would seriously jeopardize the power he has as Minister (not to mention that the idea of Voldemort's return is just too terrifying) so he simply ignores the facts.<br/><br/>I was very worried that a lot of events that are so important to the book would be written out of the movie. However, the use of Daily Prophet headlines/articles to show not only the passage of time, but the happenings around the trio was fantastic! Yes, Firenze was mostly written out as no one resumed the teaching of divination after Professor Trelawney was sacked. Yes, poor Dobby was written out AGAIN. The only moment with Percy (who is on Fudge's side in the book) is a split second glimpse of him standing behind the Minister. But - in spite of all that IT WORKED! The pacing was great, there were no dull moments, you still got to see regular teenage moments (i.e. Harry & Cho's kiss) in between danger and heroism.<br/><br/>The only ""major"" change of which I do not approve is having Neville find the Room of Requirement. As the chamberpot conversation between Dumbledore and Harry was written out of Goblet of Fire there was no advance knowledge that this room existed. As Dobby was written out he couldn't be the one to tell Harry about it. I think we were supposed to believe that Neville was fleeing from bullies and needed a place to hide so the room opened, but it just didn't work. It had a very, ""ho-hum look what I found"" feel. Meh.<br/><br/>I loved the exit of the Fred & George. I loved Grawp's little crush on Hermione. I LOVED LOVED LOVED Luna!!!! She was perfect! On the whole it's the best HP adaptation yet and was a great, fun, thrilling, tense ride.<br/><br/>Well done!"
"funkychickabe","6","0","1","16 July 2007"," very good but a heck left out
","i had already read reviews and stuff before i went and saw this movie so i sort of knew what i would be getting but i never thought that they would leave so much out of the movie. like; Ron and Hermione becoming prefects, the Wesley's shop, dobby and the kitchens, Ron and quiditch, Ginny and quiditch, they missed a lot out of snapes memory with James, dumboldors speech with harry at the end of the movie, st mongos and lost more. although saying all of this the bits that they did put in the movie were really good. Luna was fantastic she was so much like her character in the book. the end battle scene was cool i like all the fighting. the DA was OK and the theresals were pretty cool. umbridge was really funny it was good that they made her really mean still.<br/><br/>overall it was pretty good but true harry potter book fans will want more. but if you completely forget about all the stuff that they miss from the book you will enjoy it."

","I did not care for the Movie as much as the book. However, having said that, I don't know how they could have put in enough to follow the book better. The movie seemed disjointed at first pass. They did not show very well how Harry was going through transition of becoming an adult. Just one shot of Harry showing his temper with class mates. There were many other sections missing that would have made more sense to the non book reader. Also the different segments did not have a smooth transition into or out of them.<br/><br/>This is nice to see the progreession of the characters in to adult hood.<br/><br/>The special effects were very good.<br/><br/>So much was left out that should have been in. Should all of the book had been filmed, the film would have been well over 5 hours or longer.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie and may see it again. I saw the 3D version and will not recommend it. It was disappointing in that aspect. Just about 20 minutes long, if 3D costs more, don't bother it is not worth it in my opinion.<br/><br/>I will add this DVD to my collection.<br/><br/>All done and said a good movie."
"Phoenix0610","8","0","3","16 July 2007"," Good as a movie
","I won't lie. Lots of stuff was cut out or changed, and some new was put in. If the book's Dolores Umbridge was a monster, she's a pussycat compared to the one in the movie. And I'll admit, I enjoyed the book a lot more than the movie. But, I also enjoyed this movie immensely. Even if they DID cut out the most moving scene in the book-the last scene with Harry and Dumbledore.<br/><br/>I've learned that if you expect a movie made after a book to be the book, verbatim, in script form, you're setting yourself up for a lot of disappointment and wasted money. And let's face it-life gives us enough disappointment all by itself. It doesn't need any help from us.<br/><br/>Some movies, like The Da Vinci Code, don't do the book justice (sorry Ron). Fortunately for us, the makers of the Harry Potter movies don't seem to have that problem. The movies, while almost always a little different, always do the books justice. The same goes for this one. Sure a lot was cut out or different, but it didn't take away from the books. It just showed us a new way of looking at them.<br/><br/>So if you can go with an open mind and enjoy this for what it is, a movie, by all means, go see it. I don't think you'll be disappointed. If not, stick with the book and use your imagination."

","I admit to being a huge fan of the books and a moderate fan of the movies,a although I've only seen them a few times each. I knew bits, some favourite subplots, would be removed for time so I won't make any reference to removed plots lines or differences, simply reviewing the movie for what it is. However I will assume you've either read the books or seen the previous movies, simply because explaining each term would take too long.<br/><br/>At the end of the fourth movie Cedric Diggory had been killed and Voldemort has risen again, but only Harry had seen him. At the start of this movie Harry hasn't heard a word from the magical world but has to save Dudley from a Dementor attack so is summoned to a hearing to decide whether he should be expelled from hogwarts for practising magic in front of a Muggle. He's taken to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, the anti Voldemort society, where he discovers that no one believes his story and he and Dumbledore have become effective outcasts of the magical community.<br/><br/>He gets through the hearing and is allowed to return to Hogwarts with some help from Dumbledore, who unfortunately ignores him, making Harry angry.<br/><br/>On his return to Hogwarts the new teacher, Professor Umbrige, soon takes over the school, overriding Dumbledore to make the school more in line with the Ministry of Magic. Harry, at Hermione and Ron's urging, starts ""Dumbledore's Army"", a club teaching defence spells which Umbridge has banned. All clubs are also banned so the meetings must be done in secret. At the same time Harry keeps having strange dreams about a corridor, and these dreams have some disturbing consequences.<br/><br/>The movie is basically about the dreams Harry has, the struggle he has getting his fellow pupils to believe him, and Dumbledore's Army. Umbridge is also quite prominent as her influence has resulted in the Army and the general chaos Hogwarts finds itself in.<br/><br/>Harry is angry at pretty much everyone this time round; he's angry at Dumbledore who keeps ignoring him, he's angry at his friends for not keeping him in the loop, he's angry at his fellow pupils for treating him like an outcast, and he's obviously angry at Umbridge who basically makes life as hard for him and the other pupils as possible.<br/><br/>The effects are brilliant this time round, from the lines which are written out on Harry's hand to the final battle, which is spectacular. Also, because things are getting more desperate the whole mood is far more dark and tense, with fewer jokes and more angst. All the younger actors play their parts very well and the adults, when they do appear, are also great. Especially Imelda Staunton, who plays Umbridge, she is just the right balance of sugary sweetness and cruelty to make the character seem like a nice lady on the outside but show how cruel she can really be. The adults playing the bad guys also do their parts very well, being spooky and scary when necessary. The only new young actor is the girl playing Luna Lovegood, which she also does very well.<br/><br/>Definitely worth going to see whether you are a Harry Potter fan or not. I wouldn't take young children to see it, probably 10 and over I would be quite comfortable with. Younger children may find it a bit frightening and the length would probably be an issue too."
"ddoggphx","10","0","1","11 July 2007"," Spoilers within...tread carefully...Great movie...
","From my perspective, this was the best movie...most true to the book (surprising with all the cuts that were needed) since the first one. Many lines were directly from the text, and that was fantastic. Being the first showing, the theater was fairly rowdy and a well timed audience line of ""you suck Dolores"" got a huge laugh and applause. Speaking of, she was pretty good...didn't look the part so much but really played it up. They were lose with the decrees, but her attitude really hit the mark (as well as her little cough). Could have been a bit more to her, but that was I think a result of cutting some of the things that made her evil in the book (banning harry for life from quidditch) and not on her portrayal of the character.<br/><br/>I wish it were about 20 minutes longer to add certain scenes I'll mention in spoilers. Some things were changed as to who said them, when they happened or how they happened. Some were changed outright, but overall the essence of the book remained. Much more so than say the third movie. A few lines/scenes WERE included that my wife and I were wondering about after re-reading the book that could have easily been cut but as we are anticipating, will play huge in book 7 so remained.<br/><br/>The added things were well done to maintain the feel of the book, even though they didn't happen in the book. Two slaps were AWESOME, both. A line from Harry in the forest was something that I kept waiting for in the book, but never came although the direct FEEL of the line was definitely in the book.<br/><br/>Kreacher was in very small, but was pretty creepy. Bellatrix was perfect (Helena Bonham Carter) but not enough screen time for her...she did baby talk to harry which was great.<br/><br/>For the second time in as many movies, Neville was a stand-in for Dobby's role in the book.<br/><br/>This director was very good...I liked his style very much. I know he is doing the 6th book and I think the 7th...this is good. The newspaper parts were well done.<br/><br/>Some flashbacks were interesting, seeing the little boy roundheaded harry was cool.<br/><br/>***********Big Spoilers********************** Grawp was far too cute...I didn't like the parts with him so much and I was really expecting to. He wasn't terrifying as in the book, and Herme wasn't scared of him. I felt that just wasn't handled so well.<br/><br/>Cuts in general made it probably hard to follow for those who have never read the books. Dunno though, as I have, but I get the feeling it might have been a little rapid on things going on.<br/><br/>The opening was nice, but it missed the element of Harry talking trash to Dudders, which is something I always liked about this book...I felt it needed it.<br/><br/>None of the injuries to the kids happened (and no frigging baby head death eater!!!!) so it looked more like the adults of the Order really saved the day instead of having the feeling that the kids really put up a fight to the death and survived, as it seemed in the book.<br/><br/>It is avada kedavra Bellatrix uses on Sirius, which is NOT from the book...however I think they wanted to be clear that he is dead. They also didn't touch enough on Harry's pain and confusion of him being dead. They DID talk about the voices behind the curtain, so JK must really feel that important.<br/><br/>Harry hears the prophecy...he actually HANDS IT TO MALFOY which I did not like, and Malfoy breaks it. He sees Snapes worst memory while in his mind, not in the pensieve, Voldy tells harry about crucio instead of Bellatrix, etc. Things like that are altered, but in the end it really didn't affect the tone or feel or result of the movie vs. the book.<br/><br/>One thing I hated and was very sad about (other than the baby head death eater and no brain tentacles on Ron, almost dead Hermione, broken ankle Ginny and broken nose Neville) was they bypassed the Rita Skeeter part of the book which I absolutely loved. Bringing her back and using her as a turning point was great in that book, IMO. Instead, in the movie the change of heart of the populace was reflected in Shamus saying he believed Harry after the Prophet reported on the escape of the 10 death eaters from Azkaban.<br/><br/>Oh, and although Dumbledore's escape from his office was pretty awesome visually, I thought in the book he was much more of a bad ass and smart ass. That's pretty picky of me though.<br/><br/>And the kiss...well, it was sure a lot more heavy than I thought...you go harry. The scene right after was pretty much right from the book and the audience was laughing and clapping during it. They were awesome in that scene and it really showed the strong bond of friendship between the three.<br/><br/>No Fiorenze and the centaurs were introduced in a roundabout way in the newspaper, and weren't the goal of Hermoine with Umbridge...Grawp was...but in the end it played out the same (mostly).<br/><br/>***********End Big Spoilers********************** All in all, I was really surprised at how much they power-packed into 2:18 from a 900 page book. Some things I really loved were cut but it had to be done.<br/><br/>I personally loved this one, and it isn't my favorite book. My order of favorites from the books thus far is 6, 3, 1, 5, 4, 2. This may be my favorite movie though...I'll have to see it again to be sure."

I do think the prophecy could of been explained more. Perhaps about how Neville could of been the chosen one. But I suppose thats not really important. I thought Daniel's portrayal of HP in this film was excellent. He really showed the weight on Harry's shoulders throughout the whole film. Really I was pleased with all the actors in the film. They all added a little more to make the film come to life. Esp when Harry is possessed by Voldemort. Wow.

I must admit that I have not, but I have seen all the other films in the series and for the most part really enjoyed them all.<br/><br/>However, I found The order of the Phoenix to be very slow moving at times and also a little boring. There was very little of the fast paced action that made The Goblet of Fire so enjoyable for me. Looking around the cinema, there were a lot of children in there who were getting restless and some were even falling asleep.<br/><br/>OK, that's my take on it. However, my wife thought it was brilliant and really atmospheric and although a lot of the book had been cut out in order to stop the running time from being about 4 hours, she thought it was an accurate portrayal.<br/><br/>In summary then, I have to admit that the production values and effects were certainly of the high standard expected from a Harry Potter film but I think the enjoyment of it really depends on how much a fan you are of the books. For the casual patron like myself who has seen the films but not bothered with the books, then you may find it a bit of a hard slog, but for the Harry Potter fans I think there is a lot to get excited about. And at the end of the day, surely these are the people this film should be aimed at."

I am not saying that this is not a great movie, I just wish I had not read the book, which was much more intense, terrifying, thrilling and crushing. The effects are great and the acting wonderful although I would have thought that more time would have been spent developing the characters. It is a great movie and the ending although different was well executed and left me wanting to see more. Having been a fan of this movie franchise and also the books it is great to see the development of the actors. It would have been nice if the writers of the screenplay had taken a little more time as i felt it was missing too many crucial moments and at times during the movie It really does seem rushed.

While I thought OOTP would follow GOF's footsteps, I was mistaken. OOTP is by far the best out of all the Harry Potter movies, and you shall not regret it if you watch it, it's well worth your time. Ignore that hag that said bad things about this movie, he's wrong. Daniel's acting has been at it's peak in this movie, he displays Harry perfectly, Emma-Hot as ever, Rupert-Classic comic relief. And no way this is a kid's movie.<br/><br/>10/10"
"laurenmcgregor04","9","0","1","15 July 2007"," Brilliant Movie!
","As many people around the world who have been captivated by JK Rowlings Harry Potter series, i was extremely nervous to see this movie, the book had been one of my favourites. As my friends had seen the film before me had disliked it very much, but I had anticpated the worst. The film was interpretated by David Yates excellently. Yes the were parts slightly out of context and bits missing from the books, but it had done its self justice. The three young main actors, have once again done brilliantly. The flashbacks of the past were great. The special effects were done well casting of luna. Lynch had the perfect look and voice, her expressions were like luna to a T. congrats to another great HP film."
"rubywong","4","0","1","15 July 2007"," If you like the book, you will hate this movie
","Absolutely lots of unnecessary changes from the book (e.g. Mad-eye Moody did something in the book, but it will be Sirius doing it in the movie). <br/><br/>I appreciate the fact that the movie can't cover every single little details from the book and will need some clever adaptations to fit into the ~120mins limit, but the adaptations are badly done, every character in the movie seems shallow and unreasonable and the plot feels jumpy. For example, the Dumbledore in the courtroom for Harry's hearing looks agitated - not exactly like the Dumbledore described in the book! How much extra time would it takes to have Dumbledore conjured up a comfy chair on screen?! Also, I was so angry when I saw the bit about Dumbledore asking Snape to give Harry the Occlumency lesson! It makes Dumbledore to be such a short-sighted person!!!<br/><br/>The special effects are great and the Luna in the movie is as good as I can imagine! Disappointed with Umbridge though.<br/><br/>Overall, very disappointing!"

","I've read all 6 Potter books and all 5 Potter films so far and to appreciate both mediums you must understand the limitations and advantages of both film and literature. Not everyone can be expected to do this, so there will always be misinformed displeasure for one or the other form.<br/><br/>With the premise that the first Harry Potter book started when he was 11 years old and of course gets older each year, expect the teenage angst to escalate each time, hence, the darker tone by the time he hits 16 in Order of the Phoenix. Since most of this story's elements occur in the characters' minds, with heavy focus on the characters' feelings, it was definitely a challenge to execute visually on film. For instance, showing someone deep in thought while having a narration in the background simply can't be compared to reading about it if it's meant to be read.<br/><br/>Having said that, I admire the attempt to bring the book to life on screen: the visuals and characterizations are just as you would imagine, having read the book. I'm not a big fantasy buff either, but I enjoy reading the Potter books because I like the escapism, and I can relate with the characters at those ages, and I suppose the characters have grown on me, too; I like to know what happens to them next.<br/><br/>For all the flak people have said about Harry Potter, they can't take away the fact that it's gotten people reading again, especially children who can be so easily distracted these days to do something else requiring less imagination. <br/><br/>Adults who read the series have also had their share of snickers thrown their way for reading children's lit, but that's where the Potter series succeeds: it revels in being different and makes the odd feel at home. Now who can't ever relate to that?<br/><br/>To appreciate Order of the Phoenix, the frequent flashbacks offered in the movie might not be enough so you might need to brush up on the previous books. If you follow the books, you'd like the introduction of the new characters like Kreacher here, who will also appear in the 6th installment, the Half-Blood Prince, where more of Voldemort and Harry's past are threshed out further. Expect an even darker mood and flashbacks galore."
"squirtsquirt7","10","0","2","15 July 2007"," WOW! Number Five Lives up to the hype!
","This movie was excellent!! The story was great and it related to the book amazingly! The acting was great, Daniel Radcliffe and the rest have really grown into remarkable actors. OK, a few scenes were left out, like McGonagall being stunned and Harry trashing Dumbeldores office and Ron on the Quidditch team, but you can't exactly put all 870 pages into a non boring movie. Non-readers of the book would never want to sit for that long. I must say I love the books and the movies and this one was remarkable. The action and special effects were great! So, I must say even if you are not a Potter fan, go see this movie if you want to get lost in an incredible, breathtaking, and well acted movie!"
"wizard42","6","0","1","15 July 2007"," A movie that feels rushed and ends up disappointing
","The whole problem with this film is the length of the book it is based upon. Trying to cram over 700 pages into two hours ends up being very frustrating to those who love the book. While the writer of the screenplay manages to hit all the highlights, he leaves much out. The director makes some unfortunate choices as well, too many swooping soaring camera shots, and a final battle that is very rushed, and hard to follow since he chooses to use special effects with people disappearing into a swirl of light/sand regularly. This does not match the description of J. K. Rowling and ends up just being a confusing mess, rather then a climatic moment. Had the director paced the final scene better it might have worked. The character development is uneven. Harry is developed fully, and we truly sympathize with his teen angst, and anger at the world, although the latter could have been developed better at the beginning. Minor characters such as Neville, and Luna are fully developed, and Neville really grows up nicely in this film, but Ron, a major character, is nothing more then a bystander in this film, and is given virtually nothing to do, this may be because Grint is the worst of the kid actors. Hermione gets a few shining moments, but is again reduced to the role of bystander, which she is anything but in the book. Watson remains the best actor of the kids, although Radcliffe is slowly growing into a very good actor in his own right. The majority of the rest of the regular cast have one or two scenes each, and that is it, making almost no use of a very talented group of actors and actresses. The result is the weakest film in the series so far, and it is very disappointing indeed."
"chilibmom","10","0","2","15 July 2007"," I loved this movie.
","A darker movie as it was a darker book than the previous ones. It reminded me of Tim Burton's work. I especially loved Dolores Umbridge, who is deliciously wicked in pink. She is spot on for inspiring fear by merely looking as if she was the ubiquitous middle-class housewife righteous do-gooder. The evil she does is all the more evil just because she does it in the name of law and society (albeit it is a magical society). Another wonderful character is Luna Lovegood. Her blonde spaciness is delightful as she reinforces the fact that one cannot judge from surface appearance. She is more spot on with things than others give her credit for. My regrets include that the movie was not longer and so many great scenes from the book were not on the screen."
"little_digger","6","0","1","15 July 2007"," good movie, bad portrayal
","I greatly enjoyed the third and fourth films, i believe both Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell did a great job in portraying the characters both sympathetically and dramatically. however, i was very much disappointed with the fifth instalment. being a major Harry Potter fan I had waited on baited breath for it's release and was not met with the same magical feeling I had during the other movies or indeed the books. though the fifth book was not one of my favourites to begin with, with it being rather long and slow going at the beginning, the pace was also that of slow in the movie, though the acting was better than the other films, there didn't appear to be much of it. Cuarón had directed a film about the fulfilment of responsibility, about the trivialities of being a teenager and having to make important choices, Newell had taken a further step into the teenage world, creating love confusions between some of the characters that were perhaps not so obvious in the books, yet, Yates seems to have divulged his time into concentrating on different and very interesting camera shots and angles which work effectively but allow for a detachment to be made with the viewer. as a viewer i had little feelings towards any of the characters and noticed a lot of the time the use in time manipulation (flash backs etc) and the difference in both special effects and story line compared to previous films and the book itself. many things were inconsistent with the storyline which on many an occasion was very distracting and further hindered my enjoyment of the film. on the whole though worth watching, a true fan of the books and films may find this film a little far from its true potential."
"geebeegb1","5","0","1","15 July 2007"," Lacking
","I have not read the book and thought that might be why I felt lost by the film. After having spoken with others, I think I might have been even more disappointed in the movie if I had read the book.<br/><br/>The movie was disjointed. I felt like I was riding in a car that kept changing directions but never really getting to the destination. There seemed little emotional connection between all the characters that have so much history. Harry, Ron and Hermione all seemed either wooden or way too whiny.<br/><br/>However, I did love the character Luna. She was refreshing, interesting and fun to watch. Almost worth seeing the movie but not quite.<br/><br/>Perhaps the book was just too big to do it justice in 2 hours but this might have been one of those times to do a 3 hour movie or past time to bring Chris Columbus back."

","After an arduous wait of three days I finally went along to see Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix (my favourite of the book series)this afternoon and was pleasantly surprised as I thought after the film of Prisoner of Azkaban the screen series has suffered. However David Yates has included what was necessary for the plot to flow properly and although it lacks the humorous frivolity of the book, it allows images that have been floating around the book readers' minds to appear on screen with spectacular results.<br/><br/>As usual Dan Radcliffe perfected Harry's insecurities and emotional turmoil effortlessly and even Michael Gambon was tolerable as Dumbledore - a big improvement from the violent, bellowing maniac we saw in GOF. Imelda Staunton was every bit as I imagined Umbrige and Ralph Fiennes was again wonderful as Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>They didn't change too much as in the Goblet of Fire and didn't ruin the fantasy as in Prisoner of Azkaban but instead portrayed the book powerfully on screen. My only qualms would be the handling of Sirius' death scene, which wasn't as poignant as it was in the book and the scene where Harry, Fred and George beat up Malfoy for his offensive comments after a Quidditch match but I approved immensely of Voldemort urging Harry to murder Bellatrix and in, Star Wars style, move to the dark side.<br/><br/>Of course what was missing was always going to be vexing for fans of the book but the film series has redeemed itself with this effort and I am looking forward to The Half Blood Prince which I think, with Yates at the helm, could be equally spectacular.<br/><br/>So all in all I think it was enjoyable for fans of the films and for fans of the book, which is a big improvement on recent years.<br/><br/>To those who enjoyed the films but haven't yet read the books: what on earth are you waiting for? Immerse yourself in the world Rowling has created."

","Now, after watching the trailer of this movie, I was mesmerized by the scenes of this movie and ignored the harsh comments of the critics. I and my three friends went to watch this film for Rs. 130 a ticket ( please don't convert it into dollars). But after watching the film, I and my friends too were completely disappointed by the lack of direction and the terrible editing. These are some or rather, many points which I did not like in the film: 1) The pace of this film. They could have made it longer, about two hours and forty five minutes, and added more information, it could be humorous or serious.<br/><br/>2) Dudley stank like rotten berries. His acting was worse than even the annoying guys surrounding him and his mouth even wasn't moving. Remove that boy from the film.<br/><br/>3) Mrs. Figg looked so haggard like a dilapidated house unlike the book. She was shown so scared and her acting too was unfunny and a dud.<br/><br/>4) Hermoine, Harry, Ron and his mother, Professor Trelawney, the Weasley idiots, Uncle Vernon, Petunia, Fudge and Dumbledore in the film have to improve their acting skills. Hermoine looked like she was rehearsing for a play, Harry has to concentrate more on his emotions and how he throws his dialogs, Ron is not as funny as he was and in his little role too, he had scope of doing much better, why the heck was his mother in the film acting like a hysterical lady, she was so good in the previous film, the twins have improved but still suck, Uncle Vernon should have shown more anger, his wife in the film too was dull, Fudge was boring and Dumbledore was loud, again.<br/><br/>5) The editing was so bad that I felt to strangulate the person who did the editing of the film. The scenes sifted too fast.<br/><br/>6)Even though Umbridge in the movie was good, she was not as evil as she is shown in the book. Why did she have to slap Harry to show she was mean? There were other ways the director could've shown her bad.<br/><br/>7) The last battle was too brief. And characters don't glide in the air! 8) Many things were changed from the book. But these changes deteriorated the condition of this movie.<br/><br/>9) Why the hell was Grawp shown as a cuddle toy? The animators have lost it.<br/><br/>10) None of the characters were explain properly.<br/><br/>11) The kiss between HArry and his girl was rather vulgar than beautiful.<br/><br/>There were a few things that were good in the film.<br/><br/>1) Umbridge's room was decorated perfectly as described in the book.<br/><br/>2) Ginny, even in her where-is-she role, proved to be great in her voice modulations.<br/><br/>3) It was dark and that is a good thing they didn't change.<br/><br/>Overall, a no-no for POtter book lovers. I present it 4 out of 10."
"boe_dye","10","0","2","15 July 2007"," oh my, a summer movie that was worthwhile to see!
","now there are, of course, two ways too look at this. One way is by looking at it from the perspective of the die hard Harry Potter fan who has the book memorized and would get all upset over the little things.<br/><br/>The second way is to look at it as a film based on a book...<br/><br/>Now, again and again I understand that to cram 900 pages into a 2 hour film you are going to need to do a little editing. Chances are you are going to want to focus on the main events of the story, and give the viewer a good taste of just about every. You certainly don't want to cram in every little element you can possibly cram into it just because it was in the book. You want the movie to have flow, you want the movie to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>And this was...<br/><br/>This was a very enjoyable movie (aside from the increase in people who feel the need to talk and text on their phones in the theater). The story was well told. There was good flow and the continuity was very easy to follow unlike the previous too movies which just seemed to be somewhat disjointed...<br/><br/>My wife did comment on how she thought that the Weasley Rebellion could have been a bit grander, but that was really the only complaint that she could have warranted.<br/><br/>As far as little plot holes, i felt that they kinda dropped the Cho/Harry relationship a little too quickly. It was like okay here they are, and then we don't hear anything about them at all after that. Then they sort of talk about it later, and loosely tie it up. But then again, the Cho/Harry thing was a subplot and you shouldn't get all upset over that.<br/><br/>What else is there... Oh, Voldemort sort of looks like Marilyn Manson in a scene or two... And Harry's Scar somehow appears and disappears from time to time...<br/><br/>Anything more then that is just mindless ramblings that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, so I shall stop here."

","Order Of The Phoenix was my favourite of the Harry Potter books (bearing in mind that Deathly Hallows is not yet out) -- having said that, two of my favourite parts weren't in the movie.<br/><br/>Having said that, this movie wasn't too bad. It's not as ""scrap-booked"" as Goblet Of Fire, meaning that they actually managed to tell the story.<br/><br/>One of the other user comments severely reprimanded the actors in this movie, which I completely disagree with. I felt that all the characters were very well portrayed, and when I saw first images of Luna Lovegood and Delores Umbridge I was quite disappointed, until I saw them in action. Evanna got Luna Lovegood dead on, and must be commended for such a difficult character. Umbridge was also well portrayed, with her icy 'friendly tones' as well as her ferocity done perfectly. <br/><br/>For me, the biggest (and by far the most treacherous) let down of this movie was the battle between the Order Of The Phoenix and The Death Eaters... this battle was poorly choreographed, poorly shot (it was very difficult to work out who was fighting who and who was doing what) and an absolute disgrace to the rest of the movie, which in my opinion was finally -starting- to correct the terrible traits shown in HP 3 and 4. <br/><br/>In all honesty, I would have given this movie a 10/10 if it weren't for the poor choreography of that battle, despite scenes (including one of my favourite scenes) being cut from the book, they all would have been forgivable except for that atrociously poor scene which should have had people talking for months. (The fight scene between Dumbledore and Voldemort on the other hand was quite brilliant)<br/><br/>My verdict: A MUCH better movie than everyone is giving it credit for. Anyone who is badmouthing this one, go watch Goblet again, and then notice how they improved their ""editing"" of the story for this one!<br/><br/>8/10"

","I'm sorry I didn't re-read the book right before seeing this, but at least I've read the entire six books so far (and seen all the previous movies), so I have a fairly good knowledge of the plot. If I didn't, I would have found this movie completely incomprehensible. It's a series of scenes out of the book, and some of them are quite amusing, but they are simply strung together without any real connecting thread.<br/><br/>For a movie titled ""Order of the Phoenix,"" I would personally have liked to have seen a little more of the Order. I didn't even find it very clear from the movie whether Minerva McGonagall was a member of the Order, and I'd have liked to have seen a stronger development of the relationship between Harry and Sirius, although the good performance by Gary Oldman (of whom I'm not otherwise all that big a fan) does help compensate for any weakness in the script.<br/><br/>Realistically, I may be being a little too harsh, considering that the book is over 800 pages and some condensation had to be made, but some things seem to have been left in because they were cute (like the Weasley twins' magic performance during the O.W.L.S.) even though they weren't essential to the main story and wasted time that could have been better spent developing the central elements of the story.<br/><br/>If you see this theatrically, try to see it in an IMAX theater, which is an interesting experience, but otherwise you might want to wait for the DVD release.

The movie wowed with excellent special effects, great acting by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Gary Oldman and the Dumbledore character..

Well The order of the phoenix is absolutely not like that. Throughout the movie theirs a bunch of flash back, confusing details, pointless journal readings,pointless scenes(broomstick flying part at the beginning , and an excessive concentration in the new pink bitch professor. On top of that what is even more ridiculous is the constant feeling that the bloody climax is everywhere. The second you find out about the Order of the phoenix, the climax is like coming but never their and when the prophecy bull crap finally arrives, its like WOW! this is stupid. The Dark lord did not kill you last time because he didn't know that one day one of them will die! TOMTOMTOM!!!! freaking stupid. After that what about the Order of the phoenix. Well you learn what it is and whats their goal but what next. The movie is named ""the order of the phoenix"", when actually the only things you see of them is an appearing apartment(which is classic and out of date), them talking and them raping the dark lords lackeys(Oh! and Black dies to make it more tragic).<br/><br/>Maybe you people wont see this review as realistic and good but seriously read this and go see the movie remembering what is written in this review, your opinion will change and if not, well your blind and should stop looking at movies"

It has its moments of suspense and emotion, but as a whole, it is not worth paying to see it at the theater. The scene I was looking forward to the most, Snape's worst memory, was not at all portrayed like it was in the book (No pensieve was involved, but rather a spell.) and lasted a good ten or twenty seconds. This movie was the biggest disappointment yet. My rating of six is quite generous, to be honest. I only rated so high because the acting was quite good. Also, the overall effects were nice.

Why would you want to take the longest and most informative book and chop it into fragments that go so quickly that you can't follow what is happening. I was one who said ""you shouldn't compare it to the books because its supposed to be entertaining"" but there is nothing entertaining about choppy story lines and not being able to let the death of Sirius sink. The scene was cut so short that I didn't have a moment to feel anything about it. He didn't give enough attention to the fact that Sirius was so important to Harry and that it will affect how the rest of his life will be.

This Potter entry deals with a new professor of the dark arts, Mrs. Umbridge coming on, and she takes over the school pretty fast becoming headmaster. Meanwhile Harry, Ron and Hermoine get an army of kids together to fight Voldemort who has returned. Like most Potter films, this doesn't explain itself enough, so quite often if you haven't read the books, this will have you scratching your head. The acting, as always, was very good and all the kids and old British actors did a great job. One good thing that this movie has is it almost has a small time feel. Though there are many scenes with special effects, it is nowhere near as special effect heavy as the the last four, and it also has smaller sets and less characters. Plus, this is a long book, and the movie runs at 128 minutes without credits making it the shortest of the movies. It was good, but it could've been better.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 128 mins. PG-13 for violence."
"milareppa","3","0","2","14 July 2007"," Terrible Film
","The length and terrible quality of the fifth book were always going to be huge hurdles for the film makers to overcome. However, the fourth film had succeeded, despite all the cuts, and the Lord of the Rings films had proved that big books can be turned into films successfully, so I was hoping against the odds.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film fails in every possible way. The acting quality from the opening scenes is downright appalling. The Dursleys, and even Daniel Radcliffe, are just downright dire initially. Mrs Figgs is cringe-worthy and the Dementors look very cheap and unconvincing after the third film's quality.<br/><br/>Despite all the fuss made about the casting of Tonks, she's barely in the film at all. Many of the significant issues that help build up to the final confrontation and its consequences are cut. Some cuts do make sense, others definitely do not (such as the Sirius/Snape antagonism that Harry feels directly contributes to Sirius' fate).<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of Michael Gambon's Dumbledore - Richard Harris pulled off the grandfatherly side of Dumbledore but completely failed to portray the crazier, darker side. Gambon has always pulled off Dumbledore's crazier, darker side very well while still covering the grandfatherly aspect. However, in this film, Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson, Maggie Smith... all their performances fall flat. As do the children. It took me a while to grow into Luna. At first, I thought it was awful. In retrospect, I think she gets better as the film goes along.<br/><br/>The only two who consistently acted well were Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman, but since their roles in the film were vastly reduced, they don't have much screen time. The dreams were hit and miss - the suspense and eeriness were very good but if you haven't read the books, they'll be confusing and not make much sense - and this isn't plot-related confusion.<br/><br/>The film's final confrontations were absolutely great. Ralph Fiennes makes an excellent Voldemort, his scenes were therefore very good.<br/><br/>Bellatrix was absolutely awful. She didn't come across as crazy and dangerous, she came across as drunk. It was less Harry Potter and more Practical Magic. Not good.<br/><br/>Everything felt disjointed, rushed, superficial. Too much got left out and what was left in was handled poorly. The end result is a film that looks like it's full of plot holes, continuity errors and lacks any emotion at all.<br/><br/>I knew it was a bad sign when the people leaving the screening before my showing were looking bored and restless - few smiles, little conversation about what they'd seen. No real interest. When I left the cinema after my showing, the word I heard my fellow cinema goers using most was ""empty"" - the film felt empty. I use the word ""hollow"". This film lacks any kind of a soul.<br/><br/>There's a terrible thread of Charlie Chaplin/Chevy Chase-esquire humour running through this film that is absolutely inappropriate to the storyline. Some humour is appropriate and genuinely raised some chuckles in the cinema. But the rest cracked no smiles and often some embarrassed shifting in the seats from people. For a story that's getting darker and grittier as it progresses, watching Filch and Malfoy reduced to Charlie Chaplin and Chevy Chase comic pieces was downright appalling - and ruined the mood of the film.<br/><br/>Oh, and the forecasts in the background at the start of the film bizarrely give out American weather temperatures. Why wasn't this caught? It's a British story, temperatures should be given in Celsius. It stood out like a sore thumb (British forecasters do sometimes *additionally* give Fahrenheit temperatures for the older generations but never at the expense of forgetting Celsius).<br/><br/>Lupin's role was vastly reduced in this film - I have no idea why they removed him from the initial rescue group and gave all his lines to Moody - especially as the film doesn't bother explaining why Harry is so comfortable with this Moody after all his problems the previous year. The book used Lupin to ease the transition for Harry, but he doesn't appear until much later - and even then is barely relevant to any scenes. Tonks and Kreacher had blink-and-you'll-miss-them roles and Sirius' family lineage was hardly explained at all. There's absolutely no hint of Tonks' relationship - you see her mother's scratched out name on the family tree in Sirius' home, but no reference to Andromeda being Tonks' mother. Therefore, if there's going to be any speculation in the sixth film about Tonks grieving for Sirius, it's going to come out of the blue to people who haven't read the books.<br/><br/>On a more positive note - the film does get better as it goes along, although that just takes it from ""mediocre"" to ""okay"". There are some great scenes, there is some great humour and there is some very good acting - but it's so haphazard and patchy that the film overall cannot be rated much above ""terrible"" - at best, I can say it's the worst film so far.<br/><br/>The scenes where the children are practising DAtDA in secret are very good - the patronus charms are very beautiful, and there's some interesting Harry/Ginny foreshadowing. The much-touted kiss between Harry and Cho lives up to expectations. Considering the youth of the actors concerned, it is set up very well.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a huge disappointment - even if you go in not expecting much (and I wasn't expecting much at the outset). If you haven't read the books, this film will be a mess. If you have read the books, you'll only be aware of just how big a mess the film truly is."
"Pavel-8","7","0","1","14 July 2007"," The second-best movie in the series.
","After a summer of movies filled with second, third, and fourth sequels, the most anticipated follow-up is finally here, and it is a fifth installment. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the story of Year Five at Hogwarts for lead characters Harry, Hermione, and Ron, although a large portion of the movie occurs outside the grounds of the teens' school. More than a children's book, this episode builds upon strong themes of fear and friendship to create a solid piece of cinema.<br/><br/>(Note: I have read only the first five books.) ""Order of the Phoenix"" (""OOTP"") tracks the ongoing saga of the interactions between the dark Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter, who is aided by the titular order, a sort of wizard Joint Chiefs of Staff. Many in the wizarding community doubt Harry's story that Voldemort has returned, and the Ministry of Magic has it in for Dumbledore, all of which means that Harry feels more alone than ever, despite the presence of people and places he loves. As always with a movie adapted from popular literature, two questions must be answered. 1) Was it a good movie, and 2) Was it a good adaptation of the book? Pleasantly, the response to both questions is yes, though each affirmative requires unique qualification.<br/><br/>Having read the book, judging the movie strictly on its own merits is very difficult, because gaps on screen are filled in subconsciously by knowledge of the book. But this movie seems to succeed apart from those pages. Relatively unknown director David Yates keeps the story Harry-centric, giving it a brisk pace and making the main arc easy to follow, although a few other truncated story lines and characters will be enjoyed more by those who know them fully. Expanded motifs of Harry's anger and loneliness are expressed clearly but not heavy-handedly, through both pictures and the words of multiple characters. As was the case with the previous two installments, viewing this movie without first reading the book may result in confusion or at least a lesser understanding of everything, but having seen the first four movies will be plenty to let one comprehend this episode to an enjoyable extent.<br/><br/>The latter question is more complicated. Many people will complain about plot elements that vary from the book. Those objections are true but invalid. Maybe a beloved character was axed, tweaked, or minimized. Perhaps a treasured moment was omitted or included in a disappointingly disparate manner. Make no mistake about it; many things were altered. But when an 870-page tome is being condensed into a two hour and eighteen minute movie, cuts must be made. Much like time constraints demanded that ""The Lord of the Rings"" focus largely on Frodo at the expense of favorites like Tom Bombadil, this story must focus on Harry Potter. There are reasons that he is the title character. So no one gets to see Firenze teach or Ron and Hermione fight or anything about Quidditch or prefects. Looking objectively at the modifications though, the primary story arc does advance satisfactorily without those missing parts. Perhaps the galloping pace could have slowed to a canter, as the movie was indeed a rarity that could easily have been twenty minutes longer. But the purpose should then have been to expand upon the elements already in place rather than to add missing ones.<br/><br/>The more important goal is that the movie be faithful to the spirit of the book, and on that level, ""OOTP"" hits its mark. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" displayed the world of wizards better than any other Potter movie because of two key inclusions: the little ways magic was used in the background and the fantastic scene-setting shots. Yates nearly recaptures Alfonso Cuaron's brilliance, approaching it with elements like kittens wandering around in pictures and spectacular zooms over Hogwarts. Of equal importance, he also executes small moments even better than the source material, wonderfully depicting simple enjoyments like laughter and friendship are a stark contrast to the lurking complex evil of You Know Who. These small interactions imbue the movie with a soul that adds substance and humanity to an adventurous and magical universe.<br/><br/>""OOTP"" suffers slightly from middle-film-in-a-series syndrome, but in a good way. Much like ""The Two Towers"" or ""The Matrix Reloaded"", one gets the feeling that it picks up and ends mid-story, with only a necessary modicum of resolution, as though setting the stage for something grand. That promise of something huge just ahead actually enhances the power of the movie. It leaves one desperately awaiting the next chapter more so than any other Potter movie. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", the next in the series, screams to be (re-)read before the seventh and final book is released next Saturday.<br/><br/>Ultimately, viewers who have not read the book should be able to follow along easily, and the movie should quench the appetites of fans with reasonable expectations. The gist of the book is explored in numerous ways, resulting in an experience that will leave one with a few thrills and chills, and a smile on one's face.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A concise return to the spirit of the book, capturing the world with a proper dose of cinematic license. 7 of 10 for the second best movie in the series."

","Let's face it, the first two Potter films were great fun. Then, as Harry grows, he moves into a nasty pre-adulthood, and the fun really tapers off fast. At the rate his life spirals into the doom of becoming an adult, he'll end up on a psyco-sorcerer's couch for intense analysis. This film is dark and moody, with next to nothing to redeem it. The visuals, as usual, are stunning. But that's where the kudo's ended for me. The characters we've grown to love in the first couple films -- Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon et al -- receive far too little screen time. Even Gary Oldman, who is perhaps one of the finest actors in the business, doesn't get the screen time he deserves either. The kids look awkward nearly grown up, and the humor, what there is of it, is somewhat strained. In this edition, the baddie is back, and Ralph Fiennes, another fabulously gifted performer, does a fair job in his role, or what little there is of it. Even when he does appear, the makeup is so intense it smothers any hint of emotive effort. Harry tries to get everyone to believe Voldemort has returned, but few take his side as politics interferes -- a veiled pot shot at US involvement in their present war? Soon Harry starts to train his own recruits for a cataclysmic battle, which never really comes in its implied fullness. In fact, this film offers nothing conclusive whatsoever, except that there will be another one coming soon. To this I say, ""turn up the lights, toss in some sparkle, add a little more humor, and let this kid grow group up without so many neurotic episodes to deal with."

It didn't matter.<br/><br/>The movie was spectacular! It brought all the characters we know and love to life. It transformed Hogwarts into a massive castle-like school with elaborate entrances and amazing scenery. The area surrounding Hogwarts is absolutely incredible. Everything looks so real and is so well-done.<br/><br/>The story-line was good no matter what people say. Sure, it's much different from the book, but if they included every single detail from the book, the movie would be 15 hours long! 2 hours and 18 minutes gave me enough time to watch the movie and enjoy it the whole way through.<br/><br/>The acting was absolutely spot-on. I particularly like Imelda and Evanna as Umbridge and Luna Lovegood. They did amazing jobs portraying what J.K. Rowling would want to see. Daniel Radcliffe did amazing job with his role. It seemed as if he was more ""alone"" in this movie than the others, even though he has new friends. The other characters did great jobs, also. But I wanted to see more of Malfoy in the movie.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was the battle with Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort.

I had to have my friend explain the whole prophecy and why Voldemort was after Harry.<br/><br/>Really that was my main complaint. I have been told that the prophecy is one of the main points of the book, but it isn't really a part of the film.<br/><br/>Other than that it is a great film. The acting is the best in this one out of all the other films. This one is much darker than the others as well. there is a greenish overtone throughout most of the film which i think they got from the Saw series.

","In this, the fifth instalment of the series, we find a very different Harry from before. Here, he is beset by insecurity and anger at the fact that he feels people and events are passing him by without his input. Is this normal teen angst or possibly is it Voldermort affecting his thoughts? Dumbledore has resurrected the Order of the Phoenix, a fighting force of wizards against Voldermort, but without much success.<br/><br/>No one believes Harry about He Who Cannot Be Named returning, and the Ministry of Magic is out to cast doubt on Dumbledore and Harry. To this end they place a teacher of their own in to Hogwarts. Delores Umbridge starts a series of events designed to promote the Ministry and discredit any other view. Harry starts fighting back with a secret series of training sessions in Defence Against the Dark Arts.<br/><br/>Throughout this time, Harry keeps getting visions which he thinks are due to his connection with Voldemort, and these lead to a spectacular ending involving a fight between the Order and Voldermorts Death Eaters inside the Ministry itself.<br/><br/>Now to the actual film. The beginning is so disjointed, with jumps from scene to scene without any follow-up that at times it becomes difficult to follow. Many story lines are shown as annoying spinning headlines from the Daily Prophet newspaper, and so much of the book is cut from the first half that several people sitting around us in the theatre complained that they had lost the plot within the first 45 minutes.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the last half of the film is more stable but there are so many changes, scene swaps, plot losses and more that as a stand alone film without having read the book, I'm afraid it just doesn't make the grade.<br/><br/>Far better than the Goblet of Fire and a good attempt to fit an 800+ page book into under 2 1/2 hours, but because there are so many things happening in the books that don't appear in the films, I'm concerned that book 7 might throw some spanners in the works as to the things that have been skipped."
"princess_stomper","9","0","1","14 July 2007"," A good FILM, not just a good Potter
","Imagine Star Wars remade in the style of the X-Men, and you just about have it: a tense fantasy thriller with just the right balance of humour and action. For a night out at the cinema, it's a pleasant diversion. For a Harry Potter film, it's a miracle.<br/><br/>There are two advantages when the cast (and the audience) are more mature: you can show grittier and more complex subject matter, and you can have more nuanced direction. There are no pauses between gags or superfluous exposition - in fact, the well-observed jokes feel more like nervous humour and are nearly always the punctuation point between the next crisis or explosion.<br/><br/>The little orphan boy has matured well into an angry young man, and while the youngest - Emma Watson - still has a little way to go in terms of performance, the rest of the cast cope admirably with their increasingly demanding roles. Better yet, the screen time between the teens and adults is well-balanced, in the way that the aforementioned X-Men managed so well. The subtle winks and nods from Gary Oldman pack a punch as great as Daniel Radcliffe screaming ""Look at me!"" in another scene. On the subject of of punches, this is a movie in which a single hand-slap is more shocking than the explosive set-pieces and special effects.<br/><br/>It's been pointed out in reviews that Grawp is a misstep, but thankfully his screen time is kept brief and - like Kreacher - he is no Dobby. Every excess subplot (and even a few popular scenes) have been excised, leaving a lean and straightforward foil to the previous movies' labyrinthine stories.<br/><br/>If the first was cute, the second dreadful, the third good and the fourth a mere illustration, this fifth Potter is the first to hit all the right notes in all the right places. Now that they've finally got things right, I have high hopes for six and seven."

","Finally the fifth Harry Potter movie is here. The franchise has been through too many ups and downs to count in the public eye. Disagreements galore over which movies are good, which adapts most faithfully and so on. We've had the magical but hollow first two, the darker, stylish and faithful third, the larger, bolder, more adult fourth, and now the fifth.<br/><br/>The fifth is a mixture of them all really, director David Yates has obviously learnt, and learnt well, from the mistakes of his predecessors, taking the previous potter criticism to his advantage, but this sudden change in filming a Potter movie disconcerts you for a margin of the film, preventing it from having a more rounded, fulfilling pay-off, which instalments three and four did so well (and which the first two failed miserably at, both fading out to an awkward, beaming Daniel Radcliffe in the great hall. Director for both, Christopher Columbus, not seeming to know how to end the movies but with that shot).<br/><br/>Yates was given a tougher job than the rest though, having to adapt the fifth, bloated and one of the worst Harry Potter books, but he excels. He creates this slow book a sense of pace and intrigue, but with this being the adaption of the longest Harry Potter book, into the shortest running time of a Harry Potter film, some of the best bits are shortened or montaged to save time and you do feel slightly rushed in places. However, Yates redeems himself by doing all this without making you feel at loss from a lot of the book like movie four did.<br/><br/>Not underestimating his audience, Yates really does wash out a lot of the pizazz of Harry Potter, darkening the tone another level. However there's always a well delivered quip coming up soon to relax the brain.<br/><br/>Yates faithfully falls back on Rowling's' teachings when creating a vital character or set, not wanting to rile up Potter nuts, and he does this rightly so.<br/><br/>The script is business as usual, no Potter movie yet, including this one, has even tried to meddle on the already immaculate story and dialogue created by J.K Rowling, and there's no need to, despite the odd feeling of déjà vu or the generic style still being carried on from movie number one. The only reason these feelings are cast aside is because of the unbelievable line up of actors gracing the screen every 5 minutes. Helena Bonham Carter, although only portraying the small role of Bellatrix Lestrange in book five, stands out and brings her character alive. The teenage cast also has greatly improved, especially the main three, who have proved they can finally act, and new young additions are fantastic.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a great addition to the movie franchise, and is up there with films three and four as the best yet. Parents my finally fully look forward taking their kids to a Harry Potter movie."

","okay first off, David Yates is a genius! to take a book like Order of the Phoenix and turn it into the unbelievable film that it is, might be the greatest thing i've ever seen. part of my dislike for the book is that almost half of it is in italics and is Harry just moping around and doubting himself. Yates took all that and managed to convey it on screen without being cheesy or lost.<br/><br/>next, the musical score by Hooper is just the best one they've ever had. absolutely beautiful and perfect.<br/><br/>the cast - what might be so amazing about this film is the high standard of acting that was represented in the film. it encompassed some of the best actors alive today. there are of course the usual cast, including Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, Dame Maggie Smith as Macgonagal, Emma Thompson as Trelawney, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Snape. but entering this film is a new supporting cast that just makes the movie. Helena Bonham Carter was born to play the role of Bellatrix Lestrange. no one else could have done it justice. I have to admit that i was a little put off when i first saw pictures of Imelda Staunton as Umbridge. she didn't look like she could pull it off, but by god, until she gets her just rewards in the end you really just want to strangle her. but she is so sugar coated too at times, that you know that role was just perfect for her. also new comer to acting, the girl who played Luna ""Looney"" Lovegood almost seemed like she had walked straight out of the book. they also gave her a bit bigger part in the movie than she had in the book, which was nice. also Tonks was just perfect.<br/><br/>the sentimentallity level - i was worried about how much they were going to play up Sirius' death in the movie. Yates knew what he was doing here. it's enough to bring tears to your eyes, but you don't dwell on it. even in Harry's talk later with Dumbledore it's not sappy. really it's perfectly done!<br/><br/>few problems - i know that turning an almost 900 page book into a movie you have to make sacrifices, which is why i understood leaving out the trip to St. Mungos, and the Weesley swamp (although the fireworks really were awesome). but i didn't understand some of the choices they made. for example, they go through all the trouble of having Kreacher in the movie, but he doesn't do anything. in the book he's a pivotal plot point, but in the movie he serves no purpose. since Dobby has been left out of the last two movies, i almost would rather have just had them leave Kreacher out.<br/><br/>also, they go through all the trouble of having the scene about Sirius and his family, and the Black family tree, but then they leave off Tonks, and also Regallus, who might prove, in my opinion to be the RAB in the locket. so that threw me.<br/><br/>also, i was really unhappy with Ginny's role in the movie. she has about 3 spoken lines and is totally overlooked. in this book she's supposed to be really popular and attractive and coming into herself, but all she did the whole movie was make goo-goo eyes at Harry, and nasty looks at Cho.<br/><br/>Cho taking Marietta's role of being the snitch i think worked very well in the movie. i just really wish they had left in the Sneak in pimples on her face.<br/><br/>all in all one of the best movie yet, and if you have a chance see it in the IMAX where the last 15-20 minutes are in 3D. it will rock your world.<br/><br/>let's hope that David Yates will do the last two movies. he knows his Potter."

What really made this good was the fact that everyone acted really well for once. Nothing felt too contrived. There were a lot of moments skirted over (i'm glad they cut all that stuff about cleaning out the house) but they kept all the key checkpoints. And for once, one could emote with Harry. His performance was top here and I could really feel his anguish and despair. Well done Radcliffe. What was also a plus was Luna - really well cast as was Umbridge (i was skeptical at first cos at first glance you just want to hug Imelda Staunton).<br/><br/>The SFX was great too and the climax at the Ministry was given full justice (unlike last film's).<br/><br/>The use of hand-held shots was refreshing too. And nice moments caught by the director esp with Ginny. (v.subtle but there nonetheless).<br/><br/>Definitely the best Potter movie since the debacle of no.3 and 4.

","First of all let me say I have never read any of the Harry Potter books. But I am a fan of all the movies.<br/><br/>When I went into Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix I didn't have high expectations. After all the great disappointments of the summer so far. So I came in to the theater thinking it would be fair, not bad because they already have an all-star like cast and a book that sets up the entire story. And after I came out of the theater I was mildly disappointed for I thought Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire raised the bar.<br/><br/>I had two main problems with Order of the Phoenix, the first being this is the first Harry Potter movie that I could actually tell they had to leave sub-plots out and had to rush through things. When they entered Sirious Black's house and began talking I felt like I had missed something I should know that would make me have a better understanding of what I am watching. But I must say I never felt completely lost. I knew the most of the story after watching.<br/><br/>The other problem I had with the movie, it just didn't flow well. This may be a result of my other problem with the movie being they must of rushed or left things out. I felt like it went from event to event. Not like the climax type ladder we all know (until the final conflict). I think this came from a massive book being transformed into a two-hour movie and a new screen play writer. <br/><br/>I did like this movie the main thing I liked as in all Harry Potter movies is the acting, although some of the teen actors did have a few odd moments. But they always seem to get excellent actors into the movie and the new actress who played Arabella Figg was a spot on fit. The only acting problem would be giving Ralph Fiennes more screen time. <br/><br/>Another great thing was they did a great job with the special effects and action sequences. My favorite being when the Weasly brothers got back at Prof. Figg. Over all this is so far the best movie of the summer I have seen. It had a good story, pretty good writing, great special-effects, and great acting. I would recommend seeing this movie at least twice."

","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best of the five HP movies to date, but really stands on its own as a classic. Had I never seen a previous Harry Potter movie or read the novels, I still would have found this an amazing, mysterious, imaginative, quick-paced drama. The acting is top-notch throughout, and Daniel Radcliffe really comes to his own as Harry, filling out the character with believable and engaging emotional reality and intensity. Though set in a context of magic, Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix is a coming-of-age story at its heart. The lessons the title character learns--coping with loss, managing feelings, nurturing friendships, taking leadership, discovering romance, finding one's own stand in a world of conflicting moral values, encountering adults as a youth--are universal themes, and the world of magic and Harry's unique relationship with the Dark Lord accentuate and accelerate these challenges and Harry's ""real world"" education. The spiritual, moral, interpersonal, and emotional themes of the plot are vivid and coherent, but there are numerous humorous vignettes throughout to lend some balance to a generally troubling story. The special effects do a great job contributing to the story and are a fitting tribute to J. K. Rowling's vision. All-in-all wonderful entertainment for eye, ear, heart, and mind. <br/><br/>I must add a word about negative reviews I've read about the movie. Some of them are so negative that I have a hard time believing I've seen the same movie. One group of critics seem to be Harry Potter fundamentalists who want this movie to exactly duplicate the original story. They rail against deletions of favorite scenes or characters from the books, and God forbid that the movie even make some alterations from the original story. If you want the novel, read the novel. I think the movie should and can stand on its own. Another group of critics seem to think that Harry Potter is a children's story and fret about the ""darkness"" (visual and emotional) of the movie. I never thought the Harry Potter series was for children only. Certainly it's a fantasy world, but J. K. Rawling uses the fantasy world to reveal great truths about the commonplace. And why should children's movies only be light, fluffy, unproblematic, and neatly resolved? Life is messy and often painful, and that's as true for kids as it is for adults. The Harry Potter story is all about responding to life's pains and complexities with courage and dignity. In an entertaining story. That's worth a trip to the movies!"

The trailers keep fooling me, making me think that this is it, this is the one that won't disappoint me. Honestly, I don't know what was wrong with this movie, I'm not a professionist to judge right. All I know is what I perceive from a spectator's point of view, and I know that I felt like everything was so predictable; and even when something happened that was unexpected to me (and the rest who have not read the books I guess)I just didn't feel the impact of it. They tried to give a boost to Harry's emotional side in this movie but I'm afraid they failed just short of it. I didn't feel he was connected enough to the relevant characters (I'm trying not to give spoilers here)in order to portray and justify his actions and reactions right. A good movie though I think I prefer the fourth one, but that's just me. Anyway, maybe I'll like it better if I see it a second time. 8 out of 10"

","I think that this is probably the worst Potter yet. Not because it was particularly bad, it just wasn't a patch on the first 3 or even The Goblet of Fire which I also felt somewhat let down by.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I have never read any of the books, so I am judging these films purely by merit of the film alone.<br/><br/>I loved potter 1 & 2 as I loved the sense of mystery presented by them, how you never really knew what was going on until the very end when everything fell into place. They also had a greater sense of fun about them and a real feel of magic where even the children's sweets had spells on them! Then came the Prisoner of Azkaban which, in my opinion, is the strongest of the films so far. Not only due to the arrival of Gary Oldman as the fantastic Sirius Black and the dark directing style of the ever amazing Alfonso Cuarón (see Children of Men). But also you actually watched the children grow up right before your eyes, and the characters develop so beautifully, whilst still maintaining that sense of mystery, magic and fun! At this point I could not wait to see where the story was going!!! Alas, the arrival of Potter 4, and here marked the end of clever and fun magic tricks and wonderful mystery solving, and gave way to moody teenagers, underdeveloped characters and straightforward story lines! As I said earlier, I haven't read any of the books, so I spent most of the Goblet of Fire wondering what the hell was going on! As characters appear from nowhere that you've never seen before, events are spoken of that we never saw happen and we are generally presented with a quick 2 hour summary of a several hundred page novel! Then I saw the trailer for The Order of the Phoenix, how excited I was at the talk of the evil new teacher (who never really gets her comeuppance) the students rebellion (aka a bunch of kids learning magic tricks that eventually never get put to use) and the introduction to many bright new characters (most of which are quickly introduced, have a minute or so screen time and then we hear nothing more of them!) Sadly, this also seems like a brief summary of what was probably a very good novel, that does not do justice to any of the, once brilliant characters, leading to the really annoying point where Sirius Black simply drops dead for no apparent reason!!!!!! In my opinion this could have been the end of Potter, as most of the magic seems to have gone from the films I don't see how they can stretch it for another 2! Oh well, perhaps I'll start reading the books to see if they can bring the magic back to life!"

","The longest book is the shortest movie? Are you serious not only did the movie leave out key parts (quidditch and the fight between harry and malfoy, the visit to the hospital amongst others) but they parts they tried to incorporate into the movie were might as wells have been thrown in there with out any concern. Scenes that were too long should have been shorted and key scenes were either too short or left out all together. The acting was acceptable, the girl who played luna lovegood is the only bright spot. Everything else is a trainwreck. Take the money and invest in a good rusty knife, take the knife and proceed to stab yourself in the eye for a good 2 hours or so and you will have an arguably more enjoyable time than watching this poorly put together excuse for an adaption of a novel."

","I've been a fan of the HP series since 3rd grade and am persuading my younger brother to read them, too. Now a senior in high school, I still love the books and some of the movies. This is my favorite book...but it's the worst movie so far. They took so much out of the book and made the shortest HP movie yet out of the longest book. I was EXTREMELY disappointed when they didn't put ANY quidditch in it! Especially when Ron was supposed to be the new keeper!!! Dudley looked ridiculous, the ministry of magic was WRONG. The scene changes were choppy and awkward...almost a Pirates of the Caribbean feel to it. The only good thing I can say is the fight between Voldemort and Dumbledore was pretty good. Short, but I liked the water vs fire part."

","I saw the first four movies without reading the books and I loved them all. Once I read the books, I understood the movies a whole lot better but I still felt that they did justice to the books. Maybe it was this difference in order that made me have such high expectations for Order of the Phoenix - there were so many scenes that I'd read about that I was dying to see in the movie - but I have to say that overall, I was very disappointed by this movie. I understand that a lot had to be cut, especially given that this was the longest book, but there was SO MUCH missing that I don't think it would have been difficult to include. There is no reason that this movie should be the shortest when this book was the longest. Even ten or 15 more minutes worth of scenes would have made this movie perfectly amazing. Even a lot of the things that were actually included in the movie were changed, which was just as disappointing as the things we didn't see at all.<br/><br/>I have to admit though that there were some things about this movie that were dead on perfect. Luna and Umbridge were perfect, and Bellatrix was AMAZING. I was actually disappointed at how short her screen time was. The scene where Harry and the Aurors flew over the Thames, the duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore (I loved the ""It was a mistake for you to come here tonight, Tom""), the DA, Bellatrix's escape from Azkaban, Umbridge in general, etc. were all well done. I just feel that there were some scenes that were necessary to set up Half Blood Prince that were not included in this movie at all.<br/><br/>We don't see Neville's parents which means that we don't see how hard he works to do well in the DA, and his face to face with Bellatrix is hardly full of the desire for revenge that we know Neville feels in the book. We don't see Harry asking Kreacher where Sirius is, which is the whole reason why Harry was so quick to run to the Ministry - he didn't know that Sirius was upstairs, perfectly fine, because Kreacher lied to him. We hardly see any of the visions and dreams Harry is having throughout the book, which are central to whole story. We don't see much of Occlumency and there's no Quidditch, which is important to Ron's development at least. I was hoping to see McGonnagall and Umbridge go at it at least once, but there was none of that. In fact I felt like I hardly saw any of the adult characters for more than five minutes each. I've never really warmed up to Gambon after getting used to Harris as Dumbledore, but he wasn't completely horrible this time around. And overall the order of events is changed a lot (in the interest of time I suppose) but I can deal with that compared to the other gaping holes.<br/><br/>I think my greatest disappointment was the scene near the end of the movie when Dumbledore and Harry finally talk face to face. In the final chapters of the book, this is when Harry is enraged and devastated and Dumbledore finally explains the prophecy, but none of that is in the movie. In fact, the whole deal with the prophecy is completely changed. I thought this was one of the most important scenes in the book and it was hardly in the movie at all. Harry's relationship was Sirius was somewhat decently set up in the movie, but we never see his complete and utter devastation at Sirius' death. The end of the movie is not at all in the book, but it's not that bad compared to the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, the reason I give this a 7/10 is because of the charm of the Harry Potter movies. All in all it's not a completely horrible movie, but I won't say I'm not glad that the script writer of the first four is coming back for the last two. What gets me is that Order of the Phoenix did absolutely nothing to set up Half Blood Prince and left huge gaping holes in the plot that would not have been very difficult to fill in. Half Blood Prince is my favorite book so far, so I can only hope that it redeems the series and somehow gets on without Order of the Phoenix setting it up."
"aajay","9","0","1","13 July 2007"," Very good film but lacks humor and heart
","After reading all the books so far and seeing all the movies, it suddenly occurred to me that Order of the Phoenix movie left out many of the little humorous touches which make the books so endearing. I thinkthe clearing out of the Black house is hilarious as is Tonks; she gotshort shrift. I missed the house elves both in this and in Goblet ;(Dobby gives Harry the seaweed in the Goblet and he also tells him about the Room of Requirement in Order), both plot devices which should have been included. Also Kreacher should have had more exposition, he just wanders in and out a few times; I think he was actually a lot more sinister. I really, really missed the scene at St. Mungos, especially Nevilles tragic situation, that's what I mean by ""heart"". But most of all they left out the message to Aunt Petunia and her standing up for Harry and keeping him there when his uncle wants to throw him out. This is such an major theme through out the series--the importance of Harry's mother's love and the protection this affords him thru his Aunt Petunia. It would only have taken a few minutes to include. I agree with leaving out the Quidditch as it would have taken up a great deal of time. Throughout, too much emphasis is on action and violence at the expense of humor and ""heart"". However, thanks to all for the books and the movies, we should be grateful we have them at all. Advice to next director: If you want to make Daniel look younger, give him back his longer mop-like hair=do, like Ruperts. His short ""manly"" haircut emphasizes his jaw and thicker neck (sorry, Dan)and makes him look much more mature."

This PROFOUNDLY effected Harry, but the movie doesn't seem to say that.<br/><br/>2) The didn't have the single best scene in the entire book, the scene when Harry becomes non linear and wrecks Dumbledore's office.<br/><br/>I confess I just don't get it, directors go on and on how they don't want to make their movie too long, and yet the have 10 or 12 minutes of closing credits. I humbly suggest they all should flash by in 10 seconds. True, at that speed nobody could read them, but that is a minor point, nobody reads them anyway; and if you have a burning desire to know if the first aid paramedic for the second unit was John Smith or Jack Smyth you can always look it up on the internet, or freeze frame it when you get the DVD.<br/><br/>I've mentioned this to people before and I always get comments saying that they just love closing credits, but just how much do you really love them? Do you love them more than an entire subplot (probably two) that was in the book but not the movie? And look at some great classic movies, in many of them the closing credits last no more than 10 seconds, this modern trend of endless credits stinks."

"run_kidflash_run","10","0","2","13 July 2007"," The best of the Potter movies yet!!
","Just a warning for those who haven't read the book and plan on seeing the movie: this contains spoilers!! <br/><br/>This movie makes all the others pale in comparison. From the horrendous acting done by the front three in the first two movies to the glaring mistakes made in the third, this movie makes up for it all. All the young actors have improved at least 200% and the adults give what is arguably the best performances in any movie to date. I know that many people were upset with the casting of Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, I among them, but in this movie he shines. It seemed as if every time he was on screen, tears came to my eyes, and not just because I knew he was going to fall through the veil at the end.<br/><br/>I have to say that all the other actors and actresses, save one, exceeded my expectations. This one exception was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. After seeing Richard Harris take on this role flawlessly, the new Dumbledore is just not up to par. From the new costumes to the new personality, I don't know what it is. I just don't like him as Dumbledore. He needs to act like he's 150, not 25. And he needs to cut his nails.<br/><br/>Although I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and give it a ten out of ten with no hesitation, there were a few plot twists in the book that were not included. I sorely missed Aunt Petunia explaining what dementors are, as well as Mad Eye intimidating Uncle Vernon. I was also disappointed that only part of the prophecy was heard; the part about Neville possibly being in Harry's position was completely ignored. I was also disappointed by the way the veil was portrayed. There was no black curtain, just an archway with silver mist floating inside. Although I did not like this, the way Sirius's ""death"" was handled was incredible. It had me sobbing for ten minutes.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was spectacular. Although it only came out two days ago, I am going to see it again for a third time. :)"
"curtis-8","7","0","2","13 July 2007"," Needed to be at least 15 minutes longer
","This installment of Harry Potter is the first one in which the filmmakers trimmed away virtually every subplot that was present in the huge book upon which it is based; only the main plot is served. A good idea I think. But, even though they cut the plot(s) to the bone, the second half of the film still feels rushed. It is about at the halfway point that the clear, focused editing of the movie turns choppy, with one sequence following another with little or no transition; I kept expecting the characters to get cut off in mid-sentence, but that never actually happened. <br/><br/>Also, this HP, though generally very high in quality, suffers from the same lack of clarity that has afflicted each of the films in the series since the unjustly maligned first two installments. The director of the first two, Chris Columbus, was bashed by some for creating a simplistic, Disney-ish version of the Potter stories. There may be a little truth to that, but there's also something that no one credits him for--clarity. There is not a single moment in either of the first two films where anyone in the audience could have been heard asking another one ""What just happened?"" The films since the first two have upped the sophistication level and pace considerably, but have in the process lost this clarity. For example in this most recent film I could hear people all around me asking each other questions about what they'd just seen, especially during the rushed second half. The editors don't seem to realize what story points need to be emphasized and made clear. For instance, kissing scene or no, the budding and then decaying relationship between Harry and Cho is played in such muted tones that many in the audience not familiar with the book were left wondering what was going on when things started to go bad. And Luna Lovejoy's last lines were so subtlety presented that my wife whispered to me ""That went right past mewhat is she talking about?"" The editors and screenwriters of the Potter films, tasked with condensing the increasingly gigantic novels into 2 hour films are falling into the trap of mistaking the mere dispensing of information with the telling of a story. Storytelling is about rhythm and flow, high points and quiet timesit's not about just lining all the bits and pieces up in neat, even rows."
"rumen_1981","3","0","1","13 July 2007"," The worst harry potter movie
","The worst movie at all. Almost nothing in common with the book. Yates adds so many unnecessary scenes from himself and cut so many important moments... I'm very disappointed and hope next one will be better. I've read the book so many times (all the books actually) and for me ""Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" are not good enough. I really like ""The goblet of fire"" and I expected that this one will be as good as the previous. In my opinion the director this time failed.In some moments I was even bored.Unbelievable! And where is the Quidditch ???I haven't seen this since a short scene from ""The prisoner of Azkaban"". The Quidditch plays big part in the 5th book, as it gave Ron the chance to shine. Griffindor wins the quidditch cup and Ron is their hero. I really miss this scene. I'm sorry we don't see more of Rupert Grint(Ron) and Bonnie Wright(Ginny) in this film. Also we barely see Alan Rickman (Snape), but we do see long boring scenes with Evanna Lynch(Luna) like the one in the end. Also there is no Christmastime hospital scene, no Longbottom's parents, no Lockhart. I forgot to say the way that everybody can see the Room of Requirement is ridiculous. Dobby finds this room for Harry, not Nevil.A person can only enter this room when they have a real need for it and pass 3 times around.And Kreacher?He doesn't looks so bad in the movie,but in the book he goes to Malfoy, and he betrays Sirius. These are just a few examples..."
"redbandana","7","0","1","13 July 2007"," some of the worst editing in recent years
","I wanted to like this film. The thing that really made this film disappointing was the editing. The entire pace of the film is rushed, such that almost every scene ends abruptly or cuts out way to soon. I don't blame Yates for condensing a book that is over 800 pages long, but the film is TOO CONDENSED. This is proved in the total runtime of the movie, which is only a little over 2 hours, the shortest HP film yet. Ironic that the OotP is the LONGEST book in the series but the SHORTEST film in the franchise. Therefore, everyone other than Harry and Umbridge (who both give excellent performances) gets very little film time or very few lines. Major characters such as Ron, Dumbledore, Snape, Cho Chang, and Voldemort seem unimportant because they do so little. If you are a fan of the book, be warned, because the film leaves out A LOT of things and makes some changes. For example, in the Department of Mysteries, there are no revolving doors. The fight scene only takes place in 2 rooms. Although the last 20 minutes are really exciting, it would have been even better if they included the revolving doors. Also, the movie uses the newspaper flash technique as a means to give information that could otherwise be ACTED out in a scene, but i guess that would be to hard to do. It is obvious this technique is used to the directors advantage to shorten the films runtime, but it is used so much that it gets really annoying."

","Before I critisise the acting, please know that this is a very artistic film! The scenery and sets were beautiful clashed with brilliant cinematography. See, I know nothing about those sort of things, but it was quite noticeable. This film had a different aura. Luna (Evanna Lynch) was so phenomenal that I hardly paid attention to Ron and Hermione, except when Emma did weird things with her line and when Rupert was whispering... And Cho made me grimace. She didn't act really natural...just heavy sorrow without the refreshing release of tears. I felt sorry for Harry. As usual, Snape was sensationally sardonic. I just wish that McGonagall would have followed his example like in the book. Minor characters did subtle things that were HILARIOUS. Imelda S. did well with Umbetch. Loathsome. I didn't like Helena though - she cackled too much. Anyway, the last battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort had tremendous impact. Muuuch better than Priori Incantem in GoF. Dan Rad was incredible! He made me cry with the last scene at the Ministry. I was so much more aware of how powerful and merciless Voldemort was on Harry's mind. All Harry's insecurities were made clear. Abd the way his memories played made me so nostalgic. I would've really liked the Weasleys to explain about Percy...or at least so SOMETHING productive at Grimmauld place. The film was super funny, though! Kingsley and Flitwick, with their subtlety, were great! And it felt like a real movie. Not just a year inside Hogwarts, but there was the real world that Harry talked about...I guess it felt more hazardous and genuine because Voldemort came back at the end of GoF. He was waiting for Harry and being a burden. Voldemort didn't appear on the back of someone's head underneath Hogwarts, as a memory and Horcrux hidden in the school, and he didn't just threat Harry with the return of a Death Eater. He didn't bring Harry against his will this time, not exactly. Harry felt a bigger sense of protection and love, of course. He wasn't a coward...he'd barge into the Department of Mysteries after class. And the DA helped his friends feel more confident and ready to face the real world. And the real world has issues in which Muggles struggle with as well, war, incompetent governments...in this case, the Ministry would not accept the truth because of fear. The film did a good job of showing that. <br/><br/>Hmph, no St Mungo's scenes with poor Neville and his family and Lockhart. No mysteries about Broderick Bode. No Quibbler interview or date with Cho. (I was reeeally looking forward to the former!) Or ""Weasley Is Our King"". Or QUIDDITCH BANNING after George and Harry attack Draco! It's horrid of Umbetch, but that adds to her *gags* character. And why don't the filmmakers care enough about Draco to give Tom some more time on screen? He was always in the background - Divination, you know...but we are expecting (demanding =]) more Malfoy in HBP! A different side of him must, must be exposed because people who haven't read book 6 will still refer to Draco as that blonde, enemy, hot, rich, Slytherin, prat, etc. He's not that simple. But his lack of lines is forgiving since he doesn't change until book six. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt so much at home with this film. It is the best one yet. It shows that this time, the war between dark and light is boiling up. And in this film, the dark side isn't the only enemy. It's no longer just about Harry being safe at Hogwarts but fighting with Voldemort at the end. It's not safe."

With ""Weasley is our king"" being left out completely and the happier times included in the novel being very underplayed. Sirius Death has also been butchered and true fans such as myself will be left disappointed.<br/><br/>However its not all negative, the new additions of Luna Lovegood, Bellatrix Lestrange and Tonks were brilliantly cast and wonderfully played. The old cast members who have been notoriously bad at acting in the past are constantly improving with Rupert Grint in particular outshining the other 2 lead roles.

","Dan Brown once said that if movies were to be too faithful to their material we'd be having 7 - 10 hour feature films. Hardly something that anyone might want to go through in a sitting. But what is the remedy? This is where Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix or perhaps some of the previous films and moreso, other adaptations fall short. While in direction, atmospherics and cinematography it has a lot of moments to boast, the pacing is left uneven and the rhythm of the film would seem rather episodic. Add to that the little slack they cut for those who have not read the book, since I have read Phoenix and even Half-Blood Prince already, I can wink at the same people who have also read them - but the choppy flow of the story is something that is bothersome even to those who understand how the motion picture medium MUST be abridged to have the true 'show don't tell' essence of cinema rather than the comprehensive introspection of a novel.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes was as menacing as he should have been as the antagonist, though underused in my opinion, I suppose I wouldn't want to get habituated to his villainy too soon that he would no longer feel a thread if given much much more screen time. The rest of the players performances range from good to average, and the ending doesn't quite capture the same melancholy and tragedy in the end of the book. On the plus side there were issues and conflicts that were absolved from needing to be in the film such as the relationship of Harry Potter and his foster parents. Cutting some things short also means loosening the weight of emotional gravitas the novel has, and for this maybe audiences can breathe more. But it makes the film's depth, if any seem shallow-er.<br/><br/>3/5"
"jeffzandi","9","0","1","13 July 2007"," Fifth Harry Potter Film Pulls It All Together
","Just when I thought that another Summer movie sequel just might send me over the edge, Harry Potter saves the day. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix provides an all-star display of all the best elements of the previous four J.K. Rowling stories. Surprisingly tight at two hours and fourteen minutes, the latest Potter presentation predictably takes us back to Hogwarts, but don't think for a minute that you have seen all this before. Director David Yates delivers a movie with style and a consistent rhythm that makes the familiar characters and locations seem new and more exciting than ever.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg had much too much material on his plate, Rowling's novel was longer than any previous Harry Potter book, but he manages to find the most essential parts. Some characters from the series get short shrift, none more than Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy. The wizarding world's favorite broomstick sport Quidditch, a popular Potter subplot, is not so much as mentioned. In the name of efficient storytelling, there is a very real danger that viewers less familiar with the story will be lost along the way at times. There simply is not enough time permitted in this film to fully illustrate Rowling's novel. However, the important things, the tone, the excitement and most importantly, the heart of the Harry Potter experience is still there.<br/><br/>The movie's big battle takes us to a new place, where we see the personality, power and fighting styles of many different wizards and witches. The satisfaction of seeing wizards seriously battling it out satisfies in a way that tips its hat to the long-awaiting full strength Jedi battles in the most recent Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>The greatest achievement of this installment is in the thrill we share with Harry and his friends thwarting the ridiculously sadistic Dolores Umbridge. The film strikes the perfect chord of subversive energy combined with a timely sense of hope among youth dealing with a seemingly hopeless situation.<br/><br/>In the end, the only thing wrong with this movie is that it needs to be longer, and when was the last time anybody said THAT about a 'sequel'?"

","I saw this movie last night, and thought it was great! The writers did an excellent job of condensing and adapting JK's colossal novel, and kept the essence of the book alive. Though it may be slightly confusing for people who have not read the book, as there are a few little things that there just isn't time to explain in the running time. My main quibble is that much-loved characters, like Mr and Mrs Weasley, Professer Lupin, Mad-Eye-Moody and Tonks don't get much screen time, and are missed. The structure also feels a little uneven at times, but the movie is never boring. The older cast are, of course, excellent - especially Alan Rickman as slimy Professer Snape and Ralph Fiennes as evil Lord Voldemort. But what really impressed me was how mush the acting of the three leads has improved - Daniel Radcliffe really made me feel Harry's angst and sadness. A bit more time is also spent on the relationships between Harry and Sirius, and Harry and Cho, so the viewer is affected more on an emotional level. The climax at the Ministry of Magic is also amazing - roll on Half-Blood Prince!"
"alice_digby","8","0","2","13 July 2007"," The best film of them all.
","I saw this film last night, and i must say it it the best directed and the best acted of all the films. For those of you that have read the books, A lot of things are cut out, i.e. Rons Quidditch. The time spend in grimmauld place is minimal, being at most around 5 minutes, which i felt could have been extended. The story moves very quickly, and i found myself wondering whether i would have a clue what was going on if i hadn't read the books. This film spent longer on character development than the last film, which helped slow down the fast pace of the movie, however, whole chapters in the book were put into 5 seconds snapshots in the movie, and then moves to the next scene.<br/><br/>One very cringy bit is his kiss though. He looks very uncomfortable, and his kissing looked horrendous! Luna Lovegood stood out for me, as she really brought the character to life. I was apprehensive about how Bellatrix Lestrange would be portrayed, however HBC did her justice, and she was my favourite character in the film with regards to how closely they are portrayed to the book.<br/><br/>I really recommend going to see this film, It's by far the best of the lot, however if you haven't read the books you may get a little confused, as certain bits just arn't explained. I give it 8/10! xx"

","From the Dementors attacking the obnoxious Dudley and Harry, the irritating and unbearable Dolores Umbridge, and to the show-stopping duel between the two greatest wizards of the age... Order of the Pheonix was hands down the best Harry Potter book-adaptation so far! (SPOILERS) The film started off with a great introduction with the Dementor attack on the idiotic Dudley, and the aspiring wizard Harry. At the Ministry of Magic, the entire place was magnificently created... and definitely a way to introduce the upcoming jaw-dropping sets throughout the rest of the movie. Dolores Umbridge was perfectly portrayed... and hands-down stole the acting part of the entire film! At the Department of Mysteries... the entire scene was set up to the greatest detail.. and for sure made the myself completely engulfed in this movie! When Sirius' death came... I couldn't help to shed a tear! And then... it came! Once Dumbledore arrived to defend Harry by dueling Lord Voldemort I had goosebumps throughout the entire duel. Without a doubt... OOTP was perfectly adapted into the best adaptation so far! Although this movie is the best so far... some of the book was unfortunately left out... but that didn't stop me from wanting to watch it over and over again! I must say that Harry Potter has finally become a series that has conquered the entire world... child and all! This is the must see movie of the year! Drake"

","The Director David Yates clearly deserves recommendation for making one of the biggest Harry Potter books into an enjoyable movie experience. He seemed to hit each important part of the book and loop them together to make the story flow. He also made the fight scenes very entertaining. I hear from other critics that they are disappointed with character development but in honestly this is the fifth movie and you know the character by now. The only problem I had with it was the same problem I had with transformers; the final fight scenes are to confusing and fast. You really do not know what is going on. Besides that the movie is great and a must see for any Harry Potter. Just a reminder the book is big so some stuff needed to be cut out."
"hotguy353","10","0","3","12 July 2007"," Not a bad movie.
","That movie was awesome. Most people will say that the movie was the weakest in the series, but don't be fooled. The introduction of Evanna Lynch (Luna ""Loony"" Lovegood), and Natalia Tena (Nymphadora Tonks) have got to make it the best cast ever. Luna was actually different than what most people saw from the book. I expected someone more like Professor Sybil Trelawny, instead they cast someone as good looking as Evanna, (anyone have her number?) who filled the space in rather well. Tonks is not seen much in the movie, but i liked her the moment I saw her. The part where she gets mad at Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody has gotta be awesome. As she is not seen much in the actual movie, I am sure the DVD version will have a couple of cut scenes involving her. As for Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) dying, heartbreaking. The scene where Harryand Sirius are looking at the Black Family Tree, when Sirius says ""When this is all over, we'll be a proper family."" Those who have read the book, and know what's coming want to cry before he even dies. Michael Gambon, Albus Dumbledore redeems himself with an excellent performance, showing us that his character is not dead, yet. Overall a good movie, definitely one worth seeing."
"LLgood","9","0","2","12 July 2007"," Best Harry Potter movie!
","I loved this movie, It was amazing. Absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>There were things about this movie that I didn't like. It never explains the exact details of what happened to Neville's parents. That will confuse pretty much everyone who haven't read the books. Also, while the music was beautiful, there were a couple of moments where the music didn't fit what was happening. that happened only a few times thankfully.<br/><br/>Now onto the good things...<br/><br/>Dan Radcliffe acting has improved so much. I felt for him each moment he had to feel angry or sad or feel any emotions. I was surprised by Emma Watson's performance. It's a lot better than Goblet of Fire. Rupert Grint is good as always.<br/><br/>The Battle scene is amazing. One of the best scenes in the movie. Sadly, I didn't get to see it in Imax, but it was still amazing."
"Shinobu_Sensui","9","0","2","12 July 2007"," A Worthy successor to Goblet of Fire!
","While not as good as it's predecessor, Order of the Phoenix is definitely one of the top three in the series.<br/><br/>The story is well known among Potter fans but I'll say this. It is about Harry and his friends preparing for a war with the newly resurrected Lord Voldemort. Plus, Hogwarts has to put up with an agent from the Ministry of Magic who is attempting to take over Hogwarts because her boss feels that Dumbledore, the headmaster of the school, is after his job.<br/><br/>I have to say that I went in expecting a lot. The film turned out to be roughly as good as I had hoped, with drawbacks that were counterbalanced by an incredible level of emotional intensity.<br/><br/>First, the direction is good. This movie is beautifully photographed, like the last two in the series. The camera angles are solid, and the colors have a level of vibrancy that suits the story well. The lighting is good. The costuming is well done, and the production has a good felling to it. The sets however, leave much to be desired! The script is imperfect, but adequate. Some of the dialog could have been done much better.<br/><br/>The Music score is exceptional, as always in Potter films.<br/><br/>This is probably the most emotional Potter film so far. The viewers feelings are summoned powerfully and potently.<br/><br/>But what really make this movie, are the actors!!! Radcliffe as harry, is very believable as a teen facing all kinds of emotional stress. Grint as Ron, does well, and Watson once again is exceptional as Hermione! Alan Rickman once again does perfect as Snape! Most of all however, is Fiennes as Voldemort. He is very believable as this villain, oozing evil and frightening! He really makes this movie even though he doesn't have much screen time. However, they are all weighed down by Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Jeez a miss Richard Harris! Gambon is unbelievably wooden as the wise elder! So overall, the good far outweighed the bad and here we have by far the best movie of 2007!"

It had breath-taking effects and wonderfully exciting action scenes.<br/><br/>The movie did grow boring in the middle for a time.<br/><br/>This movie did disappoint me in how it didn't involve the swamp scene or have the centaur replace Trelawney.<br/><br/>Other than that, I liked this movie immensely.

","All I can say is: Wow, what a great film!!!!!!! I am a die-hard Harry Potter fan and only saw the 5th movie just last night. The special effects and acting were AMAZING. The actress that played Umbridge--WOW! She did an amazing job.<br/><br/>I was however disappointed that there was a few things left out. I was really looking forward to seeing some of the things mentioned in the book put in to the film, but I guess you can't cram an 876 page book in to 2 hours and 18 minutes.<br/><br/>One thing I loved the most about the movie was that it really picked up on Harry and Sirius's relationship. There was a lot more in this film than its predecessor."
"booya808","9","0","2","12 July 2007"," An Excellent Film
","Although many will disagree, I believe that this Harry Potter film was the greatest one yet. I've grown up in the Harry Potter craze, with both the books and the movies. Many people are complaining that the fifth installment to the series ""left out way too much"" and ""skipped a huge part of the book!"" I have a different point of view than these people. I thought that the movie flowed very nicely, and that they didn't leave out anything 'major' or that will play a greater part in the sixth and seventh movies. I talked to my friend, who does not read the books, although she enjoys the movies, and says that it made sense to her, even though it wasn't as packed as the book was. Overall, I'd say this movie was fantastic. Not only did it flow nicely, but the younger actors greatly improved. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) really stood out (obviously, because he's the main character), and did an excellent portrayal of all the different emotions and pains Harry felt as described in the book. This movie was the best, by far, and all those who are complaining fail to see the greater aspects of the movie."
"horcruxz","9","0","3","12 July 2007"," Best one so far. Seriously.
","When I learned that this was the shortest film out of all five, I'll be honest- I thought it would suck. I mean, putting 870 (or 766 in the UK) pages into a 138-minute long film... seems impossible, right? Wrong. At least not for David Yates and Michael Goldenberg. Of course stuff was cut- the St. Mungo's scene, for instance, Harry and Cho's date- and a lot was moved around. If you're a die-hard fan of the books, you will be angry. But if you go in accepting that things will be cut or moved around, and that you probably won't like it, but try to see what's good about the movie, you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>THE ACTING: The adult cast gave their usual perfect performances. Michael Gambon, while not being as great as the late Richard Harris, improved with his character from the last film. For some reason, however, Richard Griffiths' portrayal of Vernon Dursley was just wrong in this film. I don't get it- he was great in the other films. Let's talk about the new comers, starting with Imelda Staunton as Umbridge. I was bursting at the seams in awe of her performance. She was the perfect Umbridge. Staunton should win an award for it, but then again, do Harry Potter adult actors ever get awards for their HP roles? Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix was a gem. She's just as I imagined-while reading the book I imagined Helena Bonhmam Carter to play Bellatrix. She simply gave a chilling, great, spot-on performance.<br/><br/>THE ACTING CONT'D: The kids were great too, especially newcomer Evanna Lynch. This girl deserved the role. I'm glad they picked her over the thousands of other girls. The trio was of course, good. Daniel Radcliffe keeps getting better. This performance topped his last one. Emma Watson, thank God, didn't annoy me in this one. She's getting better also. I hope she'll stay for the sixth film. Of course we know Rupert Grint was good, but in my opinion he was underused.<br/><br/>THE MUSIC: Awesome. It wasn't John Williams, but this was a fresh new sound, compared to Patrick Doyle.<br/><br/>SFX/CINEMATOGRAPHY: The thestrals looked amazing, the dementors were astounding... The scenes where they flew around and over London were breathtaking. I got chills in the scene where the students cast Patronus charms. I loved Hermione's otter and Luna's rabbit. Furthermore, under Yates' directorship, we see some new methods of cinematography not attempted by any other director. Some was needed, like the flashes of images as Harry's mind was penetrated, and some was added just for the affect, like the newspapers, and worked.<br/><br/>STORYLINE: (as a movie and as compared to the book)Some events that fans might consider to be helpful or important to the plot have been cut. Quidditch is completely out. Personally, I didn't mind because I don't really like Quidditch. And if you expect the HP movies to be totally faithful to the books, you're delusional. This is Hollywood, folks- it has to appeal to everyone. Would a non-book fan want to sit through a ten hour movie? Of course not. And actually, even though things were cut and moved around, surprisingly, IT WORKED! In my opinion, we get to see the most important things, making it satisfactory for non-book fans and book fans. Unless you're picky, but that's your loss. Also, unlike the fourth movie, which was choppy and awkwardly paced, this one had flow.<br/><br/>MISCELLANEOUS: The things they added into the movie that weren't exactly part of the book were a help, and fans will be glad to know that they included some great lines from the book, such as the famous ""emotional range of a teaspoon"" line. A downside of this movie is that it was the shortest one for such a long book, so the ending wasn't as detailed as it should have been. They could have afforded a better ending, I think. On a high note, the relationship between Sirius was very touching. It made it more horrible when Sirius died... sorry if I spoiled that for you, but then again I did specify up top that there are spoilers.<br/><br/>All in all, there are some things about this movie that I can't describe. Just go see it and spend too much on a ticket for a movie that's worth it."
"marios_erotokritou230","10","0","3","12 July 2007"," Brilliant movie even though there are scenes missing!!
","I am a hardcore HP fan. I read all J.K. Rowling's books and I watched all the movies as well. I admit that I was expecting a really disappointing movie since the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book from the Harry Potter series so far. However I am really surprised. I just returned home from the movie and I confess my self really satisfy with the work of David Yates. For once more the characters were brilliant and successful chosen for the casting. Professor Umbridge performance is brilliance as well as the acting of Bellarix who transfers the feeling of madness to the spectator. The fight of the of the aurors against the death eaters is also spectacular as well as the fight of Dumbledore against Voldemord even though I would like to last longer. The graphics of the movie are also amazing. In few words Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a must see Summer 2007 movie.<br/><br/>Flaws: Many chapters from the book neglected. For example the brain room in the department of mysteries, Firenze's return in the school after Trellony's sacking by Umbridge etc. The movie never mentions that the Dementor's at the beginning of the movie were sent by Umbridge and many more.<br/><br/>However I was expecting these neglects since the book is 800 pages.<br/><br/>10/10"
"psilocybinswan","7","0","2","12 July 2007"," Very nice addition to the series.
","I had incredibly low expectations for this movie, and I actually didn't know I was going to see it opening night until my friends told me they had tickets like six hours before the show. Needless to say, I was quite impressed.<br/><br/>The film covers most of the events that occurred in the 5th Harry Potter book subtitled ""The Order of the Phoenix."" It did an EXCELLENT job at portraying almost all of the necessary elements to the story, while twisting some events away from the actual story line. Personally, I enjoyed that. I don't like to see movies that are 100% what they're based on- there's no element of surprise, and a lot of the fun of watching a movie is taken away. I won't say what parts were/were not excluded for the sake of not spoiling anything for those that haven't read the book (shame!) or what was changed so that you can be pleasantly surprised like I was. The plot did tend to stick to what was absolutely necessary to keep the story progressing, though. The lack of ""filler"" disappointed me. We didn't get to see any of Harry's classes besides Defense against the Dark Arts, or classes where Professor Umbridge was ridiculing other teachers and threatening their job security. Draco Malfoy also appeared for... all of three minutes.<br/><br/>I was never really too fond of the children cast of Harry Potter's movie series. They aged too quickly for the movie series, and often acted really... poorly. Example: Harry's character stutters after saying ""He's trying to..."", and before he can pause long enough to indicate that he's dropped the sentence or thought, Hermione jumps in and says ""to what Harry?"" Little details like that prevent me from taking them serious as actors. I guess I've never had a qualm with Rupert Grint (Ron) and don't mind Harry as much as I do Hermione.<br/><br/>That said, there were a lot of really corny and cheesy moments- Moments where the entire cast laughs at something completely not funny or assaults the audience with preachy and ridiculous lines that are just... stupid and show signs of poor writing. Surely the director could have hired a writer more skilled to portray these characters for such a high profile film! The film also introduced 2 new characters- Professor Umbridge and Luna Lovegood. Both were portrayed AMAZINGLY. Umbridge was a perfect representation of what the character would be, and really made the plot interesting. The same goes for Luna, whose ""dreamy"" voice quality was perfectly recreated.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed myself. For some reason, I suffer some sort of ""amnesia"" in between releases of new Harry Potter books and movies and forget how much I love them. This movie has once again reinvigorated my interest in the series, and it just might be one of my favorites."

","This was by far my favorite book but the movie, to me was disappointing, but only to the extent of being based off a book. As a movie in general it was excellent. I didn't like how short it was, it was the shortest movie and one of the things I like about the Harry Potter movie series is their length.<br/><br/>It seemed like David Yates rushed everything and left out many, i think, important parts. Did anyone else notice that Ron had like 20 words the entire movie? I also think that it was too much of an action movie and that Yates overlooked plot building and skipped right to the climaxes.<br/><br/>A lot was missing, but overall the movie was good for a fan or not, but as a movie based off a book it was poor."
"sinner06","8","0","3","12 July 2007"," Best film since ""Azkaban""
","I have only read the first two books of the Harry Potter series so I can judge the later movies by what they are.<br/><br/>""Order of the Phoenix"" is a fast paced film, not as fast as ""Goblet"" but still - it feels like they are packing an awful lot into a small time slot (just over two hours). One thing I noticed in this movie is the improvement of the acting, especially from Radcliffe and Gambon. Michael Gambon is spot on and really likable in this movie. There is a scene near the end where he really gives a presence of powerfulness but also helplessness.<br/><br/>In ""Phoenix"", there are many more emotional scenes. In the first films I felt that because of the dialog and stiff acting from Radcliffe the emotional scenes were very forced, almost cringeworthy. With ""Phoenix"", it's so well directed you really feel for the characters and what they're going through. I have to admit I was surprised to find that in a Potter film! The end of the movie is where it gets very tense. With previous Potter films it's usually all ""happy ever after"" - not so with ""Phoenix"". The final scenes are so powerful it gave me shivers, it was a clash of titans. An important character does die in this movie, so by the end I was ready for anything, and boy did it deliver.<br/><br/>Also, in previous Potter films, the wands and magic spells are all very fun to watch. In Phoenix, they're not little kids anymore. Voldermort is at large and the only times we see wands in action are in battle. They are weapons, not toys.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to comment on the amount of humor found in this film. Although a dark movie (possibly the darkest yet) there are many one-liners and funny scenes, particularly the ones featuring Imelda Staunton (Umbridge). Staunton delivers the most intense performance in the film, and although she's detestable, you have to admire her for her acting.<br/><br/>Overall a very fine film. Although it could of been longer and they could of cut out some pointless scenes, this is the best film to hit the series since ""Azkaban"".<br/><br/>8/10."
"Penny_Pringles","9","0","2","12 July 2007"," An incredible adaptation of the book!
","I have only been home for about ten minutes and already had the urge to write a review for this film...that's how amazing it is.<br/><br/>I went into the cinema rather curious to see how they were going to squeeze such a vast book into a two hour film. I have to admit that I did not have very high expectations considering how much information was cut out of the fourth film. BUT they managed it...the film even contained some trivial snippets of the book such as Fred and George's extendable ears and Umbridge's disgusting collection of kitten plates.<br/><br/>The actors really excel in this film. Normally I have a firm favourite out of the trio's performances but out of all honestly they all portrayed their characters without fault.<br/><br/>New faces on the scene will not disappoint you either. Evanna was without a doubt a perfect Luna as was Helena's portrayal of the unhinged Bellatrix Lestrange.<br/><br/>The special effects in this film are in a league of their own. The climax of the film in the ministry of magic really captures the essence of the book and will leave you buzzing after you have left the cinema because it is just so full of energy.<br/><br/>However if you are a hopeless romantic (like me) it will be the developing romance that you will probably enjoy the most. This film subtly hints towards future couples...Ron and Hermione of course and even though this is Harry and Cho's year there are some references to Harry and Ginny. Such as Harry's impressed reaction to Ginny's powerful reducto spell or Ginny's saddened facial expression when Harry and Cho are together on screen. There is even a growing chemistry between Neville and Luna, especially in the ministry of magic battle, which is adorable.<br/><br/>Like with any film that is based on a novel, cuts have to be made but Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix really does contain all the significant details that it needs to...if I had to fault the film at all it would be that it did not include Hermione kissing Ron on the cheek...and that is only because I am a dorky Ron and Hermione fan...and if you think about it that is a pretty petty fault.<br/><br/>So basically in a long winded nut shell see the film. The effects are brilliant, the acting is amazing and the script really does do the book justice. After all even J. K Rowling said herself that this film is her favourite in the series so far so that should be good for everyone else."
"thestrawspinner","9","0","2","12 July 2007"," Substance...with flash
","It was a joy, an absolute joy to see the main characters of Harry Potter depicted with some gravity. For four films (yes I did say all four)these young actors have had ""the emotional range of a teaspoon"" and largely through no fault of their own. Hollywood has a continual and annoying trend of equating fantasy with one dimensional, frequently paring their characters down to one and two word descriptions (i.e. hero, comic relief, girl power, wimp) that erodes them into nothing more than black/white,cardboard,stick people spiced up with a little humor. Not so with David Yates. Here, in this fifth installment, we are all of a sudden faced with people: Real people. They are full blown, colorful, effective. They remind you, on the eve of the last book of the series, how much you actually like Harry and how much you really want him to win this battle against Voldemort...somehow. This could not have been accomplished without Daniel Radcliffe's heartfelt performance. I don't care how much quidditch was added or whether Snape's memory was longer. Without substance this movie simply would have been a flash in the pan. It did not need more special effects, it did not need to be darker, it didn't even necessarily need the swamp. What it needed was the one thing all four movies have not been able to produce; acting that was befitting the characters and respectful of the work it came from. David Yates pulled that off in spades."
"Spunk_Ransom_Love","9","0","1","12 July 2007"," Good plot line, misses many points...
","Although this movie had awesome special effects and acting, I felt that it left you hanging in some places. For example, when the six arrive at the ministry, you don't really know how they got in there because of the jump between scenes. Also, when seeing Percy standing next to the Minister, I felt that the audience deserved an explanation for why he was there. Along with that no one really know what the veil is that Sirius goes through, it just kind of appears. The plot jumped around a lot in this movie and it did confuse people who didn't read the book. I also felt that there could have been more about Hagrid and the classes that the students were in. The only class that was shown was Defence Against the Dark Arts. Also, there was no explanation of why the Weasley twins had their Skiving Snackboxes and what they were planing to do with them.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved this movie because it was Harry Potter and I do love Harry Potter, but for plot line, it wasn't the best."

Kudos to Alan Rickman--further proof why he was the perfect choice for Snape, the unsung hero. The only thing I missed from the book was the opportunity to see the emotions play across Rupert Grint's face during the Slytherin/Gryffindor Quidditch match. Ah well, can't have everything."

Neville, the transfer of power, power of love, etc<br/><br/>-Harry pulling out his wand in public threatening Dudley's was not necessary and untrue (they could have had Harry talk aloud to himself about what he would like to do to Dudley and his mates) a waste of time just to let the movie watchers know Harry is having nightmare and is a hot blooded teen.<br/><br/>-Return to Hogwarts scenes were a waste of time because they do not do what the book does showing Harry's feeling of madness and isolation -Avada Kedavra hitting Sirius<br/><br/>Minor Grumble not so important<br/><br/>-Ron and Hermione not having time for Harry because of prefects duties<br/><br/>-Harry's deeper friendship with Neville (Luna was well covered)<br/><br/>-The DA members rocking their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWLs<br/><br/>-Harry pondering and questioning Sirius' death and the veil -The total mayhem created by the twins not shown but the giant W in the sky made up for that<br/><br/>None of this matter because ""The Half Blood Prince"" is my favorite, they better not mess it up.

"cali_kid","8","0","1","12 July 2007"," Brilliant
","This movie is great and not for the faint of heart! By far, it was the most thrilling and adult film of the series and had many surprising moments and stunning visual effects. The movie was pretty loyal to the book, considering the nearly 900 page adaption, though character development was clearly lacking in the script as so much was cut out. If you are a fan of Chris Columbus' sappy kiddy style films you probably will not enjoy this film much. However if you like POA and GOF, this film will be highly entertaining.<br/><br/>The actors are brilliantly cast, especially Evanna Lynch as Luna, Imelda Stanuton as Umbridge and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. The acting itself has improved tenfold. Dan Radcliffe finally does the role of Harry Potter justice, Rupert Grint is wonderful as always and Emma Watson has vastly improved as well.<br/><br/>Yates directing style is very raw and edgy which gives the film a much grittier tone than its predecessors. Goldenberg's screen writing is not as impressive, as he focuses to much on Umbridge in my opinion which sacirfices development for nearly every other character in the movie. However he does produce some shining moments. My only critique is that there are too many montages for my liking-in fact at some times the film can seem like one giant montage but to adapt a 900 book into a 2 hour movie must include montages i guess. It's definitely one of the best Potter films for sure!"
"funkichick25691","6","0","1","12 July 2007"," Not too shabby, not all that great
","I went to see this film today, and although i must congratulate David Yates on some good directing in some places, overall it felt to me as if i sat through 2 hours of nothing.<br/><br/>The cinematography I must say has certainly improved from the older films, and it felt a lot more ""real"" to me, especially in the first few things, and not only that but the special effects it has to be said, were spectacular.<br/><br/>A downside of the film though, is that it doesn't stand out as a film. If you haven't read the books, some parts may become completely lost on you, and there certainly isn't enough plot explanation. I feel as though the film brought nothing new that could not be gained from the book on its own, it didn't make anything ""click"" for me, which i didn't get in the books, and brought nothing new to the table, and although this sounds cliché, but the book is most definitely in this case better, and the film certainly went a way in ruining the book for me.<br/><br/>Not to continue slating the film, but at some points also, i truly had to cringe at some of the acting. In some places it felt very awkward, almost razored as if the actors hadn't truly grasped what was happening, although Rickman was superb as always, maintaining a character we have seen for 4 films already, and this will obviously be needed in the next film also.<br/><br/>One good point is that this film certainly contained a lot more laughs than the others, something i thought i would never see in the Harry Potter series, and although I personally do not think the feat of the film was truly accomplished, i would still suggest going to see it yourself, especially if you don't hold yourself as a large fan of the books."
"eatsunshine","6","0","1","12 July 2007"," Order of the Phoenix
","First off let me say I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan.<br/><br/>Yesterday I went and saw Order of the Phoenix at the Imax theater. I love the Imax, but I've never seen an actual movie on it, and I probably wont ever again. This is the shortest Harry Potter movie that has been made yet, but its the biggest book so far. No need to say that the movie fell way short of my expectations. I think they left out a lot of important things. I've read the book, but for people who haven't read the book and just choose the see the movie, I would think they would be confused as hell. I read that there was a new director for this movie. Well, he sucks. And you didn't get to see as much of Rupert as I personally would have liked <3. Umbridge was not portrayed as much of a b*tch is she is in the book, and she didn't look like what I pictured at all (toadface). The letter sent to Mrs. Dursley from Dumbledore was not in the film, which explained why Harry must go back to the Dursleys every summer. The Prophecy wasn't talked about that much between Dumbledore and Harry. The D.A.s fight with the death eaters at the Ministry of Magic was limited. Harry's deep depression about Sirius was left out. I don't think the point of Voldemort tricking Harry to going to the Ministry of Magic was fully made. And Qudditch was completely edited out. The Weasley twins departure from Hogwarts could have been a lot better. Kreacher was only seen once or twice in the movie. There is so much more, but I am choosing what to complain about, so finally, the battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end was definitely not even half as good as the battle in the book. A plus, the kiss between Cho and Harry, that was pretty nice. I might go to the normal theater to see it, hopefully it will be better that way, because I don't like to repeatedly turn my head back and forth from one side of the screen to another while watching a film."
"NeilBarnett","9","0","1","12 July 2007"," Excellent Fast Paced Film
","Queued up like many more to watch the first showing today of the film at 11am and I'm pleased I did.<br/><br/>The film was beautifully acted not only by the side cast which there are many, but the main trio. Each brought there character to life unlike in previous Harry Potter films. Dumbledore was Dumbledore from the books and not like how he was played in the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Imelda Staunton who was fabulous as Umbridge, a right nasty piece of work.<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing and although I wish the wand fight at the end was longer it was beautifully shot.<br/><br/>As one of the shortest Harry Potter films I did feel that perhaps another 10 to 15mins additions might of been nice. Maggie Smith is hardly seen.<br/><br/>But as other people have said you need to remove yourself from the very thick book and just have a roller coaster of a ride.<br/><br/>This has been the best blockbuster film of 2007 so far after a year of big disappointments namely Spider-man 3 and Pirates 3.<br/><br/>Its beginning to feel like the days of the Lord of the Rings films, you look forward to the next chapter and will miss it once its all gone.<br/><br/>Lets hope The Half Blood Prince brings more of the same."
"Goth_Hobbit","Null","0","1","12 July 2007"," Highly Entertaining - After All, Isn't That The Point? :-P
","Well, I saw Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix last night. There were things I liked and things I didn't, just as with all the other movies. I felt the beginning was a bit rushed, more so than the rest of the film, but that's understandable since the book is so massive. It can't have been easy to convert from book to script.They did get in most of what was necessary and throughout the film managed to get across Harry's frustration at Dumbledore's ignoring him without really resorting to verbal explanation (if that makes sense...).<br/><br/>As the movie progressed this got better, but one thing that initially bothered me was that the performances, particularly those of the three 'heroes' were ever-so-slightly wooden. This is most obvious when Harry is upset with Ron and Hermione at Grimmauld Place because they haven't told him anything about what they were doing; when Fred and George Apparate in the room, they imply that Harry had been yelling, but he clearly wasn't. It's disappointing to think Daniel Radcliffe wouldn't have thought of this himself and just chose to speak in a more tense, subdued way than is implied in the script. But maybe I'm nit-picking.<br/><br/>Of the three really new characters - Dolores Umbridge, Luna Lovegood, and Bellatrix Lestrange - I think the most successful was Luna. Umbridge was fantastic, perfectly twisted beneath a facade of sweetness. Bellatrix too was great, vicious and clearly a raving lunatic. Luna, however, was a character that could so easily have been disastrous. The actress in the role was perfect, just perfect; I don't think they could have found anyone better. The character was clearly very out-there, but in a solid, matter-of-fact way; the fact that the character accepts the unusual without making it a big deal comes across beautifully. She was adorable, very likable, and the best Luna I could have hoped for.<br/><br/>While not all of the story's elements made it into the movie, the most important bits did. I also liked how the influence of the press on Harry's life at this time is not made a big deal of nor mentioned too often, but the press clippings and headlines serve to update or clarify the story in some parts and also make the press a bigger part of the story. It was an elegant way of going about it, especially when there are time constraints to worry about.<br/><br/>There were some plot bits that were acknowledged, but the development was woefully thin, including Fred and George's ambitions outside of school (the Skiving Snackboxes are featured, but no one explains what they are or what Fred and George aim to do with them) and the relationship between Harry and Cho (it got off to a good start and just...disappeared, with little explanation). Although it's not totally necessary to the plot, I was a little upset that the bit about Ron and Hermione becoming school prefects was totally non-existent. Of course, this is a huge fan of the books speaking; I understand completely that not everything was going to end up on screen.<br/><br/>As a side note, and I didn't think about it before or while watching the movie, but if I recall, there was a complete lack of Quidditch in this movie, which means there was a complete lack of Ron Keeping for Gryffindor, which I was looking forward to. Personally, I don't really care though; there's only so much you can do with it on film. Chances are it would have disrupted the story considerably and gotten a little boring after 5 seconds. We've had enough Quidditch with the first three movies, and we'll see what they do with the sixth. (I'll say no more here in case someone's not read it.) One of the bits that I liked most was at the end when Voldemort sort of pseudo-possesses Harry in the Department of Mysteries. Since the plot-point of Harry being at risk of Voldemort wasn't as important as in the book, that really brought it together, along with Harry lines concerning Voldemort's inability to love or care about anyone. It really brought forward a very important point well but without using up too much film time. It was also simply a seriously cool bit of movie sceneage. It was neat; what more could you want in a piece of entertainment? Also, as far as script-writing goes, I had been worried about Dumbledore's explanation at the end of why he didn't talk to Harry all year. In the book it took a long time for him to tell him, several pages spent on one subject. That's perfectly fine in writing, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't work as well on film. A couple of sentences though, and BOOM. Basically the whole thing was summarized quite nicely and very quickly. Again, as with the Daily Prophet headlines, it further the plot's ideas without having to overly rush it to fit the time constraints or spending more time than is necessary.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very impressed and quite pleased. The movie was faithful to the book while still both remaining its own art and deviating carefully where it was needed. Film is a very different medium from a book, and is dealt with differently. When translating from one to the other, things can happens, messes ensue, and afterward complaints. I don't have many, and the ones I do are small, personal, nit-picky things. I enjoyed the movie, I really did. Quite frankly, that's what I look for in a movie, and that's what I got."
"realbigchill","9","0","1","12 July 2007"," Best Potter flick yet - an improvement on the novel!
","It takes something special to condense an excellent 800+ page novel into an even better, sub-three hour movie - and Order of the Phoenix is something very special indeed. The best Potter film so far, this has class acting (as many have already noted, the fresh casting of Staunton, Bonham Carter and Lynch is spot-on), plenty of action and top-drawer special effects, all carrying a complex and thoughtful story. As much about teen angst and coming-of-age as a critique of the education system, it has both intellectual depth alongside its exciting, fast-paced plot. As a long time fan of all things Potter - see you at the midnight launch of Deathly Hallows, too, folks! - I'm delighted to say that this movie has topped them all. Some of the characters, like Kreacher and Bellatrix, seem to have only the bare minimum of screen time - but you have to put this into the context of an entire series of films. You can't expect everything to tie up and make sense by the time the credits roll on this one!<br/><br/>If there are any flaws, the film might have benefited from a little more characterisation - something feels unfinished between Harry and Cho, considering the length of time spent on ""that"" kiss - but in a 2hr 30min time-frame, you can't spend too much time on reflection and lingering close-ups illustrating the characters' emotions (this isn't a Peter Jackson film, after all...)<br/><br/>Some critics have slated the new team of director, composer and screenwriter. Potter fans, worry ye not: the writing is faithful to the book (almost all of the dialogue is lifted from Rowling's original), the score is very different, but just as brilliant as Williams' and Doyle's interpretations, and Yates directs the action with a deft and stylish hand.<br/><br/>Let's hope ""Phoenix"" gets some of the Oscar attention it surely deserves. My tips: Staunton for Supporting Actress, and something for special effects or adaptation would be fitting, too.<br/><br/>Roll on ""Half Blood Prince""!"
"iDontSleep-iDream","7","0","1","12 July 2007"," Harry Grows And Doubts
","I did not read this book, I know, you hate me. But I can review on the movie on a sole-movie-based-point-of-view. It was good. Because I knew it was sort of a bridge book, I didn't expect too much action, not like the last one, at least. <br/><br/>Harry in this one was pissy. He wonders at one point if he is evil, and my friend turned to me to whisper, 'he's not evil, he's a teenage boy'. That's a pretty good idea of what this movie is. It's about a teenage boy charged with saving the world and his own doubts on whether or not he can do it- if he'll let anyone in to help him. In this movie Harry is not the young hero he was in the first or second, or even the premature teen trying to save Hogwarts like he was in the third or forth. In this movie Harry begins to grow up, which means he has his doubts. This movie focused more on how he was going to get through it all. Oh, and that infamous kiss scene.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it was worthwhile, even if you haven't read all the books. (It was a heackuva lot better than Pirates 3, and I'll bet you saw THAT if you're from ten to twenty-five.)<br/><br/>Good movie, good plot, thanks J.K. R."

","I am of course a big fan of the Harry Potter books, and as usual I am often disappointed by the adaptations of the novels to the movie screen.<br/><br/>However, my faith in the Potter movies was revived after seeing the Order of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>With all round brilliant acting from the cast, except for Daniel not being nearly as angry and emotional as his character should have been, the film proved to be the best in the series so far, in my opinion. Bellatrix was simply amazing, Tonks too, and Luna left me with my mouth hanging open due to her amazingly eccentric essence being captured perfectly by Evanna Lynch.<br/><br/>Every important part was saved and left in tact, and only little changes were made to save time (some of which were rather amusing yet exasperating I must say). I feel a wonderful job has been done to please fans of the books by turning one of the longest books of the series into one of the best movies so far.<br/><br/>Everything in the movie still felt pretty fast, with no time to ""stop and think"", if you will, but that is a feeling I've got used to with Potter films. On the plus side it was slightly slower than the Goblet of Fire movie, which adds to it slightly.<br/><br/>As usual, the sky high budget made sure the effects were still amazingly brilliant. Fred and George's firework fiasco was simply amazing, Grawp was great and the DA's sessions were true to keep the feeling of rebellion in the film.<br/><br/>So, overall, the film was one of the best, if not the best, of the Harry Potter movies so far. I'm sure I would have cried when Sirius was killed, if it hadn't of meant my social status being sacrificed, but the feeling was chilling nonetheless.<br/><br/>8/10."
"RabbitFighter","9","0","1","12 July 2007"," great movie, closer in spirit to the books
","The fifth installment in the Harry Potter movies is a satisfying retelling of it's book counterpart. What most impressed me was just how much the cast has grown as actors. All of the main characters have improved dramatically and the newcomers, such as Beatrice Lestrange, were all well chosen for their roles. There is also enough new content to hold the interest of those who have read the book many times over. The new content also succeeds in advancing the story and filling in holes created by missing story elements (elements that were present in the books). I was also really impressed with the way the movie treats the character of Dolores Umbridge, I was nervous that she would appear too silly in the movie, but she is really well done. All in all, my favorite Harry Potter movie so far!"
"coolcrystalcatz","8","0","1","12 July 2007"," Pretty good
","For anyone watches the movies but doesn't read the books, you'll be a little confused at times, such as when Tonks is changing her nose, because it's not explained at all. And I was a little disappointed to see that they had cut out the St.Mungo scene that I was so looking forward to seeing. I understand that a lot of scenes needed to be cut out, but the fact that somehow this was made into the shortest HP movie yet is beyond me, especially considering how OOTP is the longest book in the HP series. There were also a loose end in this film that didn't get tied, such as the Harry/Cho drama. We find out that Cho betrayed the DA, but then we find out that she was under the influence of Veritaserum, so it wasn't her fault at all, but we don't see Harry trying to make up with Cho after he finds out about this. Maybe he will do this in the next film, but I highly doubt it. On the plus side of this whole film, I really haven't laughed this much in this film as much as the others. It really funny at times, but not so much that it sugar coats the darkness of the film. The acting was amazing, even though I think Hermione and Ron should have played a more active role in this movie, and even the actor who plays Dumbledor is less...tense is the only word I can use to describe his acting in the previous film (i.e the yelling and scowling). Overall, this movie wasn't bad, it was certainly better than GOF, but they shouldn't have cut so much from the book."
"Skeetz81","8","0","2","12 July 2007"," Another Great Potter Film!
","Loved it! I am a die hard Harry Potter fan and therefore do not mind anything they cut out. People have to realize JK Rowling is very involved in the movie making. The director was going to cut something, but Rowling advised him not to because of the significance of this character in a future movie. So in my mind if it was cut it's not a big deal. Plus, it's the fifth movie so by now you should have read the books.<br/><br/>The kids have grown into mature actors. The girl who plays Luna is perfect; she is exactly how I imagined her to be. Daniel's acting really pulls the strings at your heart. Tension between Hermione and Ron is as strong as ever! Imelda makes you hate Umbridge the minute she appears. The special effects were WONDERFUL! It's hard to put into words my feelings for the movie because in my mind it was so well done. I knew the fifth book, being 900 pages, would be hard to make into a movie. David Yates, you did a wonderful job!"
"three_am","6","0","5","12 July 2007"," Not fantastic enough to see a second time
","Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is my second favorite book after the third book (Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban). I don't know; it could be that the movie experience was horrible in the theater. The film had problems starting. We got through the previews, and then there was a 15 minute lag. The last hour of the movie was interrupted with the screen being in half and the roll just dying out. Theater personnel had to fix the film twice. The whole experience left me sour. That being said, the story itself felt very rushed.<br/><br/>The creators had so much material to work with to deliver a great film but they fell short. Like Goblet of Fire, events and exposition of said events were truncated to advance the plot. The transitions to get through the plot were not chosen well. You knew when every scene was done and we were on to the next one. I hate this. There was nothing smooth about this, I was waiting to get in the groove of the story but every scene was too jarring. If I didn't read the book, I would have been very confused and bored. Although I did enjoy certain aspects of the movie, like the portrayals of Umbridge, Luna, Luscious Malfoy, the House of Black, Bellatrix, the Weasley twins and key moments like the D.A. lessons the elements were not satisfying enough to make up for the horrible editing.<br/><br/>The movie moved too fast to showcase action scenes. More thought should have been given to the script writing especially for the beginning and ending of the book. In the book, Harry is so angry in the beginning of the story and at the end he is a mess of fury and grief and there is a clear feeling of dread for our hero, which is what makes the story so compelling. I'm disappointed this does not play that way in the movie.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch this more than once in the theater but its not great enough to see again."
"anon1mat0","7","0","2","11 July 2007"," Entertaining but fails the book
","I just went to watch the latest Harry Potter installment with my son. To start with the end (in more than one sense) my son was almost fuming at it. Having read the whole thing a few (several?) times he was very mindful of all the things that changed from the book, but the ending is what upset him the most and from then I started thinking on the whole ordeal. Saying that a movie wasn't faithful to a book is normally stating the obvious and in this case while the main events from the book are there a good part of the spirit of the book died at the hands of the script writer and the director. Don't get me wrong I don't think the movie was a disaster (like that pathetic attempt of a movie called Eragon) but all the teen angst that overflows the 5th book is almost completely absent; is like the anger of a 15 y/o had been shrunk to a 9 y/o's size, and to complete the coup the very last scene is so cheesy that seems copied from a 80's TV series. The book is dark and the movie barely tries, which is perhaps what upset my son so much more than the scissors that made the 2'18"" movie possible.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the movie is technically well crafted and quite entertaining. Imelda Stauton does a great job as Dolores Umbridge forcing you to hate her from the very first time you see her on the movie. The combat at the ministry is visually well done although it doesn't fully show the hectic scene portrayed in the book. All in all it would seem that someone tried to make the movie PG (and failed BTW) and in the process the story loses some of its potency. Pity."
"Jizzmopper87","7","0","2","11 July 2007"," Potter or Plotter?
","First, let us look at the good. The movie had some unique aspects. The use of The Daily Prophet in the spinning newspaper reminiscent of earlier film making is really cool. The final action scene is extremely well done. I believe that Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe give much improved performances along with other members of the supporting cast. When I say Rupert Grint's performance is improved, I mean that I found him completely believable as the best friend. Emma Watson had a few good moments and well delivered lines, but I think she is still lagging behind the others. Editing was very well done and just when the movie started to talk too much, it would cut. Special Effects gets an A+. Basically, as a movie this one stands in the ranks of the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and even The Sorcerers Stone (which I appreciate for capturing the book very well and really starting the movies off on a good foot).<br/><br/>My problem is that the movie does not do justice to the longest book of the series. It's also the shortest movie. I know that when they write the script they talk to J.K. Rowling to make sure she approves; thus the movie should work out to hold all the necessary components to make sure all the relationships and intricacies are in place so the movies will make sense independently from the books. Therefore, I am not worried that the movie cut out all the important stuff; I'm upset that it has only the important stuff. Umbridge's tyranny is represented my Mr. Filch hanging decrees on the wall; meanwhile, Dumbledore's Army is going along cheerily. Harry went through a lot of personal pain going through the book, but he is cheated out of the pain in this movie. It pops up a few times, but it seems random and inconsistent with the rest of the movie. In the scene when Sirius dies, they muted the Harry's screams, a trend that is growing in modern film making that I like, but disliked in this film.<br/><br/>I am afraid of ranting too much, so I will stop. I'll just say this for those who haven't seen the movie: I'm sorry for the spoiler; I give the movie a 7 for having the razzle of an epic, but missing the dazzle of the HP world."
"jadzia98","6","0","2","11 July 2007"," Good wiz-bang action, but short on chemistry
","I commend the director, David Yates, for managing to somehow cram in the salient points from a 900+ page book into a two hour and fifteen minute movie. However, like the previous director of the GOF flick, he also severely underdeveloped several of the supporting characters - and totally butchered the much-ballyhooed budding romance between Harry and Cho. Katie Leung had one? two? lines in GOF. She had about the same amount of dialogue in this movie (shooting the occasional goo-goo eyes at Harry does NOT count!)<br/><br/>Imelda Staunton did well as the sweetly sinister Umbridge, but wasn't given enough to do. She had one good verbal exchange with Harry, and a far weaker one with McGonagall. In the book, she was the one responsible for the dementor attack on Harry, but that point was never revealed in the movie.<br/><br/>Newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna was one of the movie's highlights. She was given a considerably meatier role than most of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The complete lack of Quidditch in the movie also irked me. That was one of the central story lines in the book. Granted, some things are going to get cut from such a long book, but Quidditch certainly shouldn't have been one of them. That was the one thing Umbridge kept dangling over Harry's head, and also played in a big part of developing Ron's (and Ginny's) character as well.<br/><br/>I also think that Harry should have had his conversation about being ""possessed"" by Voldemort with Ginny (as he did in the book) and not with Sirius.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a step above its predecessor, but not by much. It's squarely aimed at the current Potter fans, but with ""Deathly Hallows"" right around the corner, OotP isn't going to grab their attention for long."

Up until today, the Harry Potter series was the only one that I could watch the movie adaptations of the book, but this one did not do the book justice as far as I'm concerned. The biggest thing that bothered me was how much was left out. It felt like just a paraphrase of the book. What made this even worse was that it wasn't necessarily a matter of time constraints, because this one was shorter than the rest. Also, a lot of the funny parts were left out. I know that the tone was supposed to be darker, but there could have been some parts to lighten it a little bit. There wasn't even any quidditch in this one! Another thing that i noticed (this is almost totally random, but it's been bugging me since seeing the movie) is that in the underground station, the people are spread out on the escalators. If someone isn't walking, they're supposed to keep to the right side so others can pass. Other than the parts that the film was missing, It was pretty enjoyable."

I didn't miss the Quidditch ( a lot of people here are complaining about that) but I did miss the Swamp and Snape's History.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a darker, more adult film.

We went a little lighter again with Goblet - the worst film in the franchise for killing off plot and being a 'montage' type film.<br/><br/>Coming from Goblet, I had low expectations.

Harry is one ball of angst and hormones - but then, he *is* a sixteen year old boy.<br/><br/>One problem was the lack of continuity between the films in regard to dress and wizard culture.

","he film seems to come from an angle that wishes to allow the viewer unfamiliar with Harry's tribulations through his fifth year at Hogwart's to catch on and enjoy the over-the-top, action riddled film. Simultaneously it is designed to give special winks and nods to the, probably larger, demographic of viewers who are familiar with the novels and are forced to accept that films, inherently, must negate some of the smaller plot lines of the book in order to be successful. <br/><br/>New director to the Potter series, David Yates, seems to enhance the growing sensation of darkness in the films. Even more so than the Alfonso Cuaton directed 'Prisoner of Azkaban."" The film works as most of the series does: loads of suspense, long action sequences where the 'good' do battle with the 'evil,' and slightly nauseating emotive sequences in which Harry falls in love and gets Connor Oberst angsty with Dumbledore. <br/><br/>The film is fun. It's a great summer blockbuster film, don't expect anything new from the series, it's the old tricks in new settings, but this is the best blockbuster film to come out this year. What is interesting to note is the maturation of the direction of these films. The more intricate and brooding plot lines have allowed the film to be shot a little hazier, straying a little from the well worn formulas of filming action. It feels less and less like a young adults film and more like a Terry Gilliam film sans sex and drugs."

This movie is very fast paced and with the new fresh faces with Umbridge, Tonks and Luna, who in my opinion steal the show, Umbridge with her evil disposition of course.<br/><br/>Sadly this movie lacks some mere moments as the Weasly's boys departure from the school a mild fireworks show, in which could of spent at least a couple more minutes or even a swamp, or more explaining at the near end for Harry and Dumbledore, and the lack of scenes between Harry and Sirius.<br/><br/>Still with all of those moments far behind, and me not focusing on the books, the movie overall wasn't that bad. Here is to hoping the DVD includes at least a half hour of deleted scenes or more. And being thankful that the video games for this will live up to the hype."

","I was very disappointed with this movie. I haven't read the book since it first came out so I'm not exactly sure how much was missing but either way this movie left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The books are long and major chunks have to be taken out to fit as much as possible in but this movie had the strange feeling of being stretched out. There were times when even the characters seemed to be talking in slow motion. There should have been more jammed into this especially scenes with Snape and Harry. Those occlumency lessons were some of my favorite 'scenes' in the entire series of books so for it to whiz by the way it did when other scenes dragged on is very strange, especially since the movie could have been and probably should have been longer. And what was there you could barely see. It was soooooooo dark. I have no problem with dark and atmospheric films but this was dark just for the sake of being dark. Hogwarts even looked dingy and in need of a wash. I'm guessing that they hired a little known director that they could bully into making a truncated and ugly film, because he's just be happy to have the job. I'm guessing they told him to make it dark so that they could fudge the special effects. It's not just a case of being spoiled by the previous directors because, in my opinion, this was bad even for a newbie director.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty bad from almost everyone, save Staunton and perhaps Radcliffe. And honestly this party didn't get started until you-know-who showed up and you can guess when that was. So basically this movie had a killer ten minutes. But that's it. The one thing that improved from the book was the death of one of the characters. Because in the book it's kinda confusing and the way it was handled here, through special effects, made it more definite. In fact I guess I'm left with the feeling that this movie was made more as a set up for the next film, instead of as a stand alone film. <br/><br/>I fear for the next film, and what's worse is that I didn't enjoy the events of Half Blood Prince. So enjoying the book for Order of the Phoenix so much and having the movie turn out this way doesn't bode well. I don't know if kids will like it. They've read the book and depending on how they feel about the omissions might make all the difference. The parents who go with them might be confused and bored. I saw way to many cell phones being used to check the time. But there was one funny moment in my theater. When Fudge finally admits that someone is back the whole crowd said ""Duh!"" in unison.<br/><br/>I mean you're going to see it, everyone will, just don't expect it to be as good as the last two."

","Watching young actors grow up during a very successful franchise is enjoyable to watch I think. Not only are they maturing physically, but you can tell at times that their acting is maturing as well. And although these kids have been doing it for six years, it seems as though they're still having fun with the characters they play. The same goes for the older generation of actors, but instead of growing up, they're the ""type-casting"" game. With two movies left to go and all three of the main children signed up to film them, will the older actors sign as well? Or will they decide to move onto something new before they're forever known as Severus Snape or Minerva McGonagall? Having said that, I believe the characters are pretty much the only interesting part about the film itself. The film moves slow at first, but picks up near the middle when all the pieces begin to come together. Unfortunately, the puzzle doesn't seem quite finished when all is said and done. However, it is only the fifth film in the series of seven and it begins to look more like the beginning of a trilogy than septilogy (yes, that's a series of seven), so pieces are left out to be explained in the next film and, hopefully, wrapped completely by the end of movie number seven.<br/><br/>What's nice about the Harry Potter franchise is that it drops you in right at the beginning assuming you've seen the previous films, so they don't have to explain what has previously happened. The transitions, though, seem choppy and you are sometimes forced to understand how characters get from one place to another with no explanation from the script. The pace itself though, was nice and I don't think there was ever a scene that didn't interrupt the story's flow. David Yates, first time director to the series and first blockbuster, brought an interesting take to the film. With very little close-ups and panoramic visions, Yates continues to stabilize what the previous directors had already established.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is a nice segue into what is leading up to a certain, and possibly extraordinary, finale. In these next two films, I'm sure ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"" will prove a worthy adversary for our main protagonists, but for now, we, as the audience, will need to see them mature enough to be able to carry the story the rest of the way.<br/><br/>Review by Glenn D.

"makisupa388","8","0","3","11 July 2007"," The best Harry Potter film yet.
","I've been reading some pretty exaggerated, ranting, angry reviews about this film and it's making me frustrated. I just went to see HP5 last night at midnight and I was more than pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge, huge fan of the books, the 5th and 6th books being my favorites, so I was very skeptical about how Yates would fit the biggest Potter book (864 pages) into a two hour movie. I almost wondered if I should go see the movie at all, since past HP movies have ruined the image of the books in my head. I've been pretty indifferent to the past movies; I thought the first two were good adaptations of the books but still only mediocre. I remember seeing Prisoner of Azkaban opening night and walking out EXTREMELY disappointed, and the Goblet of Fire was only OK in my opinion. After seeing Order of the Phoenix, however, I was relieved. Yates does an excellent job fitting the majority of the story into a mere two hours, leaving out only minor story lines or scenes from the book, which is to be expected. The three main child actors (Harry, Ron, Hermione) did much better in this film. I remember one of the things that made me angry in the 4th movie was how Hermione acted like a 30 year old biotch and over-acted almost all the time. I thought Dumbledore was much better in this film as well, I thought in the 4th movie he was a bit out of character, frequently getting angry and yelling at Harry. All in all this was by far my favorite Potter film yet and I highly suggest seeing it to anyone who reads this and who is a fan. I think it's important to realize that if you are a true HP fan, the movies will never compare to the magic of reading the books, so go into the movie with an open mind and you'll be very satisfied. Luckily Yates is already signed on to direct Half Blood Prince."
"Abhit","Null","0","1","11 July 2007"," The Perfect Adaptation for the Ultimate Harry Potter Fan
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is much different than its predecessors, in that the true message of the books plays a significant role in this particular movie. The Harry Potter book series is about tolerance, friendship, and love, and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg has done a far better job than Steve Kloves has ever done in incorporating this message into the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects are spectacular, of course, but there's the perfect balance between action and dialogue in this film, so the action does not distract from the message of the movie. Imelda Staunton portraying Professor Umbridge steals the movie, in my opinion, because she plays her character so well. The acting throughout this movie is far superior, from every cast member, and the effect it has on the film is evident. Much improved acting from Daniel Radcliffe also helps to make this film what it is--in my opinion, the best Harry Potter film yet for the Harry Potter fan.<br/><br/>Also, some have claimed they dislike this movie because it's not the same as the book. But I must disagree with them; movies should be judged independently of the books on which they're based, because, after all, the book is nearly 900 pages and adapting everything is impossible. Instead, the film uses its time extremely wisely, and because the message of the movie is the same as the message of the books, I have no problems with it. Another positive aspect of the film is that, unlike the previous films, this film did not seem rushed at all, but rather smooth and easy to follow. This movie pleases both the hardcore fans like myself and those unfamiliar with the Harry Potter series."
"idlewild_berry","8","0","1","11 July 2007"," The same, yet refreshingly different.
","I went to the cinemas today with the lowest expectation and surprisingly, I found myself LOVING EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of OOTP. I guess it's because out of all the directors(Columbus, Cuaron and Newell), Yate's approach towards the book/movie appealed to me the most and I find his direction the most interesting yet.<br/><br/>The palette for OOTP is unlike its prequels. The first three movies were pretty bright and although GOF had dark, bluish shades, OOTP primary colours are even darker.<br/><br/>OOTP really depicts Harry as a social outcast. There were many instances throughout the movie whereby one can really feel how Harry is ""marked"" as the one. Whilst Ron and Hermione are both in vibrant striped clothing throughout in OOTP, Harry is usually dressed in the darker shades. Besides that, there are also several scenes in the movie where everyone looked like they belong to a family but Harry on the other hand is all alone.<br/><br/>Let me just start by saying that is is hard for the younger cast to obviously show the same exact expressions and emotions as the characters in the books but they were bearable to say the least.<br/><br/>Accolades however should be given to Daniel Radcliffe for his earnest portrayal of Harry in OOTP, a marked improvement from POA. Harry has never before been portrayed so vulnerable and afraid. Harry was in denial and was afraid to open up, seek love and accept help for fear of rejection and disappointment. The movie really centered on Harry's inner war which truly is the heart of OOTP.<br/><br/>Enough about Harry then. Evanna Lynch is ethereal and gives her character an eerie calmness that seems both admirably stunning and unsettling at the same time. Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley also has some shinning moments mainly involving the ""Reducto"" spell. Matthew Lewis was also stellar as Neville Longbottom although I really wished that they had included the scene when Neville meet his parents in St.Mungos. All this is of course at the expense of Ron and Hermione but I'm more than happy to avoid the constant bickering between the both of them. After all, Harry Potter is not about the pairings but Harry himself. However, the interaction between the trio also seemed more natural this time around.<br/><br/>Adding to this is the fine cream of British veteran actors who are absolutely superb and spot-on as usual, including the much welcomed return of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Jason Issac, Ralph Fiennes and Michael Gambon.<br/><br/>Not forgetting Imelda Stauton who plays Dolores Umbridge which such vindication and Helena Bonham Carter as the delirious but hugely entertaining Bellatrix Lestrange.<br/><br/>Overall, despite some pretty major changes story OOTP is moodier and darker than its previous installments. It ticks with interesting psychological darkness and compelling themes."

","I am a huge fan of the books, but to me, the Harry Potter movies have always been a bit of a let down. I see most people are giving it outstanding reviews, so i figured id make a review on the other side of the coin. I realize they cant make a 5 hour movie, but they should have taken out some of the made up scenes and add in more of the important details. I felt, as i have felt in all the other movies, that this one was bare. It went from main point to main point, missing out on a lot of the details that make this series so great. As for the acting, I do believe that Emma and Rupert should have bigger roles. I know that the mood is suppose to get darker and more desperate, but I think Daniel overplayed his role a bit and ended up sounding too winy. Special effects were great, music score was great, but it just didn't meet my expectations. 3 out of 5 stars"

","Harry Potter series is quite popular for teenagers and adults too. It became live-action which is great. The first movie, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone, is not very good as the fantasy is quite mild but as the series go on, from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating, it is getting more darker. This movie is the newest Harry Potter movie, passing on to the fifth year for Harry Potter in Hogwarts and Voldemort is back, finally gets to show magic powers. There too are new characters as for Dolores Umbridge, Bellatrix Lestrange, a new villain and Lunna Lovegood. With all these new characters, Harry Potter will have face more difficulties. Harry Potter movies are just the short version of the long-pages books. For me, I prefer to watch than reading long stories.<br/><br/>The movies are getting better, with more darker tone and more serious looks, this movie can never go wrong with teenagers and adults if they like dark movies. This will definitely have darker tone compared to the other Harry Potter movies. Then soon, as the series move on, it will be quite dark with different directors with different ideas. I will have to see how this go on.<br/><br/>It is not that bad, it is just a bit too short. There is not much action to it. Oh yeah, I forgot, Harry Potter is mainly a theme for frightening scenes not some big action. Well then, you can't expect some exploding things, if you want that, go and watch Transformers. Harry Potter proves to be more darker. Now, he loses his cool and shouts back, now he wants revenge. Harry Potter is growing up. It is not the timid boy you once knew. The last fight is disappointing. Once again, you are dealing with magic not big action.<br/><br/>You will probably get some shock if you watch it in cinema and also there is some suspense. So if your kids are afraid, don't bring them. You should know Harry Potter movies are increasingly dark."

","Weird Warning: if you get motion sickness easily, take some Dramamine before the movie. I was nauseous halfway in and actually covering my eyes for part of the ministry battle. I thought I would miss the ending while cleaning vomit off the theater floor. I am Very Sensitive to this sort of thing so don't worry about it if you could take more than ten minutes of Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>I've always seen the HP movies as a sort of supplement to the books. So for me, Order of the Phoenix was really exciting. It was the closest any of the movies has come to capturing exactly what I imagined since seeing Sorcerer's Stone messed up all the faces and places I had been well acquainted with in my head; it's visually true to description. We all have one scene we wish could have made the cut, and for me it's Harry going bonkers on Dumbledore's office after the final battle. Without this the movie ends just as abruptly and oddly happy as the shorter, younger, books. The pages and pages of caps lock we suffered through are much more exciting in movie form. Movie Dumbledore is still a bust. Nobody would put their faith in that scared old man. Order of the Phoenix was perhaps my least favorite book, yet it might become my favorite of the movies (beating out Prisoner of Azkaban). It brings back some of the magic we've been missing since the first book/movie. I had a great time watching it as a book fan and my friend next to me who hadn't read any of the series enjoyed it although he said it was hard to follow without the whole story. But what's better than actually being asked to fill in plot details from the book? Bring a non-reading friend!"
"skywalker_ep3","8","0","1","11 July 2007"," - Rank in no.3 in my list for favourite HP movie --
","mini review! I've just got back from watching the movie, and IMO it was a great Harry Potter film. It ranks in third place behind POA and GOF IMO.As you all know,It continues it trend to become a much more darker film than GOF and much more serious! Harry rarely cracked up a smile, but hey! It was needed in this film to match the dark story and the overall tone that this series is taking.<br/><br/>Pros: 1- The dark tone is handled well in this movie, kudos to Yates and his crew of wizards.<br/><br/>2- Sirius Black has more screen time here, and his presence is one of the best parts in this movie. His relationship with Harry is done very well and the chemistry between them is great.<br/><br/>3- Its good to see Lupin and Mad-Eye Moody return! Fighting the Death Eaters and stuff, but sadly there's little of them in here. Although its necessarily but I really want to see them more! One can hope! 4- The whole rebellion and the formation of Dumbledore Army is cool to watch. It builds up nicely. Wicked stuff.<br/><br/>5- Dolores Umbridge. I hated her but Imelda Staunton plays her very well! Watching her performance makes me really want to cast Stupefly at her. She's that good of being evil and corrupt.<br/><br/>6.Fred and George. Funny duo.<br/><br/>7- Snapes flashback. Harry's dad bullying Snape. No wonder Snape really hate Harry Potter! Cool stuff! 8. The climatic battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Mesemrizing to watch. Loud and exhilariting.<br/><br/>9. Well, it has a proper ending this time around. An ending that left me wanting to watch HBP. So this movie is basically a set up the other two movies to come.<br/><br/>Cons: 1- The music. It doesn't have many impact and some of them are forgettable. Whenever I think of any HP movies, POA for instance, I can easily recognize many of its memorable themes. Even when John Williams step out and Patrick Doyle step in for GOF, his musical score nearly matches the same level of William's in POA. Nicholas Hooper score is mediocre at best. It hurts the film magical moments.<br/><br/>2- Although I like the ending, but it felt rushed when getting there. They should stretch it out a bit so that it will have a longer satisfaction.<br/><br/>Well for the moment, that's all the negative aspects that I can think of. Again, its a great HP movie but I'm little less satisfied when leaving the theater. Maybe when HBP and DH comes out, it will make me appreciate OOTP much more. Only time will tell! *** out ****"

","I really thought that HP and the OotP was fantastic! The cast are a little more polished and it was the first time I've left an HP movie without feeling like something significant was left out - that is, this really did justice to the book.<br/><br/>All the ancillary characters really make a wonderful contribution to the overall story - not just one-liners here and there. Luna Lovegood's empathy for Harry's situation and the way in which she brings a lightness to the situation with her unusual perspective on life was a lovely touch, and certainly provided a sense of fun to what was undoubtedly the darkest HP movie yet.<br/><br/>10/10 from me."

","The definitive review is back! Yes folks, here we are again, and once again i have to tell the story in 2 parts. First for the people who have read the book and the people who will just go watch the movie, but never read the book.<br/><br/>First for the people who have read the book. This movie was made just about as good as you can make it. Phoenix is the largest book in the series, and possibly the most boring read of all the books. i think the movie would have been better had it been 20 minutes longer. the scene i most wanted to see was omitted which was the scene in the book involving neville and his parents in the hospital. but aside from that they pretty much crammed just about everything in by performing 2 lines from each character on each page.<br/><br/>For the people who just will watch the movie. The tempo was nice, but felt a little rushed. the set design was good, and it is good to see the actors improve a little more each movie. ( i am thinking still that Emma Watson is still the strongest actor of the trio) the interaction between the rest of the cast is nice, however all the adult actors roles have been limited to small bits and pieces, the kids pretty much have the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, as a movie it was a B-, as a book to movie translation i give it a B- as well."

","The fifth installment of Harry Potter is a fantastic piece of work that defines itself by breaking away from the first two movies in making a dim and almost depressing atmosphere. Accomplishing what 'The Goblet of Fire' attempts at, this film adds action to a fast paced movie that is almost sure to please any Harry Potter fan. Being a fan of the novels as well, I was displeased to see many things either completely neglected or details changed around. If you are a nitpicker of movies and love to point out the differences then I advise you to either wait until the DVD comes out or bite your tongue as this movie is filled with plot changes. The most obvious of which is the downfall in the relationship between Cho and Harry. The casting was, in my opinion, well placed and seeing Luna Lovegood and Dolores Umbridge played out on the big screen was well done. Much like the book, the viewer actually feels a seething loathing for Professor Umbridge and, while she may be odd, feel a sort of awkward love for Ms. Lovegood. Overall, I would rate this film an eight out of ten. While there were things I would have loved to have seen, I do feel that this film has lived up to its word in producing an overall sensation and getting fans like myself properly hyped up for the seventh and final"
