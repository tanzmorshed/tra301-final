","By sheer coincidence, just two nights prior to the debut of 'Behind the Candelabra', I had the pleasure of viewing one of my favorite films, 1965's 'The Loved One', in which Liberace played 'Mr.Starker', a casket salesman. So it was with Liberace's voice, image and mannerisms fresh in my mind that I encountered Michael Douglas' portrayal of the man and boy, did he nail it.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty much by the numbers with the kind of shorthand one expects from a TV movie bio; it's the performances that bring this to a certain level of greatness. Douglas all but disappears into the role, right from the start. It's truly an amazing thing to watch, and considering the subject, a brave and unapologetic performance. Matt Damon is equally impressive and while I have no idea if he does the real Scott Thorson justice, his transformation from an eager and innocent young man to a jaded, coked-up and surgically altered paranoid boy-toy is stark and convincing. Add to these chameleon-like performances an unrecognizable Debbie Reynolds and a truly unnerving Rob Lowe and you have two hours of truly compelling, master-class performances.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"PlatoSays","7","40","46","13 June 2013"," Damon and Douglas are superbly good
","For a film about a gay relationship - I had my doubts when I discovered the two male leads were to be played by straight men, but I couldn't be more convinced by their on-screen personas.<br/><br/>The kitch was eye-wateringly OTT, Douglas superbly needy yet controlling and Damon sucked into the whole charade. Rob Lowe's performance had me recoiling with his creepiness/plastic surgery face and it couldn't be farther from his more mainstream performances. For a role that appeared for only a few minutes - it stuck with me long after the film was over.<br/><br/>All in all, a very solid biopic film that unfortunately won't be Oscared as its been shown as TV movie in the USA. A great shame - Douglas and Damon deserve nominations - their *chemistry* is totally believable.<br/><br/>Final point - either Douglas is a superb pianist or the CGI of his hands on the keyboard is first rate!"
"ArminCallo-PalmSprings","8","89","108","26 May 2013"," Point and Counter Point: Liberace's Life In Front Of and Behind the Candelabra
","Behind the Candelabra is not a biopic. Although the story revolves around the life of Liberace, the film is more than that. It is a love story that encompasses universal themes with a surrealistic twist. <br/><br/>It is well crafted by Steven Soderbergh, a veteran director with such films as Traffic, Erin Brockovich and Ocean's Eleven under his belt. And although Soderbergh describes the work as ""Alice going down the rabbit hole,"" it is a surprisingly strong film with convincing performances and a tender, yet out-of-the-box, point of view.<br/><br/>Two of Hollywood's big-name alpha males – Michael Douglas and Matt Damon – play the lead roles delivering strong and convincing performances. It would have been easy to portray the over-the-top flamboyance of Liberace in high camp theatricality. But not here. Douglas is restrained, measured, and deliberate. His Liberace straddles both sides of the male persona. Douglas goes from being tender lover and father-protector to the excessive, power-hungry controlling tyrant driven to an addiction for acquisition: homes, jewelry, dogs, new lovers, and all things Louis Quinze. <br/><br/>Damon's Thorson is both a quintessential 70s male hooker and passive disco diva. All through the film, he is dazed and awestruck by his surroundings. As Liberace's latest boy-toy, he basks in the glow of rococo excess. And he is bewildered and confused when Liberace -- moving on to the next conquest – tragically, and predictably, takes everything away. Always, Thorson seems to be a man to whom things happen. He is not a figure who takes control of his surroundings but rather is controlled by them. This passivity is quite surprising in as much as the movie is based on a book written by Thorson who is hell-bent on casting himself in the best possible light. <br/><br/>In contrast to the one-sided take of Thorson's book, Soderbergh's film provides Thorson with depth and dimension. He is more than a victim. He actively plays into his victimhood. Soderberg shows Thorson as actively doing nothing to improve his life or circumstance. Instead of taking full advantage of his relationship with Liberace, Thorson lives in, and for, the moment. He piddles away the opportunity to make something of himself beyond the rentboy persona. It brings new meaning to the old Freddy Fender song ""Wasted days and wasted nights."" At the end, all he ends up with is another diet, addiction, a new face and a paltry $95K.<br/><br/>The supporting cast members are equally effective as the leads. The standout here is, unquestionably, Rob Lowe as Liberace's plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz. His face is wonderfully plastic and his acting sublime. Scott Bakula is Liberace's mustachioed procurer; Dan Aykroyd is his Foster-Grant-wearing manager/henchman; and Debbie Reynolds is Liberace's prosthesized-up-the-ying-yang Polish mother. All submit strong performances despite brief appearances in almost cameo roles. None of the supporting actors distracts from the focus on the two tragic lovers whose end comes as expectedly as any Shakespearean tragedy. <br/><br/>To convey that 70s and early 80s look and feel, Soderberg seems to have used old-fashioned film in lieu of going ""straight"" digital. The movie is bracketed by what appears as grainy home movies. It opens with the LA bar scene and 17-year-old Thorson at his outlying rural foster home. It ends with the melodramatic flourish of Liberace's death in Palm Springs and the resulting saga over the Riverside County coroner's attempts to autopsy the body despite the family's efforts to keep his AIDS-related cause of death from public view. The conflict is told via newsreel storytelling straight out of Orson Well's Citizen Kane. <br/><br/>In between, we are taken on a trip to wonderland. Like riding in a monorail, we are shuttled between houses in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Palm Springs. We enter rooms upon rooms replete with white painted pianos, crystal chandeliers and gold-gilt furniture. The journey is a magical mystery tour into a bizarre world inhabited by two larger than life figures beset with very ordinary problems. Like everyone else, they face issues of money and power; attraction and rejection; youth and old age; addiction and dysfunction; life and death. And weaving through it all, is the all-too-common story of ""the next new thing; the next big fix."" I guess in the end, the grass is always greener on the other side. And what we have is never enough.<br/><br/>Soderberg weaves a morality tale where choices have consequences and people get exactly what they deserve. In this movie, the consequences are cruel but quite sober and sensible. There are neither suicides nor any type of saccharine sentimentality. And while the pathos could be deliciously comedic – especially on a story about the avatar of kitsch when punctuated with high camp – Soderbergh is refreshingly restrained. He tells his story with a firm grip and a cautioned mannerism.<br/><br/>On stage – and in front of the candelabra – Liberace lived a life of champagne wishes and caviar dreams. But behind the glitz and the glamour, we glimpse the flawed, all-too-human and imperfect everyman who is uncomfortable in his skin, seeking miracles from plastic surgery and sexual hedonism. He is not a hero or anti-hero; victim or victimizer; predator or prey. He is all and neither. Liberace's life is heroic because he was able to achieve much despite the odds. But his real life was lived in darkness cast by the shadow of the lights behind the candelabra."
"StevePulaski","9","80","97","26 May 2013"," The enigma is overpowering me
","I would not want to be the person shopping around a serious script in Hollywood about the life of the famous pianist Liberace. It would be the toughest of sells to a culture that would likely feel the material is too dry and the demand too little. A slightly campier script, with luxurious set design and intimate portrayals of characters the public wouldn't likely know about is what I'd like to get my hands on. The story of Liberace is stranger than fiction and dryer, more serious material could've corrupted its overall goals and ambitions.<br/><br/>The film with the campier script, luxurious set designs, and intimate portrayals is Steven Soderbergh's Behind the Candelabra, a wonderful, limitless look at the life of Liberace, an enigma in every sense of the word. In addition to playing many sold-out shows, the man had a lovelife like no other at the time, meeting and becoming fast friends with Scott Thorson, an aspiring veterinarian who was quickly made his lover. Thorson seemed to have a genuine understanding of the loneliness and lack of friendship Liberace had and provided him with great talks, great compassion, and great sex.<br/><br/>The relationship, however, resulted in drug addiction, intense plastic surgery, lies, mistrust, and ended with a lawsuit. Soderbergh and writer Richard LaGravenese don't hesitate to explore this and make it one of the deepest focuses in the picture. The relationships the men had had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. The scenes when they are together in a hot tub are human and romantic. The scenes when they are fighting are heartbreaking because you realize that these men haven't just come so far to make their relationship work but losing each other after so long would be detrimental to their self-esteems and egos. They complete each other and that's where the magic is at its strongest.<br/><br/>Liberace is played by Michael Douglas in one of the bravest roles of his career. So brave and powerful that it's unfortunate that because of the film's TV movie status it is ineligible for an Academy Award nomination. Douglas is an actor who is never conventional with his role choice. The same man who played a common-man pushed off a cliff of sanity, an executive victim to a consuming, real-life game, and a worried father of a drug-addicted daughter is the same man playing a middle-aged, flamboyant pianist with a love for wonder, music, and men. The diversity in role choice is stunning.<br/><br/>Matt Damon appears at his youngest as Liberace's lover Scott, in an equally conflicted, complex performance. Damon fills the shoes of the role beautifully and effectively, giving off much in the way of creative energy and heart as he shows just how stressed and torn Thorson must've been in a relationship with someone who truly loved and understood him but wanted to manipulate him. Supporting performances from Rob Lowe as Liberace's doctor, prescribing medicines to both him and Thorson and Dan Aykroyd as his manager are terrific and often are seen providing strong comic relief.<br/><br/>For a TV movie to have the cinematography and atmosphere that Behind the Candelabra does is truly a feature worth nothing. It may not be as excessive as Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby - I don't expect anything of the next two years to be on par with that film - but rarely has a TV movie achieved such phenomenally vibrant and luscious standards. The only thing that could make it better is Soderbergh proving he knows how to work with it and he most certainly does.<br/><br/>HBO seems to be the go-to network for biographical films about figures that wouldn't likely make appropriate return in the theaters (Behind the Candelabra especially considering the summer movie season has already hit the ground running). David Mamet, just a few months ago, directed the delightful and shockingly unbiased Phil Spector, with actors like Al Pacino and Helen Mirren receiving top-billing. Seeing as a Liberace biopic is directed by none other than Soderbergh, I wouldn't be surprised at seeing a slew of films about eclectic media figures being made and released on HBO in the next few years. Networks that have the drive and willingness to air these kinds of films are a necessity to the success of film.<br/><br/>Starring: Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Rob Lowe, and Dan Aykroyd. Directed by: Steven Soderbergh."

","The big studios passed on this film despite the fact that it is directed by Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen, Traffic), and would star Matt Damon and Michael Douglas. They thought is would be ""too gay.""<br/><br/>Well, thank goodness for HBO, as they jumped in and green-lighted the film, which is in competition for the Palme d'Or at Cannes.<br/><br/>All the action took place in the seventies and eighties. Liberace was about 40 years older than his new lover, Scott. Michael Douglas was fantastic as Liberace, and Matt Damon was also brilliant in the role of Scott. <br/><br/>Rob Lowe and Dan Ackroyd supplied outstanding support to the story. <br/><br/>Just the right amount of music; maybe there could have been a little more. This was a fascinating story about a man who was in love with himself far more than he could have been with Scott or anyone else."
"Jed from Toronto","8","64","80","26 May 2013"," Unexpectedly great performances!
","I decided to watch this film on HBO because I thought it would be a hoot - one of those catastrophic and pretentious productions which are so laughable. Within 20 minutes I realized that the film was rather important. Michael Douglas captures the late Liberace's mannerisms and voice with astonishing ease. He is quite stellar in his performance, and I see him now in a new light. Matt Damon is excellent as Scott, his protégé. The personages involved are deeply complex, even if one is only familiar with the contemporary ""National Enquirer"" reports one realizes their is something one can not quite understand about ""Lee & Scott's"" relationship. Douglas and Damon are brilliant in delving into these characters. They are unrecognizable, at times, from the familiar roles we all know of them. I think the film well worth watching. As a bonus, Matt Damon shows his bum on several occasions, for those who are interested; if not, one cannot help but be interested in the wonderful performances from two of Hollywood's great stars! A courageous undertaking well done indeed!!!"
"gsygsy","8","30","36","11 June 2013"," A triumph
","This is a first-rate piece of work by Mr Soderbergh and his team (kudos to Ellen Mirojnick's flamboyant costumes and Howard Cummings' outrageous interiors). The otherwise excellent screenplay by Richard LaGravanese loses a little steam around two-thirds of the way through, but recovers to give a genuinely touching conclusion.<br/><br/>Nominally this is a biopic. In fact, it uses the biopic format to examine a particular relationship in depth. The narrative focus is on the dynamic between two people rather than the inner turmoil of one. This, as well as the director's good taste, has kept at bay the sprawling pretentiousness and sentimentality which usually infest the genre, regardless of how good the central performances are: films as diverse as LA VIE EN ROSE and MILK have been scuppered in this way. Not so BEHIND THE CANDELABRA, which is an altogether more sophisticated affair.<br/><br/>The acting is dazzling. Michael Douglas, in a beautifully-written role, communicates the complexity of a real human being, not just a two-dimensional celebrity. At the same time, he gives full value to Liberace's famous showmanship. A star performance, sure - the subject demands it - but also much, much more.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is a revelation. For me, up till now, he has represented the worst kind of dead-behind-the-eyes, don't-dare-express-anything movie acting. The nearest I came to thinking any different was his turn as the scout in the Coen Brothers' remake of TRUE GRIT. In BEHIND THE CANDELABRA he displays a range I never thought he had in him. The character moves from naivety through rage to despair and on to quiet understanding. Really, really terrific.<br/><br/>The two leads create a totally believable relationship between their characters, in all its aspects. A triumph.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake is the supporting cast, led by Dan Aykroyd and Scott Bakula, and spangled with cameos from Rob Lowe, Debbie Reynolds, Bruce Ramsay, Cheyenne Jackson and Paul Reiser.<br/><br/>Here in England we're fortunate to see this film on big screens. As is well known, it was financed by a TV company (HBO) and will not be released theatrically in the USA. That tells a sad story about the American movie industry, from which an independent-minded artist like Mr Soderbergh is wise to walk away."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","21","25","11 September 2013"," Finally a film that suits Soderbergh's voyeuristic and clinical style.
","It's starting to look like 2013 is Soderbergh's year. Side Effects and Behind The Candelabra seem to be my favourite of his career so far, though that's only relatively, as I'm not a big fan of him. I do have Out Of Sight on my to see list coming up soon and I do need to give Traffic another watch before I make any final assessment on him. Although Soderbergh is frequently the director, cinematography and editor on his projects, he may be efficient but he's far too clinical, pushing the audience as an observer that it's difficult to feel emotionally involved in his films. I can't get excited for his half-baked premises that most likely haven't been fulfilled to their potential. However, Behind The Candelabra may be the first film I've seen of his that suits his style ideally. His style is still distant and voyeuristic, but in this bizarre world where Liberace adopts his lover for a son and pays for plastic surgery to make him look like himself, it feels more deliberate to keep us at a distance.<br/><br/>Instead, the scenes of dramatic conflict, decision and choice are played off for jokes and it's really effective, always earning belly laughs with its brilliant one-liners without feeling like it's silly. Perhaps its nervous laughter but it makes for an entertaining and interesting film. Michael Douglas is terrific as Liberace. I've never seen him take a character on like this. He's nearly up there with Sean Penn's Milk. It feels like it's been a while since Matt Damon has been in films I've wanted to watch and with this and Elysium, I've forgotten how reliable a lead he is. The characters inhabit a flashy world, but its kept on the costumes and sets which are incidental more than anything and the style of the film is kept subtle, besides a great choice of swooping cameras. It does have its flaws with nearly soap opera-esque structure and conflict but my expectations were very low so this is a pleasant surprise. I think I even prefer it to Side Effects.<br/><br/>7/10"
"gradyharp","Null","36","46","27 May 2013"," Liberace the Legend is served well
","The film is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson (with Alex Thorleifson) adapted for the screen by Richard LaGravenese about the tempestuous 6- year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson. This film along with SIDE EFFECTS are purported to be Steven Soderbergh's last films he will direct.<br/><br/>The cast is very solid. Matt Damon embodies the role of Scott Thorson well - a young apparently bisexual man who has been tossed from foster home to foster home while he does odd jobs (he is 17 years old) tending to animals. In a gay bar he meets Bob Black (Scott Bakula) who takes Scott to a Liberace concert (his first exposure to the mega-star) and to meet Liberace afterwards. There is tension in the air with Liberace's current paramour and performing partner Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) and we soon discover that Liberace (impeccably played by Michael Douglas) only keeps his 'boys' around for a while before his manager Seymour (Dan Ackroyd) gets rid of them with a check. Liberace and Scott find common ground in being needy people without confidants and soon Scott becomes Liberace's next lover. All goes swimmingly until Liberace sees himself on a TV show and sees how aged he has become. He engages plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe in a very fine performance) to perform a youthful face lift and at the same time convinces Scott to undergo plastic surgery to make him look more like Liberace! And here begins the downfall: Dr. Startz prescribes pain meds to Scott who becomes addicted and moves into heavier drugs, and his behavior, along with Liberace's need for a 'new face' (Boyd Holbrook), signals the breakup of a 6 year relationship - the best relationship either has ever had.<br/><br/>There are excellent cameos by Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Paul Reiser as Scott's lawyer, and others, but the star of the film is in all ways the flamboyant showman Liberace in some of the most interesting outfits ever created. The on screen relationship between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon is entirely credible and neither of these fine actors has a problem with being sexually physical without seeming to be a parody. There are moments that could have been cut, but as Liberace says, less is more and more is wonderful. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"Lechuguilla","8","14","17","9 August 2014"," HBO Is The Hero Here
","Congrats to HBO for having the guts to produce a script which mainstream studios refused to consider. ""Behind The Candelabra"" gives us a story about Liberace's personal life, from the POV of his one time lover, ""blond Adonis"" Scott Thorson. The plot spans some ten years, from 1977 to Liberace's death in 1987.<br/><br/>Aside from his public persona, Liberace (Michael Douglas) comes across as egotistical, daring, self-absorbed, and to some extent old-fashioned in his values and beliefs. Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) comes across as passive, a tad lazy, and lacking in foresight and intellect. The plot's first half presents us with a love story. In the second half, reality sets in. One gets the feeling that though there may have been love between the two, Scott is just one more object for Liberace to collect, which was easy for him given his wealth. That kind of material relationship speaks poorly of both men.<br/><br/>This film has a big cast, and some well-known names. Rob Lowe is terrific as a humorously bizarre plastic surgeon. Debbie Reynolds, as Lee's elderly mother, is so good that she is unrecognizable. Nearly all of the actors give fine performances. Michael Douglas especially deserves credit given that Liberace's mannerisms and image are so well known.<br/><br/>Lavish custom costumes, detailed and elaborate production design, tons of subtle and not-so-subtle makeup all combine to add enormously to the story's credibility, as does the cinematography. Interior lighting makes Liberace's on-stage performances come alive. Music is, not unexpectedly, what Liberace liked, to some extent stuffy and old-fashioned.<br/><br/>I was never a Liberace fan. But he was a much-beloved entertainer and talented pianist, who had a long show business career. That the Hollywood studios turned this script down tells us a great deal about Hollywood. The real hero in this film is not a character so much as it is HBO. Maybe there is hope that quality films can still be made, despite cowardly industry insiders."

","I can't honestly say that I know very much about Liberace. I was a teenager in the 70's - Liberace really wasn't my cup of tea. Still, I know about him. His flashiness, his sexuality, his ability with the piano - and I'm familiar with the ""palimony"" suit launched against him by his much younger lover, Scott Thorson. ""Behind the Candelabra"" is the movie adaptation of Thorson's book about the relationship, so it needs to be viewed with a grain of salt; it's hardly unbiased. But unbiased or not, it is a fascinating look into the glitzy, showy, and sometimes degenerate world inhabited by Liberace and Thorson, who was almost 50 years younger than Liberace when the relationship began.<br/><br/>The ""world"" is fabulously portrayed. The costumes and sets seem very authentic, and - with the above note about bias being kept in mind - the basic story of the relationship is believable enough. Liberace and Thorson were together for four years, and in those four years, things got weird. Liberace supposedly promised to adopt Thorson; and Thorson was given a part in Liberace's show. The movie portrays the relationship's breakup (due to Liberace's infidelities) and the final reunion between the two, as Thorson visits Liberace on his deathbed. It all seems very realistic, and provides an almost voyeuristic experience into the relationship between the two.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie, though, has to be the performances offered by Matt Damon (as Thorson) and - especially - Michael Douglas as Liberace. Both were brilliant and totally believable in the parts. These must have been difficult roles. Two guys - both obviously straight - playing these parts in a movie which includes a lot of very passionate scenes between them could have come across as awkward, but credit goes to both of them for the fact that it never seemed awkward. They came across as natural together in what must (at times) have been very uncomfortable roles for them. I gained a new appreciation of the talents of both from this movie.<br/><br/>It's very enjoyable and it certainly offers a glimpse into a world that the vast majority of us will never see - and that the vast majority of us probably wouldn't want to see.

","It seems bizarre that many people thought Liberace was camp but did not think he was gay.<br/><br/>As a young child when his television specials were shown I was aware that there was something effeminate about him even though I had no idea what homosexuality was. He even would have a female companion in these shows, a wink at the audience that he might be straight.<br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra is a film from Steven Soderbergh with Michael Douglas playing the entertainer as a reptilian predator of young men. Preening, vain, bejewelled, promiscuous and yet empty. A bit like the top of his head when he took off his toupee.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays his teenage lover Scott Thorson, who is taken by a friend to see Liberace's Las Vegas show and then backstage is bemused by the attention lavished on him by the older star who showers him with gifts and love and eventually ejects him with little dignity as a newer, younger model enters the scene.<br/><br/>Of course the film is based on the book by Thorson whose own veracity has been questioned and whose account might be self serving. It is not helped that although Damon looks buff in the disco infused late 1970s era, at the age of 43 when this film was made, he was frankly too old to be playing the teenage Scott Thorson.<br/><br/>Douglas who for a period was a sex symbol with sex thrillers such as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct is having a hoot camping it up as Liberace, not afraid to show his vulnerable side. Ultimately the only person he had a real relationship with was his mother played here by Debbie Reynolds.<br/><br/>I found the whole drama too shallow and maybe even too safe.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","5","7","14 October 2013"," The facade crumbles
","It happens far too often to us Europeans that we have to wait for weeks, often months to see a popular film after it was already released a long time ago in the United States. An especially extreme recent example was ""Albert Nobbs"", which brought Glenn Close another Oscar nomination, it took two years after its first airing in the US after it finally came to Germany. But enough moaning now: Of course we have lots of French, Italian, German etc. films that make up for it because we get to see them earlier and they may not even have a release at in the United States. And then we very rarely have a film like ""Behind the Candelabra"", the big winner during 2013's Primetime Emmys, which wasn't distributed for the big screen in the USA, but was over here in Europe.<br/><br/>It stars Michael Douglas, evidently completely cured from its cancer, as the colorful entertainer Liberace and Matt Damon as its young lover Sctt Thorson who also wrote the book this film is based on. I listened to Liberace quite a while ago and enjoyed some of his music. Also I really like Matt Damon in almost anything (most recently ""Gus van Sant's criminally underseen ""Promised Land""), so I was kinda curious about the film. Don't care too much about Douglas, but that's mostly as I haven't really seen that much of his work. And my expectations weren't disappointed. It's definitely elevated a lot by the great acting from the two protagonists, but also from most of the supporting cast, like those who played Liberace's first co-star and the plastic surgeon whose unique expressions made him such an unlikeable character. It's hard to judge how accurate Douglas' portrayal was as I was born only shortly before Liberace's death, so I have no live memory really, but thankfully we live in the age of videos and the footage i've seen is very similar to Douglas, especially a magnificent job on the voice. And besides that, most of what we see about Liberace here is not really his shows, but his private life which wasn't in the public eye back then anyway.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes mostly centered on Damon due to my previously mentioned preference. Of course his character is not such an icon and that's why he probably lost the Emmy to his costar (I wonder if Douglas could have won the Oscar for it, especially as the Academy Awards were referenced in the film with performing there was one of Liberace's main goals), but i thought he was equally good as Douglas and portrayed nicely how he was stuck being attraction and disgust for Liberace's plastic world. I wasn't moved as much as I hoped I would by the scenes of Liberace's mother passing away or finally at his own deathbed near the end, but my favorites were more those where Thorson is informed via phone that his foster mother died or when he has his breakdown and realizes that everything is gone, including his face. Another scene I liked was their conversation when Damon breaks into tears and says something like it's been so long and he forgot how it was when they were nice to each other.<br/><br/>The surgery scenes were short, but quite graphic indeed, pretty off-putting just the way it should be. The vanity of Douglas' character is exactly what made him so interesting. He always switches between despicable, pitiful and admirable, the latter mostly when we saw his music which wasn't as frequent as I liked. The only longer part is pretty much right before Liberace and Thorson meet for the first time and Damon's character is rightfully wowed by Liberace's talent. Before writing this review I listened to his 1970 appearance on Lucille Ball's ""Here's Lucy"" where he performs a wonderful rendition of ""I'll Be Seeing You"" with Lucie Arnaz. Well.. obviously the film focuses almost exclusively on Liberace's later private life as an ""old bag"" how he called himself jokingly in the film. The early years are completely left out and the career aspect is not frequent either. We only learn that he basically sues everybody who dares to accuse him of homosexual tendencies. The two completely opposite references to ice skater Sonja Henie were very well-done to depict the political climate and the perception of homosexuality and AIDS back then. That song would have been a truly nice inclusion. But that's just a minor criticism.<br/><br/>I probably disagree with the Emmys that it's the best TV movie of the year and it's definitely not among the very best I watched in theatres this year, but it still made an entertaining watch and dragged almost never during its 2 hours. The acting is outstanding and so are pretty much all the visual aspects like set decoration, art direction and, last but not least, the makeup of course. Somebody ahead of me in the ticket queue asked the seller if Liberace did really exist and I have to say I was shocked when I heard that, especially as he was clearly older than me. I hope the success of this movie brings this legendary entertainer back in the minds of the younger generations."
"tsmith417","4","15","28","11 June 2013"," Choppy and confusing and not about Liberace at all
","I remember watching Liberace on television when I was very young. Even at that tender age I knew something was odd about him, but he was perhaps one of the greatest showmen of all time and seemed to thoroughly enjoy performing for people.<br/><br/>WARNING! Spoilers throughout!<br/><br/>But this movie doesn't show any of that. Since it's written from Scott Thorson's POV the movie doesn't concern itself much with Liberace's life as much as Scott's life with him, which occurred long after Liberace became famous. <br/><br/>Frankly, I thought the movie could have been about any two gay men's relationship; that Liberace was one of those men was coincidental and a very small part of the story.<br/><br/>I found the storyline to be very confusing. Thorson is shown in a gay bar and he meets Scott Bakula's character and in the next scene they're driving off together like they've known each other for a long time. We aren't told who this character is. I assume he works for and is a procurer for Liberace, but I have no idea how he came to be in that position or what his ties to Liberace were or how long he's been doing this.<br/><br/>For all Thorson's protests that he's bisexual and likes women too, we never see him with any women at all. He doesn't like to watch gay porn because he thinks it's disgusting and wouldn't want anything like that done to him, yet he has no qualms about doing it to someone else. Huh?<br/><br/>When Liberace's mother -- played by Debbie Reynolds, who is completely unrecognizable and I had to watch the movie twice to make sure it was really her -- he shouts, ""I'm finally free!"" but we, the viewers, have no idea why he felt so trapped by her.<br/><br/>The palimony case went by too quickly.<br/><br/>When Liberace dies and the state forces an autopsy, the results are revealed and then that's it, they don't show anything about the public's reaction to the news the way they did with the Rock Hudson gay revelation.<br/><br/>What really bothered me about the movie was the part when Liberace is on his death bed and Thorson visits him. Liberace begs him, ""Please don't tell anyone I looked like this,"" and Scott promises he won't, yet there it is. <br/><br/>Did he tell in his book how Liberace looked? I don't know, but he allowed it to be shown in the film. He broke his promise to a dying man, a man he professed to love deeply. There's no excuse for that.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas was phenomenal in his portrayal and literally became Liberace for me. I'm not a big fan of Matt Damon and I don't have anything to judge his performance by because I don't know anything about Scott Thorson, but he seemed comfortable playing the part. Dan Akroyd's part could've been played by anyone because it was small; maybe he just wanted to be in the movie. Rob Lowe's performance was, shall I say, a bit over-the-top, and once again I don't know if the real person was like that, but I can't imagine someone like that not being stripped of his medical license a long time ago.<br/><br/>If writing his book was a catharsis for Scott Thorson I don't know, but as a movie on its own merits, it was unnecessary. It bordered on soft gay porn at times, it couldn't decide whether it was supposed to be a tribute to Liberace or a ""queenie dearest"" kind of story, and I really can't say I liked it."
"secondtake","8","6","9","19 December 2013"," Driven actors, glittery characters, and a slice of very weird Las Vegas life
","Behind the Candelabra (2013)<br/><br/>Well, there's the story of Liberace, which is astonishing in its own way. Then here is Michael Douglas being Liberace in a true bravado performance. <br/><br/>So first things first—see this. It's just a hoot, and a well done biopic. Throw in Matt Damon's first rate performance, and some other secondary believable parts, and you realize there is some serious discipline involved. Most of all it is Douglas who manages to not overplay the part of a man who overplayed his public life to an outlandish extreme.<br/><br/>If you don't know who Liberace is, you'll find out, but it helps to have a clue (and I have some memories of people liking him, and run across old records of his at junk shops all the time). He was a kind of piano force who decided not to be a serious concertizer but to simply entertain. He wanted to make people happy, and that pretty much sums up his life.<br/><br/>Liberace also seemed to lack some kind of long term empathy that would see the damage he might cause young men who got sucked into his influence—and bedroom. It really didn't quite matter, and in his superficial way you can see why. It was a trade off of one kind of oversized entertainer for a more compassionate and giving person—or something like that. It's hard to sum up here but in fact, the big point somewhere, is people of all stripes were playing immediate pleasures against deeper commitment.<br/><br/>There is ultimately something thin here as a movie, and it only filled in a bit by watching some Youtube filler on my own afterwards. You might do the same. Comparing fact and representation is pretty amazing."
"grnhair2001","5","7","12","6 March 2014"," Over-hyped
","I wish as a culture we had matured to being over homophobia so that the mere choice to play a gay man wasn't seen as ""brave"" or ""out of comfort zone"" or remarkable but just as another role. Then we could judge this movie and the acting jobs on their merits, and not through the lens of either homophobia or defensiveness.<br/><br/>I wish, too, that the filmmakers had put more thought into the nature of hangers-on to celebrities, to the why of that beyond a facile pop psychology explanation, and to the benefits to each party of such arrangements. (Though perhaps this would make them look too closely at their own marriages and friendships and failures, so maybe that's too much for me to wish.) Without more than a surface examination of those issues, what we get here is a pretty faithful version of the jilted boy toy's story (based on his rather whiny book of maybe truth and maybe lies), and so a frustratingly shallow presentation of this one story and the phenomenon of hangers on, groupies, and entourages of our de facto royalty here in the U.S: show biz people.<br/><br/>What's quite good here is production design, props, costume and make-up and the choice to introduce Liberace in a high-energy performance. (He really could play the piano, but the awfulness of his costumes and staging made him hard to watch and take seriously.) The supporting performances of Lowe as the creepy groupie-doctor-dealer to the stars and Reynolds as Lee's mom were both terrific, and Reynolds (speaking of plastic surgery) being willing to look that old and dowdy was likely as brave a choice as the hip grinding between the two leads. I honestly finished the film thinking ""huh, I thought Debbie Reynolds was in this"" and then it dawned on me who she had played. This always seems a sign to me of good acting, when the actor disappears into the role.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed at this slight effort and expected more because of the hype and awards. I'm glad I got it from my library rather than paying a dollar to rent it."
"NutzieFagin","6","10","19","7 June 2013"," Shameful Film devoted to ""Mr Showmanship""
","I was somewhat disappointed to the HBO showcase film ""Behind the Candelabra"" The film was based on a book written by Scot Thorson, the late Liberace's ex lover. That's about all I can say about the truth of it.<br/><br/>What is shameful is the depictions of both Scot Thorson and Liberace. Scot Thorson who is adequately portrayed by Matt Damon is shown as some innocent wide eyed young man who is smitten with the glitz and glamor of Liberace, his life and house and estates. He seems to act how he has no idea that Liberace is sexually attracted to him. When he discover Liberace has some feelings for him, he does anything for him no matter how ridiculous or bizarre it is. He even enters like a blind puppy into the world of drug addiction with no caution or qualms.<br/><br/>As for Michael Douglas's portrayal of Mr Showmanship-he is playing more of a horny drag queen than a seasoned performer. Liberace is shown more as a lecherous manipulative man who sends out someone to pimp new boyfriends. After he gains their friendship and trust, he then proceeds to control every aspect of their lives giving them free plastic surgery (to look like him) and ""adopting"" them into his family. After he is bored or tires of them, he throws them out like an old rag. Does the deceased talented Liberace deserve this? <br/><br/>The best thing of the film is that it does showcase Liberace's remarkable talent. I've personally never been to his shows but I heard that they were very entertaining with a lot of glitz,glitz,glitz--pure Vegas acts which seem to be losing their art today. What is even more interesting about Liberace's life is how he lived like a king! Gorgeous furnishings and yes...he did have a problem with his dogs (babies) pooping on the Turkish rugs. But Wow! he was the king of Vegas Outrageous!<br/><br/>But lastly, please remember the film painted Thorson's character as more of an unwitting victim. Scott Thorson was arrested for burglary,credit card fraud and he knew a LOT of Gang and underworld characters so I ain't buying the victim story entirely and Liberace is not alive to dispute anything of course. I know Liberace was a VERY private person about his life and sexual preferences but I often wonder how hiscfamily feels about this ""chicken hawk"" character they gave Liberace.<br/><br/>Also, as for parental guidance rating---please remember there are a LOT of explicit sex scenes....I don't care if they are homosexual or not, just not the right type of picture for the very young to see."

","I just watched this movie and I felt immediately compelled to write a review. Michael Douglas carries the movie amazingly well. I have seen him in many movies but after seeing him playing Liberace tonight I have only respect for him. Matt Damon did a good job too but certainly not near as great as the job Douglas did. I am amazed that no studio wanted to do this movie. I liked Brokeback Mountain but I never connected with the gay relationship it portrayed. Here, the relationship feels sincere, much more natural. Douglas never looks like a caricature, a path that could have been easily to go for, He looks like a real person (I never saw Liberace perform). Great job Mr. Douglas, you have won a fan!"

","Excellent performance by Michael Douglas--he was totally believable as Liberace. I had a little trouble seeing Matt Damon in his role, but liked Rob Lowe as the doctor. <br/><br/>I felt like the film gave me way more sexual background than I wanted to know about Liberace, and it seemed like mean-spirited commentary rather than biographical. It was a typical Soderbergh film, and I tend to not like his movies.<br/><br/>I had fond memories of seeing Liberace's performances on television as a child, and really wanted to see more of that. Liberace was flashy, funny, charming and talented. This movie spoiled that memory for me. I didn't like it at all and only gave it a 4 as a rating because of Michael Douglas' remarkable transformation into Liberace."
"christophe92300","4","11","23","30 September 2013"," Another mediocre biopic
","A true story doesn't always equal success and this umpteenth biopic that is Behind The Candelabra proves it once again.<br/><br/>If you put aside the extravagant aspect of Liberace and the huge age difference between him and Scott who was only 17 (!) when they met — an important detail that almost goes unnoticed —, what remains is an almost banal love story, with its ups and downs, struggling to convince. The viewer ends up enduring laborious scenes, sometimes very linear, often little constructive, and of more than debatable interest.<br/><br/>One could also question the veracity and partiality of the story given that the script is based on the memoirs of Scott Thorson.<br/><br/>Anyway, Steven Soderbergh can be thankful to the cast in general and Michael Douglas in particular for their very good performances, because if it wasn't for them, the movie would be a flop."
"cherold","5","7","14","3 June 2013"," Depressing but well done
","This movie about Liberace's relationship with Thorson is wonderfully acted by Douglas and Damon, effectively filmed, well written, and, for me, not especially enjoyable. I found Damon's powerlessness in the relationship depressing, and while Douglas makes Liberace seem pretty likable, his actions are insufferably egocentric and inconsiderate. Since the book this was based on was written by a jilted lover, it may or may not reflect much truth, but it's still a depressing story.<br/><br/>It's hard to know how real any of this is. The plastic surgeon is so disturbing looking that it's hard to believe anyone would go under his knife (the single image I could find of him through google did not look nearly as freakish) and even though Douglas does a great job of nuancing Liberace into a real person in spite of his quirky voice and mannerisms, parts of the movie seem rather cartoonish. <br/><br/>It's nice we've reached a point where major Hollywood actors will take a chance on material like this; it's a movie that doesn't shy away from sex the way earlier movies about gay people did. But I just never could get into it."

"bregund","5","5","9","1 August 2015"," Surprisingly dull
","Watch any clip of Liberace on youtube and, despite your awareness of his personal life, you have to agree that he was a natural showman. I remember seeing him on TV in the 70s and woman loved him, my mom went nuts. It's easy to see why, because he pulled the audience into his performances and made you feel like you were part of it. It's not easy to do this, and he made it look effortless in the way that some outstanding entertainers do, like Michael Jackson or Madonna. That critical element is missing from this film. When you peel back the layers of showmanship, you want to see what makes up the person behind them, and this film doesn't accomplish that goal or explain Liberace's complicated life. I had high hopes for Douglas, but for some reason he just doesn't click, his delivery is off, and you can't buy him as Liberace, you just see Michael Douglas in heavy makeup. Matt Damon gives a suitably understated performance and he is a dead ringer for Scott Thorson.<br/><br/>Ironically, given what are supposed to be colorful main characters, the real stars of the show are the supporting characters: an unrecognizable Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Dan Akroyd as Liberace's snappy lawyer, Scott Bakula as Bob Black, and of course Rob Lowe, who steals every scene he's in. Maybe Rob Lowe should have played Liberace."

","This is truly a repulsive piece of film making. Contrary to all the highfalutin hoopla about making a movie about ""the truth,"" this rancid flick is a poorly disguised piece of soft core pornography which luxuriates in emphasizing all the tawdriest and most sensational aspects - of which there are plenty - of this lurid tale. Everyone knows that Liberace was gay. This movie certainly tells us about his sex life, or at least the version of his sex life as told by his paramour Scott Thorson in his tell-all book. There are always two sides to any story about a relationship, and here we never get to hear Liberace's. The fact that by all accounts Liberace was a generous contributor to charitable causes, encouraged rising talent, and was a congenial and loyal companion to his many show business friends - all of this is absent from this shockfest, or maybe shlockfest. As far as the acting, I was curious to see how Michael Douglas, whose work I admire, would handle the role. He turns in nothing more than a simmering, mincing, lisping, one-dimensional caricature. Evidently movie makers will sink to any depths to make a buck, and this is Exhibit A. Avoid this disgusting piece of trash at all costs."

","Absolutely atrocious cable-film which garnered critical praise, awards and--most importantly--high ratings upon its debut on HBO. Michael Douglas never begins to suggest piano-playing showman Liberace in this adaptation of Scott Thorson's book, despite the costumes and make-up and wigs; this was something of a comeback for Douglas after a real-life bout with cancer, but there's nothing here for the actor to play (it's all externals). Matt Damon does a bit better in the role of Thorson, Liberace's sneaky, snarky young lover, but the surrounding milieu, the show-biz razzle-dazzle and atmospherics fail to come off. A major disappointment from the estimable Steven Soderbergh, who certainly got no assistance from Richard LaGravenese's flimsy, turgid teleplay. Liberace deserved better, big numbers or not."

","LIBERACE has been relegated to HBO because it would not make a dime in theaters, outside of a very few zip codes. The Gay aspect is not the reason, Brokeback Mountain did just fine. No, LIBERACE is an ugly mess with a jumble of sex, drugs, manipulation, degradation and betrayal passing for story. Half the actors look like they are trying to hide, Aykroyd in particular. The words 'brave' and 'courageous' are being used to describe the work itself and Douglas' and Damon's performances as openly Gay men. Since being Gay is natural, healthy and as normal as being straight then where is the courage in pretending to be Gay? LIBERACE is semi-pornographic exploitation masquerading as heroic film-making. Perhaps that's where the bravery can be found...in two genuine stars appearing as the leads in a porno-flick."

","Michael Douglas deserves credit for his part in this rather bizarre supposed documentary. Other than passing factoids and news blurbs, I am not familiar with Liberace, other than the obvious media stories and a few appearances he had on Johnny Carson back in the day.<br/><br/>Liberace's sometime friend, Scott Thorson, while in real life is apparently a sordid character (We ARE in Hollywood, no one gets a free lunch). Anyway while Damon can be annoying in 'wholesome' type characters, he does okay here. Although I believe that for real facts one may want to research more.<br/><br/>At any rate the lifestyle of Liberace is explored, the sumptuous, over the top decor, the dogs, the hangers on, the users, the creepy plastic surgeon (well played by a nearly unrecognizable Rob Lowe).<br/><br/>Michael Douglas and his visual effects are quite stunning: the make up here is on the mark. It is something you may find yourself re-watching in disbelief. His effeminate characteristics are also similar to Liberace, the relationship with his mother, and how he actually was relieved once she passed away.<br/><br/>Douglas really does seem to be the bilious, blatant and attention seeking persona of Liberace, quite a contrast in performance to Wall street raider Gordon Gecko. Here Douglas transforms into a caricature, believable, humorous, or creepy at times.<br/><br/>The pastiche here probably doesn't follow reality, and clearly Liberace had many unsavory experiences, and so the tales we hear now may not all be true. The film makes Thorson a sympathetic jilted boy toy, but perhaps the real story is quite different. He certainly overcame the relationship quick enough to sue the Estate of Liberace for six figures.<br/><br/>Audiences not interested in this subject matte may be surprised, and Douglas' performance alone is well worth watching. 8/10."

","Let's remain short on this one.<br/><br/>Liberace is a myth in show biz. A gay piano performer who all his life hid his orientation under a fake heterosexual liaison that had no real material density at all. All his life he ran after younger twinks to feel his youth back again, with a few implants. That was before the blue pill of Viagra. But one day he tried a new one who was probably slightly better than the others, more special. Description from the urban Dictionary: ""An attractive, boyish-looking, young gay man. The stereotypical twink is 18-22, slender with little or no body hair, often blonde, dresses in club wear even at 10:00 AM, and is not particularly intelligent. A twink is the gay answer to the blonde bimbo cheerleader.""That Scott accepted to have his face reshaped into a semblance of Liberace's. He accepted all kinds of crazy sex but he refused to be taken from behind, some old fear of the dark I guess, since he was let's say an orphan who had been raised in foster care and who found the perfect foster family to support him. In other words he was not ""a blonde bimbo cheerleader.3<br/><br/>He was attracted by the light, the gold, the gems and jewels, the white uniform though it looked more like a sentimental sweet Halloween costume to impress old ladies, or old queens, white fur coat included. He resisted nothing except that visitor at the back entrance. Pathetic! I guess then Liberace was impressed and as long as the resistance was active he went on trying. He even tried to compensate the frustration by trying to adopt Scott as his proper son, or was it a con from a con- artist? But that kind of theatrical sublimation did not work at all. So time had come to get rid of the gnat. And Liberace did in one swat.<br/><br/>Till death them parted! And just before that sad AIDS moment he called Scott to come and take his last words, watch his last tears, shed some crocodile tears out of confusion and frustration. We are not told what the will gave him.<br/><br/>The film ends up with the cardiac arrest caused by a heart failure, turned into the sequels of the AIDS virus by some coroner's office. <br/><br/>The film tries to end the show, that must go on anyway, with a love song, in fact a long poem recited by Liberace to his own piano music and that song is a marvelous love song indeed, the love song of an older man to a younger man – though it could be to a younger woman all the same. The age difference that Liberace could not deal with made him over sexual whereas there comes an age when a man can love with love and not lust with sex. Liberace never found that epiphany that would have redeemed him from total fright in front of his own age. It is so good to love someone who is younger, a lot younger than you even, just for the love of him or her, for the heat and the emotion you feel in your heart that is not invaded by some hormonal and endocrinal greed. <br/><br/>There comes an age when the wolf in man can finally go to sleep and let the platonic emotions of the loving phoenix come out of the shadow of the receding night that will bring the illumination of the last call. To be reborn instantly from its own empathetic ashes. To be reborn instantly in the lasting memory of the loved one's responsive soul.<br/><br/>A beautiful film about a time when love was not accepted in the narrow circles of the straight fundamentalism of fairy bashing. <br/><br/>But let me give you the final sentimental, slightly over sugary love song that sounds like a Hallmark Valentine's.<br/><br/>Why do I love you? I love you not only for what you are, But for what I am when I'm with you I love you not only for what you have made of yourself, But for what you are making of me. I love you for ignoring the possibilities of the fool in me, And for accepting the possibilities of the good in me. Why do I love you? I love you for closing your eyes to the discords in me, And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening. I love you for helping me to construct of my life Not a tavern but a temple I love you because you have done so much to make me happy. You have done it without a word, without a touch, without a sign You have done it by just being yourself Perhaps after all, that is what love means And that is why I love you.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Douglas must at least be nominated for an Academy award for this one because he, at least to Diane and I, slipped seamlessly into his character as Liberace, the masterful entertainer that filled the TV screens during those early days of TV in the Fifties. Hollywood really got it right when they decided to take the book written by Daemon's character and converted his insights into the life of this great entertainer into what became this masterful look into Liberace's life. Thorson, the author as well as the second character in the movie, wrote what seems to be a very fair portrait of himself and Liberace, warts and all.<br/><br/>I remember listening to Liberace's TV shows as a kid during the Fifties and not really caring for much of anything about him: his demeanor, his dress nor his music. He did not need me in his audience though; obviously the blue rinse set were his fans and he was exceptionally good at giving them what they wanted, glitz and talented piano playing.<br/><br/>Isn't it interesting that certain very talented people appear on the scene at critical times and had it happened later or earlier that talent would have gone unrecognized? It is sad to see people with huge amounts of talent but they appear at the wrong time; Liberace didn't!"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","3","5","30 May 2013"," A tender love story, but where's the music?
","If you believe the persona that Liberace displayed to the public, then you might well believe that the man never had a dull moment in his life. ""Too much of a good thing is wonderful,"" he told his audience and he didn't just speak it, he lived it. His stage shows were a garish over-the-top monument to the joys of wretched excess and over-indulgence, a garish display dripping with diamonds and glitter and color and music. It was an image that went with him when he left the stage. His gaudy and lavishly over-decorated Hollywood Hills mansion was a monument to his image. The Tsar of Russia never had it so good.<br/><br/>Liberace didn't know the meaning of the word 'subtle' and it could be suspected that his flash and glitter were a snowjob, a way of battling those who tried to bring his homosexuality out in the open during a dark time when such a headline could ruin a performer's career. When the tabloids tried to expose him, he sued and won. The audience, made up mostly of middle-aged housewives, adored him so much that they were either blind or pretended not to notice. All of his professional life, Liberace fought a never-ending battle to keep it in the closet, even going so far as to plant rumors about his love affair with Olympic figure skater Sonja Henie.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh's ""Behind the Candelabra"" does a good job of showing us the side of Liberace that the great musician spent his entire life trying to hide. This is a movie about a gay man who, feeling the approach of age, tried to keep time in check, not only through plastic surgery, but also through the presence of a rotating series of young and hansom lovers, one of whom (the movie has us believe) became the great love of his life.<br/><br/>""Behind the Candelabra"" is not so much a biography of Liberace as a story of the five year relationship between the musician and aspiring veterinarian Scott Thorson (Matt Damon). Thorson becomes our eyes to this story. We see this young and handsome Adonis who comes to Liberace's service and is quickly seduced, not by the lifestyle but by the man himself. Liberace is an old rascal, a lusty old queen with the slithery voice of a child molester. Their lust turns to love and eventually we partake of their romance that eventually becomes a marriage. As you might expect, there is no subtlety here. This is a film dripping with the lifestyle of a gay man. How much you like the film may depend on how much of a flamboyantly gay man's lifestyle you're willing to sit through. It's strictly up to you.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas might not seem the first choice to play the famed musician, he's always been the symbol of masculinity, but playing Liberace offers him the challenge of stepping into the mink of a man who was so well known that occupying his skin might come off as mere imitation. Liberace's sweet nasal voice is hard to capture but Douglas takes it off the shelf of impression and makes it organic. It takes some getting used to, and so does the persona. As the movie begins, his approach to Thorson feels more like a pedophile than a man looking for a potential lover, but we quickly get use to him. After a while we begin to feel for him, a man who is feeling his age, who must hold on to a much younger man – much as a straight man might hold on to a beautiful young blonde – in order to feel young.<br/><br/>Matt Damon finds a saintly note in which to play Thorson, a man who takes an uneasy approach to Liberace before dedicating himself to a commitment that he knew that the man was possibly incapable of sticking to. We aren't surprised by the development of their relationship, but what is surprising is the bond that they form, which lends emotional weight to the disappointment in Thorson's eyes when questions of infidelity begin to surface. This is a film very much about a gay partnership, but it could easily have been about a heterosexual marriage. What we come to understand is that, gay or straight, relationships are fraught with difficulties and struggles.<br/><br/>Their romance is sort of touching. It's not all sex and sweat (although those things do surface), but a tender bond between two men that becomes so tight that eventually Liberace decides to adopt him. This is Liberace's way of getting around the fact that he can't marry another man. As we might expect, things don't go well. As with any married couple, they fight, they develop trust issues. Yet, there is a sense that they do love one another despite all of their problems. ""Behind the Candelabra"" presents us with one of the tenderest, but also the most bizarre marriages we've ever seen. That's especially true when it comes to Liberace obsession with plastic surgery, and for the bizarre suggestion that his young lover had surgery to make himself look, well, like Liberace himself.<br/><br/>Yet, while Soderbergh gets the details right, he overlooks the most astute aspect of Liberace: his music. The movie is bookended by his stage performances, but there's very little music or stage bravado in this movie. The director is happy to close the doors of Liberace's mansion and watch the man soak in a hot tub or lounge on the couch, but we miss the music, the garish and gaudy glitter-and-rhinestone stage show that made the man such a legend. We are looking behind the candelabra but there's something missing and it might have been present in a longer film. The movie is wonderful at portraying Liberace's love affairs and his wandering eye, but you can't help feeling that it should be mixed with his love for his music and his audience.<br/><br/>*** (of four)"

","The movie is uninspired. Structurally it's solid but from a story telling point of view it's bland. It's so thin that I spent most of my time wondering how far Douglas and Damon were willing to go on the gay thing. It seemed more like they wanted to simply add 'a gay character' to their CV's - neither of them was particularly convincing, nor interesting. Soderbergh might be more the blame though. He knows how to storyboard and block but he hasn't a clue how to empathize with characters and plot.<br/><br/>However, Rob Lowe breaks away from everyone. He gives an inspired performance - it's sinister and funny - but it's too short to save the movie.<br/><br/>Don't bother with this one, it's not worth the two hour run time. If you want to see an actor imitate a star watch My Week with Marilyn, close your eyes and listen to Branagh imitate Olivier, it's remarkable. Then go back and watch Douglas stumble around Liberace - just for the laugh."

","Although I thought all the acting was great, I was not really enthused about this movie. It shows Liberace - who we all know was gay - in a relationship that ended similarly to others before it had. There was no great revelation or interesting point to key on. Liberace dies and the movie pretty much ends. I'm wondering why this movie was made. And I support gay rights. One of my good friends is gay. So this doesn't have to do with discrimination. It's really just that there was nothing of any real depth here. I think this was based on the book by Scott Thorson and if the movie is any indication, it was just written (and the movie was just filmed) to make some cash. There is nothing that truly contributes to understanding Liberace at anything other than a superficial level."
"italo505","Null","6","15","28 May 2013"," 10 Reasons Not to Date Liberace
","Behind The Candelabra ﻿ Why shouldn't you date Liberace? First of all, you'll be dating a dead man, so that's creepy. But, seriously, there are more than just ten reasons not to date Liberace, portrayed with eerily accuracy by Michael Douglas as the aging piano virtuoso that entertained Vegas audiences for decades in the latest HBO Films' Behind The Candelabra (Available now on HBO On Demand). When I first heard about this film being done, I had my doubts about Michael Douglas and Matt Damon (as Scott) playing lovers, I had my reservations that they'd be perfect for each other. Last night I was proved wrong. Not only did Michael Douglas do a great job but Matt Damon as well, two people that couldn't be any more different than each other and whose torrid love affair, if you could call it that, was told until Liberace died victim of AIDS back in 1987. If Liberace ever saw this movie, he would certainly die all over again. He was, first and foremost, a pianist, a showman, an entertainer. He would have never been of his closet or caught in the scandal of having a boy toy whom he could call his own. And Scott was one of many boy toys that Liberace wanted to play with. Little by little, Liberace took Scott under his wing and allowed him to see the man behind the curtain, the flawed man who clinged on to his youth as if reclaiming his own, as if he could, somehow, stop time and live forever. So why not date a old millionaire, you ask? Well, there are 10 main reasons why you shouldn't date Liberace, starting with:<br/><br/>﻿﻿ Reason #10 Don't date an old man for money. No matter how much money, Rolls Royce, jewelry, one hundred dollar bills and bling-bling he throws at you... He will take it away from you in a New York minute. He had lawyers that will screw you into the ground so do yourself a favor and get out while you still have your young looks and charm... They won't last you forever...<br/><br/>﻿﻿﻿﻿ Reason #9 Don't let him change you. Even if Liberace wants to pay for all the procedures for you to endure, don't do it. Here is one of the funniest scenes of Candelabra: we get to meet Dr. Rob Lowe, a plastic surgeon who can barely close his eyes after having so many surgeries himself. This surgeon is so hilarious that I wonder how Michael Douglas and Matt Damon control themselves while filming his scenes. So take my advice, don't allow Liberace to change your looks... Especially if he wants you to look like a younger version of himself.<br/><br/>Reason #8 He'll always find someone younger and more beautiful than you. There are too many eager fish in the sea. They include sharks, stingrays and barracudas that will stop at nothing to replace you just like when he met you. You got competition, honey!<br/><br/>Reason #7 You are his property, whether you like it or not. I haven't seen such decadence than over a Liberace house. It seems as if Scott had been trapped inside a glass cage, unable to get out. Liberace was very particular with his lovers and didn't want Scott to have friends of his own. He was property of Liberace, whether he liked it or not. It reminded me of Hotel California: you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave. ﻿﻿ <br/><br/>Reason #6 If Liberace dumped somebody else to be with you, don't think he won't turn right back around and do the same to you. You're just as replaceable. ﻿﻿ <br/><br/>Reason #5 Make sure that you check the merchandise for wigs, dentures, prosthetics and other signs of aging. Nothing is ever as good as it appears on the surface.<br/><br/>Reason #4 You become invisible. You know how people can disappear in a relationship to the point when you're no longer yourself but an image? That's exactly what happened to Scott. He hadn't found himself before he met Liberace and easily lost himself in the shuffle. He could have been his boyfriend, his chauffeur, his son, his lover, his pet... Anything that Liberace wanted, Scott was.<br/><br/>﻿﻿ Reason #3 If you don't find Liberace attractive to begin with, trust your instincts. I couldn't help but to feel squeamish whenever I saw Liberace crawling in bed behind Scott, as a rattlesnake crawls onto its victim, ready for the kill. You saw Scott's first impressions of the man and he found him hideous. Yet, after turning into Cinderella overnight, everything seemed different, everything seemed more tolerable. If I were Scott, I'd had gone with my instincts. ﻿﻿ <br/><br/>Reason #2 Never fall in love with Liberace. Liberace will not fall in love with you... He loves himself above all things.<br/><br/>﻿﻿ Reason #1 Never date someone who's ashamed of his sexuality. Liberace was, in the public eye, a straight man. Maybe a little extravagant or sophisticated but still a straight man. If someone said the contrary, that person would have been sued. His sexuality was as ambiguous as the person himself. Even after watching Candelabra, I still don't know much about the artist who remained in the closet until the day he died. <br/><br/>You still have your doubts and want to give it a try? Go right ahead, be my guest... Don't say later that I didn't tell you so..."
"MovieAddict2016","8","3","6","27 June 2015"," One of Soderbergh's best films.
","Supposedly no studio wanted to touch this because it was ""too gay"" (an aspect of film trivia that will probably be looked back upon 50 years from now with incredulity), but, like Brokeback Mountain, this is not a ""Gay Movie"" (if there even is such a thing). This is a tragic romance with two superb performances, stellar direction and a great script.<br/><br/>I am not always Matt Damon's biggest fan, I think he's quite hit or miss, but when he hits he often hits it out of the park, and that's what he does here. Whether playing a young man surprisingly well or playing the drug-addled version of the same man years later, this is one of his most honest, believable performances. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas is phenomenal as Liberace. Watch this movie, then go on YouTube and look up Liberace interviews. If you close your eyes you'll be hard-pressed to find any differences in the cadence of his voice. If this film had been released theatrically he would have almost definitely won an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>I'm not always Soderbergh's biggest fan either, but lately he's been impressing me, as he's moved further away from the mainstream stuff that distracted him for a few years. He directs this film with pure class, and the ending is perfect.<br/><br/>This is one of the better films I've seen in years."
"MattJJW","7","3","6","4 June 2013"," A great Michael Douglas performance elevates this HBO flick well above a standard bio-pic
","Behind the Candelabra, directed by Steven Soderbergh, was aired in the US some time back, but European interest in it has been piqued by it's positive recent screening at Cannes (though it failed to pick up any major prize in the end), and praise for Michael Douglas's performance as Liberace, the rhinestone encrusted camp performer.<br/><br/>It's Douglas's performance that pulls the film above it's otherwise light weight TV bio pic feel. He puts in a bravado performance as late era Liberace, desperate to hang onto his rapidly ageing looks and young lovers. While perhaps not quite an Oscar worthy performance (and in any case it's 'made for TV' credentials and the release timing would seem to rule it out for any Academy Awards) it is nonetheless a brave performance. Douglas manages to evoke sympathy, bemusement and occasionally queasiness. The morning after first bedding the youthful Scott, played by a very buff Matt Damon, the ageing Lothario leans forward, his wizened face pulled into focus, and murmurs salaciously ""Look who's up"" before disappearing under the bed clothes.<br/><br/>Matt Damon as Scott, Liberace's companion, employee and lover for five years, puts in a nicely under stated performance, with Rob Lowe providing a comedic turn as the plastic surgeon, and a rare outing for Dan Akroyd, as Liberace's agent, desperately trying to keep his employer's sexuality a secret.<br/><br/>Incredibly, despite his fondness for buff men, small dogs, and outsize appetite for outrageous kitch, Liberace continued to deny his homosexuality right up to the end. But as the 1980′s entered, and the rumours & press intrusion became greater, along with a lawsuit from Scott, it proved harder and harder to keep it a secret.<br/><br/>Ultimately it was death that finally revealed the man behind the candelabra, the California coroner's office refusing to accept the cause of death as heart complications, and instead ordering a new autopsy, and revealing that the entertainer had died of complications from Aids. Michael Douglas, himself suffering from serious health issues recently, pulls no punches in playing out the closing scenes, bald, gaunt, with a near death grey pallor, with all of the flamboyant vivaciousness of the great performer mercilessly stripped away by disease.<br/><br/>Despite the end, the film is an enjoyable romp, and worth seeking out, if only to see Michael Douglas as you've never seen him before"
"KarlCicitto","4","5","13","31 December 2013"," A Missed Opportunity
","THE GOOD: The cast has many stars including Douglas, Damon, Akroyd, Bakula and Debbie Reynolds. The costumes are excessive and fun. The film gives us a salacious look into Liberace's private life. THE BAD: The acting is two dimensional, despite the cast, which says something bad about the script. The story is not very interesting. The main characters are a gay man who came of age in the 1950's and another gay man who came of age in the 1970's. The characters could have showed us the challenges and scars that came with having to be closeted or suffering discrimination, and how their experiences differed. Also, the opportunity to dramatize the deadliest medical scourge since the plague, i.e. AIDS, was not mined for much plot at all. All the characters were superficial. I would have been disappointed or even agitated had I spent $10 to see this movie. I Red Boxed it for a buck. I can't recommend it it even for a dollar."
"preppy-3","8","4","10","28 May 2013"," I liked it,
","Purportedly true story of the stormy 6 year relationship between Liberace (Michael Douglas ) and his much younger lover Scott Thorson (Matt Damon). OK--Douglas looks nothing like Liberace but sounds just like him and got the mannerisms down pat. Damon is far too old to be playing Thorson--Damon is in his 40s and looks it--Thorson was about 20 when he met Liberace. But if u can ignore those leaps of logic u might like this.<br/><br/>Personally I don't like Liberace. It's not because he's gay (I am too) but he was WAY too flamboyant and ugly. He was a talented pianist though. Still I found the movie interesting. It shows a realistic gay relationship and doesn't shy back from sex and nudity. Also Douglas was great in the role. I've never thought Damon was a good actor and this movie doesn't change my mind. Still he has his moments and u gotta give him credit for wearing some VERY revealing outfits throughout the movie and doing a few nude scenes (back view only). Also in the movie very briefly are Rob Lowe (as a doctor) and Dan Aykroyd (as Liberace's lawyer) but they hardly matter. Scott Bakula and Debbie Reynolds pop up too both looking unrecognizable as a friend of Thorson's and Liberace's mother."
"jm10701","Null","2","4","12 October 2013"," Fun to watch Douglas trying to impersonate Liberace
","I was never a Liberace fan (although I never disliked him), and I strongly dislike both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. I would never willingly see anything with either of those two actors in it. So why on earth did I watch this? I don't know, but I enjoyed it!<br/><br/>Neither of them is really a good actor. They obviously thought (and millions seem to agree) that they were breaking brave new ground and showcasing their immense talents in these roles, but they were just playing the same characters they (and all other Hollywood A-listers) always play: themselves, with enough makeup and choreography and voice coaching to vary the monotony enough to satisfy the mindless masses who pay to see them on screen.<br/><br/>The best I can say about Damon is that most of the time he's easy to ignore in this movie, at least when he has clothes on; his body is so weird that it hurts my eyes, but there's nearly always something interesting to look away at. His barely-suppressed homophobia (Damon's, not the character's) comes shining through in the interview on the DVD, and it comes in handy when he gets to repulse a request Douglas makes in one of their many sex scenes. That's only one of many reasons Damon has always given me the creeps: homosexuality gives HIM the creeps.<br/><br/>But Douglas... Ahhhh! He's nothing like Liberace, but I had a ball watching him just being little Michael Douglas speaking with a funny voice, moving in a funny way, and sporting killer makeup and killer duds. There's something fascinating about him despite my intense dislike of him as both a person and an actor.<br/><br/>Enjoying this movie won't turn me into a fan, but it was fun for the couple of hours it lasted. Not great fun, but fun enough not to turn off, which is quite a feat for a big-budget Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>One complaint: it was stupid to have Douglas recite rather than sing ""The Impossible Dream"" in his last scene. Liberace was a competent singer, and since Douglas evidently can't sing it was dumb not to have a singer dub his voice then. It could have been done seamlessly so the audience never suspected it wasn't him singing. His plodding recitation of the song's silly lyrics ruined what might otherwise have been a fabulous scene. It doesn't matter that Liberace recited it himself; it should have been sung in that scene."
"Likes_Ninjas90","7","2","4","23 July 2013"," As rich as the characters are, they are ingrained in a linear, inorganic narrative that lacks exciting detours
","In 1989 Steven Soderbergh made his film debut with Sex, Lies and Videotape. The film was daring, unnervingly original and made on a budget of just over one million dollars. Its domestic gross of nearly twenty-five million dollars in return heralded a new wave of independent films throughout the 1990s. Twenty-four years later, Soderbergh will retire from filmmaking with Behind the Candelabra, a biopic of pianist Liberace, which doesn't showcase his previous uniqueness and influence as an auteur filmmaker. <br/><br/>The film is a love story, based on Scott Thorson and Alex Thorleifson's book Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace. Yet it is also a surprisingly straightforward and conventional critique of fame and show business, and like we needed any reminding, how distasteful it is. On that level, it is a disappointment. If nothing else however, the film is testimony to how well Soderbergh can still direct actors because in this relationship between Liberace and the much younger Scott Thorson, Michael Douglas and Matt Damon give layered, complex and often funny performances, elevating the film above its conventional story framework. Their characterisation is also complimented by a formal sophistication that imposes thematic insight into their attraction and inevitable fallout. <br/><br/>The project was originally meant to be a HBO movie, until it was granted a cinema release. It traces how in 1977 Scott Thorson (Damon), a trainee vet on a movie set, caught the eye of pianist Liberace (Douglas), who was playing onstage in swanky nightclubs. They moved in together to start a romantic but rather secretive relationship. Scott is allowed to live in luxury, away from his foster family, and is even employed to do stage work too. The relationship unwinds though when Scott finds himself controlled by the hilariously botoxed Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe) and also when he becomes increasingly insecure about Liberace's loyalty to him. Scott eventually cracks under a downward spiral of pills and drugs. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas has throughout the years played men who display great power, wealth and charisma in the public sphere. His work in The American President and Wall Street are among his most renowned feats. As Liberace his work is frank and uncompromised, like a weathered and ageing version of his classic performances. He is note-perfect, playing him as charismatic and flamboyant but also self-absorbed and untrusting of people who he thinks will steal his wealth. This is a reflection of his inner hubris as he believes that his talents are derived from a higher order: ""God looks upon me with special favour,"" he says. High angle shots peer down over the stage, asserting his belief in his appointment from God, as a single figure of attention in the black and gold clubs. Primary colours, including bright glittery red costumes, are judiciously selected, juxtaposed against the darkened theatres and used to imply Liberace's belief in his own personal distinction.<br/><br/>Matt Damon characterises Scott as an increasingly self-conscious and insecure young man, whose relationship with Liberace grows through two kinds of comfort: materialism and emotional cushioning. Liberace's mansion is an intimidating but irresistible prospect compared to the drab and shadowy form of Scott's adopted home. The mansion achieves its own Biblical connotations, stunningly realised through sparkling glassware and high contrast lighting. Liberace also manipulates Scott's loneliness, saying that he could adopt him. ""Maybe I'm your real family,"" he teases. One of the few dramatic peaks in Richard LaGravenese's script is when comfort reveals itself to be personal possession. Liberace seeks to preserve his legacy, not simply by adopting Scott, but by convincing him to undergo surgery so that the two will look more alike.<br/><br/>The changing mood of the relationship is echoed by Soderbergh's camera. Intercuts of Scott's plastic surgery operations are short but violent and shocking. When Scott complains about how suffocating their life is, the frame of the camera binds both men together and then a tracking shot follows them as they walk through the halls of the house to show the constraints of their relationship. Further, rare exterior shots, including brief cuts of the outdoors of a hospital or airport, are grey and empty to suggest the alienating outdoors of celebrity culture. <br/><br/>As rich as the characters are, they are ingrained in a linear, inorganic narrative that lacks exciting detours. Instead, Soderbergh and his screenwriter have used Liberace's affair to retrace much of the same material as the superior Magic Mike, which itself echoed large portions of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights. All three films are about the way that young men are drawn into the gloss and the allure of show business, only to find that it's an ugly world of competition, old heads that won't move on and drug abuse. These are Faustian stories and perhaps personal ones too. Retiring at fifty, Soderbergh is expressing his dissatisfaction with Hollywood and being famous. But it would be more fascinating to learn why an older man, who has overcome the difficult early period of show business with skill and experience, is now deterring himself from the industry."
"lasttimeisaw","7","2","4","29 June 2013"," Behind the Candelabra
","Steven Soderbergh's tentative final film is a biography of Liberace, with the cast of Michael Douglas (his post-cancer comeback) and Matt Damon, it still fails to secure a cinema release in USA, which comes across as a bummer since after BROKENBACK MOUNTAIN (2005, 10/10) and MILK (2008, 8/10), in the mainstream media, gay films haven't yet progressed much thanks to the conservative top brass in the Hollywood. Anyway, trends will change eventually, nothing can stop it, USA made a great advancement several days ago and the rest of the world will follow. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas stuns with his effeminate mimicry (on stage is the lilting rendition) in the film as the world-known pianist, a flamboyant closeted-man, a selfish control-freak obsesses with his complexion and his tabloid news, but he is also a genius player, an apt entertainer, although the taste he denotes is tawdry and grandiose, he is a nouveau-riche would make the rest of the world grudge. Though hobbled by my ignorance of Liberace, Douglas' incarnation is a self- challenging ambition and now an Emmy award is low-hanging fruit for him, and the make-up team too is awesome, both the face-lifting and AIDS-afflicting guises are eyeball-grabbing. <br/><br/>Matt Damon is his Adonis baby-boy Scott Thorson, albeit both him and Douglas are two- decades older than their characters in real age, it is a long-delayed meaty role for Matt, in lieu of the film is based on Scott's own version of the story, he hogs an ever longer screen time than Liberace, one might find him in lack of a sense of queerness in his rough-edginess (by comparison, Boyd Holbrock is more accurate in presenting his allure as another young flesh for Liberace), but the choice itself flouts the stereotype, and Damon runs the gamut of emotions from a naive boy falls for an elder man to a meds-addicted fop cannot get over with his philandering significant other, his best performance so far! <br/><br/>Two highlights from the supporting group, Rob Lowe, whose face undergoes an extreme elevation, plays deadpan humor at its best as the plastic surgeon; the legendary Debbie Reynolds, also stands out as Liberace's mother whose exotic accent and childish playfulness leave a strong impression from her brief stint in the film. <br/><br/>Out of my wayward obstinacy, I put Damon ahead of Douglas regarding the performance, but the film is a well-orchestrated drama, Soderbergh steers clear of any offshoots and centers on the troubled relationship which is tedious but typical in a mundane world. We sneer it on the screen whilst in reality we tread the same water again and again."

","The persecution of gay people in the 20th century had some strange side-effects. Take the career of Liberace, the celebrity pianist, who styled himself according to the most outre social conventions of the gay community, but sued anyone who mentioned his sexuality. Liberace also had a series of semi-contractual relationships with much younger men, which one can see as the sort of thing a certain type of rich person might chose to do, but which surely seemed more natural in a world where a more orthodox relationship was socially prohibited. Steven Sodebergh's film shows us scenes from Liberace's life, but also portrays a very odd person and it doesn't really manage to make us feel sympathetic at a personal level, however much one acknowleges the potentially hostile world he had to navigate. Perhaps a full biopic, showing how he became the man we see in this movie, would have been more revealing."

Damon cannot pass for any younger than mid-30s so it doesn't make sense that he is still supposed to be living with his foster parents in the film. They should have cast an actor in his mid-20s and then it might have been believable. Scott was only 23 when his relationship with Liberace ended, yet they cast an actor two decades older which doesn't make any sense and completely changes the dynamics of the relationship.<br/><br/>The whole production is tacky and low-budget.

Seriously, does the general public need to know about his vanity and preoccupation with looking young? Also please leave out the bedroom love-making scenes between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.

Dan Akroyd and Rob Lowe what were you thinking to pick this movie? I am not too surprised in Michael Douglas since he goes for shocking, violent films, such as Basic Instinct. I am very shocked to see Matt Damon playing this role. He was definitely the wrong choice being 40, since Scott was only 17 when their relationship started. <br/><br/>Probably the younger audience (under 40) does not remember Liberace anyway. Still whatever good name he once had, has been totally shattered. I am of the older generation, who are still offended by this kind of morally degenerate portrayal of a star. I have read other reviews and some young viewers seem to accept this as status quo. So where do we draw the line on what is acceptable and what is not? Today the R-rated movies show every form of love-making and profanity. Nudity is generally accepted. Subjects which were taboo only 20 years ago are now widely included, such as homosexual love-making on the set. Frontal nudity was once excluded, but now we see it all the time. It really scares me to think what will come next. Hopefully, I will not be here anymore to find out. <br/><br/>This is probably the worst review I have ever written. I try hard to find some redeeming light or feature which will help me be fair, but this time there is none to be found."

","Hands downs the worst movie in memory. 2 or 3 notches below the worst soap operas. How could anyone give this a positive review? Matt Damon is 42 years old and played a 17 year old with a two dollar Halloween wig. Even Phil Spector would have been embarrassed to wear it. I really like Matt Damon but this has put a black mark on his resume. I only saw a sickly looking Mike Douglas in his cartoonish portrayal of Liberace. I know Liberace was sort of like a human cartoon himself but really this was either awful or the highest form of camp. If it was camp, it wasn't funny. Every other scene in this movie made me cringe or laugh. Mostly cringe. For a infinitely better portrayal of a gay man see Sean Penn in Milk."

","While he was alive, Liberace did everything he could to prevent his adoring fans (mostly elderly women) from learning that he was gay. 'Behind the Candelabra' focuses on the flamboyant entertainer's private life, particularly on his long-term relationship with his much younger lover, Scott Thorson.<br/><br/>Thorson met Liberace through a mutual acquaintance and gave up on his aspirations to become a veterinarian. Instead, in exchange for material (and sometimes) emotional support, Thorson became both Liberace's lover and personal assistant. Later, Liberace entertained ideas that Thorson could become his adopted son (much to Thorsen's chagrin, Liberace never made this official by signing the legal paperwork).<br/><br/>Early on in this docudrama, Thorson receives a prophetic warning from one of Liberace's former 'concubines', that he too will be discarded by a younger rival. Along the way, Thorson agrees to undergo plastic surgery at Liberace's behest, who seeks to transform the younger man, into the spitting image of Liberace himself. As a result of the surgery, Thorson eventually becomes addicted to drugs, a situation which Liberace comes to despise.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Liberace's penchant for patronizing pornographic shops bothers Thorson, who points out that doing so, could undermine all of Liberace's efforts to remain closeted. The straw that breaks the camel's back is when Liberace tosses Thorson aside for a younger rival, leading to Thorson's big meltdown, where he is unceremoniously escorted from Liberace's mansion, never to return until Liberace's final days.<br/><br/>Take away the fact that this is Liberace, the over the top entertainer, known to millions, the domestic imbroglios between this gay couple, are nothing out of the ordinary. Should we really care when Thorson 'loses it' when Liberace dumps him? After all, it was strictly his decision to live an empty life where an elder benefactor provides all his material wants, at the expense of his own self-satisfaction. And does it really matter who's 'on top', during bouts of anal sex? <br/><br/>Despite the mundane source material, which highlights the couples' self-destructive behavior, there are moments which suggest that both Liberace and Thorson, were at heart, decent people. Take Liberace doing so much for Thorson upon the death of his foster mother (like hiring the chartered plane); by the same token, Thorson is willing to forgive Liberace, and visits him at his deathbed, just as he's about to die from AIDS.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas and Matt Damon do a decent enough job, recreating the roles of the two lovers; but I wonder if it would have been better if two actors who were actually gay, could have brought more to the parts. Debbie Reynolds is great, as well as unrecognizable in the role of Liberace's mother. And director Steven Soderburgh acquits himself well, in presenting this 'warts and all' portrait, of the offbeat showman.<br/><br/>'Behind the Candelabra' may not be everyone's cup of tea not because the material is salacious but rather because it's a bit ordinary. That includes Liberace's music, which to my mind represented a combination of the sublime and the ridiculous. In the end, there's enough here to keep one's interest, but given the subject matter, don't expect any real epiphanies."
"ambala-blogspot","5","2","5","21 June 2013"," an OK flick
","I​ have heard about Liberace and his flamboyant shows and outfits but never really gave it much thought about his sexuality. I suppose I knew he was gay but was not really interested ether in him, his music nor his personal life. But when the film came out I thought it would be in interesting view. And it is. The story is quite depressing: an old queen afraid of being outed, lonesome in his golden cage and a young innocent gay man lured into the light of bling - and we all know what will happen: he'll get tossed as soon as Liberace gets bored. No surprise there then. I find the film well made, acting is superb. All in all I'd like to hear more Liberace's playing and music. Apart from few Chopin clips and his show in the beginning of the film, music is pretty scarce which I find a big minus.​"

","Liberace was a brilliantly gifted Maestro who never disappointed his fans despite the most viciously mean spirited and relentless attacks against Liberace's art, craft & personal life's flaw's. Critics misrepresenting themselves as knowledgeable in music, on any, level, only succeeded in showing their gross ignorance about Liberace's, or anybody's music career. Behind The Candelabra brought Liberace to life again, and humanized him again for his millions of fans who continue to appreciate the Maestro's brilliance in his art & craft. The lifelong dedication Liberace held for his art & craft fearlessly tore down barriers against high art in his quest to bring high art to the masses. Others before him, Chopin, Beethoven, Debussy, Mozart also were persecuted and very misunderstood nor appreciated for their cultural contributions to their art & craft. Mercifully what is most interesting to Liberace's fans here,is not what his critics think & say, that never ceases, as on these very pages here. Dostoyevsky put it best when he wrote in great detail how the masses most despise the art's, they pretend to revere. Maybe Liberace might never be truly recognized as the rosetta stone for piano music, he is. But, if it is not about art, surely it is a love story, and though shallow a love story, let's be honest, its very appropriate since it's not Liberace's point of view, But Scott Thorson's point of view that this story is all about. Also what is not said, is Scott Thorson's predatory penchant for stooping however low necessary to support his lifelong penchant as a dope addict. If were truly honest about pointing fingers then, though Liberace was deeply flawed, so was Scott and in the end the one cancels out the other and were left with a very tragic love story."

","""Mala Noche"" may have given us an equally convincing picture of gay life and exploitation on the streets, but this one takes us into the upper reaches of celebrity. It's believable and grotesque.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that it was based on a book ""by"" Scott Thorson, Liberace's young lover with whom he had a falling out. The reason I'm surprised is that the film, which I'd have expected to be something like ""Sugar Daddy Dearest"", in fact portrays Liberace as a pathetic, sometimes almost saintly, old queen, while Scott Thorson changes from a young naif into a greedy Frankenstein's monster. Until the last scene, that is, when he has an epiphany and realizes what a truly nice guy his keeper was.<br/><br/>Well, we've seen love stories between wealthy older men and younger inamoratas ending in bitterness before. Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone in ""Casino"" were more rambunctious in their separation. And Orson Welles and Dorothy Comingore were more ambiguous in ""Citizen Kane."" This flick follows the same trajectory, yet it's an important film for a number of reasons, aside from the splendid budget. One is that Michael Douglas does a magnificent impression of Liberace, believe it or not. And it's a wise career move. It's the first time we've seen him as anything other than an ordinary bourgeois, his first character role. It's a sagacious choice because Douglas is now a little too old for the usual leads in action or romantic movies. Only occasionally does he go a bit over the top -- not in his lines but in his non-verbal behavior, a little too much fluttering of hands, one mince more than is called for.<br/><br/>And Matt Damon is equally good as the loyal subordinate who becomes the petulant pet. A bisexual (he claims), he begins as an assistant dog wrangler in Hollywood movies, and winds up living in luxury, sipping wine from a tulip glass while naked in Liberace's jacuzzi. Then his increasing use of speed appears to drive him to excesses of an abusive kind, although I suspect that's just a pat explanation for a guy who became greedier as time passed. He has a face lift at Liberace's suggestion and he's not at all turned off by the notion, except that he insists a dimple be put in his chin, like Cary Grant or Michael's father.<br/><br/>The homosexuality isn't bothersome. There is some nudity and some non-explicit depictions of unnatural connections, but so what? We've all been there, one way or another. What makes the film so revolting is the rococo life style that Liberace has chosen for himself with his millions, and the way Damon apparently is awed by it, and the way Liberace himself seems to think it deserves public approbation. ""These columns are real Roman -- ionic."" As the chauffeur Damon is dressed in the outfit of a comic book hero with silver boots. If you thought that the tastes of Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley were as bad as it gets, you need to see this.<br/><br/>The viewer should keep in mind that this is what's called a ""topical biography."" It deals with the relationship between Liberace and Scott. The means some scandalous events are ablated, such as the woman Liberace used as a beard, who, in thrall of hypothetical imperatives, later sued his behind off.<br/><br/>It's competently directed by Soderbergh. The photography layers over almost every scene with pale gold and ivory, giving the impression of viewing an object suspended in an aspic made if Tang. The director steps wrong only twice. A couple of times the camera wobbles and zooms in and out of focus, a repellent fad that I hope is now on its way into the dustbin of history. And the end is a cop out. At Liberace's funeral service, Damon sits in the congregation, evidently in his original persona, no longer a bleached blond with a face permanently altered into a demonic mask. Liberace may not have gone out with much style, but his lover does.<br/><br/>There was, by the way, a terrific legal battle over the possession of Liberace's corpse, each jurisdiction crying for the celebrity that would go with holding onto the dead body. Brushed aside in the film, it's the sort of petty battle that makes someone like Liberace look perfectly representative of the human race."
"sol-kay","Null","2","5","1 June 2013"," Son of Liberace
","The film ""Behind the Candelabra"" covers the last ten years in the life of the great piano playing Valentino Liberace, Michael Douglas, or known as just plain Lee to his friends who at the time was pushing 60 and looking for some new companionship in his life. Liberace found it with 18 year old veterinarian assailant Scott Thorson played by an almost unrecognizable with his hair bleached blond and puffed up cheeks, ""like Marlon Brando in The Godfather"", Matt Damon. It was in fact Scott curing Liberace's pet dog ""Baby Boy"" that really turned him on to Scott who was flattered by the, what he was known at the time and all throughout his adult life, Worlds Greatest Entertainer's personal attention.<br/><br/>Rplacing Lee's two top houseboys Billy Leatherwood and Carlucci, Cheyenne Jackson & Bruce Ramsey, Scott now became his bosses Liberace or Leiber-Archie as his step mom Rose Carracappa, Jane Morris, called him main man in the Liberace household. Things were going great for a while for both Scott and Lee until Liberace like some crazed 1930's and 1940's movie mad scientist decide to make Scott, through cosmetic surgery, into his own image. Liberace hires quack doctor Jack Stantz, Rob Lowe, to work on the very reluctant Scott who was very satisfied with his already God-given good looks to make him look more like himself. The crazy Doc Stantz in fact got Scott addicted on drugs, legal & illegal, that tuned him almost overnight into a street corner drug addict.<br/><br/>Liberace who refused to take responsibility in what he turned his #1 houseboy Scott Thorson into soon got tied of him and the hot and heavy, in and out of bed, relationship between the two started to cool of. After a five year live-in relationship Scott now on the brink of becoming homeless sued his former boss and lover Liberace for 113 million dollars, just a drop in the bucket in Liberace far flung assets, in a ground breaking palimony suite. As things sadly turned out for Scott he ended up getting a meager $95,000.00 together with two beat up cars and two of Liberace's pet dogs in an out of court settlement instead.<br/><br/>It's later when Liberace came down with the deadly AIDS virus that the two former lovers got together for the last time and kissed and made up with Scott promising the dying Liberace that he'll keep his some five year relationship with him secret and out of the public eye. From what I got from all this is that either Liberace was too ill or Scott too hooked on drugs to realize that if the two came to some financial understanding, like having taken care of Scott's money needs, that book written about Liberace's secret lifestyle ""Behind the Candelabra"" by an almost destitute money strapped and drug addicted Scott Thorton, which the film is based on, would have never been written in the first place!<br/><br/>P.S Liberace's fame never wavered even for a moment with his both old and new fans alike. Even in the last year of his life in Liberace having sold out to standing room only every show, some 50 of them, that he did in the fall of 1986 just months before his death. As for his using a candelabra as a prop on his piano that became synonymous with the great Liberace he got that idea from watching the 1945 movie, when he was at the time a completely unknown, ""A Song to Remember"" with Paul Muni Merle Oberon & Cornel Wilde. In fact it was Liberace not the movie that inspired him to put it into his act that made the Candelabra famous!"

Matt Damon was wonderful, he captured the character's overwhelming awe of his predicament. Took me a minute or two to recognize Rob Lowe.<br/><br/>Douglas's Liberace was not nicest guy, clearly, but he was weirdly likable even as he tried to turn Damon's character into a clone of himself.<br/><br/>Very well done.

","I was greatly disappointed in this HBO presentation of Liberace. I was not expecting a bio of the man, but I felt severely hamstrung by the lack of information. There seems to be a contradiction of living to entertain others yet be so self-absorbed and narcissistic while doing it. Its obvious the bulk of this is thru the eyes of Scott Thorson because to be otherwise would usher in much more theory, conjecture, and dramatization. At times, it seems to exhibit Liberace as a victim of sorts then the rest as person absorbed with selfish interest. Michael Douglas is superb at creating a complex character without complexity. As a pianist for 45 years, I can safely say his physical performance on the piano was more accurate than any I have seen in film before, albeit a less flamboyant as Liberace's hand movements were more grandiose. Matt Damon's performance was credible yet strangely despondent and vague. The real stand-out for me was Rob Lowe's representation of Dr. Jack Starz. Although a minor role his presence was commanding and creepy. The production values and directing were very solid, with an award for the make-up artists nearly a sure bet. But overall, the film felt a bit bumpy and disjointed, with little dynamic, and even less, ironically enough, entertainment value."

The two of them really go at it in this film. Of course, the relationship cooled off significantly as the Damon's character goes down rather quickly.<br/><br/>The film certainly showed Liberace for what he was- a nasty, vicious individual.

","Greetings again from the darkness. According to director Steven Soderbergh, this is his farewell to film. He is taking his eye and camera and will concentrate on specialty projects ... at least until he figures out that movie directors make more money (yes, I'm skeptical). This one has been ""in the works"" for years and is based on Scott Thorson's autobiography.<br/><br/>If you don't recognize the name Scott Thorson, you surely recognize his opponent in his 1982 palimony suit ... Liberace. The story recounts how a 17 year old Scott fell under the spell of Mr Showmanship, and didn't leave until 1982. To understand what occurred during those years requires an understanding of the times. The gay culture had not worked its way into mainstream America. Despite his over-the-top flamboyance (on and off stage), Liberace's fans refused to believe he was gay ... or more accurately, refused to even entertain the idea.<br/><br/>Although their actual ages are way out of whack for the story, Matt Damon and Michael Douglas are both exceptional as Scott and Liberace, respectively. Much of this story focuses on Scott, but Douglas' performance is what makes this work. He walks the fine line between predator and protector, lover and louse. When he tells a young Scott that he wants to be his ""Brother, Father, Lover, Friend"", we are nauseated as viewers, while Scott is captivated.<br/><br/>Supporting work comes from Dan Akyroyd as Seymour Heller, Liberace's fixer and handler; an exceptional Rob Lowe as plastic surgeon Dr. Startz; Scott Bakula as one of Scott's first and the one who introduces him to LL; Paul Reiser; Nicky Katt; and Debbie Reynolds ... yes THAT Debbie Reynolds ... who plays Liberace's controlling and creepy mother.<br/><br/>Scott Thorson is really not a very interesting character, though there is no doubt that he and Liberace were exceptionally close for almost six years. The movies have shown us many ""kept"" women over the years, so it's a twist to see a studly young man in the role. The slow spiral into drug addiction and paranoia is not fun to watch, and luckily the movie ends with Liberace's passing due to complications from AIDS. Since then, Mr. Thorson testified against gangster Eddie Nash in the Wonderland murders, and was placed in the Federal Witness Protection program. Of course, his taste of fame would not allow him to live a quiet life and he has since been shot and arrested ... even giving interviews from the Reno jail just one month before the premiere of this movie.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching thanks to the Michael Douglas performance, but also as a reminder of just how much innocence society has lost in the last thirty years. Soderbergh says that no studio would distribute the film because it was ""too gay"". Maybe we haven't progressed so much after all. Luckily HBO picked it up, though that prevents Douglas from being an Oscar contender. Brace yourself for the ""creep factor"". Liberace even tried to legally adopt Scott ... a move that eclipses the wildness of even his costumes, pianos and cars."

","Stephen Soderbergh's putative swan song, Behind the Candelabra, is like an Old Testament prophet's rage against the vanity, corruption and futility of his smug, affluent society. As he's dying of AIDS, Liberace (Michael Douglas) seems like a memento mori. His skull seems too small for his body, as if shrinking away from it. As Soderbergh retells the memoir of Liberace's young lover Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) his recurring theme is the human failure behind the star's sparkling success. <br/><br/>That's the point of the title. Liberace's signature candelabra denotes wealth, brilliance, flash, glamour, romance. The film exposes the darkness that pretence can't dispel. Liberace is an artist who no longer plays for pleasure but for professional performance. He is cashing in on his undoubtable -- but trivialized -- skills. What emotions he pretends to are similarly turned into routines, like the loneliness and pathos by which he seduces his continuing diet of young studs. This appetite proves fatal.

The Liberace Story, starring Mike Douglas as Lee-Berace and
A bleached blonde Matt Damon as his younger lover, with Debbie Reynolds as Liberace'rs mother, also Rob Lowe as a sleazy pretty-boy dietary and beauty advisor looking too young to believe ..
A lush-plush Weinstein production that was surprisingly good1
Viewed at the Pushkin Mozi in Budapest in a nice intimate 77 seat theater.
This is the best work Mike Douglas has done since Wall Street - kind of an amazing comeback for an actor who was on the ropes both career-wise and physically with cancer only two years ago.
Douglas is spot-on as Liberace all the way and Damon is a sufficiently convincing bi-sexual lover. -- 180% removed from his usual Action Hero screen persona.
The film was probably rejected by many people who just couldn't see ordinarily macho heroes like Douglas and Damon on screen as gay lovers, but director Sonderbergh makes the most of this counter to expectation casting.
Damon also played a non action character in Sonderbergh's last film about fragging ...so it looks like Matt is now trying to be accepted as an actor, not just a star.
There is plenty in this pic for the gay audience to chew on but aside from that this is a slam-bang biopic of one of the most flamboyant and popular entertainers of the mid XX century -- now perhaps largely forgotten because sexual gaieté has become so mundane that many may have forgotten how outrageous it was was for a figure so much in the public eye as Liberace was to flaunt it back then. Today this would be a story about gay marriage -- back then the issues were much more complicated.
The pic only deals with the late career of this amazing showman from 1977 to 1985 when he died of AIDS. A newspaper headline announcing the early death of macho actor Rock Hudson Is seen momentarily to underline the fact that LIberace's demise from AIDS marked a turning point in public perception of this plague - especially in the entertainment world.
Douglas is simply excellent -- arguably his best film ever!--but I would attribute Damon's success in portaying a gay to Sonderbergh's deft direction.
The whole picture has class, while it could easily have been a cheap portrayal of a screaming drag queen catering to the Gay&Les crowd, which it most certainly is not!
Some of the nude in bed scenes, man to man kissing scenes and the discussions between the actors of who gets to do whom, and why, in masculine love making, may make some male viewers cringe, but this is one of the many things that makes this picture so true to life -- too true in fact for it to have been the box office smash it should have been. Also, the reconstruction of Liberace's on stage performances in Vegas with some amazing keyboard pyrotechnics is alone ""worth the price of admission"" and Douglas shines in all of these scenes -- to the point where you forget that this is the actor Mike Douglas!
Bottom Line:
One of then best pictures of the year, and Mike Douglas deserves the Best Actor Oscar without a doubt. If he doesn't get it somebody ought to eat their shoe ...
Ps:
Of course he didn't get it because the film barely escaped and was hardly seen by anyone except at scattered art cinemas."

","A film a about Liberace, especially a 'TV movie' would have held no attraction for me to watch. But on hearing it was directed by Soderburgh caught my attention. My jaw dropped with the casting. Michael Douglas as Liberace? What? Really??? Matt Damon as his 'friend'??? Rob Low as the plastic surgeon???? My first thoughts on awareness from this movie, I live in England, was TV movie about Liberace was why would I like trash movies made for cable. Or satellite. Whichever. Not a studio film a HBO movie. All the possibilities just swirled around my mind of a film made about an artist I had little interest in. But the talent involved in cast and crew just kind of nailed it for me. It was a must see. I did not expect much from it because it being a possible disaster actually started to perturb me. Such talent together HAD to make a decent movie. It would be on their filmography forever. Then I watched it. Then I watched it again. And as of now four times this is why. NO SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas was stunning. I was again anxious of him getting the part wrong to become offensive. There was nothing offensive in his role. I was dragged in to the part he was playing not as some people feel how good his acting out of his normal role and this Is Michael Douglas playing this role as I understand some viewers may be distracted by understandably. For me HE WAS Liberace and I was divulged in interest in his life rather than the lurid and offensive things written about his very strange life. The Matt Damon role role and how he would pull off a character he does not normally play from the start opening scenes went very quickly from worry to who is and how the characters life unfolds. Rob Lowe, yes Rob Lowe!, was engrossing as a plastic surgeon to make for the first time from being engrossed to stand back and think is this role deliberately comedic or frightening. Sank in quickly it was both.<br/><br/>The story moves on I think quite slowly for some and I understand that. Personally I was just so engulfed in such complicated lifestyles. With things unspoken or spoken brutally between characters. Things wanted and not received. Love wanted and sometimes hidden, given, retracted and back and jumbled so much you can feel the complexity of life and what we should hide, show, be frightened to show and pushing away the ones we love.<br/><br/>For me it was a rollercoaster of emotion which at times was painful to watch. It made me laugh. But it also made me cry. Both more than once.<br/><br/>Some viewers may be unsettled by explicit sex scenes in movies. If so dont watch. I dont find myself sex scenes offensive, of any sexuality, if in the context of the movie. But we are all different and I would not accuse anyone of being homophobic. But if you watch it you should expect what is shown in the film and not watch it in the first place. I have refrained from looking at other reviews here in case they are homophobic but I know IMDB does not accept such things anyway. I am straight. But live and live. But the point of the movie is not about some big reveal about the sexuality of Liberace. I am still stunned people would watch him live and not be unaware of it??? But again live and let live for them.<br/><br/>In final, yes I know that was long, the film is about life, love, incredible talent and living life under mask of who you really are in the fear of losing your life. And, and I dont call this a spoiler, the effects on your life because of fear, showmanship, grief, loss and unfortunate unknown at that time consequenes.<br/><br/>My only regret of this movie, as in the title of review if you have read this far, it did not qualify for Oscar's. It appears to be becoming a forgotten and hidden gem now. And last regret is I could not give it 11 out of 10."

I know it's a TV movie but with that kind of talent, I was expecting a whole lot more. Maybe I expected too much. The story is a pretty simple one about a naive newcomer falling into a sugar daddy. It's a lot of flash and Liberace provides all the outrageousness that any filmmaker could ever hope for. But the story just doesn't have any surprises. The acting is good. Everybody has a lot of fun playing gay. Matt Damon may be playing innocent a little too much at the beginning. The movie looks fine but there isn't any chance to pump up the excitement.

","Review: This is a great movie which is based around the love story between Liberace and Scott Thorson. The acting is superb and very believable, which gives you an insight into the weird and flamboyant world of Liberace. It's hard to to imagine that people actually lived in a world like this but after watching the documentary on the DVD, it does bring the movie more to life. It's based around the book by Scott Thorson, so a lot of the storyline is true, and the events really did happen. I have always been a big fan of biopics, and this one is definitely one that I would recommend because of the great performances and direction. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Whilst watching this movie it's hard to remember that you are watching actors who have played Bourne and Gecko because of how well they play gay men. The movie really brings the best out of Matt Damon and Michael Douglas who deserve an Academy award for there performances. Even Dan Akroyd, who plays Liberace manager, and Rob Lowe are great in the movie, along with Scott Bakula who is famous for Quantum Leap. The film does make you want to find out more about Liberace because of the world that he created from his amazing talent as a pianist.<br/><br/>Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $2.6million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there biopics which are based around the world of Liberace and his relationship with Scott Thorson. 7/10"
"BadBucks","Null","3","12","28 May 2013"," What A Thorough Disappointment
","With this big name cast, this movie was purely a poorly written, borderline bad Gay Porn movie. The script was amateurish and predictable. Added to wasting Matt Damon's talent and the minimal detailed information regarding Liberace's family and background, it was hugely below par. The continual barking of the dogs in the background was unnecessary. The ending with Liberace playing ""The Impossible Dream"" in a dream like sequence (yes, I know it was meant to be a dream) was laughable and IMHO, disrespectful to both Liberace's memory and the actors' integrity. I'm NOT a prude, but was really looking for much more with the star studded cast and interesting subject matter."

He can be camp, authoritative, confident, loving and in despair all in the same movie. Everything about his performance as Liberace exudes a confident pink flavour. He is so natural and so into the role, that makes me have even more respect for him The make up artists deserve a special mention, as they transform Michael Douglas and Matt Damon with their superb make up skill. Whether it is an older, younger, debilitated or post plastic surgery look, they always look perfect.<br/><br/>Two hours flew by as the story was very engaging.

"jboothmillard","7","1","3","24 October 2017"," Behind the Candelabra
","I had been meaning to see TV made biopic movie for a long time, I knew the celebrity being focused and the lead actor playing him, so I made the effort and finally watched it, directed by Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape; Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Ocean's Eleven, Magic Mike). Basically in 1977, Scott Thorson (Golden Globe nominated Matt Damon) is working as an animal trainer for films, then he meets Hollywood producer Bob Black (Scott Bakula) in a gay bar in Los Angeles, Black urges him to leave his adopted home and search for better paying work. Black introduces Thorson to flamboyant entertainment giant Wladziu Valentino ""Lee"" Liberace (Golden Globe winning Michael Douglas), who takes an immediate liking to the handsome younger man. Liberace invites the two men backstage, then to his luxurious home in Las Vegas, Throson observes one of his dogs is suffering from a temporary form of blindness, with his veterinary experience he offers to help the pianist, the dog is treated. After this, Thorson becomes Liberace's ""assistant"" at the performer's request, Thorson is also hired as his chauffeur, driving a Rolls-Royce limousine, he moves in, and they become lovers. Thorson confesses to Liberace that he is bisexual, he is attracted to both men and women, Liberace is sympathetic, informing him he tried to love women, but was exclusively attracted to men, but he believes that God still loves him. It gradually becomes clear that Liberace is trying to mould Thorson into a younger version of himself, he asks his plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Golden Globe nominated Rob Lowe) to transform Scott's face to resemble his own, and he unsuccessfully attempts to formally adopt him. Thorson becomes increasingly angry and frustrated with Liberace trying to control, and his obsession to publicly hide their romance at any cost, he turns to drugs. In 1982, Thorson and Liberace's relationship is ultimately destroyed, by Thorson's increasing drug abuse, and Liberace's interest in younger men, including dancer Cary James (Boyd Holbrook). Thorson gets his attorney (Whiplash's Paul Reiser) and attempts to sue Liberace for over $100,000,000 of his assets, this results in their formal partnership ending, the lawsuit starts in 1984, but Liberace flatly denies any sexual relationship with Thorson. In December 1986, Thorson receives a call from Liberace that he is very sick, later diagnosed as AIDS, he wishes Thorson to visit him again, he agrees and visits him at his retreat in Palm Springs, there they have one last emotional conversation. Liberace dies in February 1987, Thorson attends his funeral, in which he imagines Liberace performing on stage for one last time in his traditional flamboyance, before being lifted to Heaven with a stage harness. Also starring Dan Aykroyd as Seymour Heller and Debbie Reynolds as Frances Liberace. Douglas gives a powerhouse performance as the blatantly gay, peculiar and charming entertainer, Damon is equally good as his lover, and there is great support from the likes of Lowe and Aykroyd. This is one of the few occasions that a TV made movie could easily have gone to the big screen, the production is fabulous, the costume design is brilliant, the use of colour is splendid, the feel is both eccentric and glamorous, and it is not afraid to be controversial with the subjects of homosexuality and addictions, a most watchable biographical drama. It won the Golden Globe for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television. Very good!"
"Lejink","7","1","3","30 December 2015"," Ivory Tower
","This uncompromising backstage dramatisation of the turbulent relationship between celebrity pianist Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson was a compelling watch. As I watched it, it took a little time for me to get over the sight of Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, two celebrated uber-masculine action heroes playing such camp characters plus their over-familiarity as stars if anything detracts from identification with their parts here but the fact that both absolutely throw themselves into their roles saw them convince me in the end.<br/><br/>Liberace in real-life conducted himself as a family favourite, particularly with his female audience, playing popular piano pieces in cabaret and projecting a debonair if very camp image, on and off-stage, owning the inevitable L.A. mansion, with a grand piano in every room, innumerable fancy cars and of course his elaborate rhinestone-heavy stage costumes. Behind this facade however was a ruthless businessman, determined to preserve his self-image (woe betide the publication which levelled charges of homosexuality at him), in addition a controlling and sexually voracious individual who attended male-only brothels, watched hard-core gay porn and groomed young male wannabes into becoming his latest playmate. Douglas is excellent at portraying his character's at the same time compelling but repellant nature, flaunting his squeaky-clean image in public while living a life of decadent sleaze after hours.<br/><br/>Into his orbit comes a young blonde bisexual country boy called Scott Thorson who very soon supersedes Liberace's then live-in boyfriend, attracted by the older man's charm, riches and power until too late he realises that he's being made over in his lover-employer's image and developing a drug addiction in the process. <br/><br/>The power struggle between the two is fascinating to watch even if it is of course heavily slanted in Liberace's favour. The question here really is did Liberace corrupt and waste a young innocent's life or was Thorson a willing participant in the gravy train, happy to go along with it from the start.<br/><br/>Director Siderburgh I think tends to the former viewpoint, although it's clear that Thorson is no angel himself. On the other hand, Liberace too is no one-dimensional character and it is the older man who calls up the younger as he nears his end from AIDS, fondly remembering their earlier happy times.<br/><br/>I like this ambivalence, allowing the viewer to come to their own judgement on this particular lifestyle of the rich and famous. No corner is cut in exhibiting the pianist's excessive lifestyle although I was grateful that the love scenes between the two, although not ignored, was toned down somewhat for easier consumption. The acting is excellent, especially by the two big-name leads while Rob Lowe steals his scenes with a centre- parting like the Red Sea as a creepy plastic surgeon.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised this film received so many Emmy plaudits and commend the director and cast for taking on a tricky subject and delivering such compelling viewing."

","Ah a bio-pic on the flamboyant self styled ""Mister Showmanship"" and rabid heterosexual Liberace <br/><br/>""Eh hold on Theo . You do realise Liberace was gay don't you"" <br/><br/>Really ? I do remember British tabloid rag The Daily Mirror in the 1950s implied Liberace was gay . They didn't come out and say it in so many words but merely implied it and this led to them losing a libel case . Likewise an American publication from around the same time did the same thing that resulted in the same outcome and Mr Showmanship cried all the way to the bank to cash those cheques . In other words he was an utter hypocrite who spent much of his life living a massive lie . How'd he get away with it ? I'm reminded of a BBC documentary from many years ago called REPUTATIONS where Bob Monkhouse told of a time where he revisited an ATV studio after a gap of four years and remembered everyone by name and asked how they and their relatives were . He remembered each and everyones name and the names of their relatives . As Monkhouse stated ""There wasn't a single person in the studio who didn't gasp wow what a guy"" . Liberace had that sort of cheesy charm that propelled him to if not superstardom then at least to showman fame . He understood who and what his audience was and made the most of it <br/><br/>BEHIND THE CANDELABRA was many years in the making but kept being delayed because director Steven Soderberg couldn't decide how to tell the story . I'm afraid in my opinion it shows to an extent . It's not an affectionate love letter to its subject but at the same time it's not the schlocky campfest that it hints it might become . You want someone playing Liberace then who better to play him than Michael Douglas in what must be the most challenging role of his career . And get him to play the role by wearing a wig that wouldn't look out of place perched on top of Gary Glitter's bald head . Douglas has a whale of time playing the role and while he's not exactly channeling the dead spirit of Liberace it does capture the opulent over the top camp nature of Mister Showmanship and one did hope at this point the film would just throw its hand in and have the rest of the film continue in the same way . Unfortunately the story uses Scott Thorson's book as its source material and when Damon - equally cast against type - the film has a rather serious tone that's maybe a bit too respectful . It's a tragic story but one might have hoped for a bit more tragic-comedy"

","Although it got very good reviews I didn't watch this film when it was released (as indeed it was in the UK, where it got a cinema release). I really didn't know much more about Liberace than his name and reputation, and to be honest didn't see any reason to really know more. I still felt that way before and after the film but despite this I did think ti was a really well crafted film that is worth seeing. Based on the autobiography of one of the two main characters, Candelabra follows the relation of Liberace and his young lover Scott Thorson. In doing so we see what type of person we have and generally how things went.<br/><br/>I say generally because it is never a film that really gets inside the characters and explores them so much as it explores the events and broad flamboyant strokes. On that level it doesn't have much going for it but in the broad strokes it is quite excellent. The basic narrative is full of color and is engaging throughout as we see Scott go down the well- worn path that it was obvious he always good. Seeing this journey and then the added conclusions of Liberace is what makes the film work and it has a lot going on, with a sense of the flamboyant and comical throughout.<br/><br/>Stylistically the film embraces the period and the lifestyle, with great sets, costumes, characters and sequences. The cast equally latch onto this. Douglas is great; really good energy and presence, and he is able at least to find a person in there that the script doesn't do as much to help him with. Likewise Damon is very good despite the person getting lost in the broad strokes. Support is mostly equally fun â€“ particularly a turn from Rob Lowe, but the cast is deep in names and faces with Bakula, Aykroyd, Koechner, Reiser and others all getting the tone of the film.<br/><br/>There may not be a lot of insight in here, but it is a film that has a great broad stroke and delivers it well, from the design of the film through to the performances. Well worth a look for what it does well, even if it is limited in certain areas."

Unfortunately nobody will win an Oscar for any thing to do here because it was a TV movie in the 'States. Internationally it was released successfully in cinemas. With excellent and humorous production values, a lot also filmed in the Liberace museum and home and with some key scenes lifted directly from his awful 1955 romantic drama SINCERELY YOURS, Soderberg's terrific and emotional film literally 'hits all the right notes' for me and ends up being quite a moving experience. Ghastly behavior, petty jealousies and a wry eye for the outrageous, BEHIND THE CANDELABRA would have been a serious Oscar winner had it made the cinemas and not cable. What Damon and Douglas agreed to do nude in this film is as astonishing as the story itself. It is hilariously explicit and with jaw-dropping costumes they clearly enjoyed making this film. Imagine LA CAGE AUX FOLLES in Palm Springs with grand pianos. Great to also see Debbie Reynolds aged 80 on screen still as Momma, hamming it up and celebrating over 50 years as a headline actress."

It shows us some of Liberace's musical talent, his real life, his inner sanctum and his extraordinary world. The plot is simple and age old: man meets boy, man gets boy, man ruins boy, man throws damaged boy away. (If Liberace could see this movie, he'd be spinning in his grave.) <br/><br/>This movie was made by an A-list director at the peak of his career. Two superb lead actors and a number of other outstanding supporting actors deliver truly astonishing performances. I would be shocked if these actors were not awarded.<br/><br/>In addition to the juicy biographical details about Liberace and his sordid dalliances with boys four decades younger than him, this movie has important things to say about Hollywood, American celebrity culture, extreme wealth, certain aspects of gay life and gay relationships (well, some anyway), and indeed relationships in general.<br/><br/>I haven't read Thorson's book, but this movie felt honest to me. Yes, this movie is about a ""rich old closet queen"" and a ""hustler"", but the film forces us to see how meaningless these labels are. (I suppose this was cinematically done long ago for their straight equivalent roles.) I can't think of another movie that focused on the sexual aspects of a gay relationship (albeit a very dysfunctional one) as much as this one did. I'm glad Soderbergh gave the role to the droolworthy Damon, who most certainly nailed it. This movie would have been a lot more uncomfortable to watch if a real 17-year-old had played Thorson. In this film, the absurd relationship between Liberace and Thorson is made believable and not so absurd.<br/><br/>The movie did not blow me away, nor did it impress me sufficiently to give it a higher score than 8.5 or so -- but I'm not sure why.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Scott Thorsen (Matt Damon) was a young, naive farm boy who worked on movie sets, before he was introduced one night to entertainment giant Liberace (Michael Douglas) after a show, and became his lover, spending the late 70's and early 80's in his life before he was tumultuously thrown out, only to get his own back with a tell all book about their time together, before a brief reconciliation before Liberace's death in 1987.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh's latest high profile biopic, which essentially serves as a temporary resurrection of a man who was once as big as Elvis or Sinatra, has managed to prove controversial for any number of reasons, not least of which was the casting of Matt Damon as a young man of eighteen, despite being 42 years of age himself. The first high point the movie strikes is pulling off the incredible feat of genuinely managing to make Damon look this age, a real masterstroke from the make up/lighting department. All the same, in a still largely conservative America, the film was deemed ""too gay"" for mainstream cinema goers, despite it's massive Oscar potential, and only managed to make it as a HBO TV movie, and doesn't manage to hide it's production values quite so convincingly. Some of the greatest sadness's are caused by a nonsense, since it's ridiculous to think most Americans wouldn't be forward thinking enough to enjoy this lavish, touching and highly impressive true life story.<br/><br/>In the main roles, Douglas and Damon very bravely cast aside their tough guy personas to portray the original Elton John and David Furnish, only in a day and age where this kind of relationship had to be kept completely behind the scenes rather than plastered all over the front page of OK! Magazine, and it's testament that they manage to play them so well. As Liberace, Douglas captures the gay mannerisms and styles perfectly, showcasing a flamboyant character it seems inconceivable anyone could doubt was gay nowadays. He evokes a gentle innocence and dislike of confrontation, juxtaposed with a thin line between whether he has genuine love for Scott or a filthy, perverted lust. Meanwhile, Damon is explosive as the emotionally volatile, needy, unworldly wise Scott, who is never completely able to lose his affection for Liberace despite the worst treatment. Like a dog, the worse he's treated, the more he loves, though with this in mind it still doesn't take away from a deeply tender and heart-breaking ending.<br/><br/>This isn't the type of movie I'd go out my way to see, but with nothing else on and being quite a fan of the lead star, I gave it a go and think I spent my time well. If the lead stars don't provide enough dramatic dynamism for you, there's still a lively supporting cast including Rob Lowe, Dan Ackroyd and Scott Bakula to ensure the characters working in the background for the main characters also get their less pivotal, but still highly relevant, inclusion. ****"

That all changed when he met Liberace. The small town boy became a drug addicted, paranoid, and revenge obsessed man. I wasn't totally sure what to expect from this movie. I knew very little about the real Liberace and nothing about this story at all. The movie shows the rise and fall Scott and the extreme things he goes through for the man he loves.

Then the reviews started coming in, gushing about how good he, and the movie, were, how thoughtful and reflective his performance was, how Matt Damon worked as a his foil.<br/><br/>So I knew that I had to overcome my Douglas-phobia and venture forth boldly to my local cinema to see what all the fuss was about. And I have to say, the gushing reviews weren't wrong and Michael Douglas in particular nails a fantastic performance as Lee, resisting the temptation to play his role for cheap laughs or high camp and instead delivering a tender, human, thoroughly convincing portrayal of a man who combined complexity and simplicity it would appear as key character traits.<br/><br/>Matt Damon similarly inhabits his role as Scott, the slightly confused and bedazzled young lover, who learns the pain of the real world in a slowly creeping and shabby way. Their relationship is the key to this film, to the point that it almost struck me that what you're seeing is some kind of glamorous kitchen sink drama at heart, with an increasingly angry young man railing against the unfairness of everything, without having the ability to see how he is an architect of his own misfortune.<br/><br/>Support performances are all strong, even though they are also incidental to what's at the heart of the story in many ways. Rob Lowe in particular as the plastic surgeon shines and impresses with his bizarre visage. The look of the 70's is spot on, the script bowls along at a good pace, and the tender way that proceedings are wrapped up bought a tear to my eye and a lump to my throat. A beautiful heartfelt warm movie that will make you smile and lets you sneak behind the sequins to a real human show."

","Being forcefully persuaded into seeing a film when you have no interest or knowledge of it is one thing; but to then be pleasantly surprised at your own delight and enjoyment of that very same film is certainly another. Behind the Candelabra follows the contextually tragic moments in the life of the musical entertainer Liberace, and unfortunately is likely to remain somewhat of a hidden treasure due to its limited release. The cinephiles that are fortunate enough to discover it beneath the grains of less humorous, less glamorous and less genuine cinematic offerings (which all still garner abundantly more popularity) will hopefully have discovered a truly refreshing gem of a drama film.<br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra is a HBO Films production that has been reserved to a US television release as well as a limited European exhibition, due to its thematic content being ""too gay"" as director Steven Soderbergh articulated. This devastating justification from the Hollywood studios for not picking up the film is as tragic as Liberace's own fear for the economic impact and public reputation that he believed he would see diminish if his personal life were to be known. Sadly, as the majority of fans probably never knew of Liberace's true personality, today's majority will not have the pleasure of witnessing this pure and remarkably emotional biographical film.<br/><br/>Despite the film itself being projected on screen, Soderbergh's true intentions are for the emotion of the film to be directed and projected onto us: the audience. Behind the Candelabra is truly enjoyed and experienced as a collective group with every other cinemagoer in the room, though you yourself will forget there is another soul in the theatre due to the emotionally investing 118 minute feature in front of your eyes that takes you away from your own reality and places you in an interpretation of Liberace's. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas' magical performance as the once internationally renowned entertainer captivates your consciousness with his electric charm, fabulously worn costumes and overall tremendous acting ability. Douglas' performance however only constitutes 50% of the relationship that the film revolves around, and is irrelevant without Matt Damon's pivotal and magnificent portrayal of Liberace's other half, Scott Thornson. The relationship they share, IS the film. Without the two talents to confidently and charismatically carry Thornson and Liberace into the 21st century, the film would certainly fall apart and lack the sense of purity that the two actors manage to organically create as they collaborate. It is a great sadness to see the relationship stumble over avoidable hurdles, and conversely a thing of beauty to see the non- fictional characters high jump over obstacles to sustain their romance. <br/><br/>Other features of the film greatly supplement the focal relationship and characters to a quite notable degree. While Douglas and Damon certainly carry the film, Soderbergh piles other cinematic elements atop of the actors' hands which make for a visually and audibly delightful experience. The costumes, sets, locations and most emphatically the soundtrack are powerfully incorporated to give Soderbergh's film an enjoyable charm, and while only supplementary to the core relationship, they are distinctly memorable due to their grandeur through both sight and sound.<br/><br/>The only thing lacking in Behind the Candelabra is that there is nothing negative to criticise about the film. This is a rare feature of any motion picture, and it is the result of great filmmaking. Behind the Candelabra is consistently purposeful from one scene to the next. It is subtly humorous when appropriate, tragically emotional on cue and ultimately continuously engaging throughout. While it may not receive the attention it deserves, Behind the Candelabra remains amongst the best of the opening half of this year's film releases that I have seen, and particularly is the most genuine and purposeful."

","From the very beginning of the film I knew this was going to be a rock solid drama. The trailer is completely accurately gives you a sneak peak into a great film that has all you want; believable acting, costumes, setting, musical performance and surprisingly comedy.<br/><br/>There are sex scenes to those you might be ambiguous about seeing this movie. They are quite tolerable as you don't see any penetration or anything too vulgar. There is one scene with Matt Damon onto top of Michael Douglas that is quick and not graphic. Most of the sex is discussed or occurs of screen.<br/><br/>Mostly surprisingly as I mentioned before is the comedy element. It is not obvious if it was intentional or a result of us now knowing what these well dressed men were up to. Either way Rob Lowe's stiff facial expressions are poignantly funny.<br/><br/>If you have any interest in seeing this film I highly recommend that you do see it. Films like these don't come along that often; it gives shows us Liberace's lifestyle, his showmanship, the nature of gay relationships in the 70's & 80's, and has a respectfully emotional ending."

","For me Douglas and the cameo by Rob Low steal the show.<br/><br/>This gave me insights into a man I really knew nothing about or had anything in common with, but I could relate to his need for excess. Having what he had was never enough, and always wanting more.<br/><br/>A friend of mine always says to me ""your needs will be met, but your wants will never be met!"" This for me sums up Liberache's life.<br/><br/>It was also interesting that his avid following of middle aged housewife's never realised he was gay. When a comment is maid about ""a pair of queens!"", the person making the comment is given a stern look.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's character is interesting as well, but I think he just is overwhelmed by some of the performances mentioned above. I also didn't recognise Dan Ackroyd.<br/><br/>I also think the facial special effects person on this film should get an Oscar.

"Quinoa1984","8","1","4","7 November 2014"," imperfect, but for what it achieves it's absorbing
","Michael Douglas gets into this character - whether he IS Liberace, well, he is still a character in a movie ultimately, however true he may be to real life - is remarkable. Douglas has been playing characters for decades that have been like the 'Lover Man' types, the leading man with swagger and presence who you believe would have women flocking to him (Glenn Close, Sharon Stone in his prime, I'm sure there's more). Now he's in his 60's, but he's playing Liberace without missing a beat or stopping to go for broke, which is what Steven Soderbergh as director and Richard LaGravanese as writer goes for. This is a dark, flamboyant character with more layers and depth than it would appear on the surface. You might just look at Liberace and see a control freak (or just a freak in general), a megalomaniac, and an egotist, and that's in the first half. But it's his relationship with this guy Scott, played by Matt Damon, that makes it a full-blown character study and, in fact, a failed tale of romance and fame.<br/><br/>Soderbergh captures the glitz and glamour, and the horror of this world too. Scott, as played by Matt Damon in a, frankly, slightly miscast role. Maybe ten years ago, when this film was planned, it would have worked, but Damon is now in his 40's, and he doesn't look or act quite young enough, much as he might try and it's sad to say as it's the only time he hasn't fully worked with this filmmaker. And yet, the writing and storytelling helps a bit, and when it comes time for Scott, who becomes Liberace's intense lover and confidant (for the most part) and almost his second in command at times, there's one last thing: he has to look... better for his old musical genius of a lover. So, plastic surgery.<br/><br/>This was one of the things that stuck with me the most, how a person can change so drastically in such a landscape as in show-business - especially that around Las Vegas in the 70's and Liberace and that whole ball of wax - and change their look like THAT. Oh, and lest not forget Rob Lowe, who is so incredibly funny and horrifying at the same time to LOOK at. There's more cringe-comedy following the surgery, and the peaks and valleys of this relationship of this May/December romance. Soderbergh seems to be not shying away from the gaudy spectacle that was this world that Liberace had set up - and, ultimately, ended in tragedy for him, not altogether one he didn't bring on himself - but he shoots it with a level of class and sophistication; it's not too gaudy (though the color orange and red and yellow fix their way into the palette of the director's cinematography).<br/><br/>In other words, the movie looks really good, the finale, especially if this had been Soderbergh's 'final' movie, is quite a way to go out, and the acting delivers on the sordid details making them feel palpable and, for as much as this kind of lurid and tempestuous narrative goes, real and full of hurt. Even as Damon, as I mentioned, doesn't totally work, he still tries to give it his all and it matters still. Douglas, after all, can't be as good as he is without some support, and at the least he's bringing his A game here. I don't know where it rests in this director's filmography, but it's up there as one of his toughest dramas and darkest comedies in one package. Oh, and get ready to SING! No, not really, but there's music a plenty here, and some of it, as kitschy as it is... it kind of works for how Soderbergh shoots it.<br/><br/>Or, to put it another way - if a character from an 'Ocean's' movie took a left turn in the 70s, they could wind up in the dark corridor of... a Las Vegas concert room. So it goes."

","It's hard to imagine super-spy Jason Bourne in a sparkly thong, throwing a hissy-fit at his older male lover. Perhaps that's why Matt Damon's performance has got him quite a lot of praise for his portrayal of the young man (Scott Thorson) who lived (and loved) Hollywood icon Liberace. Michael Douglas too is on fine form as the man himself, displaying the voice and the mannerisms of the flamboyant entertainer to a tee.<br/><br/>It's a 'rise and fall' tale of love that was probably doomed from the start. It's based on the 'kiss and tell' book that Thorson wrote once Liberace had died, so we only have his word on it that this is the 'truth.' But, truth or not, it's an entertaining piece of tragic drama that allows both him and Douglas to put in some stellar performances.<br/><br/>It probably isn't for everyone. If you look at internet message boards, you'll see a fair few people who found it 'overly gay' in subject matter. However, if that sort of thing offends you, you really shouldn't even be considering watching a semi-biopic about a gay couple's life."

I mean wow...what talent...Until this film, I hadn't realized what incredible range Michael Douglas.<br/><br/>What may be surprising to most is that being so wealthy and not all that good looking really, Liberace had no shortage of boy toys at his disposal. Not all of them were prostitutes.<br/><br/>The film dramatically chronicles the dramatic twists, nightmares and pleasures he ran into when he got into a relationship with a 16 year old known by the name of Scott Thorson.

","Beyond the Candelabra <br/><br/>With a subject as over the top as Liberace, one would expect an element of caricature to be unavoidable in a film about any part of his life, let alone the last years that received so much publicity throughout the world. Instead, this film gives the viewer a fully realized human being flaws as well as fine points. Liberace is fully formed in the beginning of the film. Still growing is Liberace's companion, Scott who transforms from the somewhat naive rube into a man who has become accustomed to the extravagances of wealth commingled with tinges of fame. The actors responsible for these two men's portrayals are simply amazing. Michael Douglas allows himself to be changed chameleon-like into the aging, smothering, sometimes disingenuous, and always entertaining Liberace. Matt Damon brings vulnerability, acquiescence, and disenchantment to the role of Scott Thorson. This film, while giving the viewer enormous excess in so many areas costumes, interior design, personal adornment, sexual encounters. creates a genuine world, no matter how flawed and filled with intrigue, that is inhabited by real people. The film does not let up. The film does not shy away from the impolite or trashy. Innuendo has no place here. The reality of these lives and their lifestyles simmer with humanity, shortsightedness, and betrayal. Michael Douglas, known from The Jewel of the Nile through Fatal Attraction to Wall Street, completely transforms himself into the persona of Liberace. He is magnetic in both directions he attracts and then he repulses. He welcomes and then he rejects. He proclaims a Catholic spirituality and a sexual baseness with the same intensity and cinematic truth. His Liberace is sometimes hard to take, but always fascinating; his love for Scott is at once stifling and one sided and yet compelling and understandable. His larger than life public image is contrasted neatly with his sometimes small minded attention to the details of daily living. The one overriding aspect of this film is the depiction of the time: open, rebellious, and exploratory but colored by Liberace's attempt to deny his very being for the sake of the primitive attitudes of his conservative fan base. The film in some respects is as much about the man Liberace as it is about the social mores of that era. This film at some points is hard to take, but its refined grittiness never lags, and the viewer is continually pulled forward in this extravagant, sumptuous, and intense production.<br/><br/>24 Aug 2014"
"MacTheMovieguy","9","1","4","23 July 2014"," Douglas slips seamlessly into Liberace's soul for this spot on performance.
","Is it possible for a movie to be ""too gay"" for mass audiences? Especially for a Michael Douglas/Matt Damon film directed by Steven Soderbergh that seems primed for awards consideration? A movie so good, it premiered at Cannes, despite being a TV movie? Well, the truth is that Steven Soderbergh couldn't get any studios to bite on Behind The Candelabra, so he went to HBO. And HBO is enjoying all the free publicity for what is arguably one of their best originals of all time.<br/><br/>Behind The Candelabra is based on the book written by Scott Thorson, who in the movie is played by Matt Damon. Scott chronicles his great romance with Liberace (Michael Douglas), from the moment his current boyfriend introduces him to the piano great. Scott, only 19 at the time, falls immediately for Liberace's charm, and is seduced into Liberace's flashy lifestyle. Liberace leads Scott into his life, almost like a lion would with a gazelle. Slowly, Scott is picked apart, turning to drugs, and having his face reshaped to look more like Liberace, all with the promise of being Liberace's forever boyfriend (and in one creepy segment, also his son).<br/><br/>But somehow, in some segments, Liberace and Scott manage to seem like a real married couple, despite all the insanity. Liberace really does care for Scott, and Scott adores Liberace. It's a doomed relationship, for sure, but you find yourself oddly pulling for these two, hoping they'll mend their differences. In the end, when Scott is alone and has nothing, Liberace reaches out to him one last time, and that final goodbye is the most powerful moment in the film, because of all the hard work they've put in leading to this point. Sure, Liberace may be a sex crazed maniac, and Scott was a drug addict, but these two complete each other.<br/><br/>None of this would be made possible if it wasn't for the astounding acting by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. Douglas slips seamlessly into Liberace's soul for this spot on performance. I had to go back and youtube some Liberace to make sure, but Douglas does a fantastic job mirroring the mannerisms, and sounding like Liberace. Balancing the line between being a complete creeper and an endearing, loving partner seems to be easy for Douglas. It must have something to do with Damon's acting as Scott. Tasked with trying to act 19, and going from being a naive teenager, to a naive lover, to a naive drug addict, Damon attacks the role with explosive intensity. Even in the small quiet moments, Damon's stare cuts through your TV with precision. You can always feel Scott's emotions through the entire film. Really, it's Damon at his best too.<br/><br/>Backed by a surprisingly good supporting cast, including Rob Lowe in a role that should win someone a makeup award, as well as Dan Aykroyd, Debbie Reynolds, Cheyenne Jackson, and Scott Bakula, Behind The Candelabra is the kind of quality filmmaking that can really change the game in terms of the projects attracted to the medium. What Steven Soderbergh, in his final directorial effort, understood about Liberace is the ultimate truth in all of us. All Liberace wanted was to love and be loved, he just lived in an entirely different world than the rest of us. And for a brief moment, Scott lived there too."
"phubbs","9","1","4","8 November 2013"," Behind the Candelabra
","Oh my shame on me, I actually thought this was a parody or spoof comedy about these extravagant Vegas performers like Siegfried and Roy hehe. Turns out this is actually a biopic of the ultra extravagant piano performer Liberace. The film is based on a book/memoir written by the young man Liberace fell for, Scott Thorson, and dissects his close relationship with the homosexual pianist. You may need sunglasses for some sequences within this film...high levels of glitter and sparkle warning!.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert (of sorts), if you're uncomfortable with homosexuality on screen then this film might not be for you. I was actually surprised at the level of gritty realism this film portrays, I wasn't expecting it, but sure enough Soderbergh doesn't beat around the bush. In all honesty you can tell straight away its gonna be edgy, the question is can you handle seeing a skinny makeup laden Michael Douglas and a chubby tarted up Damon going at it? oh and there's also a highly gay Scott Bakula looking like one of his 'Quantum Leap' characters...remember that?.<br/><br/>I know nothing of Liberace, I grew up when he was still around and big and I do recall seeing him on TV here and there as my folks did like him for his classical skills. After a a little research I was stunned to discover how accurate and well portrayed everyone was in the film. Douglas should be in line for an award of some kind for this performance, its only when you see the real Liberace and then you see Douglas that you realise how damn good he is. Of course he is imitating the man but his mannerisms, body movements/gestures and general overall idiosyncrasies or quirks are brilliantly conveyed. I won't deny it is kinda creepy to watch Douglas at times, his wiry, leathery reptilian- like looks covered in tonnes of glittery makeup whilst clad in some cringeworthy flamboyant attire that a fat Elvis wouldn't say no too...its enough to make you gag at times. Must say he looks terrible with the bald cap on and his aging flabby torso, yikes!.<br/><br/>Quick point: I have no idea how they did the live piano sequences but trust me it looks damn good. I'm sure Douglas isn't playing the piano but blimey it looks like he is! very impressive scenes.<br/><br/>At the same time Damon is also fantastic in his role and looks just like the real Thorson. I'm unsure if his mannerisms are the same as I found no real footage of the man but he looks the ticket. Again its creepy to watch Damon at times, the lavish makeup, camp behaviour, full blown kissing and tight sparkly revealing underwear...its all very errrm...homosexual. Not that that's a bad thing of course, its just an extreme eye opener to see these two fellas going at it and acting this way.<br/><br/>I did enjoy seeing how Liberace carried on I must admit, to see his previous bit of fluff whom he gets rid of for Damon's character. The way the previous bit of fluff knew exactly how Liberace behaved because he'd seen it all before and knew his time was up, he was old hat. I liked the rather camp house boy Liberace had around the mansion and the fact he knew about Liberace's devious ways, Dan Aykroyd's rather blunt and gruff manager character and a round of applause to Rob Lowe as the seedy slimy plastic surgeon/drug dealer. <br/><br/>'Hey Scott, why don't you stay outta my f**kin business, now give me back to Lee'<br/><br/>The level of narcissism shown by Liberace to actually have Thorson's face altered to look more like his own was pretty eerie really. The fact that Thorson agreed and the way everybody carries on about it in the film is like a car crash, you just can't look away!. Its in these sequences where Lowe really shines plus it shows us the indulgence and vanity shown by all involved. Yet despite that you do feel Liberace cared very much for Thorson, there was true love there. Unfortunately being involved in show business meant real feelings could get smothered very easily with egocentric behaviour...as displayed by Thorson at the end.<br/><br/>I think lavish and flamboyant are the key words here, everything about the film (and this man's life) is just that. The sets are tremendously well created and really show how this man lived, more eye openers folks!. All the costumes and props seem to have been recreated to the tiniest detail, not only that but sequences from his real shows appear to have been recreated too. If you check some of Liberace's You-Tube clips out you'll see how pinpoint these sequences have been made, I really can't falter anyone involved with this production.<br/><br/>The story is very familiar really, it could be any relationship between any two people male and female, a simple tale of mistrust, lying, promiscuity and wealth. Towards the end the film does become quite sad in all honesty, you do come to like Liberace and his squeaky tones, you know Thorson did care about him deep down and at the very end the gifted performer is given a nice send off and rightly so. You can see what will happen a mile away its very easy to predict all the way through, but the ride to get there is undeniably a show stopper.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Based on the autobiographical novel, the tempestuous 6-year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover, Scott Thorson, is recounted. Scott, a young man raised in foster homes, is introduced to flamboyant entertainment giant Liberace and quickly finds himself in a romantic relationship with the legendary pianist. Swaddled in wealth and excess, Scott and Liberace have a long affair, one which Scott eventually begins to find suffocating. The life of a celebrity who only prefers other men at a time when being a homosexual was completely ridiculed at and it meant a complete destruction of one's career.<br/><br/>I didn't know about Liberace before watching the movie. He's highly talented and is a legend, but his taste in clothes and lifestyle is awful. Flashy and expensive to be sure, but seriously revolting. There's nudity and several suggestive moments, but these scenes are done well and its a shame that many will give this one a pass because of the subject matter. I'm a heterosexual guy and it didn't bother me. Its surprising that this story is from Thorson's autobiography because it apparently portrays Liberace as a very sympathetic character although he's a very nasty individual and saw his young lovers as pets, while Thorson's own character turns from a genuinely likable, naive young man to a greedy coke head. But, even so, we can't make judgements based purely on one man's word since Liberace wasn't around to refute his claims when the book came out. Betty White's statement makes one think that maybe Thorson's account of the events are probably true for the most part.<br/><br/>The acting is sublime with Michael Douglas finally taking a leap to genuine character roles and completely personifying Liberace. Though Scott isn't very interesting as a character, Matt Damon takes a masterful turn as the young lover. The makeup, special effects and cinematography takes years off his face and makes him look a lot younger than he is, but don't look for miracles and expect him to look like he's 20. Both Douglas and Damon should be applauded for taking on these roles. Their tender moments are unabashed and unapologetic. Dan Akyroyd is the fixer Seymour Heller, Rob Lowe as plastic surgeon Dr. Startz is just brilliant and Debbie Reynolds plays Liberace's creepy, controlling mother. For now, this is supposed to be the last directorial venture for Soderberg in feature films. Though it isn't completely captivating, it is quite competently made. The elaborate sets, the campy humor and the enigma of Liberace makes it worthwhile and the acting is a treat to behold.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Steven Soderbergh is on fire. For someone who has ended his big screen career, he is still kicking ass. His ""final"" big screen effort, Side Effects, is the best movie of the year so far.

For someone who is quitting, it seems as if he's not going anywhere.<br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra has been in development for quite some time, but yet studios were afraid to bring it to theatres. Why? Because they were afraid it was too gay. That alone is something to admire about Soderbergh's film. The fact that he actually brought it to life. But it's not just him that brings it to life. The actors also bring it to life.<br/><br/>The film tells the bizarre true story of Vegas performer Liberace (Michael Douglas, in easily one of his best performances), and his odd relationship with Scott Thorson (Matt Damon, also giving one of his best performances). Scott went to work for Scott, and then they turned into lovers, and Liberace even forced Scott to get plastic surgery to look like him.<br/><br/>What also helps Behind the Candelabra is the side roles. Rob Lowe shows up (nearly unrecognizable) as Liberace's alien-like plastic surgeon. Dan Aykroyd plays Liberace's publicist. I loved this movie. Basically, i had a hard time tearing my eyes away. This is an unbelievable story that really needed to be told, and, shockingly, Nobody could have pulled it off better than this team.<br/><br/>If Soderbergh is at the end of his career, then it really has been a great one. He's a filmmaker who is never afraid to push the limit, and this film is an example of that. This couldn't have been an easy movie to make, but they really pull it off. This is a powerful, occasionally hilarious, and excellently acted biopic that should go to theatres. See it, if at all possible.<br/><br/>A-"

","I have just come home after seeing this and found this was made for TV I was thoroughly engrossed with the whole thing Michael Douglas in the star role apparently not eligible for an academy award because it is for TV is simply ridiculous he is thoroughly believable cast as Liberace<br/><br/>Matt Damon I was not aware was even in the film until later on .The blonde hair being enough to throw me also combined with my lack of knowledge of the cast . You know how the relationship is going to end from the start shown when Scott appears, Liberaces last conquest is fired freeing up a role on the staff for Scott. I was uncomfortable I am afraid to say with some of the kissing but how can you portray the relationship betwenn these two characters with no kissing or physical contact Very brave roles for both actors respect given the further the film progresses the more their physical relationship becomes more acceptable This film i believe is trying to show reality and does not try to humiliate the subjects.It deals with the human side of being a superstar and is itself an insight into a lifestyle almost on par with royalty while neither approving or disapproving . Go watch it the acting and cast are just superb Try not to look look at the cast either see if you can recognise them as they appear throughout the film. Two big stars on top of their game both pushing their boundaries make this compelling viewing."

","Okay, I want you to put yourself in the place of the actors in this film. If there were scenes in this movie that made you squirm and look away from the screen, imagine how it felt for Douglas and Damon. Those two gave their all for this picture and did an outstanding job. Is it the best movie ever made? No, but those two pulled it off without a flinch and made their way through scenes that surely made them uncomfortable and embarrassed. The story line flowed very well and gave us an in-depth look into the life of Liberace, which was flamboyant, disturbed and tragic. Douglas and Damon each deserved an Academy Award for their performances in this film. It's not really the film itself that rates 10 stars, but the performances alone elevated it to that level for me."

","As a child I remember Liberace popping up from time to time on TV. Somehow even back then there was something ""unsettling"" about the man. It had nothing to do with his sexuality, as I child that mean't little to me. What I do remember is thinking the facade the man presented to the world hid something rather sad and empty. <br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra, offers up an image of Liberace as a man who appears to have everything but, in fact, has nothing. Liberace as he admits himself, is a marketing product, Lee as he prefers to be called, worked very hard to create. <br/><br/>There is too, no denying the man's musical talent or his intellect. His sharp humour and insight can not easily be dismissed. That said, for all his material success, his glitzy shows, expensive cars, overstated mansions and young paramours, Liberace was a lonely, isolated figure. <br/><br/>Liberace is a victim of his own success and the times he lived in. He can not openly admit his sexual preferences for fear of losing his career and he can not be sure who his friends are and who is simply out to take advantage of his considerable wealth (for the large part of his time in show business he was the highest paid entertainer in the world). <br/><br/>The result as this film ably shows, is a man who leads a strained, sad, rather superficial existence. Surrounded for the most part by quislings and hanger on's. A man so worried about his outward appearance he resorts to plastic surgery that leaves him sleeping with his eyes partly open. Indeed, even his partner Scott Thornson, is compelled to have surgery to look more like Liberace. It seems the only person Liberace can really trust in and have any measure of love for, is himself. <br/><br/>Its a sad tale, with beautiful sets and a very camp feel to it. Michael Douglas hands in a excellent, if slightly overstated, performance as Liberace. Personally, I felt Matt Daemon was somewhat more convincing, as Liberace's partner, Scott Thorson.<br/><br/>All in all this is an excellent, very interesting film, that explores the unglamorous reality that lurks behind the glitzy veneer of the US entertainment industry. Eight out of ten from me."

","HBO spared no expense in bringing BEHIND THE CANDELABRA to fruition. This lushly mounted TV movie tells, in intimate detail, warts and all, the story of the very rocky six year love affair between a dog trainer named Scott Thorson and the flamboyant showman Liberace. This movie scores big not only in production values and on-target performances, but in a story that provides something that is so rare in movies like these: balance.<br/><br/>Richard LaGravenese's screenplay is based on Scott Thorson's book, so it's most likely that the facts presented here are pretty much what happened. What surprised me (pleasantly) is that the screenplay does not present Liberace as this big rich gay ogre who lured this naive young boy into his lair of sexual iniquity, expensive jewelry, and fancy cars. Liberace wanted Scott and dangled a lot of pretty things in front of him but Scott was perfectly aware of what was going on and entered the relationship with his eyes open, despite what anyone might say. <br/><br/>We not only get to see the young hayseed get his head turned by the glamour of Hollywood and the initial constant attention of a show business icon, but we also get an up close and personal look at the icon...aging and terrified about it and actually trying to perpetrate the illusion that he was heterosexual, which the film implies that he did really well, but I just find it so hard to believe that people believed this man was heterosexual. What we also see is an aging gay man whose wandering eye is always looking for the next better built and younger thing as Scott's relationship goes full circle.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his dazzling interpretation of the legend...this is the 3rd movie made on the subject but no one has ever brought the humanity to Lee that Douglas has. Douglas is completely invests in playing a homosexual character without resorting to stereotyped gay behavior or over-the-top lisping. On the other hand, I love during Lee's first meeting with Scott, Douglas looks at him like a steak smothered in onions.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's Scott Thorson is a fascinating character journey that Damon makes completely believable...Damon has not been this sexy and charismatic on screen since THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY. It appears that Damon created Scott from the outside in, starting with the clothes, the hair, etc. and created a character we come to care about, even if his naiveté is sometimes a little hard to swallow. Watching his descent from small town innocent to dangerously obsessive and jealous drug addict is not pretty and Damon doesn't shy away from it at all. There's also a couple of effective supporting performances from Dan Aykroyd as Lee's agent and Rob Lowe as a slick plastic surgeon who gets Scott hooked on diet pills and talks him into surgery that would make him look more like Lee, an idea of Lee's that I was shocked Scott consented to.<br/><br/>The film also boasts superb production values with absolutely superb work from the makeup team, who made Debbie Reynolds unrecognizable as Liberace's mother and gave Douglas a look in his final bedside scene that actually made me gasp. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time that was a biography and a love story but no clear villain...and I liked that."

","this movie works and works well.<br/><br/>When you see a movie starring Michael Douglas as Liberace, Matt Damon as his gay lover/chauffeur/boy Friday/what have you, and Rob Lowe as their perfectly Hollywood zombie plastic surgeon, you just HAVE to watch it ... there is no way any kind of movie fan can not not watch this. Those three actors alone in most any movie would make it a pretty solid ""maybe"" and would cause you to read up on the plot, etc, before you commit to going to the theatre to see it. But certainly, if it is not a movie you think it is worth the $50 to see in a theatre then it is a rental for sure.<br/><br/>I didn't see it in the theatre ... i laughed reading the casting list and the blurb but that's not enough for a theatre excursion.<br/><br/>But man am i glad i saw it on rental. I've even watched it twice truth be told and that is something i recommend because there are some little things (or bigger things even) that you miss and make it an even more hilarious and darker comedy. Just watching Rob Lowe sit there sedated just below a level suitable for surgery is a laugh out loud moment (more than one more actually).<br/><br/>Having grown up in the 60s and 70s i was of course exposed to Liberace. This was during the age of variety shows and spectacular TV specials. So with three networks channels and a public television station and luckily since i grew up near chicago, we also had wgn (good for Ray Rayner and Cubs baseball) ... so Liberace was a big name for these kinds of things and without much of a selection or much say-so in what channel was on the TV (this was back when a parent could backhand you for looking at them funny ... and now they wonder why parents raised like that respond to their own kids in the same way ... yeah ... difficult to figure out the line that leads to a heavy hand in childrearing) ... so if you wanted to watch TV you had plenty of exposure ...<br/><br/>but this is the back story ... all that money he made was good since he had plenty leftover after covering up all of the things he didn't want the general public to know ... i don't remember if the supermarket tabloids were saying or alleging that Liberace was gay back then but his 'eternal search' for that 'perfect bride' had to be a thin veneer out in las vegas and Hollywood ... in the midwest tho, homosexuals were considered well, not exactly likely where agriculture and steel manufacturing were the predominant industries ...<br/><br/>anyway, it's pretty interesting to see the behind the scenes stuff and while i don't know how accurate it is, for this movie, i don't care ... there's obviously enough truth to get it started and then the fun begins ...<br/><br/>really, don't miss this one just as a laugh out loud couple hours of some great work done by three pretty darned good actors who took on some difficult roles truth be told ... it's campy yes but it isn't silly and stupid .... they make the people they are portraying realistic no matter who nutty they may seem to us ...<br/><br/>btw, if the gay community is offended by this movie, i apologize i suppose for not having more sensitivity into what i could see might be considered as offensive as actors in black face would to African-Americans ... but it doesn't strike me that way tho i am not saying i am perfect and could be misreading it ...<br/><br/>anyway, it's a 10 on the laugh scale and another 10 for douglas, damon, and lowe pulling off some hysterical stuff"

"davidgee","8","1","5","13 June 2013"," Carry on camping
","Wow! Camp overdrive. Camp overkill!<br/><br/>You have to remember that Lee Liberace was the most flamboyantly gay entertainer showbiz has ever seen - even though he sued a British newspaper for hinting that he was a tad effeminate and went to his grave protesting his innocence from homosexuality.<br/><br/>The part is a gift to an actor and Michael Douglas sinks his teeth into it with relish. He also sinks his teeth into Matt Damon (who wouldn't!) as Scott Thorsen, Lee's toyboy for six years who even underwent plastic surgery to make him look more like his new ""daddy"". Liberace was an egomaniac, vain, needy, voraciously sexual and vicious when he didn't get his own way. Thorsen (on whose biography the movie is based) tries to portray himself as both less and more than just a gold-digging opportunist. The screenplay suggests that this mismatched pair may - for a time anyway - have loved each other. Hell had no fury like Lee scorned and Thorsen, like his many predecessors, was moved on as briskly as he was moved in - and with a lot less in 'palimony' than he would get today; Liberace was outlandishly generous but he could also be stingy.<br/><br/>All the kitsch of Mr Showmanship's life is here: the ludicrously furnished homes (Michael Jackson had the same hideous taste); the extravagantly costumed performances. His skill on the piano, however technically accomplished, always seemed like the keyboard equivalent of a drag show - every piece of music as over-decorated as his houses. Michael Douglas captures not just the style, but the very essence of this preening onstage/offstage monster; it seems unfair that because the movie has gone straight to cable TV in the US he will not be eligible for an Oscar.<br/><br/>Matt Damon also clearly enjoys playing against his usual type and is very persuasive as a cocky young man enjoying the luxury of his new life but at the same time stifled by it. Rob Lowe goes gloriously camp as the plastic surgeon to the stars, with hair modelled on Lauren Bacall. Debbie Reynolds is unrecognisable in a cameo as Lee's money-grubbing momma - they should have built her part up more.<br/><br/>This is the cruelest as well as the campest biopic since MOMMIE DEAREST. If this is director Steven Soderbergh's 'swansong', as he has promised, he's going out on a high. Everybody involved in this production pays pitch-perfect 'homage' to the over-the-top phenomenon that was Lee Liberace. Freddie Mercury and Elton John don't come close, though perhaps Quentin Crisp did. Liberace managed to be a gay version of both Frankenstein and the Creature!"

","Although it seemed that Steven Soderbergh would retire from film-making after finishing this year's Side Effects, he made another movie, Behind the Candelabra, and then stated he would just take a sabbatical. He might be just indecisive or he might be fooling us and doing it for the publicity, but after watching his last two movies I have to say it would be a shame to lose such an interesting and good director – and brave, I would add, since Behind the Candelabra was rejected by Hollywood movie studios because the story was considered ""too gay"", so he made it as a TV movie.<br/><br/>This movie is based on the autobiographical novel 'Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace' by Liberace's former lover Scott Thorson. Thorson (played by Matt Damon) and Liberace (Michael Douglas) met when the former was 17 and the latter 57. They started a sexual relationship and Thorson was also incorporated in Liberace's Las Vegas shows. He underwent plastic surgery to look more like Liberace, at the musician's request, and lived at his expenses. Their five-year relationship started to fall apart because of Liberace's promiscuity and Thorson's drug addiction.<br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra is not just a simple biographic movie. It focuses mainly on the characters' relationship and growth as people, so it could be said that not much happens. Most of the scenes are shot indoors, and no character apart from Liberace and Thorson is really relevant. Thorson's evolution keeps the story going: in the beginning he's a healthy young man who wants to be a veterinarian, and then we watch him disappear, lose himself, becoming unable to control his life or his lover. When he tries to rebel, he is rejected and replaced. Liberace remains the same throughout the movie, but only in the end we realize that – he always grew tired of all his relationships.<br/><br/>Douglas and Damon both deliver amazing, touching performances. Liberace's stage costumes, his and Thorson's outfits and the furniture in their houses are all over the top, but fit Liberace's persona perfectly, and Thorson's too, after he becomes sort of a clone of the famous musician. It is a truly great movie, but it might have been better had it concentrated more on Liberace's career and showman skills. In this version, it risks being seen as just another movie about bad relationships.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","I've never really known anything about the events that happen during the course of the film, or anything about Liberace in fact.

I don't think there's anything that makes it stand out in any way, and the only truly fantastic aspect of it is Douglas' performance. I have no idea how the real Liberace acts, but that doesn't really matter. Douglas created a fully- living character. Damon starts off not particularly anything, but he gets better and better as the film goes along, and both him and Douglas make some of the rough patches in the script work. <br/><br/>Again, despite being based on real events, the arc here is pretty much a common one. I do think this is very much a worthy entry, and Douglas deserves accolades for his role here."

","Behind the Candelabra is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. Capturing the life of world renowned musician Liberace at a certain phase of his career and personal life, the film manages to find a lovely balance between these two without making it feel overstuffed or putting too much focus on one aspect. Huge credit deservedly goes to director Steven Soderbergh in bringing this all to life, between the camera work, set and costumes, this world is brought to our very eyes marvelously. <br/><br/>The only issue I would have that is worth mentioning is that there was very little scope put in to any character bar Liberace and Scott Thorson. Of course, I understand that the film revolves around their story and relationship, but I felt we could have gotten a bit more development from other characters that also served a huge importance to this plot, but unfortunately come across as two dimensional. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are absolutely outstanding in their respective roles, both going against the grain of what we had come to expect from them as performers. Douglas knocks it out of the park as Liberace, bringing this larger than life, animated being to life in a way that never comes across as mimicry, but genuinely authenticity, while Damon really grounds the story with a part that is much more tame and human. <br/><br/>Riveting and enjoyable.

"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","3","28 April 2018"," Behind The Candelabra is as flamboyant as Liberace's glossy wardrobe.
","The final film before Soderbergh's retirement...oh wait, he's still making more films? Retirement spent well! Hollywood initially rejected this due to the content ""being too gay for mainstream audiences"" and so Soderbergh released this to TV stations instead. I for one am glad he went ahead and completed the project. Depicting the lavish lifestyle of Liberace, he recruits a younger fellow named Scott and illustrates the idolising yet spiky relationship between the two of them. If you didn't know who Liberace was, well where have you been hiding? Arguably the most famous entertainer of the late 70's having sold out a multitude of shows with his extraordinary piano playing skills. This biopic depicts the last ten years of his life and the illusory world of fame. Soderbergh consistently focused on both the physically and emotional relationship between these two men and how it rapidly deteriorates from boredom. Liberace wanted to see multiple younger guys and Scott succumbed to drug abuse, thus conveying the exertion of energy that was required to maintain this relationship. There's also themes of vanity, pride and jealousy throughout which come together to create a balanced perspective into Liberace's life. Douglas gives probably his best performance of his career as the central character. He absolutely nailed the campy mannerisms of Liberace and remained fearless during the more sexual scenes. Damon also gives a terrific performance as a young man falling for his idol and willing to do anything for him. It came across as helpless rather than obsessive which indicates the strength of his love for him. My major issue is with the tone. The flamboyancy of this production detracts from the emotional involvement of these characters. I felt disconnected and didn't really feel much during the more emotionally powerful scenes. The glossy veil was just too thick which prevented me from looking through it. Also the runtime felt abit extensive at two hours. However, it's certainly a gay ol' time."

","PLAYING KETCHUP. WITH Hollywood FLIXX. MISSED IN L.A. <br/><br/>Behind The Candelabra was viewed in Budapest on August 20, 2013. At long last, the Liberace Story, starring Mike Douglas as Lee-Berace and a bleached blonde Matt Damon as his younger lover, with Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, also Rob Lowe as a sleazy pretty-boy dietary and beauty adviser looking too young to believe. A lush-plush Weinstein production that was surprisingly good. Viewed at the Pushkin Mozi in Budapest in a nice intimate 77 seat theater. This is the best work Douglas has done since Wall Street - kind of an amazing comeback for an actor who was on the ropes both career-wise and physically with cancer only two years ago. Douglas is spot-on as Liberace all the way and Damon is a sufficiently convincing bi-sexual lover. -- 180% removed from his usual Action Hero screen persona. The film was probably rejected by many people who just couldn't see ordinarily macho heroes like Douglas and Damon on screen as gay lovers, but director Sonderbergh makes the most of this counter to expectation casting. Damon also played a non action character in Sonderbergh's last film about fragging ...so it looks like Matt is now trying to be accepted as an actor, not just a star. <br/><br/>There is plenty in this pic for the gay audience to chew on but aside from that this is a slam-bang biopic of one of the most flamboyant and popular entertainers of the mid XX century -- now perhaps largely forgotten because sexual gaieté has become so mundane that many may have forgotten how outrageous it was was for a figure so much in the public eye as Liberace was to flaunt it back then. Today this would be a story about gay marriage -- back then the issues were much more complicated.<br/><br/>The pic only deals with the late career of this amazing showman from 1977 to 1985 when he died of AIDS. A newspaper headline announcing the early death of macho actor Rock Hudson Is seen momentarily to underline the fact that LIberace's demise from AIDS marked a turning point in public perception of this plague - especially in the entertainment world.<br/><br/>Douglas is simply excellent -- arguably his best film ever!--but I would attribute Damon's success in portraying a gay to Sonderbergh's direction. The whole picture has class, while it could easily have been a cheap portrayal of a screaming drag queen catering to the Gay&Les crowd, which it most certainly is not! Some of the nude in bed scenes, man to man kissing scenes and the discussions between the actors of who gets to do whom and why in masculine love making may make some male viewers cringe, but this is one of the many things that makes this picture so true to life -- too true in fact for it to have been the box office smash it should have been. Also, the reconstruction of Liberace's on stage performances in Vegas with some amazing keyboard pyrotechnics is alone ""worth the price of admission"" and Douglas shines in all of these scenes -- to the point where you forget that this is the actor Mike Douglas! Bottom Line: One of then best pictures of the year, and Mike Douglas deserves the Best Actor Oscar without a doubt. If he doesn't get it somebody ought to eat their shoe ..."

By this time, Damon has become so used to the lavish lifestyle that giving it up is worse than going through drug withdrawal, although it is apparent that if he didn't initially love Liberace at first, he has grown to love him, or at least need him, by that point. <br/><br/>Liberace, as played by Douglas, is queeney, charming, aggravating, self-centered, controlling, perverse and condescending. Damon falls reluctantly falls into the crazy world that Liberace pulls him into and the end of that universe is a human apocalypse from which retribution seems the only recourse. Seen briefly are Debbie Reynolds (unrecognizable as Liberace's mother), Dan Ackroyd as his arrogant agent and Broadway star Cheyenne Jackson as the protégé obviously filled with hatred towards Damon as he moves in while Jackson is pushed out. Rob Lowe is creepy as the plastic surgeon that takes over Damon's life and basically gets him hooked on all kinds of pills. Scott Bakula is authentic as the acquaintance of Liberace's who picks up Damon in the opening scene and remains his biggest confidante over the years. This gives a negative (but believable) look at the truth about certain stereotypes, over- played in the press to create all sorts of controversy at the height of the AIDS crisis.<br/><br/>Yes, this is an expose on the unraveling of the public image of one of the great entertainers whose squeaky clean image was known by many and denied by his biggest fans, and how the manipulation of an allegedly innocent young man destroyed his life, ironically on Academy Awards night where Liberace performed the best score nominees. It's all scandal sheet documented, with the Liberace estate brought down with his private life being revealed throughout the hearing. Well acted and beautifully filmed, it's still a sad expose on how celebrity allegedly desires can destroy one's own soul. For the devoted Catholic Liberace, his claim that God gave him special dispensation to be gay is a sign of his self absorption and may be upsetting to conservative Christians who would probably avoid this movie anyway. Liberace's sexuality is shown in great detail, with visits to Silver Lake's Circus of Books (back in the day of back rooms and anonymous sex) while wearing his furs being quite sleezy indeed. Whatever the truth is won't diminish Liberace's legacy, but the fact remains that the world was fooled by Liberace's closeted life."

","Let's get the good bits out there first. I thought Matt Damon and Michael Douglas were both very good in their roles, Douglas especially going against type. That was impressive. It was well filmed, and the sets were every bit as striking as you'd expect given the subject matter.<br/><br/>But despite all the glitz of what I was looking at, the overall was rather drab and workaday. At first I was thinking that was perhaps a reflection on the fact that the rich and famous also live fundamentally normal lives, the same stories played out in terms of relationships and human weaknesses, so the mundane nature of their experience can't really be hidden by the shiny baubles and jewellery, but in the end I feel that there was something else missing from this.<br/><br/>A bit like Liberace himself perhaps, this is a film that depends more on style than substance. 'It looks fabulous, so maybe no-one will notice how thin and meagre the rest of the work is' appears to be the underlying ethos for the film, and that's disappointing given the personnel involved.<br/><br/>I can't quite get my head round why that is. It could be that the source material is not the full picture given how one sided the account really is (I only found that out after seeing it and that struck me as a possible issue straight away.) Perhaps the fact that it was supported by HBO rather than a more experienced film studio gives it a more televisual, functional feel than might have been achieved elsewhere, but I don't really know why that should be the case, other than the fact that I don't watch any TV any more, partly because it leaves me feeling like what I watch lacks something vital, similar to the way this film makes me feel.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to the film, and am glad I've seen it now, but it didn't live up to my expectations."
"violetcobra","9","0","3","13 November 2015"," Subjective Biopic Similar to Goodfellas/Casino but on gay characters
","I really loved this movie because it unlocked the mystery of Liberace to me. I guess you could say I am a Liberace fan, not necessarily of his music or style, but in his baldfaced schizo lifestyle under the mirrored pond of his success and artistic stylings. I find him fascinating, though I'm probably more interested in him than in his fluffy music. <br/><br/>Lee does all things his way. He wants a fur with a 20 foot drape? Presto! He wants to wear a ring on each finger? Sure! Not only can he play the piano, but also ""very well."" He wants to be driven on stage in a giant Rolls, handled by a 20 year old blondAdonis from the sticks, groomed to be Lee's ""personal bodyguard""? Oh most definitely YES!<br/><br/>So to me the most intriguing way is on the one hand, Liberace artfully cons his primary audience of middle aged Midwest housewives into believing he hasn't ""met the right woman."" I remember at 14 asking my parents after maybe Carson, why does Liberace have to act like he's not gay? EVERYONE knows it! My dad says to me, the fans just haven't caught on. Later, I saw an interview of Lee, claiming he played ""You Made Me Love You"" to Queen Elizabeth II, who sang along in her place.<br/><br/>Back to the movie. The only person that can tell this story is Scott Thorson. I feel like I've waited for Scott to open up and tell what was Lee really like, and how was it that Scott could have gotten involved in the first place? <br/><br/>So I was glad to hear not only was Steven directing but Michael Douglas, the quintessential Alpha Male, was to be none other than Lee Liberace. I couldn't wait to see his spin on the character and I knew he wouldn't overdo or caricature. You just had to know that Michael would be asking himself these questions: How would Liberace pour orange juice? How would he straighten his wig, how would he trim his nails? What would he order at the McDonalds? And other perfectly boring things that you would have to know being Liberace on a day to day basis. You really believed Michael was a 60 year old gay man stuck in a lie.<br/><br/>I didn't think too much about Matt Damon as the boy toy but I just kind of thought generic beefcake role, he'll be fine. But he's more than fine. I personally felt Matt stole the show, maybe that was the plan all along? But I really thank Michael for letting Matt steal the show because I knew it was going to be very difficult for Michael to be on par with Matt without overshadowing the little ole country boy from San Bernardino County, L.A. Ultimately, Matt underpromised and overdelivered. <br/><br/>The plot is three parts really: (1) Scott becoming acquainted with and ultimately falling in love with Liberace, (2) becoming essentially united with Liberace as far as a person and even a possession by receiving gifts and requiring to take diet pills and obtain plastic surgery, and (3) the eventual falling away from Liberace by basically what I felt was a Casino/Goodfellas type of internal implosion caused by greed and drugs on one part, lust, power and control on the other.<br/><br/>The first part is most interesting. First, you'd have to be nuts to fall in love with Lee Liberace in the first place if you were forty years his junior but Matt Damon played that part with some restraint and curiosity as well as completely being drawn in both to the lifestyle and the man. I found it odd and sad at the same time that the crux of the love story was probably more romantic and passionate than most straight movies.<br/><br/>The middle, which was kind of a mellowing in relationship and division of roles in career and sex partner, with Scott refusing a lot and Lee wandering. But didn't Scott himself drive Liberace to such a fate? Some choices are hilarious, seeing Scott standing at attention from the toes up, clad in white, with a diamond Chauffeur's Cap. There was probably even a fur coat in there, who knows.<br/><br/>To some extent, I feel the third act in the movie really was more or less the same thing I'd seen in two other movies. One partner out to hurt the other partner in whatever way they could. But when Scott starts to sell off his jewelry, sad but previously used.<br/><br/>The last part of the third act was the lawsuit. And I found the lawsuit quite boring. Yes, we know he loses, and do we want to know or care why? Not really. But maybe you want to know what Scott gets in exchange for keeping quiet. Later, Scott reads Lee's autobiography, ""The true love of my life is Sonia Henie,"" the book supposedly says. Even in death, Liberace's handler (played by Dan Ackroyd) absolves Lee of being gay. Only the we and the coroner can vindicate Scott."

","An HBO-originated made for TV movie that received a deserved cinema release, this Steven Soderbergh directed film tells the story of Liberace's long affair with the much younger Scott Thorson, right up to and beyond the eventual death of the pianist. Even viewed on TV, as I did, it doesn't come off like a TV movie; Steven Sodebergh's efficient and composed direction marks this out as worth attention. <br/><br/>However it doesn't really go to the depths worthy of the film's outstanding central performances (Michael Douglas as Liberace, Matt Damon as the lover). Liberace is pretty much as you expect the celebrity to be in this sort of story - initially attractive and engaging, then increasingly unpredictable and selfish. Scott Thorson is also as you expect the lover to be: star-struck, naive, enjoying the material benefits of his affair and eventually bitter, angry but still harbouring tender feelings. The narrative never feels quite engaging enough to grip or move; it's more of a genre piece, really - of rich prince and commoner lover lifted above his station. I was never really moved by it - fascinated, maybe; informed, potentially. However without a real interest in Liberace as an individual or artist, it didn't move above average. <br/><br/>To say it's not a TV movie isn't a value judgement; it's a substance statement, describing the nature of the beast we're watching. What we're watching is a decent, but unspectacular glimpse into the faded glories of the over-privileged and under-loved."

","Drama about the secret affair Liberace (played terrifically by Douglas despite being a little too old and thin) had with a Scott Thorson (played by Damon, who is terrific as well, but is also too old for the role), a man nearly 40-years his junior. Based on Thorson's memoir of the same name (but subtitled ""My Life with Liberace""), lending itself to be a story inevitably driven more by perspective than fact. Screened theatrically overseas, but Hollywood dubbed it ""too gay"" for its native USA so HBO aired it instead. Outside of the serious scenes, the film is an otherwise lighthearted portrayal of the lavish life Liberace pursued with a companion that he was forced to pretend was his adopted son instead of his partner or husband. Really good film for the masses; but at the end of the day, it's still another gay-movie made by straight people—it didn't work when white people were writing sitcoms about black families, why do straight people think they can properly execute a meaningful story about gay people? Let the many talented gay people in the business take a shot at making a film about their culture and history that will appeal to people of all sexual preferences.

"HelenMary","7","0","2","1 February 2014"," incredible performances by Damon and Douglas
","I had no idea about this film before seeing it, although of course I had heard of Liberace and knew a little about his life/death. I cannot believe that people didn't know he was gay. This film, you find out, is the autobiography of Scott Thorson, Liberace's lover and it seems, the love of his life, who was played by Matt Damon. I think that everything Damon does is totally incredible and one of the best actors out there and he played the role convincingly, dedicatedly and with great courage. It was an exposing and difficult role, as was Michael Douglas' and both of them were superb. Douglas seemed to inhabit Liberace and gave the role 100%. Support actors Rob Lowe, Dan Aykroyd, Scott Bakula, and Debbie Reynolds were all superb. I barely recognised Aykroyd and Rob Lowe as the Plastic Surgeon looked ridiculous but was committed with all the facial taping and prostheses he must have been wearing, Matt Damon too post surgery. I don't know how Michael Douglas' facial effects were done but they were amazing. Damon's prosthetics were a little more obvious but still amazingly convincing. The costumes and sets were something spectacular but then there was a lot to work with given the eccentric flamboyance of Liberace himself.<br/><br/>The film covers some intimacies of Liberace and Thorson's life but it was remarkably discrete with regards to the sexuality of the two, and I was impressed by that. There is some bad language and sexual reference that is quite gratuitous and drug use but it could have been a lot more overt. Damon and Douglas clearly were very professional and worked well together to be so discrete, covering their mouths for kisses (ie showing the passion and sexuality of a kiss but without the actors presumably having to do it, and the censor-certification for TV only release in the US) and decent camera angles etc.<br/><br/>There was much to enjoy in the film, some comedy and happy moments seeing the burgeoning relationship and love between the two main characters, but also a lot of emotional scenes, sadness and feelings of sympathy seeing Thorson's descent into drug problems and their relationship failing. I felt for the characters such was the investment created by the superior acting. It is an exposé film, eye-opening and as a biopic it is a grand and rather ostentatious success.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Damon and Douglas were superb and carried a film with rather difficult subject matter that I wouldn't recommend to everyone."

","I always wanted to know the story of Liberace I remember as a young kid when he died of AIDS, I must say that this HBO original movie from Steven Soderbergh captures the life story almost perfect. The film called ""Behind the Candelabra"" is based some on the autobiographical novel of the 6 year relationship between the yours truly and the much younger lover Scott Thorson. Starting in 1977 at the height of Liberace's fame and popularity a young ranch and farm hand in Northern California a young bisexual man named Scott Thorson(Matt Damon)is able to meet Liberace in Las Vegas thru one of his gay connections. And soon after attending more and more of the legendary pianist concerts and events young Scott is taken under the wings and seduction spell of the fabulous and flamboyant pianist called the one and only Liberace(in a beautiful and shining performance from Michael Douglas). This love affair would last nearly 6 years the relationship comes to it's highest points in Liberace's Las Vegas mansion. Going all the way thru the couple's rocky times when Liberace cheated on Scott with a younger man till the legendary musician's death of AIDS in early 1987 this is one autobiographical film that can't be missed as it goes behind the scenes of a legendary gay relationship it's a historical shine."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","2","1 January 2014"," Douglas is a revelation in this role
","Wladziu Valentino Liberace, known to the world simply by his Italian surname, by friends as Lee and by his family as Walter, was a genuinely talented and immensely flamboyant entertainer whose trademark was a candelabra on his grand piano but, behind his public persona, he was a rampant homosexual who seduced a series of younger men who became ornaments in his homes of ""palatial kitsch"". Director Steven Soderbergh has insisted that this bio-pic of Liberace is his final act, but is it a television movie or a theatrical film? The answer is both. Soderbergh claims that no Hollywood studio would finance such a revelatory and intimate portrait and therefore he made the work for America's HBO television network but, outside the United States, it has been shown in cinemas.<br/><br/>One can perhaps understand, if not excuse, Hollywood's sensitivities since this is a remarkably frank, if generally sympathetic, portrayal, not least sexually (although little is actually seen). It is based on a memoir written by Scott Thorsen who met Liberace when the entertainer was 58 and spent five years in a relationship with him before a bitter break-up and the pianist's death from AIDS aged 67. Michael Douglas is brilliant as Liberace, utterly convincing as a man with all the riches he could want but desperate for true companionship and love. Matt Damon is impressive in the difficult support role and there are cameos from some surprising and barely recognisable stars: Rob Lowe, Dan Ackroyd and Debbie Reynolds.<br/><br/>Liberace's love for Thorson was a strange and suffocating affair in which the performer required his young companion to undergo facial surgery to make him look like an earlier version of himself and take drugs to keep him slim, all the while confined to a gilded cage which required him to give all of his space, time, and dignity. So this is ultimately a profoundly sad work, not necessarily recommended for a New Year's Eve iTunes download (which is how we viewed it with friends) by definitely well worth seeing."

It was a fascinating bio pic about the relationship of evanescent Liberace (played by Michael Douglas) and what was a teenage Scott Thorson (played ironically by 40 year old Matt Damon). It is a compelling drama as you watch the shifting levels of power between the two men. Both characters, while flawed seem genuinely nice people and have a real affection for each other, something that surprised me a great deal. Douglas and Damon have been nominated for Golden Globes. Although this is for television which also surprised me since it screened in cinemas in Australia. I guess some stories remain taboo for a long time.

","'BEHIND THE CANDELABRA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Supposedly director Steven Soderbergh's last film is this made-for-TV biopic about the last ten years of Liberace's life and his six-year affair with Scott Thorson. Michael Douglas stars as Liberace and Matt Damon also stars as Thorson. Richard LaGravenese wrote the screenplay, which is based on the autobiographical book ('Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace') by Thorson and Alex Thorleifson. The performances are great and the makeup is really impressive but the movie as a whole is too dark and depressing.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1977 when Scott Thorson (Damon) was just 17. He had grown up in multiple foster homes and was then working as an animal trainer for films. He meets a producer named Bob Black (Scott Bakula), at a gay bar, and Black then introduces him to the famous pianist Liberace (Douglas), backstage at one of his shows. Liberace was a sex obsessed (but closeted) homosexual who was immediately attracted to the young Thorson (who was bisexual). He throws his current lover (and musical protégé), Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson), out on the streets and seduces Scott, while also offering him a job. Scott leaves his adoptive parents and moves in with Liberace, who totally begins controlling his life (including altering his face, through plastic surgery, to look like him). <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of biopics (although the ones I've seen recently, before this one, have been better than those of years past) and I didn't enjoy this film for that reason (as well as many others). I found the Liberace character to be way too unlikeable and the film itself to be way too disturbing and sad. The way Liberace preyed on a teen, Scott Thorson, and ruined his life is just devastating. If it's true to life than I understand the filmmakers' intentions but I don't think the movie offers anything of emotional or inspirational value. It's just a very dark and gloomy look at life in the celebrity world (it's also filled with a lot of bad homosexual stereotypes). Douglas and Damon are outstanding in their roles (like I said), the makeup is amazing and Soderbergh's directing is once again topnotch but I didn't care for the characters or story at all.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOD_FVRPTm4"

It strikes me that by focussing purely on relationships an enormous chance has been missed: Liberace was an astonishing phenomenon in his day, there must be more tell and show about his motivation, his talents (which obviously extended way beyond just tickling the ivories), his background, his mother, etc etc. Imagine doing the same to James Brown, say, or David Bowie, you know, giving maybe five minutes of them on stage and the rest about their mundane love lives?

However, I had reasonable amount of fun during the movie thanks to a couple of gay jokes, and because I could compare my experience and lives of my gay friends with a few moments in the movie. But if I were straight, I probably would stop watching it after 20 minutes. The whole plot is about an old and very successful gay man from showbiz who rents a company of young and not so smart guy who is keen for wealth and luxuries. They had a six-years long relationship followed by problems which are quite ordinary for any gay couple (at some points for straight couples as well). Everything is presented superficial, and the director certainly has failed in intention to show deeper emotions and complexity which that kind of relationship just had to posses. Normally, I would rank this sort of movie with four or five stars, but because of magnificent performance of the two leading actors - Matt Damon and Michael Douglas - I rated it with six stars. Their acting was so superb that I, after only a few first minutes, completely forgot who they actually are, and I continued to watch them as truly gay people who might be a real couple.

","After having immersed himself in one world of extreme showmanship and male relations in Magic Mike, Steven Soderbergh tells another, not quite so dissimilar version of the same topic when he tackles the love life of Liberace in Behind the Candelabra. Based on the autobiographical novel by Scott Thorson (played in this movie by Matt Damon), Soderbergh explores the stormy six year relationship, starting in 1977, between the famed pianist – already an older man at that time – and the much younger man who he sweeps into his world of excess. A naive boy uncomfortable with a life of glamour and glitter, you'd think Thorson knows better than to simply accept Liberace's invitation into his effusive lifestyle, but the call of adventure and glory is too much for any young adult to ignore. What starts as a seemingly genuine love affair between the flamboyant musician and his younger bisexual paramour generally devolves into an untenable situation as Thorson, victim to various cosmetic whims of what is basically his benefactor, fears himself just a fling, easily replaced if Liberace so desires. Eventually their relationship unravels and tragedy ensues. Even more so in later years, long after the legal dust has settled between them, as Liberace suffers from AIDS and once again calls on his former romantic partner for reaching an understanding. It may be Thorson's story, but thanks to a fabulous performance by Michael Douglas (which has unmistakably written 'Academy Award' all over it), no quarter is given to the fact that this is Liberace's movie. The historical character drives every scene from the get-go, even when not physically present, while Douglas dominates every sequence with his superb acting which all too carefully balances character and caricaturism. Despite being an insufferable, arrogant and commandeering presence, often driving Thorson to extremes for his own pleasure, there's also a definite poignancy and heart to Liberace as he searches for someone to hold on to during all the madness of his life as a totally over-the-top artist. Douglas successfully makes you love and hate Liberace. Damon, though certainly not lacking the necessary chemistry duelling this opponent and holding his own when it matters, is unsurprisingly outstaged at all times, but this is naturally unavoidable as you can't outshine the likes of Liberace and Soderbergh knows better than to have his supporting cast try to do just that. Nevertheless, Damon proves as brave as Douglas when it comes to making the expression in the flesh of the love between Liberace and Thorson feel convincing.<br/><br/>Though dealing with heavy themes of lust, betrayal and passion gone awry, Soderbergh isn't afraid to employ a lighter tone for much of the film, making us enjoy Liberace's various campy acts as much as his contemporary audience did, while also relaying the sheer absurdity of a man who was so clearly gay, but who vividly denied his nature at every turn to the point of suing people who openly commented on his homosexuality: if you watch Douglas' playing the part it seems incredulous people ever actually believed such continuous denials. The greatest fun the movie provides comes with courtesy from Rob Lowe playing Liberace's plastic surgeon, who is commissioned to turn Thorson into a young duplicate of the celeb. Here the joy gradually turns to disgust (and not just because of several explicit surgery shots!) as Thorson all too easily drops his resistance to please his lover who's asking things of him no sane human being would allow, with detrimental results to his face and in the longer run, his mental health. However, it was perfectly clear from the start the relationship between the two was doomed to failure and would only cause harm. In principle, Behind the Candelabra is no different in any way from hundreds of other films dealing with an inexperienced younger person who is drawn into a world of fame and passion which turns out a web of lies in which he is devoured unless he breaks free and returns to his roots: in fact, Magic Mike's plot line was similar in all too many ways. However, neither Mike nor all those other films in the same vein had the benefit from Michael Douglas' delightful but ultimately heartbreaking performance, which makes up for any of such narrative predictabilities. Douglas delivers, as Liberace lives again."

","As much of a history guy I am, I know virtually nothing about Liberace. So this was literally my first experience of whom Liberace was. I can't even say whether or not it was accurate or not but from all accounts it sounds like this is the best possible dramatization of what his private life may have been. It is a good film, it is a good TV Movie, but it doesn't floor me in any way. At two hours long I feel like focusing the entire film on Liberace's relationship with Scott Thorson rather than at least a little bit about Liberace's career. But I understand this film is truly meant to document their relationship. In many ways it is a riveting story that is often hard to watch and its like being a fly on the wall of an extremely dysfunctional relationship. There are some powerhouse performance in the film that it wasn't until the film was over that I truly began to think about and appreciate. This isn't the film to advocate gay relationships because the two of them are like oil and water and this is an incredibly dysfunctional affair. The film has several familiar faces in cameo and supporting roles but surprisingly enough hardly any of them really stand out and make a solid go at their roles.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas is Liberace himself. I wasn't sure at first that I liked his performance, I found him kind of irritating and then when I read a little bit about Liberace I think maybe he actually nailed the role. Douglas looks terrific and has some truly great scenes and certainly at least deserves his Emmy Nomination. However, I believe that Matt Damon takes the cake for best performance in this film. If its not completely certain than the last half of the movie proves how good he is. This might be one of Damon's best performances and he gives a disturbing and erratic performance as Liberace's lover Scott Thorson. Despite Scott Bakula seeming to get top credits in the film, his role is barely a cameo and there isn't anything special about the part. I was also very disappointed in the small role played by Dan Akroyd. He is in a few scenes and just looks bored and acts boring. What a disappointing turn from a talented and iconic actor. Debbie Reynolds plays Liberace's mother and does a decent job but the role is excruciatingly small (another example of something they could have focused more on.) <br/><br/>I have seen more than enough Steven Soderbergh movies now to sort of understand him as a director. He really does enjoy telling a bloated story. From the atrocity of film-making that was Magic Mike, Solaris, and Haywire to brilliance like Erin Brockovich or Side Effects, he doesn't hold back in telling as much of a story as he wants to...whether it drags it down or not. He doesn't seem to have a very good handle on pacing when it comes to film. Behind the Candelabra ran at least twenty minutes too long and started to stumble in several places. Liberace fans and older movie goers might be more than turned away by the fact that this is strictly about his bizarre and dysfunctional gay relationship rather than what Liberace was or his career in any way. Still as I said in the title, this was a valiant effort, especially for Damon and Douglas and it was interesting to watch. I suppose it just wasn't entirely my thing but it falls somewhere in the mediocre range of Soderbergh's projects. 7/10"

Now with so many show business celebrities never even entering the closet let alone emerging it almost seems quaint how Liberace took such pains to hide who and what he was as if such a flamboyant personality ever could.<br/><br/>With the kind of wealth he amassed Liberace could get just about anyone he wanted and on his own terms. So when young Scott Thorson came back stage one fine afternoon and Liberace took one look at him it was lust at first sight. His current flame went and Scott was ensconced in the palatial estate in Las Vegas which he lived in luxury as a kept boy toy.<br/><br/>These relationships are always dangerous. Scott may have the attractiveness, but Liberace had the money and the power. Years ago when I worked at New York State Crime Victims Board I had a case where a man in his 60s was killed and left a surviving partner in his 40s and they had been together for about 20 years. It was a relationship like Liberace and Thorson had. The older man was a business executive and the younger did nothing but keep house. Because there was no same sex marriage when the older man died, the younger inherited nothing that was not in his name. But worse than that he had no job or trade he could fall back on, he was completely dependent on the older for support. Scott Thorson wanted to be a veterinarian when he met Liberace. I'm sure he's sorry he didn't learn some kind of job to fall back on. The palimony suit that he brought against Liberace was out of sheer necessity.<br/><br/>Douglas and Damon bring both men alive for a younger generation, more importantly a younger generation of LGBT young people who can see what it was like in the bad old days which aren't quite over. The two truly dominate the film, but Debbie Reynolds as Liberace venerated mother and Dan Aykroyd as business manager Seymour Heller and most of all Rob Lowe as a quack doctor who hooks Damon on diet pills are quite memorable. Matt Damon who is getting on should have done this project in the 90s. But his skill pulls off the part where he's clearly too old.<br/><br/>I recommend this film highly for young gay audiences."

","This years Cannes Film Festival main competition nominee is somewhat of a rarity, as the Steven Soderbergh biopic was an HBO sponsored television movie. To some extent this shows a growing trend for top directors to opt out of the Hollywood model and experiment with TV, often with great results.<br/><br/>Based on the autobiographical book by Scott Thorson (portrayed in the movie by Matt Damon), the movie treads crystal, glitter and champagne-deep into the wild and wonderful world of kitsch extraordinaire Liberace (gleefully played out by Michael Douglas). Presented from the perspective of Liberace's most recognisable lover, Soderbergh delves into the extravagantly absurdly luscious lifestyle of Liberace together with his crazed mindset and restrictive destructive influence. Despite serving somewhat as to ridicule the famed artiste, Soderbergh does also present the more fragile, unfulfilled side of the spectacularly wealthy Las Vegas piano player, who attempted to live his life as if it was one of his on-stage spectacles. Thorson himself becomes intoxicated with the lifestyle, slowly supplanting his self-worth for a drug-like dependency on Liberace to the extent that he agrees for a plastic surgery, that would make the pair look related.<br/><br/>""Behind the Candelabra"" was aptly heralded for the flawless portrayal of the flamboyant Liberace in what could well be Michael Douglas's best role and undoubtedly his most adventurous, posting him way outside his comfort zone. Coupled with a deliciously androgen Matt Damon and some superb bit part roles (especially by Rob Lowe as the otherworldly Dr. Jack Startz), Soderbergh excels in one department: character creation. Nonetheless once the characters waver on their initial freshness, even the sublime acting on hand fails to gloss over the lagging storytelling, which lacks both in emotion as well as in laughter, making it neither dramatic nor comedic, instead an amalgamate of unfulfilled potential. Much to my chagrin this TV docudrama (unfortunately it always possesses the characteristic TV feel to it) on the delightful life and times of Liberace and his consorts, dangles a big fish in front of the audience, but soon tasks patience falling into a monotone rhythm, which directs us towards the inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>The mundanity of everyday life does serve to push the point, that despite all the effort Liberace places on lavish and opulent surroundings, human life tends to fold back into the ordinary, where in turn the joys of life truly lie. Here however the focus on the exterior causes the inside to ring hollow, as Thorsten receives no true fulfilment in his decision to live with Liberace, his de facto sugar daddy, while Liberace gets so lost in the self-creation myth, that he fails to attach true meaning to those closest to him.<br/><br/>""Behind the Candelabra"" does shine at times, much like the artist in question, but the overwhelming banality that drags the plot and lingers throughout the movie, coupled with the luscious extravagant performances, just might not fit the bill for many viewers, even if the initial delight of seeing Douglas's restrained mimicry and grins makes it a movie truly worth at least the effort of watching."

","If this is indeed Steven Soderbergh's last film (as he's gone on record saying) then that'll just be a darn shame because he's one of the few working directors that can turn out films of this standard at a rate of twice a year.<br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra focuses on the life of Liberace (Michael Douglas) for the six years that he spent with his lover Scott Thurston played by Matt Damon. With the exception of the scenes of Liberace performing in Vegas the film isn't too showy and instead uses extended bouts of dialogue and relationship troubles between the characters to propel the film. This works to a degree as Douglas is doing some fantastic work here and the way Matt Damon evolves throughout the film is a testament to how good of an actor he really is. That being said there are moments where the film sags and its episodic nature grows a tad grating throughout the run time.<br/><br/>I can see why the film had to be this long however as it aims to track how the relationship grew out of one based on power and control on the part of Liberace and began to fester after years of this dynamic, but surely there could have been a scene of drug taking or plastic surgery that could have been cut.<br/><br/>As someone who wasn't at all familiar with the story of Liberace I found this film to entertain and enlighten on the subject of the Las Vegas entertainment industry and the closeted homosexuality of public figures during this time. So if you're in the mood for a slow burn character study of some larger than life figures while also witnessing the swansong of Soderbergh (for the time being) check it out.<br/><br/>I still don't know what a candelabra is."

","The New York music critic, Lewis Funke, described Liberace's piano playing as 'sentimental as possibleall showmanship topped by whipped cream and cherries.' <br/><br/>To the critics and discerning musical audiences,Liberace was little short of the Anti-Christ – a sort of talented André Rieu. But like Rieu, Liberace was unfazed by the vitriol that came his way. He gave a large swathe of the public – mainly blue rinse women of a certain age - exactly what they wanted, made no apology for it, and profited handsomely. Famously he responded that, upset at the criticism, 'I cried all the way to the bank.' He later amended this to say he went on to buy the bank.<br/><br/>More serious for him was any implied suggestion that he might be 'a fruit' as homosexuals were then often disparagingly called. In 1959, Cassandra in the British Daily Mirror,described Liberace as being ""...the summit of sex - the pinnacle of masculine, feminine, and neuter. Everything that he, she, and it can ever want...a deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, chromium-plated,scent-impregnated, luminous, quivering, giggling, fruit-flavoured,mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love."" Liberace sued for the implication and won the case, perjuring himself in the London High Court by denying his sexuality. <br/><br/>It seems incredible now that anyone could have been in doubt as to Liberace's sexuality. Times were different then and by the mores of that era, Liberace had to ensure that his loyal fan base was deceived. Were the truth to have emerged, his career would have been ruined and he liable for criminal prosecution.<br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra, as the title suggests, looks at Liberace's rather seedy and debauched private life from the 1970s when he was in his late 50s. His career had long since peaked but he could still command massive fees and audiences for his Las Vegas shows full of chintz, glitz and glamour. The film follows a standard, slightly old-fashioned, biopic formula not so different from The Glenn Miller Story of nearly sixty years hence. It details Liberace's relationship with a much younger man who he inveigles into his life as chauffeur, secretary, companion and lover, eventually and inevitably boring of him and moving onto someone new and younger. <br/><br/>Neither of the main protagonists, Liberace (Michael Douglas) or his young lover Scott Thorson (Matt Damon), present as sympathetic figures –Liberace is portrayed as a manipulative ogre, petulant and spoilt in a manner unique to someone to whom nobody ever says no. Thorson is a chancer and user, happy to live a useless, lazy lifestyle as the toy-boy of a wealthy golden daddy, stealing from him as his drug habit spirals out of control. What raises the film above the ordinary is an ensemble cast whose acting and delivery without exception is supreme. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas gives a pitch perfect portrayal as the ageing lothario. In the few scenes showing Liberace performing, he radiates the man's stage presence and charisma, contrasting his far from edifying off-stage persona. Douglas's miming of piano playing is also good though not always well synchronised.It is unfortunate that the film was not released to theatres in the United States, showing only on television, thus precluding Douglas from receiving an Oscar nomination which would be well deserved. <br/><br/>Matt Damon, although far older than Scott Thorson at the time of his relationship, matches Douglas nicely as he moves from youthful naïvety to embittered and worthless gigolo. I've been less than kind about Damon's acting in the past when he did little more than recite lines. But he now seems incapable of putting in anything other than a strong showing. <br/><br/>Though the film concentrates on Douglas and Damon, there is still plenty of opportunity for great cameos from a few well known faces. Dan Ackroyd has fun as Liberace's manager; the veteran Debbie Reynolds likewise as the devoted mother. Funnier still is Rob Lowe as plastic surgeon to the stars, Dr Jack Startz. Lowe's face is pinched, taut and lifeless resembling an Afghan Hound,personifying the specious vanity in trying to hold back the years. <br/><br/>If Steven Soderbergh is to be believed, this is his last film after a 25 year career as a director. Should it be that he has lost the passion and has nothing more to contribute, then so be it. But I hope that proves not to be the case. Soderbergh has made some great films since his debut with Sex, Lies and Videotape; earlier this year his thriller Side Effects was a fine example of that genre. Let's hope he has a nice sabbatical and returns refreshed. Hollywood can ill afford to lose his talent."
"aegoss","6","0","3","4 August 2013"," Reasonable film spun out of not much
","My wife, who finds homosexuality repulsive, insisted on seeing this film, probably as a result of childhood memories of seeing Liberace on the TV. I knew very little about him, my impression was a kind of Benny Hill without the laughs, not that I am a fan of Benny Hill. <br/><br/>The cinema was quite full, entirely of hetero couples like ourselves old enough to remember Liberace, or at least his name. I don't think anyone walked out, though my wife says she nearly did in the early part. <br/><br/>I must commend the scriptwriter for drawing a coherent and mostly engaging script out of lives that were lived from moment to moment with little or no regard to thematic content. Like many successful artists, Liberace seems to have lived mainly for his art, if you will pardon the expression, and the pleasures that money can buy. This is not promising material, and if it were not for the Scott Thorson story element the film could not have been made. As it is, much use is made of anecdotal events to pad out the rather thin drama.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas does give depth to a character who appeared two dimensional in the filmed performances I have seen, it deserves an award of some kind, and he can be proud of it. Matt Damon is impressive as Scott Thorson, a young man utterly swept away in a tide of glitz, away from the life he had hoped for as a veterinarian. These two actors do manage to let us care what happens to their characters, when it would have been so easy to fall into cliché.<br/><br/>The direction is good, unostentatious craftsmanship, the atmosphere becomes increasingly claustrophobic as the tensions rise, and the wonky plot lines are neatly traversed. To me the end feels tacked on, but I don't think they had much option. As the film drew on I began to thirst for a female face, and towards the end when some girl dancers appeared, out of focus, behind Liberace, I drank them in like a camel in the desert. The constant close-ups of men you wouldn't buy a used car from gets a bit wearing, but this, I presume, is what Mr Soderbergh intended. The net impression is of lives and talents squandered. The audiences are next to invisible, and only now and then audible. Liberace was, maybe, his own audience.<br/><br/>Not a film I would have chosen to see, but not time entirely wasted."

","Steven Soderbergh returns to direct the Liberace biography drama Behind the Candelabra. The film is based on the autobiography of one of Liberace's former lovers, Scott Thorson. The film documents their six year relationship as well as delving deeply into the mind of one of the world's most loved pianists. With any biographical film, you must be wary of dramatisation, but Soderbergh delivers yet another film full of emotion, led by two fantastic performances from Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as Scott Thorson.<br/><br/>The film begins and ends, touchingly, with Liberace doing what he does best: performing. The film portrays all sides to the great musician: the good, the bad and the down right outrageous that makes the film so entertaining. The controversy behind their relationship was that Thorson was so much younger than Liberace. What began as as a lustful romance, later turned into a relationship filled with jealousy, pain and self-torture as the pair drifted apart.<br/><br/>The different phases of the relationship are documented in such an intimate way that you can really feel Thorson and Liberaces relationship breaking up right in front of you. Both Damon and Douglas are an engrossing partnership and behind all the glitz and the glam, keep the film together with two fantastic performances.<br/><br/>In a film that could have been so easily lost behind Liberaces fame and extravagance, Soderbergh and Douglas both manage to capture the heart of Liberace whilst telling a story which evokes a full range of emotions.

","Left to my own devices I probably wouldn't have gone to see 'Behind the Candelabra': not being very familiar with Liberace's work (I think I only saw him once, in an episode of 'The Love Boat'!) I wasn't hugely interested in watching a biopic of him. But the film I'd originally booked (and paid) to see (James Franco's 'Kink') at the Sydney Film Festival was withdrawn, and this was shoved on in its place. And I'm glad it was - I think it was the best of the five films I saw at 2013's SFF. It's based on the memoirs of one of Liberace's boyfriends, but is even-handed, showing how both sides were to blame for the eventual breakdown of the relationship. How close to the real Liberace Michael Douglas' performance is I am not qualified to judge, but he creates a likable character, and Matt Damon as the boyfriend does well to maintain his dignity delivering lines whilst clad in sparkly posing pouches or very short dressing gowns. Two major Hollywood stars doing gay for pay - how times have changed!"

","When Stephen Soderbergh announced his retirement as a director, he may have told a little porky. Though it was reported he would no longer direct for the big screen (indeed, Behind the Candelabra was produced as a TV movie for HBO), his latest foray behind the camera has deservedly earned a cinematic release in the UK, at least, in a similar manner to which Truly Madly Deeply did in 1990 following great acclaim after it's initial airing on TV.<br/><br/>If this is to be his swansong, what a way to flounce out! Based on Scott Thorson's (played here by Matt Damon in sparkling form) exposé, Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace, this is a fluffy boa wrapped around a lead pipe; soft to touch and a little exciting but able to cause a headache of you cross it. Soderbergh has once again proved to be a master of control in handling a flamboyant story about a great pretender, that could easily become a tawdry pastiche on less skilled hands.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas is beautifully queenly as the maestro Liberace. He sails onto the stage in the opening scene, dazzles at once as his fingers dance across the ivory keys and doesn't stop preening, even when his character's body fails and fades. No, that's not a plot spoiler if you understand this is based on truth and we all die. You don't need to have read the book to grasp that! Douglas inhabits Liberace with a delicate grip and wonderful manipulation of the screen and all those around him. It is staggering to realize that most of the pianist's adoring public was completely unaware (either genuinely or by subconscious decision) that their idol was gay, and Douglas' presentation of him on the screen renders it impossible to see him any other way.<br/><br/>But though he is obviously brash, camp and regal, not far below the makeup is a man who struggles with the need to be loved, the obsession to be in subtle control and the fear that he will achieve neither. Why else would he invent girlfriends and hide his truth so solidly while tantalizing the press and fans with unabashed excess? Freddie Mercury was perhaps the greatest showman to strut across a stage, but Liberace was a unique monarch of glitz and glamour and Douglas is flawless in resurrecting him.<br/><br/>Damon rarely disappoints in his career and has proved to be equally comfortable as a romantic dad (We Bought a Zoo) as when playing the action man (Bourne), with a great deal of variety between. As Scott, the closet gay country boy turned Liberace plaything, Damon astounds again as he gently excites in his fearless approach to a character the bigots will despise (though I'm sure most will damn Behind the Candelabra without seeing it). Scott's excitement dissolves into his own brand of neediness and torture and Damon effortlessly presents us with a multi-dimensional man who continually evolves, both for better and for worse, upon the screen. While Liberace may be the star, Behind the Candelabra is truly a double act from two actors in their finest form.<br/><br/>If Behind the Candelabra had received an original cinematic release and we were mid-way through our post-Christmas diets, I would predict Oscar nominations for both Douglas and Damon. However, they must contend themselves with Emmy nods as Behind the Candelabra waits to see how many of its 15 nominations turn to gold.<br/><br/>Beyond the two star turns, honorable mention must go to the almost unrecognizable Dan Aykroyd as Seymour Heller, the puppeteer tugging the strings of Liberace's business and purse. Part snake, part sledgehammer, Heller is a man always less than pleasant to those who aren't his boss and Aykroyd is a revelation in a performance (and makeup) that is far removed from what we expect from him.<br/><br/>While many have and will continue to turn their noses up at a biopic of a long-dead queen who denied the truth up to his death, it is not necessary to know about Liberace's life nor be a fan to enjoy Behind the Candelabra. It might help, but it is far more important to understand this is a film for those who applaud actors for breaking their own moulds and who delight in surprising performances. Go on have a gay moment; let yourself go and bask in the dazzle of the diamonds. <br/><br/>Soderbergh's next slated directorial project is TV miniseries The Knick, staring Clive Owen. Tantalizing though that is, life just isn't going to be the same without another Soderbergh cinema release to look forward to. We can only hope he was economical with the truth about his retirement.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","Steven Soderbergh's biographical drama about the late, great pianist and entertainer, Walter Liberace premiered at the Cannes Film Festival about a week ago and has received mostly positive reviews from film critics. Actually, this is not a biography of Liberace at all. It is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson. It tells the story of his obsessive sexual relationship with Liberace. Matt Damon plays Thorson in the leading role of the film and Academy Award winner Micheal Douglas plays Liberace. The film opens with Scott sitting in a club, a man approaches him and begins to flirt with him. It becomes obvious that he is gay. By day, Scott works on film sets with animals used for stunts and hopes to become a veterinarian. One day he is invited to accompany a film producer to one of Liberace's shows. After the show, Scott is invited backstage to meet the man himself. They get along well and soon enough he is invited to Liberace's house. Liberace takes a liking for him and invites Scott to work for him. They soon develop a bond that becomes a serious sexual relationship.<br/><br/>I will start off by saying if you decide to watch this movie be ready for some uncomfortable moments. That aside I have to say that I thought this film was excellent. Micheal Douglas delivered a fantastic performance and I would not be surprised if he will be nominated for an ""Oscar"" next year. Damon also did a great job at portraying a naive, young and troubled man. The film itself was just fascinating. Soderbergh perfectly balanced comedy and drama as well as doing a great job at creating the overall tone and style of the film without coming off as overly stylish. It's really a shame that he has said that this is to be his last feature film.<br/><br/>This is a daring, engrossing and incredibly well made film. Though some scenes may seem gratuitous and the style may be too flashy for some, Matt Damon and Micheal Douglas deliver stellar performances that boasted the film to even greater heights. ""Behind the Candelabra"" is one of my favorite films of 2013 so far, I highly recommend it."

","After struggling to find a home to find a home for several years, Steven Soderbergh's long-talked about Liberace has finally graced our screens after a wonderful reception at the Cannes Film Festival, only this time it was brought directly to our small screens in the form of HBO. Soderbergh claimed that studio executives chose not to finance the film because they deemed it ""too gay"". Its a shame that such a thing would occur in this day and age. Instead of the possible Academy Award recognition the film could have received, it will now compete amongst television. Though that's better than nothing.<br/><br/>Any awards consideration this film would have been for its acting, which is the most appealing feature of the film. Behind the Candelabra is a well made film that follows Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) and how his life changes after he engages in a complicated relationship with famous musician Liberace (Michael Douglas). The film does a wonderful job at education those who are unaware of who Liberace actually was, thanks to Michael Douglas's terrific performance. Every once in a while, we see an actor we are this familiar with completely disappear into a role. Douglas brings Liberace to life and is fully convincing in the role. While watching him, we get a great sense of how Douglas actually understands the man, that there is heart and reason behind the physicality of it all.<br/><br/>The film, although about Liberace, is not a biopic. It merely follows Liberace the same way that Scott Thorson does and from that time period only. Damon plays Scott as a complicated and misguided young man. He maintains throughout the film that he is bisexual and not completely gay, yet we have to decide for ourselves just how much he loves Liberace, if he loves him at all. When they first meet, Scott's eyes are wide open and he absorbs everything that the man is. Clearly he is fascinated with him, but it's easy to determine that Scott is quite confused, and not just with his sexuality. As he befriends, and slowly but surely starts dating Liberace, we wonder if this is what Scott truly wants as much as he wonders it.<br/><br/>The relationship between the two main characters is bizarre to say the least. Liberace wishes to not only be with Scott and have a sexual relationship with him, he decides he wants to legally adopt him. He wants to be his father, his brother, his best friend, and his lover. He wants Scott to get surgery to look more like him. Exactly what makes Liberace desire this? The film doesn't explore any territory that Scott doesn't get exposed to and it uses him as a means of trying to understand Liberace. However the audience starts to lose sight of Scott when he gets dragged in to the 'California' lifestyle.<br/><br/>The film holds your attention throughout but never attempts to dazzle the viewer. The story almost steps aside and lets the acting take command of the screen, and the film does not disappoint in that aspect. However, relying on acting alone to completely engage the audience is not an easy task. Even with actors as wonderful as Douglas and Damon, its hard to not watch a film such as this and wish it just had a little something more to make it more memorable. Soderbergh claims that this will be his last film in quite some time, although he has claimed that before. I hope one day he returns and reminds us that he's the same director who brought us Traffic."

","BEHIND THE CANDELABRA looks at the man behind the myth of Liberace - entertainer, pianist extraordinaire and promiscuous homosexual. Michael Douglas is just wonderful in the role; he has the voice intonations absolutely right, as well as the body-language. His Liberace is so in love with his self-created myth that he cannot see beyond it; to say that he is massively self-centered is no understatement. At the same time Douglas portrays him as vulnerable; however much of a star he might have been, he needed young men to lean on as well as to take to bed. Matt Damon is equally wonderful as Liberace's much younger lover Scott Thorson; at first rather bemused that the celebrity should take such an interest in him, and then falling hopelessly and yet eternally in love. Steven Soderbergh's film begins quite humorously, with Douglas and Damon indulging in an elaborate courtship; but the tone soon changes as the film examines the lives of the ill-matched yet inseparable couple.

","In a fine performance, Michael Douglas is Liberace, not just playing him. His finest performance in many years the impersonation of the late renowned fine artist was impeccable.<br/><br/>The film was a joy but with poignancy. We enter behind the scenes and closed doors for c lose look in what was out of bounds as long as he was alive. For the most part we like what we saw; a very wealthy and successful man who remained simple and humble, treating others very well. At the same time, he was lonely and under the impression love was something that could be bought in the form of young attractive men.<br/><br/>Were there elements of kitsch? Yes there most certainly were, but this not a fault of the film but side effect of Liberace's opulent life, that the film brought to screen.<br/><br/>Enjoyable, emotional and a roller-coaster of moods; Douglas ought to get an Oscar nomination!"
"johnmcc150","6","0","3","23 June 2013"," Well acted but sordid
","There is no doubt that this was well-acted and directed. Michael Douglas and Matt Damon produced brilliant performances that are believable. The problem for me was sitting through a film about two unlike-able characters. I looked at my watch a few times as the hollowness of Liberace and the idiocy of Scott Thorsen gradually unfolded. Meanwhile in the background the manager and the plastic surgeon exploited them. In end I was glad it was all over. The film may well have been accurate, but it was unbearably sordid. My rating is based on how much I enjoyed rather than the technical excellence of the production. (Why doesn't Michael Douglas feature in the cast list on this site?)"

","I went to see this with my husband who swore he was going to hate it.He had never heard of Liberace and is into sci-fi films. I couldn't wait to see it ,as I am a fan of Michael Douglas and I wanted to see how he tackled this sensitive role.<br/><br/>The make up department deserves accolades of it's own for the youthful, then aged, appearances .Debbie Reynolds was almost unrecognisable as his mother ,and Scott Bakula looked just the part of the long haired hippie.<br/><br/>Needless to say hubby loved the film .It was opulent , extravagant and entertaining - just like Liberace. There were tender moments and moments of greed and ruthlessness. Scott was portrayed as a victim ,a whim of ""Lee's"", until a younger more interesting challenge for Liberace came along. It was good for Scott while it lasted ,but the dream ended for Scott when he was replaced ,and ended for Lee when illness overcame him. The tender moment at the end where Scott visits his sick ex partner was poignant. One of Michael Douglas's best performances of his career I think .An enjoyable film ,don't be put off by preconceptions of it's theme .It is handled with dignity throughout."

","""I love to give the people a good time.""<br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra is Steven Soderbergh's latest film based on the autobiographical novel written by Scot Thorson (Liberace's former lover). It is an HBO original movie, but it didn't feel like a TV movie considering Soderbergh was at the helm of this project. The film does a great job of recreating the flamboyant excess of Liberace's life and his hidden love affair with Thorson. The performances from Matt Damon and Michael Douglas were very powerful and I believed their characters. I loved the look of the film and the 70's hairstyles is what kind of stood out above everything else. Damon and Douglas go through some physical changes, and the makeup was done really well. I never felt it was false. Despite the look of the fim and the great performances I didn't feel there was anything special about the story. I felt it was very formulaic and pretty much similar to any other romantic biopic I've seen before. There was nothing groundbreaking here. I was bored throughout several moments and have to admit I got distracted and didn't pay too much attention to the story during the midway point. I didn't know anything about Liberace, but fans of the famous artist might enjoy this film which delves inside his private life. <br/><br/>Scott Thorson's (Matt Damon) life changes dramatically when an acquaintance of his named Bob (Scott Bakula) who he met at a bar, introduces him to the star of the moment: Liberace (Michael Douglas). Liberace, who is in his mature years of stardom, has a liking for this young man and asks Scott to come work with him and live in Las Vegas. Scott accepts and they soon begin to have a relationship. Scott begins to enjoy the luxurious life that Liberace offers him, but soon the life of excess begins to take its toll on Scott after he is introduced to some drugs by Liberace's plastic surgeon, Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe). Scott also begins to feel suffocated inside the big mansion because Liberace doesn't let him leave the house much. All these elements begin to take a toll on their relationship and what began as a promising life begins to affect him. Dan Aykroyd also has a supporting performance here as Liberace's manager.<br/><br/>Rob Lowe and Dan Aykroyd's characters give the film some lighter and comedic moments, while Michael Douglas and Matt Damon have an interesting and believable chemistry together. They both went out of their comfort zone and took some roles we had never seen them play before. I had no issue with their performances or the overall look of the film, but I wasn't too hooked on the plot. I felt the story dragged at some points and I began to lose interest on the relationship between the two lead men. This isn't a film for everyone, but Soderbergh knows his craft and does a great job at setting the tone of the film."
"sheamusly","8","0","3","19 June 2013"," one word...WOW!!!!
","There is one word that describes Behind the Candelabra and that is amazing! When I first heard about this HBO film I was very skeptical for many reasons the main one being that I knew little, if anything, about Liberace. This film changed that. It was very well done, Matt Damon was excellent, possibly his best role, and Michael Douglas was wonderful as usual in another example of him being one of the elite actors in cinematic history. <br/><br/>Definitely shocking the first time you see how sexually graphic this movie is and it can be a shot to the system the first couple times you see Douglas and Damon kiss and...do other things...but please don't see them Michael Douglas and Matt Damon see them as Liberace and Scott Thorson. The best HBO movie ever without a doubt."

","Its not very clear from the huge advertisements circling the world around us and the internet, but Behind the Candelabra is a very graphic film. The director, Steven Soderbergh, is very ignorant to the traditional men of values and pushes the intimacy and the unravels the unknown mystery of who is Liberace.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is an orphan, abandoned by an untrustworthy mother, who never feels at home with his foster home despite his appreciation for what they have done for him. He finds solace with the great piano player Liberace and they start a gay love affair. <br/><br/>One may try to relate this film to another successful homosexual hit Brokeback Mountain, but the very message of hidden secrets, fame and possessions all spin off into a completely new horizon. Though one must not compare these two movies as they are rarely alike.<br/><br/>Matt Damon brings across an excellent portrayal of a bisexual behind-the-scenes aficionado for Liberace who in return acts as a father to him. Despite the intense love affair, there is clearly a sort of sixth-sense father-son bond binding these two together.<br/><br/>Some scenes triumphed for emotional intensity but this isn't a film about love between two gay men. This is a movie about two men who use each other to fill a void left in them from temporarily places in their histories."

","Steven Soderbergh has been a prolific director, making many films the Oceans films, Traffic, Erin Brockovich, Contagion, etc Behind the Candelabra is set to be last film (watch this space), a bio-pic about the pianist Liberace and his relationship with a much younger man, Scott Thorson. Despite being nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes and earning a theatrical release in Europe, Behind the Candelabra was considered 'too gay' by Hollywood and was only a TV film in America.<br/><br/>Scott (Matt Damon) is a young bisexual man who wants to become a vet. His friend introduces him to Liberace (Michael Douglas) after a concert and Liberace is a man who gets what he wants. Liberace hires Scott as his personal helper and the two embark on a relationship. But Scott falls for Liberace's manipulations and falls into a world of drugs as the relationship soars.<br/><br/>The best aspect of Behind the Candelabra is cast. The film has a great cast, as well as Damon and Douglas there are there are top actors such as Dan Aykroyd, Scott Bakula and Rob Lowe in supporting roles and there were all strong. But it is the Damon and Douglas show as Damon plays a young man who has a decent personality and gets corrupted by Liberace into a world of drugs and Liberace is made out to be a creepy, manipulative figure during his courting of Scott.<br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra is a thematic film exploring a few ideas. One of them is the corruption of Scott's character from a decent caring man who degrades from his ambition to someone who falls into a world of glamour, drugs and dependence on diet pills. Whilst Liberace is creepy in the way he wheels Scott into his world and the film explore the idea on whether he was looking for a lover or a son/clone/successor: he actually tries physically alter Scott into himself via plastic surgery and Liberace's previous partner who dressed just like him. Liberace is made out to be a very controlling figure, who wants a puppet and if they show any resistance Liberace will ditch them want he finds someone else. Another theme is about Liberace who despite his highly camp persona seems to be very ashamed of his sexuality, hiding it from the public and hiding Scott from the majority of people.<br/><br/>Behind the Candelabra was made with the intend of being a cinematic release, but it did look and feel like a TV film, which is disappointing considering that Soderbergh directed. Soderbergh and his team do try to make a Boogie Nights style film with its frank look at sex, its time period and Scott going through a rise and fall (though he is a smarter character): but there is no flair that Soderbergh is known for and this is film crying out for it. There are some nice little camera movements but on the whole this is a film that plays it very safe with its visuals. Even worst is the slow pace pacing, especially at the end where the film feels like it is going on and on.<br/><br/>Tonally the film starts off a fairly light hearted comic tone with some decent jokes that should raise a smile and chuckle. But as the film processes it turns darker and more serious as we explore this relationship, how Liberace uses Scott and how Scott falls into drug taking. It is a fine procession with the film having its sinister underbelly and gets explored gradually exposed.<br/><br/>As you would expect from a film about Liberace the music is excellent and Marvin Hamlisch does supply an great score to compliment the film.<br/><br/>At the time of this review Behind the Candelabra has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But the 7.1/10 rating on IMDb is much more actuate because the film is decent and no more then that."

","Take away the givens - the courage of the two leading actors to accept roles that at the very least attract controversy and then play them to the hilt (sorry about that) the Award-worthy performances etc - and we're left with one serious flaw that makes the writing appear sloppy and amateurish when in fact it is as good as may be expected given the subject matter. At the beginning of the film Liberace and Scott Thorson inhabit worlds that are polar opposites and need to be brought together. We know they were together for six years because Thorson wrote a book to that effect and though I haven't read it and have no desire to do so it's reasonable to assume he gave a plausible account of how the two worlds collided. In the movie Scott goes with a friend who knows Liberace to one of his performances. Afterwards they go backstage and chat in the star's dressing room and are invited to lunch the following day at Lee's mansion. There Lee is fawning over a poodle with a serious eye condition. I can help with that says Scott and sure enough the very next day he telephones Lee and says he is putting the medication in the mail. Don't do that, says Lee, I don't want Baby to suffer a moment longer than she has to. Take a plane at my expense. I'll fly you straight back. So he takes a plane and stays six years. Here's what the writers are asking us to accept: A millionaire performer who dotes on a pet has NOT explored every avenue to find a cure for the pet's eye condition and is SURPRISED when an ordinary man who works with animals suggests basic medication. MORE IMPORTANT, once Scott has arrived - supposedly with the medication - we never see or hear about the dog AGAIN. Surely any writer who knows that it's 'I' before 'E' except after 'C' should be able to do better than this and because it comes, of course, at the beginning of the film it makes everything that follows suspect. Yes, the two leads ARE outstanding and YES, they should be at least nominated but a Doris Day movie it's not"

","Michael Douglas has an Emmy award waiting for him for his outstanding portrayal of the late Liberace.<br/><br/>Douglas delivers a sincere and tragic portrait of a lonely and tormented gay celebrity, who at the time of the film (1970's 1980's) could not even consider coming out.<br/><br/>The transformation of Douglas into Liberace is amazing. I understand that the makeup took over 2 hours a day not counting wardrobe, lighting, etc, plus the fact he is just recovering from cancer,wow, talk about a master of your trade.<br/><br/>I was saddened by the story, I felt sorry for Liberace and I could understand how he could become such a tormented and at times cold blooded person. I don't think he actually knew how to love anyone because he didn't love himself, his entire existence was an act, a diamond and fur covered act.<br/><br/>I think the most telling part in the movie is when Liberace says after his mother's passing ""Now I'm free"". I know exactly what he meant by that and I think that is when he really ""hit the town"" if you know what I mean, he didn't have to worry about his mother finding out about him, although I'm sure she knew (how anyone could not, is just beyond me).<br/><br/>Damon's performance is good, but nothing spectacular although he does convincingly play a much younger man during the early parts of the story, its hard to believe that he is 42!.<br/><br/>This is a must see movie but it is not a fun movie. Yes there are a few laughs but in the end it is a tragic story of two lost and lonely men who for awhile found solace in one another but ended up destroying it. I'm sure HBO will have this on for awhile so catch it if you can."
"cinemaniac2002","9","0","5","30 May 2013"," Haunting Storytelling and Brilliant Performances
","From the moment I heard that this movie was being made by Steven Soderbergh with Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Rob Lowe, Dan Akroyd and Debbie Reynolds, who actually knew Liberace – I was hooked. I just knew I would enjoy this film, so I write this with a certain amount of bias. I find all of Soderbergh's films insightfully enduring and Richard LaGravenese's truthful writing refreshing. <br/><br/>I'd always been fascinated by the flamboyant, glittery Liberace since childhood. As a young adult, I guessed that he was probably gay, though none of the media talked openly about it. It was clear that most people thought he was gay – but no one cared particularly due to his popularity. Besides, back then, you just didn't talk about such things.<br/><br/>The film centers around the love affair between Liberace and Scott Thorson, based upon his book about their torrid and troubled relationship. I hadn't read the book so I found that the story behind their relationship turned out to be much more unnerving than many I've seen. I used to think that I couldn't be more creeped out than I used to be by the babes I knew in California who would get boob jobs and other bodily reconstructions to suit their men, but this one takes the cake. Since I already indicated there are spoilers, I will go ahead and say that I can find little more twisted than a grown man who insists that his lover have his face reconstructed to make it look like his own. I suppose it made sense that perhaps the reason he did that was because he intended to adopt the 17 year old young man, making it beyond disturbing, bordering on pedophilia and molestation by a father figure. Yikes!<br/><br/>Matt Damon has said that because Soderbergh is so precise, it was much easier to do the gay for pay (my words) scenes. Thank goodness for small favors. Nonetheless, these two actors fearlessly go for an authentic look into an ill-fated romance that went south for more than a few reasons. Thorson has maintained that he was bisexual, found gay porn a turn-off and was disenchanted by Liberace's propensity toward promiscuity. One scene that makes Liberace look particularly hypocritical is when he tells his lover that they should see other people to satisfy their individual sexual desires, but then accuses Scott of having an affair.<br/><br/>Even more troubling is when Thorson revealed that all of the unnecessary facial surgeries, done to satisfy his obsessive lover, created an addiction to various drugs such as cocaine, biphetamines, Demerol and quaaludes, all of which were allegedly provided by the plastic surgeon.<br/><br/>The level of detail in this film is mesmerizing, from the elaborate costumes to the over the top décor that Liberace incorporated into his entire lifestyle. Surely, the costume designers deserve an award for their work on this film, as do the entire cast, crew and director. It's actually one of the best biopics I've ever seen. It really felt like I was entering the world of this man at a time in his life when he had gone far beyond his pinnacle, but remained very popular. Soderbergh's shots from head to toe accentuating the shimmering lifestyle that Liberace led are haunting against the backdrop of living inside of the closet for most all of his life. <br/><br/>Given Thorson's continued troubled life, it would be interesting to see an epilogue to this film. Exploring the affects of how a 17 year old boy's sexual relationship with a very famous and obsessive man, old enough to be his father affected him could be seen as a cautionary tale – at the very least. It is said that Thorson is working on the second part of his story to raise money for a legal defense fund. As he sits in jail, penniless - it looks look a movie advance on a book doesn't go far these days."
"cygogentry","Null","0","3","26 May 2013"," Great film
","Very good depiction of book. Liberaci, a very eccentric man, had a very eccentric gay relationship with another man, Scott Thornson, that was great but didn't last. It was interesting to see what went on during the time they were together and after. They had great times when together. It was sad to see when things started to fall apart. The end of their relationship was devastating, but I don't feel less of Liberaci's talent. Thornson truly seemed to love Liberaci and Liberaci the same. It looked like a typical break up. But when Liberaci moved on, you gotta wonder did he play this game over and over? And was that to cover up that he was gay and had a public career? After all that, my opinion of Liberaci's talent never changed (I'm still a fan). And I feel that to his dying day he cheriched all the people in his life. No matter what role they played."
