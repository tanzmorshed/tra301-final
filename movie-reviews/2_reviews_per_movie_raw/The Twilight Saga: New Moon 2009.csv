","Different than the first. I'm not going to say that I fully enjoyed watching it though. I do think that the production levels have stepped up a notch, the werewolves provide a nice touch to the ever dreary lens of Forks and surprisingly, Kristen Stewart is quite convincing as the heart broken Bella. But this is too long, too dull, with only a couple of scenes that ignite any real sense of danger and an ending that is contrived in the way that it sets up to the next installment."
"deathscythe_42","3","628","906","20 November 2009"," A never-ending stream of awkward moments
","I will preface this review by saying that I have not read any of the twilight books, but I did watch the first movie before going to see this film, and I am looking at the series purely from a cinematic stand-point.<br/><br/>That being said, I thought this movie was a massive failure. The entire movie was very slow, long, and awkward. As I was watching it, it really felt like I was just watching a very long book unfold on screen, rather than a movie that is BASED on a book. To die-hard fans of the book, this could be considered a good thing, because all the fans really wanted to see was a movie that depicted all of the events of the book and followed it closely. By what I heard from book fans it seemed to have succeeded in that regard, but that is not at all to the film's credit. The film just moved from one scene to the next as if it was counting off a large check-list of scenes that the fans wanted to see, most of which just consisted of very uncomfortable and boring one-on-one dialogues. The film had very little momentum, and was tedious to watch. This was mostly due to the structure and pacing of the film but also due to the characters.<br/><br/>To be fair, some of the characters were likable, but they had very little chemistry. I already didn't quite believe Bella and Edward were in love in the first twilight. In this one I would flat out argue with Stephenie Meyer herself that the two characters were not in love. Their relationship was stiff, there seemed to be no real emotions between them, it merely consisted of silence, staring, and Edward randomly throwing out gooey love phrases like ""you are my everything"" and ""i didn't wanna live in a world where you didn't exist"" that just come out sounding hollow. There was a little more chemistry between Bella and Jacob, but even they were a bit awkward together. It seemed like none of the characters could say two words to each other without a ton of awkward pauses. The conversations were incoherent and annoying. There was a little bit of humor in the dialogue that I admit got some chuckles out of me, but even that came out of the awkwardness between all of the characters.<br/><br/>There were, however, a few welcome releases from the snail-like dialogue. Cinematically it had a few semi-redeeming moments. The score was likable, and a couple of scenes were artistically shot, but even so it was nothing that would deserve a best cinematography or best director nomination. The other well-needed break from the awkwardness came in the action scenes. They were very few and far between, and rather incoherent with the rest of the film, but they were enjoyable. The wolves were obviously CG in a lot of shots, but then there were some shots where they actually looked pretty real, and they were presented pretty well. They could have done a bit better job of foreshadowing them but hey at this point in the movie i was willing to accept what I could get. There was also a more intense scene near the end that I won't spoil that I thought was fairly well-done.<br/><br/>All in all, I did enjoy a few scenes in this movie, but as a whole it was slow, incoherent, poorly acted, and a bit uncomfortable. If you're a die-hard fan of the book, there's a chance you'll love it but if you're looking for a truly cinematic experience, this isn't it.<br/><br/>3 stars out of 10"
"crazybilby","3","1016","1554","19 November 2009"," So BAD I find it funny
","I've read all the books. I know what happens. This never ruins a film for me.<br/><br/>I didn't want to see this film because the previous one was lacking in... well... everything. But girlfriend wanted to see it. I went in and was instantly surprised to see the demographic had widened past 12-16 year old girls who instantly swoon at any even remotely hot guy so that was interesting. It's not relevant to how good the film was- it just reaffirmed to me (and should to all of you) that hating a series on principle or having preconceived notions of how bad something will be is unfair on it.<br/><br/>Not in this case. It was still bad. BUT worth the money I payed to see it because though it most definitely not intended to be entertaining in the way I found it. It was full of melodramatic dialogue and bad acting which, if you take ANY Drama classes at school- Which Robert DIDN'T- you'll notice certain things about how people deliver lines. You notice how they're SAYING lines they have memorised with unnatural and stylised emphasis on the key words in the sentences without giving the (cheesy) dialogue depth or realism. Quite simply, it was so terrible I found myself resisting the urge to burst out laughing in a room full of fans who were probably misinterpreting the melodrama as ""Good, emotional drama."" No. This film is ridiculous.<br/><br/>As it goes further on it gets less tightly stitched together and I had to become reliant on my knowledge of the books to fill in and pick up the slight gaps in dialogue and plot. They would say things that are based on something that didn't happen on screen (probably deleted scene for time) or their dialogue would just be terrible unrealistic lines that are work as standalone ones for a trailer but in conversation it seems like they're jumping slightly just to get to say something that is dramatic without it actually making too much sense.<br/><br/>BUT! It does have SOME redeeming qualities! The melodrama wasn't nonstop hilarity so thankfully something else held my attention. There was actual effort put into this film. The fight scenes actually used REAL special effects (something the first film was a bit cheap on) which actually looked kinda impressive. Any action was short lived unfortunately but what little there was, they did a reasonable job with.<br/><br/>I was impressed at the presence of transition. The previous film jumped and skipped and the next plot point just WAS without having been caused. This film (until near the end, of course) actually had a pace and a coherency to it that allows you to understand it without reading the books. This is a bonus. Certain things you'd think would drag on as the director tries to give you time to let the ""emotion"" ""sink in"" thankfully didn't take forever and the entire movie fit almost snuggly into its 2 hour length. Too bad it fell apart more and more it went along.<br/><br/>The film also shares the semi-awkward character interactions that create the same humour as the first one. Not as deliberately funny as the first one (though, as I said, it was pretty hilarious when it wasn't meant to be) though.<br/><br/>Though it was many failings with only a few things to back it up as being a reasonable film it will definitely make all you little teenage girls out there desperate to see Jacob's hell tanked up body very happy. You can HEAR the audience's reaction the first time Jacob takes his shirt off. He's got all you need: Pecs, biceps, ABS OF STEEL and minimal clothing. Too bad he lacks depth and real character. (Girls love obsessively devoted Zombies, they don't think enough to complain) It is NO WAY even NEAR one of the best films of 2009. NO ONE should say this ridiculous claim.<br/><br/>Really tossing up between 3 and 4 stars. Mmm. I guess a movie's highlight shouldn't be how low it sinks. 3."
"roy-583-453250","1","214","322","23 November 2009"," Best thing I could say was it's a chick flick (no offence meant ladies!)
","Well, my lovely lady wife has been waiting for this movie since Twilight, and is a huge fan of the books, I thought I would keep her company. We saw the Twilight when it first came out, and I wasn't really impressed with that, so though, hey ho, go in with low expectations and hopefully I would be surprised.<br/><br/>The only problem was, I don't think I could have expected less and still been as bored as I was.<br/><br/>When in the theatre I was probably the oldest male at 37, apart from some dads that had been brought along by their kids, and several boyfriends, which is fair as I guess the film is aimed at the younger ladies than us old folks.<br/><br/>So, we sat down and I waited for anything to happen, well anything really. There was no chemistry at all between the leading actors, just a dull numbness which left me bored, I really don't know how Kristen Stewart got the role as she's possibly the most boring actress around and added nothing to the film at all, unless I guess she was just asked to play a spoilt brat with no brain.<br/><br/>I thought, maybe there is some suspense? Nope, none of that either. Bella does a very good job of not really showing any emotion either way and where in Twilight you there was at least a couple of times it made you think ""something good might happen"" there wasn't really a single moment in this film that stood out, although I was at some point expecting to see the teleprompter which some of the actors looked like they might have been using, so wooden was the performance.<br/><br/>It's a shame really that the other film I have seen recently ""UP"" you feel more attachment to the characters in that, than you do to the actors in this.<br/><br/>Yes, the CGI was good, the Wolves were pretty great. But like in 2012, throw a lot of money at CGI and be amazed, but that's about it. There so many little bits of story that really didn't seem to do anything, it really reminded me of another film directed by this lovely director, Golden Compass anyone?? All in all, pretty much a letdown, and that's with low expectations, if felt like just another suck on the wallet by Hollywood to our pockets.<br/><br/>If you are thinking of this film, and really if you read most of the reviews on this site I can't imagine why, wait until it comes onto DVD. Rent it for £1 and you can get a couple of cheap laughs at the acting, and for the ladies, buff men, apart from that give it a miss."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","2","77","111","20 November 2009"," The Twilight Saga: Teenage Porn
","It's that time again: Twilight! Ever since last year's release of the mega-successful movie Twilight, our lives have not been the same. With a new director on our hands, Chris Weitz, I actually had hopes for New Moon. Last year with all the screaming fans, Twilight has turned many off. It also made vampires into a joke, New Moon had potential to give the series some life. Unfortunately, we got trash. Not only vampires are a joke to this story, but these movies are a joke and an embarrassment to cinema. I'm trying to not be cruel, because I honestly feel so sorry for this cast, since they don't have much material to work with. For God's sake they have lines like ""Your breathing is my gift"", ""You don't belong in my world"", and ""I couldn't live in a world without you existing"". How could you work with soap opera lines like that? Not to mention, more than 80% of the film is 5 buff meaty guys in jean shorts, which I'm above those jokes, but I was expecting as they walked on screen ""Gonna Make You Sweat"" was going to play in the background. It seems like this was teenage porn for a while because every girl in the theater kept going crazy with Jacob's 6, no, 12 pack abs exposed. It seems like every chance the director got, he had to make the little girls happy by exploiting these young actors.<br/><br/>The characters are another problem: Bella, Edward and Jacob. I've read the books, Bella never intrigued me. But while last film she was just flat, this film I wanted to kill her. She's 18, now granted I know that she'll probably never find another vampire boyfriend who's so creepy in love with her, but good God, does this girl need to get a gigantic grip on life. Edward leaves and even Hamlet would tell her to lighten up a bit. She goes into this coma state where she's just obsessed on why her vampire boyfriend doesn't want her. It's more sickening, a bad influence on young girls and pretty pathetic rather than sympathetic. Edward is introduced in this sequel with him walking in slow motion as if a rock star just came on the screen, more to just please the fans and give him an applause. He spends the whole movie pretty much saying how much he loves Bella, how he can't live without her, basically any pre-teen's wet dream that a guy will be that devoted when it's actually more so creepy. While Edward is Bella's boyfriend that sparkles, we have a sensitive werewolf, Jacob. I feel so sorry for him in this movie, Bella basically tags him along, starting to kiss him, but then pulling away, but then rubbing up against him, but then telling him he can't have her problems in his life, but then saying he's beautiful and she loves him. <br/><br/>It's Bella's birthday, fearing her aging process she's having nightmares that she will grow old as Edward will stay young and beautiful. Alice and the other Cullens throw her a surprise birthday party; while opening a gift, Bella accidentally gets a paper cut. When the blood hit's the floor, Jasper goes into a violent state and tries to attack Bella, Edward stops him and saves Bella. After months of Bella begging Edward to change her, Carlisle explains why Edward does not want to take her mortal soul. Realizing the danger he's put her in, Edward has to break up with Bella. He tells her that he doesn't want her and that he and his family will never see her again. Bella goes into a coma practically, spending months inside her home and not seeing her friends. Realizing she could see Edward through adrenaline rushes, she convinces Jacob to fix a couple of motorcycles. As the months pass, her and Jacob grow closer as she starts to fall for him, but of course being Bella, he has a ""monstrous"" flaw, he's a werewolf. Bella accepts it as she tries to move on with her life, but Alice Cullen comes back saying she had a vision of Bella dying. After a misunderstanding, Edward thinks she's dead too and Alice tells Bella that Edward is about to sacrifice himself for her.<br/><br/>To sum this review up, this movie was made for the fans, which MOSTLY consists of 12-15 year old girls and desperate housewives. I'm not looking to insult anyone here, but after reading the books and seeing these two movies, I feel like my IQ sunk a few points. They insult my intelligence and I will never understand why this story is appealing to anyone. Stephanie Meyer is a genius in some aspect: almost every girl in high school doesn't feel special or just average. How cool would it be to have someone who has lived centuries, who is gorgeous, smart, strong and kind who just thinks you're the ultimate catch? That's what sold these stories and I hate it because it makes these girls fantasize about a world that will never exist. These stories are old and over used and Twilight has overstayed it's welcome. The special effects were awful and the material was just lousy. To be kind to the film, the action sequences are a major improvement over the last film, much more exciting and intense. I could go on forever with this review, but I'm going to save some more of my rant for my friends. While I was very kind with the rating in the first Twilight, I understood it who it was meant for and took it for what it was. This is trash and could have had so much more potential. This movie was made for the fans, so if you're not one, there's a very good chance you're going to agree with everything I said in this review.<br/><br/>2/10"

"sunsetshoegazer","1","59","89","27 February 2010"," Embarrassing
","The first Twilight film was really terrible, and had some moments of unintentional comedy, but this was actually much worse. I spent the entire time just cringing at the poor lines, the acting, the God-awful treatment of mythology, the misogynistic, patriarchal and abusive undertones throughout the film, and the terrible special effects for such a blockbuster series.<br/><br/>A lot of people will dislike so much scorn directed to a film that's just a fun watch - I understand this argument but there's a difference between fun and forgettable and just being complete trash. There are incredibly entertaining movies that aren't Shakespeare but don't actually manage to offend my intelligence and my gender. This isn't one of them. Additionally, popular culture affects our world view more than we can sometimes imagine. Media should be analysed because it's influential. <br/><br/>And it confuses me how this could be so popular. Edward, Bella and Jacob are some of the most unpleasant and unappealing protagonists I've ever encountered in popular fiction. Bella is shallow and yet pretentious, while Edward is controlling and demeaning. These are not people that you would like if one of them wasn't a vampire and the other was snogging them.<br/><br/>One of the worst films I've ever seen, and it's something devoid of both artistic merit and any sort of meaning, message or thought. It really sucks that young women are enjoying this franchise and seeing Edward and Jacob as the ideal love interests.<br/><br/>EDIT: A lot of people giving this film positive reviews are trying to dismiss criticism by saying it's a 'film for the women/girls/ladies'... have any idea how much that furthers stereotypes? I know more than one guy who loves Twilight, and more than one girl who loves *enter generic action movie which people think only men like*. Come on people move behind this shallow 'Boys like this girls like that' already. Popular culture should be analysed, and it sucks if you think just because it's developed for one gender in mind it gets some sort of free pass for being sexist, badly written, poorly acted drivel. It sucks if you think this sort of tripe should be 'for the girls'. Another card being played is the 'Is Romeo and Juliet bad because its unrealistic?' question. Romeo and Juliet, though, is about the tragedy and immaturity of the two young lovers. The relationship fails and ends in such disaster because of the way they rushed and were consumed by lust. And it's one of Shakespeare's most heavily critiqued plays - a lot of people have criticised it. So if the Bard himself is not above disapproval then why should something like this be exempt?"

","well to start off, I've read all four books, and saw the first movie which i loathed.It had horrible acting, and cringe-worthy dialogue. so i was extremely disappointed with that one.I saw the trailer for new moon and became very anxious to see it. i was hoping it would be better since they got a new director......well i was wrong.i got my tickets in advance. pulled up to the theater with my mom-she has read the series to and thought twilight sucked-and we couldn't sit together because there was so many screaming teen girls.we got there half an hour earlier thinking there'd be no one there..... anyways,so the movie starts, i'm feeling pretty good.....sure as hell did not see this piece of crap coming.WORST.ACTING. but not from everyone.just Kristen and Robert.there was no chemistry at all between them as some claim. half the time he wasn't even looking at her!he mumbles his lines and its just BAD. then Kristen cant show emotion to save her life. she does this rapid blinking thing i don't understand.if they were replaced it would make a huge difference. Taylor was pretty good for the most part. he over acted at times and it came off as fake to me. like something you would see in a soap opera. but the rest of the Cullen clan,the wolf pack,and her school mates were excellent. the cgi was good,had really good stunt work. some lines seemed out of place to me. the leading roles need to FEEL the words and not just say them nonchalantly. the ending was bad to. they cut too many scenes from the book that would make a big difference to. so overall I'm disappointed. why this is such a big franchise i have no idea. fans are too obsessed, boggles my mind.i was left dissatisfied, but of course the rabid fan base will approve."

","It was a weird happening that I got to see the first part of twilight but for the second part I have no excuse what so ever.It was like seeing a rock coming towards your head and not dodging it.If you are one of the male audience and let's say you liked Scarface, when you're near the cinema with your girl and she says let's see new moon you have 2 options:1.fake a heart attack and wait for the ambulance to get you out of there or spare no expense and take her to an expensive dinner and don't mind the money because you have just paid for 2 hours of life.The boredom is so big and intensive that you'll find yourself closing your eyes and wishing it would end or counting your teeth with your tongue.As for the girls,if you love the man you're with spare him,go with your friends or something. The only good thing that you'll get from this movie is possibly a good nap.You have been warned,"
"lexi0113","1","236","397","20 November 2009"," awful....just plain awful
","I cut them some slack with Twilight, but not with this one. To say the book was butchered is an understatement. I was fully prepared to take a long, depressing ride with Bella into the depths of h**l, but instead took a trip down comedy lane. What was the point of all those ridiculous one-liners? And Ashley (Alice) - she was terrible. She was so much better in Twilight - at least she showed some character, but here it was like watching paint dry when she spoke. And as for the spoiler note, the only scene that gave me any enjoyment was the confrontation between Bella and Paul. It was just as ""electric"" as I pictured it in the book. Folks listen, don't waste the money. Wait for the DVD, or even better, just wait for Netflix...."
"marina0411","4","120","198","22 November 2009"," Very disappointing
","I loved the Twilight movie, that's how I started reading the books in the first place. I've read them about ten times each and I still like them. But New Moon's big screen adaptation was a huge let down.<br/><br/>One thing that was improved was that many of the characters actually smiled or laughed naturally when the moment called for it, as opposed to the ""I don't crack a smile cause I'm a seriously deadly vampire"" routine in Twilight.<br/><br/>I liked the portrayal of Alice, she seemed more like what she should be according to the book, Charlie and I also liked the wolves and the rest of the special effects.<br/><br/>But I couldn't feel the bond between Edward and Bella. I couldn't believe that they loved each other. Hell, I couldn't believe they even liked each other. Even at the end, after their ordeal, after deciding that they would never let each other go, they were frigid. The actors just delivered their lines, they didn't feel them. <br/><br/>The score ranged from awful to non-existent. It seems as though it was not written specifically for New Moon. Carter Burwell's score brings to memory specific scenes in Twilight. This one is an indifferent, generic one, I guess it would fit in whatever movie you threw it in.<br/><br/>However, the most important flaw was that the entire movie seemed very rushed, like it was originally supposed to be much longer but somebody edited it heavily and really, really badly. For example, in an instant we are informed that Edward is going to commit suicide thinking Bella's dead, she drives off with Alice *bang* next thing you know you see a plane in the air, *bang* next thing you know Alice and Bella are already inside the stolen car on their way to Volterra and it carries on like that until the end.<br/><br/>No character development, no bonds between them, no space to breathe, no explanation whatsoever of how things happened or how decisions were made, nothing but a hastily chopped up summary of the book.<br/><br/>Is the actual movie coming out any time soon?"
"towards-the-within","2","109","181","20 November 2009"," What a disappointment
","I'll start with saying that I'm a fan of the original Twilight movie. I'm also a guy, so as to rule out the whole 'crazed over Pattinson' sensation that'd make me go nuts over the first film just because he was in it. I'm also a big Vampire fan...<br/><br/>Twilight despite its many 'original' (for lack of a ruder term) ideas when it comes to Vampires and sunlight amongst other things, had feeling. Had a character development that the books themselves fail to provide with. The lady that directed the first Twilight was what made the movie become bigger than the original book. Deeper, stronger. I can't forget the sight of Bella crying in the hospital bed in thought of Edward living her. I connected with her pain at that very moment. Twilight didn't have many action scenes, in fact it only had one. But it was a means of exploring the character development of a young girl and a very old vampire. And though the reason between their spark was 'God, he's such a hunk', 'Dracula, she smells great !' the film reached out to the audience. Tried to remind audience of feelings of romance, and falling in love and love in itself. All reasons for which I liked the first film. It had feeling.<br/><br/>Back to New Moon. 2 1/2 hours spent in pointless, clichéd dialogs. The actors' faces appeared as if the poor souls were in pain. And I think they were, as they were giving a script written overnight or so it felt at least. Biggest mistake, is how close it kept to the book to the point of ripping out line after line. Basing a film on a book that has less soul than an ancient Egyptian mummy is not a very good idea. The book had interesting ideas, Jacob's ascension to Werewolf (Jacob and the pack being the only thing I enjoyed in that movie). Bella's pain to explore, her need for adrenaline etc etc. But to my eyes it failed, ludicrously. It was even worse than the book.<br/><br/>The Cullens didn't even have any part at anything. They were shallow, empty and standing around like plant pots for the sake of existing.<br/><br/>Bella, Bella. Remember that Twilight moment that made me cringe, seeing her cry? Well it takes a HELL of a lot of directing to have this poor girl weep and slam herself like a widow for the entire movie and the only thought coming to my head, being 'Please, someone SHUT her up'.<br/><br/>Edward, Robert...He didn't want to be in this film and it showed. The teenage-hormone-based craziness of his mindless zombie fans is affecting him and let us not forget the poor guy's 23. He went from having a normal life, to being popular and now he can't even sleep properly probably out of fear a crazed fan might slit her wrists in his name. Praise the star system and the mindless people we bring in our society. I wouldn't be surprised if they'd consider changing him or if he asked to leave.<br/><br/>Charlie was one of the BEST characters in the first movie. He brought in the comic sidekick/relief, along with Jake's father. Both having disappeared completely in this film. As for Victoria, the audience feels her as big a threat to the couple as I feel the moon crashing on earth while I'm sleeping. Typical example of a villain whose only purpose of existence is to get kicked around. Soon.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, New Moon was a terrible disappointment. Save for the inevitable number of 13 year old, fainting and feigning when Robert comes on the screen this movie has nothing to offer to vampire, or non- vampire fans. a waste of time.<br/><br/>Got to give credit to the final cliffhanger though, the 'Marry me' part. Though I knew it was coming, they still brought that one nicely. That'll help them get some of the audience back for the next sequel which, if they keep this director, will probably look like a kung-fu b-movie remake..."
"justjojo39-1","2","214","372","19 November 2009"," Do not mess up a winning formula - bring back Catherine Hardwicke & Carter Burwell!!!
","I watched Twilight before actually reading all 4 books - several times.To be fair, New Moon was the least of my favorites - I am Team Edward. So far I have seen this movie twice, hoping that by the 2nd time it might do something for me. I was disappointed. From the opening scene, I wanted - expected something to grab me - be it the scene or the soundtrack.. but it fell flat. The film's director or maybe screenwriter tried to reproduce the book faithfully, yes it's closer to the book, but in doing so, the first half just dragged on, and the music score did not help.The pace was so slow, the dialogue just fell flat, Edward's eyebrows were too bushy (they were plucked/trimmed in the 1st movie), the Cullen's contacts looked nothing like the 1st movie. Alexandre Desplat is a great music scorer- but his style does not suit this movie..there were scenes that required music, but there was none. Whoever picked the songs for the soundtrack ought to be shot. <br/><br/>I bought my daughter the CD a month ago, and the songs almost sound the same.Nothing grabs you like in the Twilight Soundtrack. Say when you hear ""Super Massive Black Hole"" you know it's from the baseball scene, or ""Eyes on Fire"" when Bella was imagining Edward in her bedroom. Fans still will buy it tho, no matter what. <br/><br/>The pace picks up on the 2nd half when Bella cliff-jumps,and Alice rushes back to see her thinking Bella tried to kill herself. From there the pace quickens, to the point where I thought they were rushed-- from Bella & Alice's trip to Italy to stop Edward from killing himself (or being killed by the Volturi),to meeting them (Volturi)at last, to the Cullens coming back to Forks, etc...it looked like the last half was heavily edited - and badly at that. The scene that Alice shows Aro (to prove to him that Bella will turn into a vampire eventually) made me cringe - that of Edward & Bella running in the woods - people actually laughed in the cinema..it looked really ridiculous and sappy.<br/><br/>Twilight was made on a measly $30M budget, but Catherine Hardwicke made do with what was available successfully, it was a winning formula. Hiring Chris Weitz for New Moon to ""take it to the next level"" unfortunately, was a disappointment considering they had more $$$ to play with. The CGI was better because they had more money, but that's about it. Weitz hired Desplat whom he worked with previously - but it just didn't work. It looked different, sounded different but for all the wrong reasons. New Moon should have been bigger & better than Twilight, but it's not. <br/><br/>I hope the director does not mess up the 3rd movie - my favorite book--and I hope the people behind the production wake up to their senses and hire Carter Burwell to do the music score. He did a great job with Twilight, anything less would be a crime.<br/><br/>Bitterly disappointed."
"leaderoftheelves","8","212","369","21 November 2009"," Wait--what? People are upset??
","Ahh, what a fickle bunch Twilight fans are. I remember the release of the first film last year, and the incredible backlash from fans of the series--can't even remember the number of comments saying ""Stick to the book!"" Incredible liberties were taken with the plot (or did we all forget the butchering of the much-beloved meadow scene in the first movie?), and too much of Hardwicke's own film-making style was imposed upon a story that was not hers to fiddle with.<br/><br/>Then New Moon comes out. Obviously, the screenwriter and director went to great lengths to painstakingly recreate the second book in film form, undoubtedly due to the response to Twilight. I am hard-pressed to think of any really pivotal plot points that were excluded from this film (and, no, the flights to and from Italy don't qualify as ""pivotal""). But suddenly fans come out in droves to complain on the Internet that the dialogue is cheesy? Hello, have you READ the books? Any actor is going to choke on the ridiculous dialogue that Stephenie Meyer came up with (I doubt even Robert De Niro could sell that tripe). Her dialogue only sounds remotely reasonable on the page. At least this movie didn't include such horrendous lines as ""I hated you for making me want you so much""). And people saying it's slow? Again, take a look at the book--the vast majority of the story is devoted to Bella moping over the imaginary hole in her chest. It wasn't exactly an action-packed thrill ride.<br/><br/>I for one thought this movie was a vast improvement over the first, primarily because it stayed so true to the book. And Weitz, unlike Hardwicke, wasn't itching to impose his own style on the story by using crazy camera angles and other weird stylistic elements that were nowhere suggested in the pages of Twilight. New Moon was fittingly glossy and stylistically neutral, appealing to a wider range of tastes. It was filmed beautifully and, to my great relief, had a much wider color palette than the first film.<br/><br/>As for the acting--let's face it, Kristen's never going to be an impressive performer until she realizes that scoffing doesn't qualify as ""emoting."" And Rob just seems flat-out wrong for this role, but I think he did tap into Edward's inner turmoil better than in Twilight. I thought the performances were, overall, a huge improvement over the first film, especially from Taylor, who fits the sunshiney role of Jacob to a T. The Cullens were, yes, sadly underutilized, but making the movie longer just to give them more screen time isn't going to appease complaints about it being boring and slow as it is.<br/><br/>Hopefully this film will get the credit it deserves after the initial tsunami of unreasonable outrage. It's obvious that the filmmakers are trying incredibly hard to please the fans of the book by staying closer to the text. Here's hoping they don't throw up their hands in frustration upon discovering that loyalty to the book is apparently not good enough either."

"tarnishedblood","1","257","453","22 November 2009"," Why, oh why...
","I had low expectations. After Twilight, this is now an obligation. I don't care much for the books, even though I've read them. (Because these days, you can't possibly have a rational opinion on this saga unless you've read the books. Otherwise, you're just a plain ol' hater who will be disregarded. Yeah, sounds about logical.) Anyway! I so badly wanted to see Dakota shine, even though I reprimanded her decision to get involved with this saga. Her eyes freaked me out - not because they were red, but because they didn't focus on anything. She just seemed to be staring vacantly ahead. (Though I've noticed this with the majority of the cast...I fear it may be contagious.) Which brings me to the Cullens. Call me closed-minded if you wish, but what kind of people wouldn't notice a person with yellow eyes in school? I definitely didn't see those yellow contacts in the first movie. If anything, they were less vibrant and could pass as an exotic shade of brown.<br/><br/>That said, I'm only glad I didn't pay for it. Avoid it. Or at least wait until you can use the ""fast forward"" button to spare yourself the agony.<br/><br/>Now if you'll excuse me, I have a Buffy collection waiting to be re-watched so that I may cleanse my head of this filth they call a modern Romeo & Juliet. I'm pretty sure Shakespeare would want no association with this whatsoever."
"lemon_sunrise","1","59","95","24 November 2009"," Awfulness Unparalleled
","Watching New Moon, the latest in the Twilight Saga, was for me, an experience identical to reading the book:<br/><br/>Boring.<br/><br/>Mistake #1 was the script. It was juvenile and contrived to the extent that I wondered if some misguided fool had allowed Stephenie Queen-of-the-Paedophiles Meyer to write it herself. Given the drastic amount of quotes from the book, they may as well have.<br/><br/>New Moon is significantly more introspective than its fellows: Bella mopes for most of the story, sans Edward. Introspection can work well on the page. However, it's much harder to transfer onto film. Montages of Bella screaming in her sleep would have been more at home in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and when her depression is drawn out for over two hours, it begins to feel gratuitous.<br/><br/>As for the acting, they try, they really do, but they fall short. Kristen Stewart is monotonous. She plays Bella in shades of grey, sounding exactly the same when she tells Edward she loves him as when she apologises to Charlie for her three day disappearance. Robert Pattinson equals her dullness, looking apathetic after Bella is attacked by Jasper – not a shred of care or conflict in his expression. Taylor Lautner might have been good is he didn't find it necessary to pause between every other word, adding unnecessary screen time.<br/><br/>Props, however, must be given to Dakota Fanning and Anna Kendrickson. Kendrickson's comedic timing was superb. In fact, I enjoyed all the scenes with Bella's human 'friends' – they provided much-needed comedic relief. And Dakota Fanning, with her first line, proved that at only fifteen-years-of-age she has more talent than the rest of the cast combined. If only she'd gotten more screen time.<br/><br/>The creators of New Moon seemed aware of the overall dreadfulness of the film, and attempted to make up for it with shirtless close-ups. Too bad it didn't work. One look at Jailbait Lautner's naked chest was enough, after that it felt like a cheap tease. Add to this Edward's entrance, which was so drawn out it was laughable.<br/><br/>Special congratulations to whoever chose the locations. If it hadn't been for the beautiful scenery, the film would have been even more unbearable than it already was. Also, whoever organised the soundtrack did a brilliant job – Bon Iver and Death Cab for Cutie on one album is enough for me to buy it (although, I'll lie to the cashier and tell them that it's for my little sister).<br/><br/>Overall, New Moon was about as captivating as watching a slug crawl across the lawn, and just as slow. The precious few action scenes were sporadic and too short-lived to be interesting. Every boyfriend who let his girlfriend drag him there left with a pair of blue-balls thanks to the constant (and frustrating) sexual teasing between Bella and every other male character (which was achieved without a shred of genuine chemistry). And I wasn't the only audience member to exclaim ""Finally!"" with relief once the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the majority of cinema-goers aren't as dim as film executives seem to believe, and most people snickered at the ridiculousness of it all – particularly the final line. I might have felt bad that I was talking during the film if it hadn't been for the fact that everybody else was, too.<br/><br/>As my friend Caroline so concisely put it, ""One and a half stars would be too generous."" Don't see it, or, if you do, do what I did, and go on Cheap Tuesday."

","When this movie came out, I thought all the nasty comments were just people hating on it without seeing it because it's a popular flick for young, teenage girls, and they wanted to look cool by trashing it before it came out.<br/><br/>And then I actually watched the movie, and... SWEET Jesus... It is actually one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not just people hating on it. It is actually a really bad movie. I mean I feel like I've been mooned watching ""New Moon"".<br/><br/>But, just to even things out, I'm a guy. So I'm not exactly unbiased when it comes to this movie. (I saw the movie because I work at a Drive-In theater, and it was a really slow night.)<br/><br/>That said, I've seen love stories and fantasy love stories that I've actually liked, or I can respect for being well made, even if they're not my thing. And that's what I was expecting with this. I was expecting it just to not be my thing, but it made me frigging ANGRY to try to sit through this. I say ""try"" because I couldn't sit through the whole thing!<br/><br/>Everyone else has commented on the movie, but I'll add my two-sense anyway.<br/><br/>ACTING - Mostly awful. The woman playing Bella is actually OK, but she's given horrible dialog, a horrible motivation, and a horrible story so it's impossible to get into her character.<br/><br/>STORY - It's stupid. That's the only way to describe it. It's like watching a two hour emo-trip. <br/><br/>Here's the story ***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Edward breaks up with Bella. She goes through a long... long... long... LONG over-dramatic period of mourning where she meets another guy and basically acts completely emo and sees Edward everywhere. Not just for a few days or a few weeks, but MONTHS. Which the film MAKES A POINT TO SHOW US BECAUSE THEY PUT UP TITLES SHOWING US THE PASSING MONTHS AS SHE STARES OUT A WINDOW!!!! <br/><br/>And then she starts hurting herself and putting herself in dangerous situations because... life is meaningless. And you know, she's emo. Because her boyfriend broke up with her. And even though she's got other guys expressing an interest left and right... she just keeps crying over this one guy, who is kind of a dick. That's not romantic. That's a sign you need psychological help. And it is a terrible message for young women. ""If your boyfriend breaks up with you... act like it's the end of the world... because it is. Don't try to move on. Dwell on it. And get into motorcycle accidents.""<br/><br/>DIALOGUE - Bad. SPECIAL EFFECTS - Bad. PACING - Bad. LOVE SCENES - Unbelievably bad. CHARACTER MOTIVATIONS - Ridiculous. <br/><br/>ANY GOOD?<br/><br/>Well... I will say the cinematography is nice. Some of the editing is nice. The girl playing Bella can act, but she's given bad material. And some of the scenery is kind of nice.<br/><br/>But in all... the movie is really crappy. I didn't see the first one, and I don't intend to. Hell, I didn't intend to watch this one. I only tried to because it was a slow night at the drive-in movie theater where I work. But if you want to watch a good fantasy love story, there's better stuff out there. There's more well-made stuff out there. <br/><br/>And fans of ""Twilight,"" I'm not hating on you. If you like it, hey, everyone's got their own preferences. Watch what you want to. But I didn't care for the movie, and I, personally, didn't find enough good to give it a higher rating.<br/><br/>1/10 - Only watch it if you're a fan of ""Twilight"" or you're really into this kind of thing.

","Before the girls storm my castle with torches and pitchforks, let me put something out there. I'm not high on my own testosterone or blindly hate love stories. And I'm definitely not new to vampire books, movies, and video games.<br/><br/>While I finished the whole set of Vampire Chronicles books and I'm going through half of Sookie Stackhouse books, I couldn't bear to read even half a book of Twilight. I thought visuals would help me see what all the fuss is about on this Twilight saga. I was wrong. Twilight movie bored me to tears.<br/><br/>I thought New Moon would be better than Twilight with all the establishments out of the way and other kind of supernatural added in. But I was wrong, again. I lost all my interest after only 30 minutes. Yes, It's That Bad.<br/><br/>Character design for vampires was ridiculously bad right from the first book, so that wouldn't get any better for sure.<br/><br/>But Bella was still as bland and uninteresting human as ever. She was just a Mary Sue who was thrown there to be protected by a bunch of good looking Mighty Joes, so that women could dream themselves in her place.<br/><br/>Let alone the stiff performances of the actors and actresses (not Harry-Potter bad, though).<br/><br/>In conclusion: This one is a total chick flick and utter nonsense. It failed as a vampire movie, and as a love story.<br/><br/>If you want a movie about star-crossed lovers, watch Romeo & Juliet or Moulin Rouge. And if you want vampire-human star-crossed lovers, watch Underworld.<br/><br/>But if you are dying of curiosity about Twilight and New Moon, I recommend you borrow a DVD from your friend, like I did, or find a 99-cent copy on eBay.<br/><br/>[[[ SPOILER ALERT ]]] ** NOTE ** They made fun of 'Face/Off' in New Moon when the characters went out to see a movie 'Face Punch' and they said that the movie sucks.<br/><br/>What an irony.

"leonidliu","2","49","82","21 November 2009"," Why?
","In my comment I want and will try to answer on some questions which sticked in my head after watching Twilight and New moon. First, why twilight was not just popular but literally bursted teen world. What was so unbelievable magnetic in Twilight? Second, why New Moon turned out so tasteless with quite good and fresh ingredients? Well, Twilight, generally, it's not a story about vampire, it's about love and passion and what most important thing it's about inaccessible love and passion. My first association with Edward and Bella was Elisabeth Bennet and Mark Darcy. This plot of hate in public and love with first look inside and gradual opening true feelings always charmed. It's classic and there is nothing surprising in Twilight's success. Besides classical love story there is magic of vampire's immortally, reading minds, seeing future, longing girl's blood (and it affects more than usual sexual attraction in ordinary melodramas), beautiful music with right mood in right places, fantastic landscape from flying camera, silent and mystical atmosphere, and (don't worry, I didn't forget) Robert Pattinson. I reckon the combination of innocent young love and dark Edward's desire of killing Bella it's the cocktail almost everybody wants to drink. Catherine Hardwicke feels keenly what teens want and she gave them beautiful which they can understand. A million defects in Twilight you just dissemble because it doesn't matter. And what we seeing in New Moon? It's really boring and too long. I'm almost asleep, and that telling a person who loves Gerry of Gus Van Sant with no action at all. But New Moon have an action but there is no sense and nothing exciting. Everything what was so good in Twilight including logical acting and simple but pretty rich dialogs was so wrong in New Moon. I read the books but still didn't understand reasons of character's behavior in the film. Sentimental words repeating over and over again during two hours about how she loves or how she feels produced only irritation. In Twilight everything was obvious without much words. New Moon's music made a fairy impression what right if considering New Moon like a fairy tale, but this is most realistic book in saga. Hardwicke knows where highlight key points and she made Twilight romantic, but I didn't see promised gloomy in New Moon. No mysterious, no magnetic, no passion. It was bright and colored. Bella's skin was shiny white in Twilight but in the second part it's even pinkish. It has to be a story about despair and death of spirit and sinking deep in yourself and depression. It has to be a story about loosing The Biggest Love Ever. All of Bella's hopes and dreams disappears just like Edward did. And then she slowly wakes up, step by step after months of semi-life because of sunshine of her friend Jacob, but everything I can remember about this character it's his naked trunk. Actors looks absurdly wooden and not so handsome as in first part. Why all of this personages were so natural in the first film? I can give only one answer: because of director. And I'm sorry Chris Weitz, because I like him."

I mean, why do people think movies such as Underworld sucks and yet this one great? One reason: Because this one involves teenage love.<br/><br/>Yes. A girl who has no emotion, no character, never smiles... gives her first love to a vampire... and when he dumps her, begin to act suicidal just to see him... at the same time ignore the wolf-boy who at least is kind and not selfish and seems to have a heart... is just plain stupid and boring... yet this gets a lot of young people high... I don't get it.<br/><br/>To make things worst, this movie could not have delivered it more boring and dull... there were hardly any exciting dialog, no action (all the action are already in the trailer)... and most of the male characters in the film are half naked most of the time... you know, just so they can get more teenage girls to watch it.<br/><br/>Plain dumb and boring."

","Okay here it is, New Moon is not unwatchable (thought some parts come close). Twilight was a bit better mostly cause it had some direction. This one is severely unfocused, with a plot that denies motivation and has lazy acting across the board...well not quite.<br/><br/>New Moon may have one edge over its predecessor which is that Taylor Launter puts more into the game than Rob Pattinson. At times, it feels like Jacob may be the better match for Bella. Their interaction which takes up the majority of the movie in fact, feels less broody than the Bella/Edward connection. Unfotunately, around the beginning of the third act we grow out of Jacob almost as fast as we grow into him. Wheras Edward is quite blatantly shy, Jacob by contrast is angry. The reasons for this however seem largely unjustified by the story. Like all bad stories, this one advances by making up its own rules on the spot, resulting in a movie that makes very little sense.<br/><br/>I'm truly not sure what it is about the Twilight saga that demands such a plastic style of acting. Why is everyone so lazy about this? it actually degrades the quality of the material. If this is the kind of Romantic chemistry that sells on the market (a chemistry where two people act like kissing is more pain than pleasure) then Romance itself could be a dying genre.<br/><br/>But perhaps that is an overstatement.

Whatever the reason may be, I thought New Moon was appalling in all forms. From the acting to the editing, New Moon was thoroughly disappointing.<br/><br/>I think the one thing that bothered me the most was Kristen Stewart. I'm sorry but the girl cannot act. All she is good at is twitching. When she is supposed to be emotionally upset, she twitches. When she is suppose to be happy, she twitches. It really bothered me. Especially because I could name at least five different actresses who would have portrayed a much better Bella Swan.<br/><br/>Honestly, I could not come up with one positive quality about this film. I feel that they made a terrible mistake switching directors. Chris Weitz may have talent when it comes to effects, but Catherine Hardwicke has the experience directing teenagers.

"Nyx_Selene","2","6","7","11 June 2010"," I want the money (I didn't pay) back
","I disliked the movie ""Twilight"", so I saw this one against my better judgment, and with quite a bit of skepticism. Ten minutes in, it was clear that ""New Moon"" would be better than it's prequel. Sadly, this doesn't say a lot. Throughout the movie, I found myself being either annoyed, bored or utterly amused, and all for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The story does indeed stay somewhat true to the book this time, but I think I would have had trouble following what goes on, if I hadn't read the book. Most key moments from the novel have been given focus here, but there's not much to fill out the in-betweens, so this movie impressively succeeds in being both boringly slow AND fast-paced. The fast pace is because of the same thing that made ""Twilight"" fast-paced; the would-be romance between two people who go from just meeting, to not being able to live without each other in all of 5 days, more or less. It wasn't believable then, and it isn't now. So why boringly slow? Because of these: <br/><br/>1. THE DIALOG. When you write a book, it's okay to use fancier words, and to give your characters long speeches, to let them get descriptive; it's sometimes necessary, because since we can't see either their body-language or facial expressions, their words will to some extent have to make up for them. However, you should never forget that real life people don't talk like that! This movie sadly utilizes lines directly from the book, and as in most such cases, it ends up sounding wooden and insecure, not to mention ridiculous.<br/><br/>2. THE ACTORS. Robert Pattinson looks like he's in immense pain, from beginning to end. He sounds like he tries to put some seriousness into his lines, but without backing them up with any kind of conviction or real feeling. Kristen Stewart once again gasps her way through too many lines, and still hasn't learned to master any facial expressions beyond bored and vacant. Never once did I see ""Bella"" during the 2 hours this movie progressed - I saw an actress trying hard. She appears to be struggling with every scene, and failing. Her interaction with Pattinson looks they were forced into it, and his attempt at seriousness clashes almost spectacularly with her monotone indifference. After a while, it became amusing to watch her incompetently stumble and stutter through scenes. Towards the ending, I found myself wondering if the director and the screenwriter intentionally left out the more emotional moments, because they realized she wouldn't be able to act them out anyway. <br/><br/>Finally, we have: 3. THE CHARACTERS. Can't say much about them, because there's really nothing to say. If you would ask me to describe any of them without using looks, profession or race, I wouldn't be able to give you an answer. I'm not demanding someone to relate to, but I at least want someone to care about, and here, there's just nothing. The actors could have been replaced with mannequins in some places, and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. I can't call any of the characters particularly memorable, but if any of them were, they would all be found among he minor ones."
"DragonSayer","1","6","7","1 May 2010"," So bad people will still be talking about it in 100 years...
","First off, this rating is for both films. The Twilight story is just plain bad. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart cannot act (or at the very least, cannot act with each other). Both mumble their lines throughout the two films, half of the time they aren't looking at each other, and cannot do little things like sit down in a natural way. Taylor Lautner is a step up from them, but he plays the character everyone loves to hate, or hates to love: ""The Other Guy"". Whatever Twilighers say, there is a love triangle in the movies, but although Taylor tries very hard his acting is stifled by both his co-stars poor abilities. The Volturi were a bit of a joke as scary vampire go. Even Lugosi was more intimidating than they were. Overall, the filming for New Moon is improved, but when they insist on doing slow-mo's of Rob Pattinson, people will laugh...and do laugh. I get that bad books make bad movies, they also make bad musicals (case in point for Love Never Dies), although if the book were made into a movie, which was then made into a musical, it might improve (Hillywood show Twilight parodies prove this). Please do yourself a favor and watch the parodies and leave these two poorly acted messes to the scrap heap."
"jl-freak","2","6","7","16 March 2010"," Awful...just plain awfulness
","I cannot express in words how bad this movie is. TEARS of boredom. And laughter. Still actual tears. I've read the books and loved them, probably because the dialogue doesn't sound so ridiculous on the pages of the books. <br/><br/>But that's what you get when you pair extreme cheesiness with cringe-inducing acting! <br/><br/>I get that Kristen Stewart wants to seem like she's oh so bored with the world and nothing can impress or make her smile. But still, you're supposed to be an actress for crying out loud. You have to ACTUALLY have more than one single facial expression which you slightly alter to 'show' feelings. It hurts to watch her. I cannot begin to comprehend how she landed this role. I'm convinced that person with facial paralysis would've managed to express more emotion than this girl did. Oh, if you've watched the movie you probably remember the 'moose having a stroke' face she made when she asked Edward to kiss her. Cracked me up so hard. <br/><br/>Also, I wouldn't have ever guessed that Edward and Bella were in love if it weren't for the constant over-the-top cheesy lines, and of course, the books. And I don't remember Edward looking and acting like a constipated guy with a rash on his private parts or something in the books. I get that he's in pain and stuff being around her but STILL. COME ON.<br/><br/>And the eyes? Didn't anyone at school notice that they had YELLOW eyes? They didn't seem so noticeable in the first movie since they were supposed to be a dark gold, but in this one they had, like, painted-on yellow eyes that looked in different ways.<br/><br/>All in all, it was really bad and I actually regret wasting my time watching it. The book wasn't something out of this world, but still. And the movie didn't do it justice at all."

","I honestly cannot fathom how a sane person can sit through this movie without swearing. And, no, it's not because you're rooting for something good to happen to the characters, you're just there hoping they'd all explode somehow.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart may be a good actress, but you'll never tell from this series. She gives a very wooden, uninspired performance. It's like zombie Bella, unless that's what's intended. The writing is extremely cheesy and flows like a young child learning to write short conversations for the first time.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with BROODING and MOPING. It's not believable, entertaining angst, it's just annoying and sickening.<br/><br/>I know there are people who'll say a rating of 1 is unthinkable, when there are so many other horrendous movies out there. Granted, that's true, but a lot of those movies know they're ridiculous. New Moon pretends to be something of substance when in reality, it's plain ridiculous. It takes itself way too seriously and in so doing, bores viewers beyond measure."

","I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I was with this film. The acting was horrible, the storyline was pieced together, and it was just plain boring. I've read the books and enjoyed them. I was excited to see the movie. I'm so sorry I spent the money to go see it.<br/><br/>The only reason I think it got so much enthusiasm was because of the teenage girls gushing about Taylor Laudner's bare chest throughout the movie. If it wasn't for frequency of that, I think even they might have noticed how bad the film was.<br/><br/>Don't expect to see me in line to watch the next two installments of Twilight."
"eastbergholt2002","1","15","22","7 December 2009"," Bad Movie
","This may sound sexist, but this a movie probably best enjoyed by teenage girls. My guess is that anyone else is likely to find the film a challenge. Phillips and Scott recommended the film on their show ""At The Movies"" so I took my two kids who were back from college. They laughed in all the wrong places and made fun of me for taking them to see such an awful movie. The film takes itself too seriously and the male characters were always taking their shirts off which made it seem like a cheesy, exploitation film.<br/><br/>As you know Bella is a girl in love with a vampire. In New Moon she is dumped, becomes suicidal and then befriends a werewolf. Although, Bella is very pretty it's hard to understand why her two suitors are so attracted to her. She is constantly depressed and getting herself into life threatening situations and having to be rescued. Edward's sister Alice (Ashley Green)is smart, pretty and funny and is more my type of heroine. Some light relief was provided by Michael Sheen who hams it up outrageously as Aro, king of the vampires, he obviously needed the paycheck. <br/><br/>I couldn't understand why Edward at 109 was still in high school and chasing 17 year old girls. I would suggest that Bella is not a very good role model for young girls, she seems badly in need of psychological counseling. This film is so bad it's funny."

","Whilst I do not begrudge Stephanie Meyer on her success with the Twilight series and the untold pots of money she's amassed; she's no J.K Rowling either. To quote one of her critics, Stephen King: ""while both authors spoke to young readers, the real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good."" I get the feeling Steph was a stay-at-home soccer mum, whose only boredom was to reinvent a genre. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to bring something different into Vampire folklore (as Joss Whedon did with Angel and Ron Koslow with Moonlight. Both vamps walked around in the day,whilst avoiding the sun; and displaying their fangs-for-all menace at night). Angel was in love with Buffy Summers, but their love was not cringe-inducing and much can be said for Mick ""Moonlight"" St.John and his passion for Beth Turner. Sadly, if Twilight was written in the 80s and turned into a movie in that period, we could have had a different story in the Romeo & Juliet vein (which was sadly alluded to in New Moon and possibly insulting to Shakespeare himself!) Bram Stoker said the inspiration for Dracula came to him after contracting VD, a BLOOD related disease. Does this mean that Steph Meyers happened to get inspiration from her menstrual cycle? So, what's wrong with the Twilight movies? First of all, why doesn't Edward Cullen possess fangs? Can a Twilight reader explain this to me? The notion of a veggie vampire isn't new and was seen in Supernatural's season two episode ""Bloodlust"" - (featuring Buffy Alumni, Amber Benson) as a vegetarian vampire with an impressive set of retractable fangs and a new craving for Cow blood. She was a badass girl and yet, you liked her nobility too. A very convincing storyline, thanks to the writers and actors of the show (Eric Kripke, you're God! Jensen & Jared, you two make Pattinson & Lautner look like real amateurs!)Steph Meyer has said on Oprah recently that she avoided horror stories and it seems she should have stayed away! <br/><br/>If you want decent, hardcore horror by a female author, look to Charlaine Harris and her Sookie Stackhouse girl, that inspired HBO's ""True Blood"", a sick, shocking and very funny vampire show with attitude. Tonight, I sat through New Moon, in a sea of giggling girls who just didn't know when to STFU! In fact, if Twilight was made as a comedy, it would actually work! Upon seeing Robert Pattinson as Edward, one girl shouted out: ""Is that him? He's not all that!"" I have to admit that was almost the highlight of sitting through the torture. I wanted to leave; but also remained seated to see if New Moon would conjure a surprise or two. Well, it did, most laughably that werewolves transformed in the daytime (the cute, cuddly, ferocious kind; not the tear-your-heart out muthas, mind you)and vampires going for long swims (WTF??)It even tries to be pop-culture clever in the form of Victoria, but the attempt was poor and looked smug and painful at the same time. Also, is Bella supposed to be a poor-girl's suppressed Goth? Watch Katie Holmes do a far better job in Disturbing Behaviour.<br/><br/>If you want wiseass remarks, look to Dean Winchester in Supernatural, the King as far as I'm concerned. Sadly, today's generation has no clue about anything, and the demographic for Twilight, clearly proves that. I miss the glory days of the 1980s, when films WERE films, and not concerned about ""original"" ways of enticing an audience. And how does someone like Chris Weitz go from directing American Pie to this??? <br/><br/>If there are any redeeming qualities to Twilight, it's really underused actors like Billy Burke as Charlie Swan; Michael Sheen as Aro and Dakota Fanning as Jane. Michael's no stranger to the horror genre and cuts a convincing Lycan in the Underworld series. They could've given him fangs here, but guess they didn't want their audience to have nightmares (please!) Kristen Stewart is a good actress but struggles with the dialogue at times. Rob Pattinson (whose career will only last 2 more years)does a good American accent but is no Brad Pitt (who incidentally, played a great romantic fanged lead in Interview With The Vampire). The real horror here, is that Hollywood has been running out of ideas for years and this is the best source material they could find? Sit through and watch at your peril - and get the hell out while the screaming of prepubescent girls rings in your ears! You have been warned."

It's like Meet The Spartans or Disaster Movie, I don't care if it has a 'target audience', if you actually enjoy this movie, then there's obviously something very wrong. Where to start? The acting is just horrendous, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are just the most untalented turds on screen in cinema at the moment. Every bit of dialogue is provided with soap opera un-enthusiasm, almost like watching a very bad play. <br/><br/>This is a great movie to ridicule and mock with a bunch of friends. The screen play is in-excusable direction is flat in is just so dark and hard to follow I actually had a migraine brewing. Hunks with the t- shirts off parading, surrounded by crap CGI and just a concept that is just an utter waste. Stop this franchise here!<br/><br/>Overall: An in-excusable mockery of cinema.

I went and saw this movie with my wife, we just recently saw ""Twilight"" and have not read the books, so we were at a disadvantage next to the million's of other kids in line with us. The only good mark I can give this film is that it's a new spin on the old Vampire tale. Plus, it's a new spin on the ""i'm a girl being chased by two boys, who will fight over me."" This formula has been done thousands of times, and it won't be too long before there's another silly teen-craze movie that draws in the current generation of movie goers. The negative marks on this film are too numerous to mention. It's plain and simply bad. It rates up there with Manos: hands of fate, and From Justin to Kelly. This is an example of the junk movies that are made in today's age, and just like the recent Transformer's movie it's made a boat-load of money based on hype.

","Show emotion please!! Jesus! Emotion! At least show me you're going to try! Pattinson, nothing! Stewart, less than nothing! Lautner, wrong emotions! I've seen more emotional variety on a cereal box. And better special effects, too! I should have known better than to sit through this movie, seeing as I thought the first one was god-awful. But I did anyway. I guess I thought that maybe there was no way it could be as bad as the first film. Wrong! It was actually worse! The coolest part was the title sequence. After that, everything went downhill fast. More accurately, it fell out of a plane.<br/><br/>We have a story filled with plot-holes, to start with. My biggest problem with the psychology behind this movie (and I do mean a *huge* problem) is that the audience is never explained why it is bad to become a vampire. I mean, you can live forever, you stay young, you get cool powers, why wouldn't you *want* to be one?!? And everyone you bite is just going to turn into another vampire anyway! And is it just me, or for vampires and werewolves who have a hard time being discovered, aren't they a little quick to pounce on the human characters? A paper cut and the vampire pounces. A couple insults and the werewolf transforms.<br/><br/>In this film, we are introduced to our (poorly computer generated) werewolves. Actually, they're just kind of like large wolves. We get a ""romance"" between Stewart and Lautner in this film. I put the word romance in quotes because, just as in the previous film, there isn't much to base the romance on. I will give them credit, the two ""lovers"" did have some dialogue this time, but she doesn't even decide to go with him, so it doesn't count.<br/><br/>The effects were awful. If CGI effects were overused in the previous film, in this film they were used excessively! For instance, instead of filming a person jumping into some water, they use CGI! Why?! Is it really necessary?! And the plot is almost nonexistent. They didn't even try! Just as in the last one, the film makers knew that to sell tickets they just had to put a good looking guy in the film with no shirt on and girls would come in herds.<br/><br/>I hated this film, almost more so than its predecessor. I hated hated this film! The acting was terrible, we go through no change of emotion (let alone character development) throughout the entire movie, there is hardly any plot, the action sequences were lousy and poorly conceived, the dialogue was cheesy at its best, and the whole tagline of the movie could have been ""See topless guys! Buy tickets!"" And next time, Stewart, at least try changing your facial expression at some point during the movie! 1/10"

","Alright. I am 15. And a girl. And this doesn't work for me at all. This movie is so horrible that it's sad. I hear my friends talk about Twilight and how wonderful the books and movies are, and I had to check them out. The first film was OK, but not better than it's rated. And then I sat down and saw this one, and..well, I will actually say it's OVERrated. The only good thing about this one is when Taylor Lautner smiles and takes off his shirt. Nothing else, and that is embarrassing. They can't act, especially this..Kirsten. I mean, I had to ask my friend if she was supposed to be so..cold, and without any feelings at all. And yes, she was, because she was so shy and didn't like any attention. But I don't see her acting, really. She shows just as much acting skills and emotions like Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man. She doesn't have any passion, it looks like she's bored. And yes, Robert Pattinson is way better than her, but there's still a long way to Tom Hanks. In my opinion, the acting are one of the reasons this doesn't work out. Even though the chemistry between Robert and Kirsten is impressive.<br/><br/>Second of all, the film is rather boring. You (finally) get to the plot when there's left 30 minutes of the movie or so. And before the plot, it's very much ""oh, my life sucks, I feel abandon, I'm just gonna sit here, being very deep and feel sorry for myself."" And of course, there's a little struggle in her head. ""Which one of them should I choose?"". Cliché. Cliché big time. You have seen this before, with better actors and without vampires.<br/><br/>And yes, the plot. Saving Edward from certain death. And they fight a little, smashing each other to the walls. I usually cheer when people fight in movies, but I get bored of the fighting as well. I don't get that ""Oh, this is exiting, I wanna know who's winning even though I already know it""-feeling.<br/><br/>So. Touching story, if you like that kind of story, great music, somewhat OK special effects. But I really don't understand why people say this is good? What is wrong with those little teenage girls? This movie is pathetic. It's boring. So please, stay away from it. Rent (500) Days of Summer on DVD if you have to watch a romantic movie."

","OK, so I knew this movie was going to be bad you knew it was going to be bad but I honestly didn't think any film could consist of no positive notes whatsoever. Some films don't have a great plot or require some character development but have great CGI to show for. 'New Moon' lacked substance, quality, artistry, the plot layout; soundtrack and actors were terrible and didn't deliver any flare whatsoever to an already long winding and dull basic story telling ploy.<br/><br/>The movie began with Bella waking up next to a giant 'Romeo & Juliet' novel on her pillow immediately got me thinking this director is 'highly' skilled in the art of subtlety. The fact that they're even trying to draw any parallels to a classic love story is, in my opinion slightly offensive as there was no development of love between the Twilight characters other than the superficial physical attraction. The whole 2hour 'New Moon' intensely follows Bella (Stewart) as she morosely goes about her day since Edward Cullen (Pattinson) left her. Which goes to show Bella is a whining, dependant, selfish and frankly stupid character as she disregards her family's and friends' feelings to become an adrenaline seeking suicidal tool to induce her hallucinations of Cullen. This is not someone who can be classified as a heroin in today's empowering and independent society and if the youth can't relate to this character, what is the point of dedicating an entire film on an uninteresting, miserable and superficial teenage girl!?! If I wanted to observe an emotionally insane teenage girl, I would've tailed my cousin's ass for two hours.<br/><br/>The cheesy dialogue and absolutely appalling acting gave me a skin-crawling-eye-rolling-dry-heaving uncomfortable experience. Pattinson's inappropriately painful expression for the whole 20minutes he was featured in the movie was confusing to watch, he had the same constipated stricken look for every situation. Lautner did nothing but act cool and expressionless for the first half of the movie, then prance around shirtless (with the same expression) for the rest and Stewart's performance was atrocious! Batting eyelashes and stuttering in a monotone bored voice does not denote fear! (Yes, I'm talking about the scene when she announce ""please don't"" after a hungry red-eyed vampire just called her 'mouth watering') I don't know whether it's their acting or the director's request but someone should tell those kids to learn new expressions for different scenes! Let's not kid ourselves here ladies; we all went to see this horrid movie for the abs, it was all about the abs! The wolves pack were only in jean shorts for the entire duration of the movie and Pattinson even flashed his nipples and airbrushed six pack for the last half hour. It was hilarious to see women swoon over baby-faced Jacob's (Lautner) ripped muscles like he was on the cover of a Mills & Boons novel when he unnecessarily took off his shirt and flexed his muscles because Bella bumped her head. I actually recommend this film for its superficiality if abs is the only thing you're after in a film. Otherwise strictly Twilight crazed fans only.<br/><br/>I'll end by mentioning my favourite scene. You know how comedies have characters run through a serene and peaceful setting in slow motion to poke fun at certain situations as seen in Shrek and 40 Yr old Virgin? Well, New Moon manged to incorporate this classically amusing scene into a serious segment of the film. This left me in stitches and made me wonder if Stephanie Meyer really wrote these cheesy scenes or the director has once again made matters much worse by turning a adolescent fantasy into a childish comedy.<br/><br/>http://musingsandmorsels.weebly.com/"

Is there a story ? things just happen and happen, transitions are as abrupt as they can possibly be. The only constant is Bella and her terrible terrible acting and whining and screaming throughout the movie and edward who thankfully isn't on the screen as much. Pattinson seems like he's some drug addict who was just waken up early after a heavy night to do some scenes. The same for Kirsten who can't act for crap.<br/><br/>The movie begins with some slow-mo pictorial of Pattinson, things are going fairly well between the characters and then out of nowhere he has to go. Then there is this subplot or something that takes up like half or more of the movie, about bella's depression, that jacob kid and that redheaded vampire that wants to kill Bella. Then magically she disappears and some other things start to happen. There is no continuity whatsoever. Most of what I think is the main plot happens briefly over the last 10 minutes of the film. It's like they said, OK let's take a 2 hr pictorial of bella,jacob and edward and then just throw in some kind of a plot in the last 10 minutes. I really can't describe how bad this ""movie"" is.

What can you say when my dad, who WAS a fan, just said ""Ok, this is just plain stupid."" My friend tried to give it a chance, but after Edward left Bella and Bella falling on the ground like an airhead, she gave up. I gave up when I saw Kristen Stewart, the worst actress yet.<br/><br/>The suspense, well there is none.

I have to say that the wolves were done pretty good, and there is ONE good scene in the whole movie - when the wolf pack is chasing Victoria in the forest.

"YYTQinetiQ","4","22","35","30 November 2009"," Lets be honest, Serious Shortcomings...
","Firstly, I should point out that I am not someone who hates the Twilight franchise, and I have read the books; neither am I a 15 year old girl who has fallen hopelessly in love with one of the two male leads.<br/><br/>The film had several problems with it that became increasingly obvious as the film progressed.<br/><br/>The acting, and not all the acting either. The really sad thing is that there were some strong performances here (more on these later), but Kristen Stewart dear God she can't act. In Twilight she was annoying, in New Moon she is indescribably annoying, but nevertheless, I'll try to describe it. For one, she blinks a lot and she twitches a lot, I don't know why she does this. Also, she only ever wears one of two expressions: slightly shocked, or utterly disinterested. She just looks bored to be there, I'd rather fill out tax returns for the rest of my life than watch another minute of Bella moping about, looking depressed. I know she does this in the book, but the film isn't the book. The director took liberties elsewhere; he could have found a better way to portray this.<br/><br/>Moreover, even before Edward breaks up with Bella she's a complete cipher. In the book Bella is interesting, compassionate and full of life; someone you could fall in love with. In the film she is a boring, boring, boring kill-joy who can't even accept gifts on her birthday without kicking up a fuss. Why does Edward like her? Yes, she's quite hot, but that's about it. She has nothing else, no personality at all.<br/><br/>Next, the music. It wasn't that I didn't like it (I love Paramore), it just wasn't even remotely appropriate most of time. Film music is film music: it compliments a scene, it shouldn't dominate it. The one exception to this was the scene in which Harry Clearwater has a heart-attack; I felt the music here actually worked quite well.<br/><br/>Oh, and the colouring/lighting I don't even know where to begin. It was awful. Really, really awful, in fact, it was almost as annoying as watching Kristen Stewart. The colouring was alternately too dark, too washed out, or too bright. Also, did anyone else notice the camera constantly flicking between people's faces, as well as the totally unnecessary close-ups? Apparently Kristen Stewart wasn't the only one feeling twitchy. The camera-work alone made the break-up scene in the woods between Edward and Bella a complete joke. And that's before you include Kristen's total inability to act; Patterson kept cringing every time Bella delivered another terrible line, by the end he was starting to look embarrassed to be involved in scene more wooden than the trees surrounding them.<br/><br/>That said, the film did have some redeeming features. The CGI on the wolves, which I know some people didn't like, I thought was pretty good. The wolves looked a little bit cuddlier than I imagined, but that's fair enough. Also, was it really necessary for the Quileutes to be quite so topless? It just felt a bit cheap and exploitative.<br/><br/>Some of the supporting acting I quite liked too. Most of the Cullen's (especially Alice) were good, Bella's friends were good, Dakota Fanning pulled off menacing quite well too, even Robert Patterson and Taylor Lautner were OK, if unexceptional. Michael Sheen was also decent (although I didn't buy into him quite as much as I did in the Underworld series, in which he was immense), and added a little bit of genuine class to the cast list. The problem is that all of these little performances are overshadowed by Kristen Stewart's monstrous tribute to bad acting.<br/><br/>In short, don't watch this film. It's immensely frustrating and self-involved. After about an hour of watching it, I really wanted to kill Bella, and by the end of the film I would have settled for killing just about any of the cast. If the film had lasted another 10 minutes, no one would have been safe. I did, however, get some free popcorn and a hug from my flatmate, so not all bad. But seriously train wreck."

","Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Edgar Allen Poe, Lon Chaney (Sr. and Jr.), and Bram Stoker are all rolling in their graves at the massive s*** pile that Hollywood has produced. And it's not just New Moon, it's the original, Twilight, as well. Now, I maybe beating a dead horse. But as both a filmmaker and a film fan, I feel obligated to to voice my opinion on this (for lack of a better term) cluster f*** known as the Twilight franchise.<br/><br/>Let me start with the acting, or lack of. It would appear to me that this movie (didn't read the book, so I have no gripe with it) was based around sex appeal. Its as if the producers picked the best looking kids auditioning, with very little care for ACTING SKILL. (which, if your acting is very important). Robert Patenson improved very little from the first movie, still giving a very vein and self-indulging performance. Kristen Stewart also showed little signs of improvement, keeping the same expression almost through the picture. As for ""Mr. 6-Pack"" Taylor Lautner, again, casted on sex appeal. But was the only one to show slight improvement.<br/><br/>Moving on to direction/scripting. Now, I wasn't expecting a Cecil B. DeMile epic. But please, try to make something decent. An actor is only as good as the script that's written and the direction they're given. So, I can't blame it all on poor acting. So for all of those involved in both films behind the scenes, please try to make something better the 3rd time around. Follow your basic techniques and don't try to be too fancy with the camera.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film grossed over $700,000,000 world wide. And it was perhaps the most idiotic, the most dull, and the biggest crap fest I have ever witnessed. This movie made its money through sex and the hormonal instincts of teenage girls and middle-aged house wives. This series gives horror films a bad name. But the question remains, how far will they go? Will that tarnish The Frankenstein Monster's legacy next? Will they continue to make money? Is it just a fad? Frankly, I don't car about any of these questions. I'm avoiding this series. Thank you for reading."
"LittlestMonster","3","13","19","23 December 2009"," That tiny flicker of hope has died
","Firstly I'll set out a few points because I don't want this to come off as biased or a 'Twihard' or 'Twihater' - I'm neither. I'm a guy who has in fact read the Twilight Saga and it's an OK series (except for Breaking Dawn - but we will cross that bridge when we get to it). Everything clear? Let's begin.<br/><br/>Now, Twilight was bad. I'm sorry but it's true - no matter how much you deny it, it was. If only Twihards tried to clear their beloved book, RPattz and Taylor out of their heads for just a while and watch that movie again, they would see the awkward stiff moments which were supposed to be romantic scenes, mumbled lines and zero connection between the characters. <br/><br/>For me, I blamed all these flaws on the director, Hardwicke. After the handing of the Twilight reins to Chris Weitz and I truly had high hopes for New Moon, seeing all the trailers, leaked footage, photos etc. The end result? Weitz didn't do anything better, New Moon may have even tumbled a few steps below Twilight. The flaws mainly exist within the static acting of the cast - more than half of the dialog is mumbled and said with no emotion. Bella (Kristen Stewart) manages to maintain only one expression throughout the entire film - whether she's sad, happy, exhilarated, depressed (very Channing Tatum). Robert Pattinson hasn't displayed any great talent either. The only considerably good performance was that of Taylor Lautner who has put on a much better show than last time (that's speaking with his body out of mind)although his character did begin to slip near the end.<br/><br/>All in all, New Moon is a big yawn - there is some action which does help brighten the scene but is very brief and provides no satisfaction. There is nothing drawing the viewer in, nothing that keeps you compelled for more - it's almost a chore to watch this bore of a movie through to the end. As I've said already this is largely a fault of the stone- faced, monotonous acting. Both Twilight and New Moon never showed us why Edward loves Bella, nothing ever convinced the audience that they are truly in love. Twilight seemed to have been rushed to get to to the action, while New Moon seems to have concentrated on how many shirts we can get off. Box office success or not, New Moon has done it for me, I have truly lost all hope for the franchise - unless a serious cast change is in order, nothing is tempting me to and I don't think I'll be waiting outside Eclipse's doors."
"nba_is_jakob","1","13","19","18 December 2009"," And we all thought twilight was bad!
","OK, twilight was a massive success and gained popularity from 13 year old girls with a crush. Its no surprise that this installment of the twilight saga would be even bigger with a even better looking and more buff character in Jacob. If thats all it takes to make a real bad movie a massive success then we need to take a long hard look at ourselves and wonder what the world has come to.<br/><br/>The acting was very stiff from both Kristen Stewert and Robert Pattinison and how can one believe that there in love with acting like that which made it totally unbelievable. Do these two actors think that long awkward and uncomfortable silences and pauses with an unnecessary amount of staring will make us believe there in love, i mean please why don't you two show some emotion.<br/><br/>The CGI was better in this than the first which wasn't hard because they were terrible. There were a couple of scenes where you might have a chuckle but thats it from a entertainment stand point.<br/><br/>The story is very boring and slow and the film went way longer than it should have done.<br/><br/>The only half positive reviews i have heard have been from fans of the book or again girls with crushes for guys who for no reason take there shirts off non stop for no real reason. If your a fan of the book series and enjoyed the first one then i guess you might enjoy this one, but if you want a pure cinematic experience then this isn't for you. I would recommend renting out a film like Donnie Darko which has nothing to do with twilight but it is awesome.<br/><br/>1/10"
"CountVladDracula","1","41","72","22 November 2009"," One of the worst supernatural romances ever written
","I can't even express into words how strong my distaste for the entire Twilight Saga truly is. In my personal opinion Twilight is prefabricated, poorly written, shallow, demographic-forcing tripe. When I was a fourteen-year-old girl I was very obsessed with the vampire anti-hero Lestat from Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles. And though Lestat had many relationship issues he was still a better defined and more well conceived character than that of Edward Cullen.<br/><br/>Edward and Bella are poorly thought out, two dimensional shells. This was a deliberate effort by the author so that every young reader could imagine themselves as the main characters but in the process she made them so superficial that the characters lacked any quality of definition. They did not feel like real people.<br/><br/>Not only is Twilight poorly written but it also hinders upon actual mythology. The notion of vampires glittering in the sun is laughable at best. It brings to mind the recollection of such toys as the My Little Pony dolls. The logic behind vampires sparkling in the sunlight is non-existent. A vampire burning in the sun has been a staple of Gothic fiction for many years. There are real diseases and disorders in the world that make sunlight harmful to certain individuals. Scientifically it's more plausible to be harmed by sunlight than to 'naturally' sparkle in it.<br/><br/>Another flaw in the mythos of Twilight is the definition of werewolf. I cannot tell you how many times I have come across Twilight fans who insist the characters who can turn into wolves are not werewolves. They say that these characters are shape-shifters. A shape shifter by traditional definition can take on multiple forms, not just one. Many Twilight fans also argue that within the mythos of the books a true werewolf only changes on the full moon and that's why Jacob and company are not actually werewolves. The parapsychology student in me winces at this. In many traditional werewolf folklore out of Germany and France there are werewolves that most certainly can change at will, are aware in their wolf form, and are not bound by the phase of the moon. The very word werewolf means man-wolf. It does not mean part man and part wolf. It comes from the notion of a man INTO a wolf. Most classic werewolf stories (before The Wolf-Man movie) had the werewolf changing from a person into an actual wolf.<br/><br/>The very first werewolf legend can be traced back to the Greek myth of King Lycaon. According to legend King Lycaon served human flesh at a feast for Zeus (the king of the Gods). Zeus was so offended that he punished Lycaon by turning him into a wolf. Only his eyes remained human. This myth is where the terms Lycanthrope, Lycanthropy and the more modern Lycan come from. I guess it's safe to say Stephenie Meyer does not do her research in regard to the occult before writing these stories.<br/><br/>Not only is Twilight poorly written and intellectually insulting to occultists (amateur and professional alike) but it also promotes very unhealthy relationships. Edward Cullen is abusive, stalkerish and obsessive. Edward has also had moments of physically harming Bella. Bella is equally so but that does not make it okay, nor does it make the relationship healthy. At one point Edward disables Bella's mode of transportation and has her kidnapped as a means to 'protect' her. If he was not a vampire this would be viewed as highly abusive of the character. There is a fine line between being chivalrous and sexist. Edward Cullen crossed that line miles ago. This sets a very unhealthy ideal of what defines romantic relationship for the young readers of Twilight. I am not saying not to read Twilight nor am I saying to burn the books. I am simply saying that it needs to be looked at in context for what it truly is and that there are far higher quality reads out there. If you want a chivalrous character who is NOT sexist, seek The Dresden Files novels by Jim Butcher. The hero, a wizard named Harry Dresden, is very chivalrous without being sexist.<br/><br/>Bella is what modern writers call A Mary Sue. In fiction writing and role playing games Mary Sue characters are strongly frowned upon. A Mary Sue is a character of shallow quality who is nearly flawless. The character is so perfect that even her so-called flaws are endearing.<br/><br/>I have run online text based role playing games since 1999 and I can tell you there are plot points in Twilight I would not have allowed in my game. A major one would be when Bella and Edward finally had their daughter toward the end of the book series the child aged extremely fast and by age seven or so she was involved with her mother's werewolf ex-boyfriend. To me this is disgusting. I would never have allowed this in my online role playing game. She might have developed with supernatural speed but she still has only had only seven-years-life experience and I feel that is certainly not enough time to be in a romantic relationship with a grown man. That was disturbing to me. Supernatural speed aging does not give her enough life experience for that sort of relationship. That was simply not right.<br/><br/>In short Twilight is not what I would consider a good read even for those who truly love supernatural romances. See out the likes of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. Twilight is not worth the time. There are higher quality works of fiction out there."
"jdat_1990","2","10","14","16 September 2013"," I was Blackmailed into Watching this...
","Seriously. I wouldn't have gone any other way.<br/><br/>At the persistence of a die-hard fan girlfriend, I read the books. While cheesy and obviously not my style, I could see how it would appeal to the Prince Charming fantasy that most high-school girls like. As I got the ending I was gradually wanting more and more bathroom breaks. It's just not my thing. And having it drawn out through not one, not two, but four books just made me... irritable.<br/><br/>Then I watched the movie, with the same girlfriend.<br/><br/>I could sigh here and rub my temples, but let's get this over with. I don't think we need to harp anymore on just how horrible the acting of Kristen Stewart and Bobbie Patinson was. Taylor Lautner deserves some credit too. Obviously picked to be eye-candy, this dude cannot act. He looks sarcastic or angry through the entire film. His attempts at dialogue are pretty sad, and his hatred for vampires somehow makes you think he is a closet sparkly fan. I think he has a crush on Alice.<br/><br/>Speaking of... well, Alice was dainty in the books, but here, they turn her into a pretty little butterfly, flitting and flying, huffing when she doesn't get her way. Jasper was supposed to be intense and controlled, but he comes off more as bored to be here, the same for Carlisle and Esme. Rosalie is a bitch, and even though her acting makes everyone else seem like drawings, she is still irritating and grating and you hate her anyway. The only good thing about this movie is Emmett. He seems to be having so much fun that it just makes us wanna know about him.<br/><br/>The plot makes a sad Kristen Stewart sad, or, in her case, bland. The heartbreak would only make a three-year old cry because he/she has a dirty nappy, and well... even in the book, she seemed like she spent the entire time just... moping. And if anyone did that in real life, if a friend, I would sit her down, and have a serious 'get over him!' talk, and since she doesn't have any friends, all you can do is just pray for Laurent to kill her. Another decent casting choice, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>So, she is drawn to Italy, where she flies off because Edwards is, yes, gonna kill himself because he realized he sparkles in the sunlight.... no wait, because Alice saw Bella jump into the water, and for some under explained reason she can't see what happens when the wolves are involved. I really didn't get that, in the books or in the movies. Meyer has a lot of these plot holes in her work.<br/><br/>And here we get to the only good side of the movie: The Vulturi. While their build-up is pretty weak, Micheal Sheen, Dakota Fanning, and whoever it is that plays Felix are incredible. Putting fear in the people's hearts, and well, during the Edward-Felix fight, I was chanting 'Felix, Felix, Felix,' In the movie theater, you kinda wished that the series was about them. They have the history, they have the background and something to build with. Hell, even as the bad guys, Meyer could have built them up a bit more.<br/><br/>In the end, nobody dies, and Bella and Edward are back together again even thought nobody understood why they broke up in the first place, Bella goes home to her ever-bland daddy-o played by Billy Burke, who went on to a stunning performance in 'Drive Angry' who, wouldn't you know, grounds his 17-year-old daughter for eternity. The end.<br/><br/>And it couldn't have come sooner.<br/><br/>I would have given this movie 1 star, but due to the excellent casting by the under-developed villains, as well as a couple others, I decided not to drop it down all the way. Overall, not a movie you want to waste your time with, considering the only good thing about it was a few of the side actors. Made for, by, and to honor the fans, and nobody else, which in my opinion, is a blatant lack of respect."

","First of all: I did not read the books. When I thought about seeing this movie I was aware about the possibility of a piece of pure bad acting, so I went to the cinema with a really and truthful feeling of detachment...nothing would ever surprise me! Indeed, the things went as I have predicted: it was one good show of bad acting! Although the movie was bad, my low expectations turn it kind of bearable, even entertaining...I found myself laughing during the ""dramatic scenes"" as Robert put his forced expressions to the limit! In the other way, Kristen have turned better then I've expected! She has done a near good work (forgetting the frequent blinking). At least she seemed sad when it was suppose to! By the way: is there anything more ridiculous then seeing guys on steroids without shirt during a movie about love overcoming all the obstacles? I would tolerate a scene or two, but that much time of abs and what else? I don't know!!!! Just disgusting! So, generally it was bad, but some things went kind of well: like the fact of Robert being away most of the time! The thing is: see the movie, but be aware of what you might find!!!"

"CranberriAppl","Null","7","9","2 September 2010"," Obsession is not love...sorry kids
","And grown a-- women who should know better. I watched New Moon last night via Netflix. That was the only way I would watch it bc I would never have paid for a ticket. From the beginning of this series, the hype killed any interest I had in it. The actors were everywhere. Teens went nuts, women my age (27)-nuts, women my MOM'S age went nuts. It just killed any plans I had to see it. First movie I didn't watch til this year during our blizzard. As I said, I watched NM last night and it was bad. I'm a fan of Buffy, Angel, some Anne Rice, heck, I even liked that weird Jim Carrey vampire movie from before he became a star, but Twilight just bugs me. The second time around, the sparkling faces *still* don't do it for me. I'm no big fan of ""Edward,"" but even he looked worse in this movie. ""KStew's"" range of emotions *still* consisted of Emo and More Emo. Out of the three, Jacob did the best acting bc he was the only one I hoped survived. He might have a future in Hollywood if he can get away from this franchise. Also, he and Edward had more chemistry than Bella had w/either one of them. Even in the last movie, the tension between them was palpable. The script was humorless which is pretty sad for a teen movie. It's obviously a moody film, but there was no typical-teen sarcasm or anything like that.<br/><br/>The story: it was utter garbage. No plot, no action, no suspense. I cringed through the entire movie. I only kept it on otherwise, it would have been a waste of my free trial. Anyway, I'm a person who can watch movies ranging from Citizen Kane to My Man Godfrey to Memento to The Hangover and enjoy them all. I'm not pretentious with entertainment, so I was honestly hoping that the series would have found a groove and improved once the 2nd movie appeared. Not so. It's still the same overly hormonal teenage stuff. It's funny because I'm an 80s baby so we had Clueless (loosely Shakespearean), Can't Hardly Wait, 10 Things (also Shakespearean), Scream, and many other teen flicks. These millennium kids have Twilight. They're getting gypped. Edward was a vision for a good chunk of the movie which suited me just fine; however, his absence caused Bella to have screaming fits at night (see: obsession). She gets closer to Jacob during this time doing pretty normal teenage stuff: motorcycles, movies, etc. She even embraces warmth. ((Which honestly, even in a fluffy movie like this, had so much potential. It would have been much more interesting if the story was written in a way that Jacob ACTUALLY had a chance. Her line: ""Don't make me choose bc it would be him, meaning Edward, pretty much killed any chance for a believable triangle.)) That goes to hell once Ed's ""sister"" returns and you just see a regression in Bella's character. She becomes more obsessed with Edward than before. She disses Jacob who actually helped her during the time she was depressed.<br/><br/>Which also begs to question: what is it that draws these guys to such a downer type of girl? I mean, she's so BLAH. Edward, OK yeah, I can see it, but Jacob could do so much better. He has a nice family, nice future sis-in-lawdude, get away from this moody girl.<br/><br/>Disclosure: I skipped over the entire part of the movie in the temple structure or whatever. Once Edward came back, Bella started talking about turning again, and I lost interest. The only reason she wanted to turn was because she had nothing else going for her, which is pretty sad for a girl of only 18. I guess this makes me part of ""Team Jacob"" but that's more because there was no obsession there. Her ""love"" for Edward was pure obsession not based in any type of reality. She's being hunted because of him. I totally understandwho wouldn't want to be w/someone whose presence makes them a target? //total sarcasm.<br/><br/>As for the effects, the CGI was better this time, but still obvious. I did like the werewolf scenes. Edward and Bella also did a good bit of mumbling; I shouldn't have to turn my volume to 50 or read lips to figure out what's going on.<br/><br/>When the movie ended, I said ""that's it?"" I had no desire to see Eclipse. In fact, I went ahead and read the plot on Wikipedia just so that another Netflix movie wouldn't be wasted."
"trashgang","3","7","9","26 August 2010"," just watch it for the Volturi's
","I am a martyr, I guess. My wife suggested to watch Twilight 2 yesterday. I had seen part 1 and it was a hell to sit through as you could see in my review. But all the fans told me and tried to convince me that in this vampire (sigh) flick there would be action. I agree, there is action...after waiting 90 minutes. Again it's a lot of blah blah and again it's one for teenagers. I just can't get it what an adult could love in this peace of celluloid shite, or you must be into Titanic and others of that kind. In the second part Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) has to choose between Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison) a vampire and Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) a werewolf. That is in fact the story, which one will it be...oooooh scary isn't it. For me the wrong part was almost immediately in the movie, the glistening Edward Cullen while walking in the sun. I was looking forward to meet the werewolfs but sadly it was all CGI, and not from a perfect kind. I mean, if you have seen 'Wolfman' their they use CGI too but much better and scarier. Maybe I am getting old but if I say An American Werewolf In London or The Howling I guess you all know what I mean. The best part is in the last half hour and takes only 15 minutes to watch. Yes, real vampires, the Volturi. That was the only part that satisfied me. I thought, hey, Aro Volturi is great, reminded me of Interview With A Vampire and wait a minute, Aro is played by Michael Sheen, Lucian in the Underworld franchise. He really is the only one that gave a great performance. The other Volturi were great too but didn't say that much. It is really those gang of Volturi that makes the movie watchable but sadly, you will have to take the lamentations of the others to get to that scene, doing that I always annoyed my immortal one with listening to the soundtrack and guessing who's playing now...do I need to say more? And waiting for the end credits to see if I guessed them right."
"benniegolightly","2","7","9","20 August 2010"," Tonight I died a little
","My friends told me to watch this flick and so I did. I have to admit I'm a bit shocked. I saw the first Twilight movie and I didn't think the next one could possibly be worse than the first one, but, unbelievable as it sounds, it is. Forget the painfully bad acting, the hilarious pointless screenplay, the embarrassing special effects (well sure they are somehow special), the awful soundtrack; the worst thing about this movie is that it's so boring. I never fall asleep watching a movie, but this time I went nearly there. Many people already explained why the movie isn't great at all, so I'm not going to repeat the same old things. I'll simply say that, even without paying attention to the big problems of the movie, some little, unintentionally funny details made my eyes widen in horror/amusement: awful make-up (why are Edward's lips covered in lipstick? Why is his face's pale skin complexion so damn different from his neck's one?), odd screams (when Bella screamed in her bed, all those nights, well, I laughed so hard), werewolves (nothing more to say), Jacob randomly taking his shirt off. I honestly disliked any small thing about the movie, but I wouldn't tell people not to watch it. If you're a fan I think you may like it, so I'd recommend you this; and if you're not a fan, even if you're a hater, you may like it too, if you watch it as a parody (it's not that difficult). It works both ways, and that's why I gave New moon a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1."
"MovieEnthusiast13","3","7","9","4 August 2010"," Taylor Lautner, put your shirt back on, you look like a fool!
","Honestly I don't know how New Moon beat records for midnight showings and other opening night records. This film contains shaky acting and the script is laughable. This is the first movie I have reviewed that I have little good to say about the movie.<br/><br/>Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is living at home with her dad. On her birthday she goes to her boyfriends, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) to celebrate. He is a vampire, by the way. During the party she receives a paper cut and Edward's brother tries to attack Bella because of the blood. Luckily, the rest of Edward's family is good and they help Bella. Following this Edward then tells Bella that it is too dangerous for them to be together, his world is too dangerous for a human. His family leaves, vowing he will never see her again.<br/><br/>Trouble follows. It turns out a vampire that is mad at Edward goes after the now unprotected Bella for the kill. Then a group of werewolves, one of them being Bella's close friend Jake (Taylor Lautner) saves Bella. Desperately wanting to see Edward, Bella begins to engage in dangerous activities like cliff diving because when she is in danger, she sees Edward. Next, Edward hears that Bella is dead, and he goes to the Vulturi (Vampire Council sort of thing) who are the only ones which can kill a vampire. This is the closest to suicide for Edward. Racing to Italy where the Vulturi are located Bella tries to warn Edward that she is still alive, and he shouldn't die. With out spoiling too much, I'll just say a sequel is already being planned.<br/><br/>The acting in New Moon is unsteady. Robert Pattinson is actually not in the film much, but when he is he delivers a solid vampire-like stare. Kristen Stewart is fine. She was probably one of the best choices for this role, but the main problem is the script. Taylor Lautner may be appealing for teenage girls, but when he says ""Don't anger me"" its not really intimidating, funny more than anything else. The script is weak and certain moments made we role my eyes or drop my jaw in awe of the number of clichés and stupid lines.<br/><br/>The long pauses of awkwardness in this film are boring and unnecessary. The animation of the wolves is done awkwardly as well and the CGI is horrible if compared to a film like Avatar, or even the new Harry Potter. I would not recommend New Moon to anyone, although I'm sure many teen girls will still line up to see Taylor Lautner without a shirt or Robert Pattinson just standing there. If you insist on going to see a 'Twilight' movie, go see the first one again, or wait for Eclipse."

","I spent the day doing writing and design work while watching movies. A normal day. First I watched 2046 (my first time seeing it), then Me and You and Everyone We Know (my first time seeing it in at least a year, maybe two), then I'm Not There (first time since the DVD was first released). All three were great, even if I was only half watching while I worked. And no, I don't sleep very much. <br/><br/>As the night settled in I started to get those oh-so-special cabin fever feelings. So I called up my younger sister, who had been wanting me to go check out New Moon with her, and we decided to meet up and see the film. The two of us aren't all that much alike, truthfully, but we both love film/movies. She collects DVDs, loves going to the theater and at one time worked at a theater. Same stuff going on over here, though to much geekier, obsessive compulsive degrees.<br/><br/>The film was ... ummmm. Pretty bad. Awful, even. There's this group of Native American youths who run around together doing some really serious outlaw-type like swimming in cold water and eating big muffins. One of the guys gets mad and destroys his girlfriend's face ... then she makes him some really big muffins (nope, that wasn't a pun). She understands his rage because, you see, these dudes are actually werewolves (I suppose that's why their shirts are off in chilly Oregon, but I don't really understand the logic). They do not remind of Michael J. Fox. They turn into very large wolves that hunt vampires and fix motorbikes and go to private schools. <br/><br/>All through the film I was laughing as I kept running through all the SNL skits I could easily write spoofing this blockbuster. Too easy, but I just love the idea of these Native American guys walking home from private school, fully dressed and trying to decide if they should hang out or go separate ways before they go home and get all mechanical. Once they decide that, yes, they're going to hang out, they all take off their shirts and go eat some muffins and look at the girl with the chewed up face. One of them even decides that he wants to fight the 100 lb. heroine (Bella Swan, duh) at one point.<br/><br/>The bare chest stuff wasn't the only funny business going on. Edward, the biggest pu$$y of an anti-hero ever (sorry for saying the word ""pu$$y,"" but I figured this was the perfect opportunity to play my once-per-decade Pu$$y Card), keeps appearing out of nowhere, looking incredibly brooding. Then he cries. Then he tries to kill himself in front of a perfectly happy parade. Then he gets his tush beat by a vampire played by an awful actor (obviously cast for his fake fighting skills). Then he goes home and wants to play house again with the Bella Swan. Then Taylor Swift's werewolf boyfriend takes off his shirt and tries to fight the pu$$y. Don't get too excited, though, the dudes don't even fight over the girl. In fact, the film just kind of ends. And this is not exactly the kind of story that you can end without a payoff. Actually, it's hardly a story at all.<br/><br/>Directed by Chris Weitz, who I was once SERIOUSLY rooting for (About A Boy and Chuck & Buck were both excellent early works), New Moon is something of a trapper keeper film. That is, if they were still making trapper keepers, those awesome contraptions would sell like crazy if you put the dudes with no shirts on one side and the big pu$$y on the other.<br/><br/>Oh, drag ... I'm outta pu$$ys on my Pu$$y Card. Guess that means I should go watch Russian Dolls and pass out."

","Let me just preface this review by saying I knew this movie would be bad. I had no doubt about that but what I didn't anticipate was just how bad it would be. It really was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>The lead actors need some acting lessons, badly. I felt as if I was watching amateur night at the community theatre and not some highly paid (and unjustifiably so, in my opinion) Hollywood actors.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson spends the entirety of his scenes looking constipated. As a vampire, he's not convincing in the slightest. I feel his ""acting chops"" would've been much better suited to a Pepto-Bismol commercial. <br/><br/>Kristen Stewart once again manages to make her character totally inarticulate. It's really difficult to even watch her as she blinks, stutters and stammers her way through each line of dialogue she has. Also, she has a highly annoying habit of arching her eyebrow. I have no clue why she does this but it's very irritating.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner has a big problem with overacting. His performance doesn't ring true, it seems rather forced and unconvincing. His effeminate voice doesn't help him to sound intimidating while speaking lines when he's supposed to sound as such. Also, while unrelated to his acting, still a major annoyance is that his character only wears a shirt for about two minutes of the movie and the rest of the time he's bare-chested. He has no reason to go around without a shirt other than to try to play the ""beefcake"", and it's nauseating. One scene or two without the shirt would've been enough to ""get the idea"", not the whole movie.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is largely forgettable, and seemingly unimportant to rest of the film. It's almost as if you're watching a movie that only truly has three characters in it. Every one else is just sort of there. <br/><br/>The CGI was horrible. You would have thought with as much money as the first movie made they could've gotten some halfway decent effects for the sequel but I guess not.<br/><br/>Watching this, I didn't even really feel like I was watching a real movie. It was so horribly boring and uninteresting that I could hardly finish it. In truth, I don't even know why I did other than to be able to give a full review on exactly why it was so terrible.<br/><br/>I was hoping that with ""Eclipse"" being released today that I'd only have to listen to all the undeserved hype about ""Twilight"" for one more movie, ""Breaking Dawn"", but now the greedy movie studio behind the franchise has decided to split the last book into two movies so they can keep the kiddies coming back in order to milk them out of as much money as they can before this fad is forgotten like the Macarena. I dread having to hear about this series another minute, let alone for the next year or two. Why can't people see how crappy these movies are and just stop seeing them? I mean, I saw it for free so I don't feel bad for contributing to its gross. No way in hell would I have paid to see this. You shouldn't either!"

","I'm a twilight-hater, admitted! but this is not just a hating review, the film was confusing, trying to squeeze lots of actions in two hours failed big time ! those who have not read the book -like me- would never understand a thing ! and don't tell me you have to read the book before seeing the movie because that's just a lame defending line otherwise why would we have the great (shutter island/ the notebook/ requiem for a dream) and so many other movies which I have seen without even knowing they were originally books! Bella actually fell for Jacob in this part I've been told by a friend! was that shown in the film ? not at all ! just her getting along with Jacob then Edward showing up and that's it ! but you know what, the twilight staff are aware of all the bad stuff that they are creating, but why would they spend too much money? or spend more time (a movie comes every year) creating a better version and thinking deeper of what to put in the coming-up film, while they get all the attention and all the drooling ladies and all the money without ever even trying so hard? bad but smart ! heh!"

It was directed by Chris Weitz, who made the excellent comedy ""About a boy"" and the so-so fantasy flick ""The Golden Compass"", but this have to be his worst film. It was even worse than ""American Pie"". ""The Golden Compass"" it's a masterpiece compared with this inane, muddled and worthless piece of junk.

"sjmutchie","5","7","9","11 June 2010"," Had a few high points, but other than that...
","All right, so I'll try to be kind about the acting given by the inexperienced teenagers.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart: I never expected much out of her, especially after her mediocre performance in Twilight. And, I was smart not to expect anything. She didn't improve AT ALL. Her lines are still rushed, and emotionless. Bella's character hasn't developed at all either.<br/><br/>When Edward walks towards Bella, or enters the scene, her face doesn't even light up like a real love-struck teenager's would. With Jacob, it does. I do not approve of being a part of the 'teams' that they've invented for Edward or Jacob, but as a third-party observer, she has much better chemistry with Jacob. When Edward leaves her in the woods, do you think that she would shed ONE BLOODY TEAR?! She doesn't even appear to be affected. And when she is 'depressed' for three months, could you fix your screams so that they don't sound like you're going into labor and giving birth? Thank you.<br/><br/>Now Robert Pattinson: His accent was MUCH better. He didn't sound like he had a speech disability this time around. The only beef I have with him is his lack of understanding of Edward's emotions while he says his lines. In the scene when he leaves Bella in the woods, the way he relays his lines makes him sound like he enjoys leaving her. Even though I struggled through the books, I do remember that Edward is supposed to be 'pained beyond description' while breaking up with Bella. And let us not blame Robert for his lack of abs. We all know that no one can compare to Taylor Lautner. (Stifles a laugh) His fight scene with the Volturi was very entertaining to watch, however. That might just be because I enjoy watching Edward getting his trash kicked, but whatever...<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner: The only thing he had that met any expectation was his muscular figure. His lines were very poorly delivered, but his chemistry with Bella was good. A lot more noticeable than Edward's. Jacob does deliver a few witty lines, but they are almost thrown away due to his rushed delivery. I liked him better with the long hair too. According to 'Indian' tradition, cutting your hair is disgraceful to the culture.<br/><br/>I was suffering through the entire film, thinking that there was no possible hope of redemption, UNTIL, the scene with the Volturi rolled around. Despite the fact that it is not NEARLY long enough, I was absolutely blown away by Michael Sheen's acting as Aro, the leader of the Volturi. Even Cameron Bright, who played Alec, only had one line, but delivered it very well. Dakota Fanning played psychotic Jane very well, but the only suggestion I would have to her, would be to input some dramatic pauses in her dialogue. It makes the audience hang on her every word. The few she has, anyway. I'm looking forward to the expansion of her role in Eclipse. Bella's lack of emotion while Edward is being tortured by Jane's 'pain' power just screams how horrible of an actress she is. Christopher Heyerdahl and Jamie Campbell Bower do a wonderful job of playing Aro's wings; Caius and Marcus. Jamie Campbell Bower's glare that rests on his brow adds GREATLY to his character development. I'm almost tempted to skip Eclipse altogether, just so that I can see Michael Sheen again in Breaking Dawn! But then again, I would be missing Peter Facinelli and Elizabeth Reaser, who never disappoint. The rest of the Volturi guard, Felix, Demetri, and Heidi, also did a great job of making a good impression with little dialogue.<br/><br/>So when it boils down to it, every character in the movie, including minor ones like Charlie, and the Cullens, do very well. The only ones I cannot stand are the three main ones: Bella, Edward, and Jacob. If you can get around those, then this movie will be mildly entertaining. I only bought the DVD so that I could watch the Volturi scene over and over again!"
"Skino473","2","7","9","10 June 2010"," Too false to be true
","I met a lot of girls who actually Loved this movie. I had no choice but to watch it myself in order to make an opinion. Well, this movie is just marketing. The moment the camera showed the muscles of Jacob when he was taking of his shirt so he can put it on Bella's wound, i felt stupid. The director obviously didn't had to do low the angle of the shot, but he did it. Its a movie made for little teen girls, and just for them. The movie seems to lose direction, since the main character (Edward Cullen) is completely missing and the whole story follows Bella Swan in her search of her, the same time she has a flirt with another boy. The story is yelling that the creator is a woman who dreams of a universe where she is the center. Jacob runs here and there always half naked, and Edward always talks like ""i love you"" and ""i miss you"", even if he is a blood sucking vampire. For all this fake feelings i give this movie a 2/10, and a ""not worth watching it"", unless of course you're a teenage girl. In that case, you might like it.<br/><br/>Skino473"

","I didn't read the novels, let's get that out of the way. I'm not here to review the novels, I'm here to review the movie. I saw this movie with my girlfriend. She didn't even enjoy it that much. Let's start with the acting, if you can call it that. Kristen showed no emotion at all. I was told that's what her character was sort of supposed to be like. Whenever she was on the screen it felt like was watching a bas Jr.High play. Robert wasn't very convincing either. It was weird seeing him in this role. He was good enough in Harry Potter but he seemed to be trying too hard. Taylor was the best of the three, but that's not saying much. He was the only believable main role. The film story. Was so empty. I could tell that these novels were never supposed to be on the big screen just form seeing the movies. There were parts that just kind of zipped by. The story itself seems like a load of bull to me, but thats just me. The film. At least the CGI improved. Parts that really bugged me. When Jacob took his shirt off. All the girls swooned and cheered. I almost yelled back ""You're all perverts!"" but felt that to be unnecessary. But come on, that's what I'd be called if a cheered at an 18 year old girl taking her shirt off. When the native guy died. I didn't know his character enough to really care. Bad job film, bad job. Characters attitudes. Well, I didn't know that girls felt that people who basically stalk you, are depressed at every little thing, sneak in your room while you sleep, and never age were so attractive. And there's another side to this shown in the movie. The woman who was attacked by her ""werewolf"" lover. I call that abuse, but again, thats just me. Parts I liked. The credits, my suffering ended. And when Jacob said ""You're making me angry!"" I had to stop from laughing. I leaned to my girlfriend and said ""You won't like me when I'm angry. I turn into a big green wolf with purple pants!"" Work. Yeah, I worl at a theatre. There were people lined up before I even showed up for the midnight show. SEVEN FRICKEN HOURS early. And they must have been 13 or 14 years old. I didn't get a break for the next three days at work. FInal thoughts. Dryer than toast. All in all a bad film. Don't expect much more from the one coming out next month. A bunch of nerds playing dungeons and dragons for two weeks could play through a more convincing story than this. Vampires can't read minds, make you feel pain by looking at you, can't see the future, and DIE in sunlight. They don't f%&$ing sparkle! This series went from a book that had potential to a complete and obsessive mess. I fear my children will be going to school with a bunch of Edward's, Bella's, and Jacob's. I'm done ranting. Not a very good movie. *** out of 10 for trying. Stick with bloodsucking killers and violent beasts."

","Lemme see. I had to see this movie, it wasn't my choice, I had to. I knew it would be bad, but I strengthened myself, I couldn't be THAT bad, I mean Vampires are cool, name is New Moon, it had to do something with werewolves, it was based on best selling novel. Damn, it might be passable.<br/><br/>Then the movie started, sparkling vampire came on to silver screen and I knew I was in hell. Bad acting, I haven't seen Twilight, but I still knew what would happen, and somehow knew what kind of story this would be. I mean, somebody who hadn't seen first movie knew what would happen. And characters. No soul, no character, just devices to keep plot going. Scenes were long and slow, but not ""Once upon a time in the west""-long and slow. It was boring to watch. No action, no romance, no good plot. Oh and this movie romanticizes madness and self-destructive tendencies, it's perfectly normal to stay in catatonic-state for four months because your perfect boyfriend left you, it's perfectly normal and recommendable to act suicidal just to see illusion of him in your mind. This movie is just twisted. From slow start, through slow and unneeded middle section, to boring, very predictable anticlimax.<br/><br/>Seeing this movie made me depressed for a month. No kidding. It was just that bad experience."

","I enjoyed the first movie. It wasn't great, but it was entertaining. So I rented NEW MOON.<br/><br/>Within two minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake. Some movies start slow, but this one starts just plain boring. It's like watching ketchup ooze out of a bottle.<br/><br/>I stuck with it for an hour, but within 15 minutes I was reading reviews on the IMDb on my cell phone, as I needed something to do to kill time while I was waiting for the picture to be over. Finally I decided there was no point in waiting and shut it off. The prospect of another 90 minutes of this abyssal ooze was too daunting to even consider.<br/><br/>It's not like I have to have wall-to-wall action. Some of my favorite films are ""deliberately paced."" What I do need is some kind of a plot, or interesting characters, or something other than terminally brooding teenagers gazing vacantly into space.<br/><br/>Yes, I was a brooding teenager once, but that doesn't necessarily put me off in a movie. What does put me off is being bored.<br/><br/>Perhaps fans of the books will find something of interest, but as entertainment, this film is rock-bottom."
"jadejedi","4","7","9","14 April 2010"," Die-hard fans will love this, but not everyone else.
","I am a fan of the Twilight series. I love the books. But the movies suck. I can't see why people would enjoy this crap. Well, I can see people wanting to see the new and improved Taylor Lautner and Robert P., but Kristen Stewart? Now that is a joke.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart can act, but she is very bad at it. Her constant blinking and licking her lips is irritating. If I were the director of this movie, I wait until Stewart stops fidgeting to call it a good shot, but if she doesn't I'd fire her and look for a new Bella. And at Volterra when Edward was about to die, what was that with her hair. She was like ""No, please *moves hair over-dramatically, PLEASE!"". You don't need to show us your hair Kristen. We can see it fine.<br/><br/>Also, Chris Weitz is a good director (I loved American Pie), but this was another disappointment. He added to many features, tried to do too much action, he cut out important scenes (the Alice scenes to be exact), got the lines messed up, and most importantly, he got some terrible actor(s)/actress(s). The Golden Compass was better than this and he still messed up that one, too! Tsk. I'm ashamed of director with such potential.<br/><br/>The only good news I have is about the evil people, the Volturi. Jamie Campbell Bower, Michael Sheen, and Dakota Fanning nailed their roles. Actually, the only reason I saw this was to see Dakota Fanning play evil and how they would do the airplane scene to Volterra (which they ignored). Michael Sheen was eccentric, crazy, and violent, yet calm and serene and peaceful. And Dakota Fanning, what an actress. Who needs Kristen Stewart; Fanning could play a better Bella.<br/><br/>Overall, boring. I swear, though, I thought the special effects with the vampire moving and werewolves were cool. That was good. But that's all. It had a base, but no structure. So therefore, I give it a 4/10."

","The Twilight Saga: New Moon<br/><br/>The best part about dating a vampire is that you can totally cheat on them during the day, and they'll never know. And while the despondent teen in this rom-horror does attempt a similar impropriety on her undead boyfriend, she mistakenly does so with a werewolf.<br/><br/>When his clan is forced to relocate to avoid human detection, brooding vampire Edward (Robert Patterson) must go along. Distraught over losing her immortal boo, Bella (Kristen Stewart) lashes out in destructive behaviour, which lands her in the waiting arms of teen- wolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner).<br/><br/>With a higher production value than its predecessor, this second installment of the Twilight series is more involving: it creates a volatile love triangle and reveals more about the vampire/wolf-pack pact. Unfortunately, it's sopping in teen melodrama.<br/><br/>As for simultaneously dating creatures of the night, just be sure to use protection, i.e. a silver-plated diaphragm or garlic flavoured condoms.

","I also have not read ANY of the books. I'm sure they're great. Having siad that, this ""movie"" was absolutely so dull and brutally stagnant I absolutely cannot believe it got distribution and people paid money to see it. I took my daughter to see the first movie, Twilight, in the theater. I wasn't expecting anything ground-breaking or spectacular, and I pretty much got what I expected - a tweenage love story with 2 dimensional characters and a thin plot line about teenage vampires and werewolves and how they deal with their issues while going to high school. Transylvania 90210 basically. New Moon, on the other hand, is a movie that looks like they took whatever was left on the cutting room floor and slapped it together and put a couple songs on top of it. The only redeeming quality of the film is the lush forest background. I am pretty sure there wasn't even a script. The actors just showed up on the set and improvised incomplete sentences - I swear to God that's what it felt like: Bella: ""You cut your hair!"" Jacob: ""That's not all that's been going on..."" Really? You mean that's not all that's been going on in the course of the school year with vampires and werewolves running around town? I'm on the edge of my seat... Did the head vampire guy get an oil change too? I can't stand the suspense. In all seriousness I commend Summit Entertainment on creating the ""pet rock"" of the decade and getting people to cough up good money to see... nothing. It's not a horror film because there's no suspense or horror. It's not a drama because there is no underlying tension or tangible conflict... no characters even raise their voices at each other... it's basically a LONG moving photograph of a few shirtless guys and a couple emo girls hanging out. Surely there was a crew member on the set of the film that went home after work and said to themselves ""I can't believe I'm working on this. This is an embarrassment."" I have never been so un-entertained in my life. If this is where movies are headed, I don't blame people for just staying at home and plugging into youtube for 2 hours instead. No plot, no commendable acting, no substance, and a sequel on the way. New Moon."

There were TV spots on every every 30 minutes encouraging us to go see it. that we won't be disappointed. Truth is this movie was a disappointment. Disappointing that it made so much money. Wow. this movie was so bad. Crappy directing, crappy acting. It felt to me like the actors didn't even care in this movie. Like they just showed up to work and went home at the end of the day. Like they weren't invested in their roles. <br/><br/>This movie is supposed to be a love story and yet the two leads had absolutely no chemistry on screen. It felt like they didn't even know each other. And it felt so awkward, I was embarrassed to watch them at times, and the melodrama which was just about every second didn't help that. By the way before I saw this film I read the screenplay. I wasn't impressed with it, I didn't think it was very good, but the movie was worse. The lines were delivered dramatically when there was no room for drama. Wow, this movie was horrible. Worse than the first which I found mildly entertaining. But this, this raises the bar on how Dodgy Hollywood can be. <br/><br/>On an upside. The scene where Bella wrecks the bike and Jacob rips off his shirt to help her made me laugh for days. <br/><br/>1/5"

Even the title takes a minute to show the name of the movie i.e. new moon across a fading full moon. Another thing which amazes me is how the characters react when they kiss? they shiver.. MY GOD!!! Who the hell does that? I like kristen stewarts's acting because it is really natural and she is like that even in award ceremonies but this movie makes me hate bella. Out of the two hours, 1 hour and 45 minutes are lost on the line ""hole in my chest"". Edward leaves her right after she gets attacked and she takes till the end of the movie to decipher that it was for her own good...r u kidding me? The wolves are animated superbly but they are given less than 5 minutes on the screen which I think is a lost because a few fight scenes could have paced the movie. You know the end of the movie even before it begins, not because you have read the book but because you saw the trailer.

The (few) funny lines weren't actually amusing, and i found myself laughing at the unfunny parts, like when Belly-Welly cut her finger in the beginning, and when Edward wanted to kill himself by SHOWING OFF HIS NAKED TORSO!! (Which wouldn't have really worked, because due to older vampire folklore, vampires do NOT have sparkly skin, so people would be more likely to think he was being Vince Noir from The Mighty Boosh, or David Bowie.)<br/><br/>However, the movie is very pretty. there's LOTS of eye-candy (more ways than one!) and the forest is pretty.

Comes complete with gratuitous scenes of teenage male characters taking off their shirts and showing off their muscles to ensure enough screams by tween girls in the theater will make you giggle instead of concentrating in the movie itself. Just when you thought the formula of ""any unusual social circle + hot teens having relationship problems"" had been cherry picked to death, Hollywood comes along and mixes us up a new batch of the same-old (again). While watching this movie, you will get an eerie sensation that every single cast member was type-casted to attract broad types of teen stereotypes so that everyone out there who watches the movie can have their own favorite character they can relate too, just like in those old WB Shows. Once your mind gets over the whole vampire thing, it truly is a very stale and genetic script of boy gets girl, boy loses girl, etc. You get the point."

","Possible Spoilers: Book and Movie I think most of these reviews are being unfair, though I can understand a lot of the points that have been made. I was on the fence about going to see this movie because of these reviews here. I'm glad I choose to watch it! The directors compacted a book to a movie, which could have easily been well over four hours, into two. This movie could have been one of those slaughtering of book to movie scenarios like Blood and Chocolate, the directors could have not followed the book at all, again like BandC, but they didn't. It was a decent job and New Moon, in my opinion, was better than Twilight. Honestly, it was really closer to the book than Twilight was; this is probably why people felt it was rushed though. It was too much for two hours and had the movie been made longer it would have been a terrific adaptation.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses were better, it was even funny at points when it was meant to be intentionally funny; they were familiar with the material they had to work with. Special effects kind of wavy, but they aren't everything. The fact that the story was so close to the book made up for the sometimes cheesy computer-generated images. More screen time for the Volturi and a bit more of Jacob/Bella interaction as well and it would have moved 'great' to 'amazing,' but that can be corrected in Eclipse. Also the addition of more interior monologue from Bella was a good idea. The music I didn't really pay much attention to, but then again it wasn't a Mickey Mousing like Twilight had been. The music just seemed to be not as important in New Moon.<br/><br/>I also read something about Kristen Stewart not being able to actÂ…Bella was dull in New Moon; she was depressed because Edward left, she was supposed to be that way. I read all the books as well and though I'm not the biggest fan of Stewarts she did a good job acting depressed. And Rob Pattinson playing Edward did decent as well. In the beginning he was all happy-go-lucky, but as the movie progressed, he looked that way because he was in pain at having to leave Bella! I haven't read the New Moon book for awhile, but I do read the books often enough to remember this.<br/><br/>Overall I was pleased with New Moon."
"angelawebb88","4","83","158","20 November 2009"," I thought vampires were meant to be interesting?!
","I read all four Twilight books a long time ago when they first came out - I liked the general idea but thought that the writing and plot was terrible, and after the whole Twilight hysteria I ended up HATING everything about it. However, I will admit I was quite excited when I heard they were making movies. So I went to see the first movie the day it came out. I was thoroughly disappointed but oh so entertained in a so-bad-its-good sense.<br/><br/>So when New Moon came out I rushed to go see it, anticipating a similar hilarious showing. And that it was! However, I was ALSO pleasantly surprised by some changes:<br/><br/>GOOD THINGS - Jacob Black. Not only was I totally mesmerized by everything below his neck (and spent the whole movie feeling like a pedo), I also thought his acting was pretty good. Taylor is a very likable and sweet person and he made Jacob go from being my least favorite character in the book, to my most favorite in the movie. <br/><br/><ul><li>The action. The few minutes of action scenes were actually quite good! The special effects were perfect and everything just worked. Much much MUCH better than the stupid ass effects used in the first film.</li></ul><br/><br/>BAD THINGS - Kristen Stewart. My god this girl can't act for shizz! It's just... oh god.... it's just so bad. How does she get hired?!?! I feel so uncomfortable watching her. In comparison, the rest of the cast appear highly interesting and very competent. Go them!<br/><br/><ul><li>Boring. Some scenes were unnecessarily long and most of the characters severely lacked depth. They hold no interest and it is hard to pay attention. The scenes between Edward and Bella were the worst - they went on forever talking crap. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The script. Who keeps hiring this screenwriter?! If she was actually talented she could take that awful book and turn it into something decent. But she's not, so all she does is create an even larger pile of crap. </li></ul><br/><br/>Everything and everyone else does not even get a mention because they were all so mediocre (and not anger-inducing). I will say this: New Moon was not as bad as Twilight. I like this new director. Everything was relatively better. Relatively being the operative word here. Enjoy!"

","I don't even know where to begin for this review as I was so extremely disappointed by New Moon, the latest Twilight chapter. I saw the first episode of the Saga recently because everywhere I turned there was an article or pictures of Robert Pattinson and I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I enjoyed it, thought it was original and saw how it could appeal to a younger generation. I wasn't hooked and didn't necessarily feel the ""twilight mania"" but nevertheless wanted to see what would happen next and decided to watch the second installment. I even had some slight anticipation, and Fabio had lots (but shhhh that's a secret).<br/><br/>What an enormous letdown for both of us. Instead of building off of some of the tension and interesting elements of the first film, the sequel's plot is quasi non existent and the acting has managed to get worse. You hardly see Edward (Robert Pattinson), Bella's vampire love, as he leaves her early on in the film. He decides it is best for Bella if he and his family move out of Forks to spare her the danger of their presence. Bella is heartbroken and goes through a major teenage lovesick depression. The film then focuses on her childhood Indian friend Jacob Black in whom she tries to find comfort while still longing for Edward. But without wanting to give too much away, Jacob has some pretty bizarre secrets of his own...<br/><br/>The special effects are decent, the wolves quite cool, but the action sequences seem fake, there are no explanations for anything, no character development. The movie jumps from one scene to the next, particularly at the end, and I don't have other words and will not sugercoat it- this movie is stupid. I was hoping to feel some love and passion between Bella and Edward and the result was zero. This movie is a big, huge flop. Let's hope the next one is better and that people will still want to see it after this vampire and wolf wreck.<br/><br/>My rating: 2/10 Fabio's: 2/10 Total score: 4/20 For more movie reviews please check out and become a follower at: http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com"
"Tweekums","5","3","3","14 May 2012"," A weaker sequel
","Set soon after the original 'Twilight' film this one opens with Bella worrying about the fact that she will age while her vampire boyfriend Edward will remain forever young... it soon appears that isn't something she should have been worrying about as he soon announces that he and the rest of Cullen clan are moving away and they will never see each other again. Believing she has been abandoned Bella sinks into a depression until one day she puts herself in a dangerous situation and sees a vision of Edward. In order to keep seeing him she decides to play with danger some more. To do this she acquires to broken motorbikes and sets about repairing them with her friend Jacob. Over time they grow closer until one day he too refuses to see her... it turns out he is a werewolf! To make matters even harder for her the vampire Victoria is after her again. After an event occurs that leads Edward to believe Bella has died he decides that in true 'Romeo and Juliet' fashion he must kill himself too; with Alice Cullen's help Bella must race across the world to show him that she is still alive.<br/><br/>I'm not in the target demographic for this series of films but as I'd heard good reviews I thought I'd watch then when they were on television; the first one turned out better than I expected but unfortunately I don't think this one is as good. Once Edward has gone Bella spends the first half of the film just moping about and then gets closer to Jacob who isn't the most interesting of characters; even when we learn he is a werewolf. Talking of the werewolves the CGI did look impressive making them very wolf-like; the problem was the way they transformed from human to werewolf... it happened in a fraction of a second and thus was far less impressive that the slow transformations used in classic werewolf films like 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Company of Wolves'... although I suspect such transformations may have been considered to frightening for a film aimed at younger teens. Thankfully the film improves when we get back to the vampires; it helps the head vampire is played by an actor as good as Michael Sheen, it is a pity we didn't see more of his character, in an even smaller role Dakota Fanning impresses as Jane, a vampire who can inflict pain on people telepathically... hopefully we will see more of their characters in later instalments. Of the main cast Kristen Stewart does a good job as Bella, Robert Pattinson is okay as Edward and the third main actor, Taylor Lautner, seemed to be there so he could appeal to teenaged girls by spending most of his screen time looking fit without his shirt on. I'm sure this is a film for the fans (and there is nothing wrong with that), you certainly need to have watched 'Twilight' first to know what is going on as no time is wasted explaining who everybody is for newcomers."

","I've not read the Twilight books...and I am a 49 year old male...so...I know the demographics are not targeted at me. However, I have no begrudging anyone their success and harbor no ill will towards the Twilight gang. My opinion is that I am ""calling as I see 'em.""<br/><br/>Technically the film is structured OK. The cinematography is nice and the CGI is fine. To me, though, the film is like the Vampires of true Vampire myth...soul-less.<br/><br/>I see many reviews state that Twilight is ""teen porn."" I find that I disagree with this assertion. Twilight is more like people who need some porn in their life for there really isn't anyone in Twilight.<br/><br/>For the movie Bella acts like she needs to pee. Like...pee really bad. Bella is in blue jeans and she is so tormented that she is almost constantly bending in her blue jeans like she needs to find a potty quickly.<br/><br/>Bella pines for Edward...and acts like she must pee. She tells Jacob ""Don't do this"" in such a tortured manner...and acts like she must pee. She exits the car to run to the clock tower not knowing what to do...and she acts like she must pee. That is most definitely not ""teen porn."" <br/><br/>If mopey, whiny characters who bear no semblance to reality are your fantasy bag then have at it. In this kind of fantasy the characters are all tortured and the nerdy girl who looks like she needs to pee is loved by both vampire and werewolf. In real porn she is enjoying doing both of them at the same time...and she probably has more substance than Bella. Considering how little substance that porn girl is demonstrates how little substance Twilight is."
"Sjhm","3","5","6","13 May 2012"," Frustrating
","Truthfully, the CGI is good. Then we come to the real problem; Kirsten Stewart is not the actress to carry Bella off with conviction. It's a shame. Because this film is all about Bella. She is the core of the story, with Edward absent for a significant portion of the film. Without a good core, the cheesy dialogue and long sorrowful glances are just that, cheesy and long, it's impossible to see past them. It takes FOREVER for anything to happen. Happy or sad, suicidal or in a bad mood, it really is impossible to tell. Kirsten's broody look never changes. Scenes which should have some poignancy are simply flat and dull. I know that the character is somewhat thinly written, but really, come on. And then Robert Pattinson comes back in, and he also delivers his lines as though he's reading from a telephone directory. Very disappointing."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","4","5","6","17 January 2012"," New Moon (2009)
","It would have been nice to see a decent Vampire movie in such a setting. I really liked the photography and the overcast woodlands. That's about it for compliments. We get more of the same as the last film, spastically turgid dialogue, which just has characters saying how they feel. ""It hurts when you're not around, it hurts when you're right next me. It's like drowning or something painful etc."" That's pretty much what every character says. The allusions to Romeo and Juliette are misguided and heavy handed. Once again, the only decent actor/character gets about 2 minutes. It was such a waste. He had delivery, presence and most of all CONVICTION. However, he's soon chased off by some of the most annoyingly fake pixels to ever hit the screen. Roger Rabbit looked more realistic."
"Flick_Montana","2","5","6","24 May 2011"," Everything You Would Expect From a Twilight Sequel
","If you watched the first collection of lumped-together scenes, generously dubbed a ""movie"", then you probably dreaded seeing this one as well. Granted, it definitely hits true to the mark on the target audience. Young girls and confused boys have single-handedly supported this movie at the box office. Because of the numbers, you may have been lured in to actually seeing this monstrosity. If you have, God have mercy on you. If you have not yet seen it, heed the following words: This movie holds the dubious distinction of being even worse than the first one. All of the characters you don't care about are back to stare at each other again. Only this time, there are some CG effects and at least one very poorly-made fight scene. For the most part, however, you're in for a long trip through teen angst. And you better wear your gloves, because the acting is wooden enough to give you splinters.<br/><br/>I debated trying to review actual sections of this film, but since nothing actually happens, that was pretty tough. I didn't bother including a spoiler warning as there is nothing to spoil. It seems they are saving all the ""stuff that happens"" for the last film, after they've had their fingers in your wallet for two years. The conflict doesn't occur, the star-crossed love doesn't come to fruition and not nearly enough of the cast is killed off.<br/><br/>Even people who enjoyed the mind-numbing books will find it hard to love something about this film. Besides the pale prettiness or shiny shirtlessness (what, it's a word) of the male cast members. Oddly enough, Bella herself is probably the least appealing aspect of the film. Something for mopey teen girls to relate to, I have to assume.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you would be better off saving your money. Instead, spend it on a cat. Put the cat in a box and shake it as hard and you can. Then, insert your head into the box. Trust me, it will be far less painful than watching this movie."
"Rizar","Null","5","6","3 November 2010"," The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009, PG 13)
","Something about ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" drains you of life, but it's difficult to pinpoint the precise source. It isn't lack of sex appeal. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) spends many of his lengthy chatty scenes shirtless, sporting a buff and chiseled physique. The other werewolves don't bother with shirts because sometimes they transform spontaneously out of anger and aren't rich enough to keep buying new shirts. It isn't lack of action either. If you've seen any of the trailers this doesn't give anything away, but (spoiler) Jacob and his Quileute clan members frequently transform into werewolves to chase vampires and occasionally rip them apart. Edward (Robert Pattinson), the cold and undead vampire who thirsts with love for Bella, also battles a pair of vampire enforcers for the Volturi (an elite gang of ultra powerful vampires) in a lengthy fight scene.<br/><br/>Even so, it lacks the sentiment or playfulness of Stephenie Meyer's novel (of the same name). It makes the same mistake as ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" by standing still in awkward moments and lacking depth in talky scenes. In the first movie, you learn that Bella (Kristen Stewart) feels more comfortable in the undead vampire world and feels out of place in a normal human life. Instead of deepening the triangle with dark talk like this, the films mostly leave it out, focusing instead on the choice between Team Jacob and Team Edward.<br/><br/>""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" continues where the first movie left off with Bella and Edward in an uneasy love. Edward mastered his thirst for Bella's blood to the extent that he may safely remain in her presence (as long as they practice abstinence and as long as he breaks away before any of their romantic encounters get too extreme). But Jasper, one of the newer vampires close to Edward, attacks Bella at her birthday party after she gets a paper cut. The accident makes Edward rethink his relationship with Bella. He decides to move away from town to give her a chance at a normal life. Edward makes lesser appearances in the movie when Bella hallucinates in moments of an adrenaline rush. This transforms her into a motorcycle riding and cliff jumping daredevil.<br/><br/>The story is sound in theory, but the way it's translated to film loses all the internal struggle Bella experiences. After Edward tells her he's leaving, you don't see her experience depression much; instead, she screams at nightmares and she sits in front of a window in a daze for months, remaining the same as the camera moves around her and the seasons change before her eyes. Her desperate run through the woods is difficult to understand. It's mostly off camera and she doesn't seem as panicked as the plot and dialog tells us.<br/><br/>The point of all this detail is that the rest of the story falls like dominoes. The lack of exploring Bella's inner world and emotional turmoil (on camera) dampens all the events that depend on her initial state of mind. The result is to further remove Edward from any significant part of the story. (Edward is actually a huge part of it. He causes her depression by leaving without explaining his reasons, making her question whether he cares for her if he could leave so easily.) So the reunion scenes between her and Edward at the end have very little build up and almost no psychological depth. They come out of nowhere and arrive mainly through dialog and last minute love scenes. Mostly Team Jacob gets a chance to make the case for human warmth without the other side of the triangle for competition.<br/><br/>Why does she need a friend like Jacob so much? Unless you pay careful attention to Bella's voice-over, the most noticeable reasons are because he's ""sort of beautiful"" and he makes girls in a theater scream and giggle. For the most part, the Jacob and Bella scenes seem awkward and sleepy. Particularly troubling is the uneventful exchanges between Bella and Jacob as they repair her motorcycle. The whole sequence demands more coverage, more depth, and more playfulness. For example, it lazily summarizes the gag over Jacob's lesser age (he's only 16). How do we know Jacob is warm and friendly? Take Bella's word for it; she says it, so it must be so.<br/><br/>In the most awkward of their scenes, Jacob stands frozen in rain, looking like he's not quite sure what to do. He looks like he wants to give Bella every chance to stay and talk when he's supposed to be telling her to go away. It seems like the director is afraid that if Mr. Lautner moves, or otherwise behaves like a person saying the words he's saying, the filmmakers might have to worry about the logistics of moving the water truck (that was dispensing the rain) to cover the actors with realistic movement.<br/><br/>For a movie obsessed with following the book, it sure kills all the best parts. It lacks any ""Godfather"" moments that immerse the viewer in the story; instead, the story zigzags through major events without exploring them in any depth or detail. Sometimes you get a sense that the filmmakers simply wanted more action in the story. For example, Edward's amazing fight sequence at the end (choke slams and all) would never happen with Jane (Dakota Fanning) standing in the room, as she is. She's a vampire that inflicts pain in others with her mind (sort of like using a cruciatus curse in Harry Potter), but she apparently forgets she has these powers and simply watches Edward fight against a couple of the other lesser Volturi. For fans, it will be a must own movie, but for others it may very well be a sleepy experience."

","Twilight 2: Electric Boogaloo. Now with more *sparkle*! This one was much more maudlin, thus made romantically worse by the inability of it's actors, especially the chick playing Babs, or Bella, or whatever. She's TURRIBUL. Again, I found myself most sympathetic to the dumb one, the teen-wolf, and the understated sheriff father. Actually the whole wolf pack, minus the again bad CG, is fun. A group of ""awe shucks"" vampire-killer native American brothers who like to beat each other up, they're a welcome change from the bitching bitches that are the Cullens. Their emotional and intellectual antithesis, it plays a little better than expected. I distractedly sat, though, and wondered the whole time why and how it was that after they had morphed back into boys, they still had on their shorts and shoes. Perhaps they have stashes of K-Swiss and Jams all over the Olympic Peninsula? Twilight isn't too big on filling in plot holes, like vampires on 9 hour flights to Italy and not losing their minds being cooped up in a juicy tube full of juicy humans who would just love to join the mile high club with Edward. Finally, the addition of the High Council of Lookintomyeyes might make the third and FINAL film interesting. A creepy little deadpan Dakota Fanning was disconcerting enough to make me want to see her again, while the lead mean girl of this council, played by a British man I didn't care to look up, was a 160 pound canned ham, complete with licking of lips, bridging of fingers, and googly amphetamine eyes like Andrew McCarthy: way over the top. We get it, you're a 500 year old vampire. Fun finish to their appearance was a group of gawking tourists who are led into their chamber as Babs and company rush away, and we are gifted with offstage screams of horror and dinner as the group is welcomed by the ancient and tawdry mob of vampires.<br/><br/>Does all this mean I actually liked it better than the first? No. The first was fun in it's shocking awfulness and horrible dialogue. What you get here is much more of Bella stumbling about in a depressed state of under-eye makeup. I did find I yelled at the screen a bit less in this one, but yelled at the thing extra loudly at the end.<br/><br/>I will look forward to more yelling at these douchebags for one final installment, by rental of course."

","Ever since Stephanie Meyer's popular series of novels, the Twilight Saga was commission be made into films two communities have emerged on the internet: Twihards who love the books and films and will not accept any criticism and Twihaters who will shout from the rooftops how much they hate it and go and see the films just so they can rid them apart. I am in neither camp and I am neutral to the Twilight films, accepting them for their own merits. I have not read the books, so I can only judges the films by themselves.<br/><br/>Bella Swan (Kirsten Stewart) has just turned 18 and reluctantly celebrates her birthday with her vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and his family when they throw a surprise party for her. But when she is nearly attacked by Jasper (Jackson Rathbone), Edward ends the relationship for Bella safety and the family move from Forks, Washington. With Bella being heartbroken she becomes socially isolated from her friends and becomes a danger junkie, hoping Edward would save her. She falls for her old friend Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) who helps her overcome her depression: but he has his own dark secret, with Sam (Chaske Spencer) putting pressure on Jacob to join his gang/cult.<br/><br/>I will say that New Moon is a weak film, but there are some positives. I am personally critically of Chris Weitz as a director because I believe he is one of the main reasons why The Golden Compass was a hatchet job of Northern Lights: but he does a better job with New Moon. With New Moon he does a better job. With editor Peter Lambert, Weitz was able to shot with effective shots pacing time, like when the camera goes around Bella when she staring out the windows and the months roll by and when Bella and Jacob rebuild the motorbike. Weitz is also a more confidence action director then Catherine Hardwicke was with Twilight: it was obvious that more money was spent on the CGI and there were some decent fight scenes like when Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre) fights a werewolf with a Muse song in the background and Edward fighting the Volturi. There is also an effective and stylist CGI for creating a misty ghost of Edward which only Bella can see: I particular like how he disappears. Plus there is a fitting soundtrack and Weitz makes a wise call to use indie music.<br/><br/>But there is a plenty of weaknesses in the film. The pacing is very slow, with not much happening, leading to a boring experience. There is a feeling that of just get on with it, shorten and cut scenes: the film need to be more action packed, particularly to widen the fan base. The film focuses on the dullest character in the series and it would have been more interesting if we got to see it from Edward or Jacob's perspective with all the personal issues they would have to go thought as monsters. The acting is bad, Stewart is good when she is suffering night terrors, but otherwise her acting was very wooden. It's the same for Lautner, which I doubt his abilities as an actor: I will be surprised if he does become a star outside the Twilight series. Many of the small actors like the other members of the werewolf tribe were terrible actors and I'm sure they were cast because they were cheap and can be passed off as Native Americans. Ashley Greene starts of strong but later on her performance is just average. Even Michael Sheen hams it up in the film and that Dakota Fanning doesn't have much to do. Pattinson is better and I believe he has a better chance of becoming a star. But the best performer overall was Anne Kendrick as one of Bella's human friends and her role was minor. There is also some weak dialogue, like when Edward said 'Bella, you give me everything by just breathing.' Who speaks like that? There are interesting ideas in the Twilight series and I do like how ideas of the myths are twisted. I like that the vampires are having to fight their blood lust, and want to be good that there is a ancient order of royal vampires that powerful and govern the vampire race and that the werewolves are part of a Native American tribe and change by choice and anger rather then by the moon and become a creature with no memory of his/her old self. I would have like to have seen more of these ideas and been developed in the film. I also thought the film should have shown more of the fact there is a murderer targeting hikers in the woods and how the police would have investigated it. It could have helped give the film a more male audience and keep the female audience.<br/><br/>As I said I speak as someone who is neutral towards the Twilight series."
"Bobby747","4","5","6","28 July 2010"," Slightly better than the first, but a far cry from being any good
","The reason it took me so long to review this film is because I wanted to wait for it to show on the movie network, as my interest in it was next to none. I got bored today and watched this movie and they basically took all of the redeeming qualities of the first film and removed it.<br/><br/>The most interesting part of the story was the relationship between Jacob and Bella, however it began to get tiresome after Jacobs third attempt to reach out to Bella, and then it just wouldn't stop. Edward and Bella's relationship is totally annoying to me, as there is no apparent passion between the two when they're interacting with each other. Close talking with convenient lighting does not convey passion.<br/><br/>I tried watching this with the notion that this is a children's movie, and I guess its good enough for kids if they decide to like it. However the subject matter leads to a rhetoric that is heavily politicized. I do not wish to discuss that here.<br/><br/>I understand that fans of the Twilight novels wanted this film to do what the previous one could not. Which is to do the novel justice. The script writing was not thoughtful enough to even come close to representing even a poorly written novel. The dialogue was that of an after school teen TV series. You can tell that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson tried a bit harder to convey emotion. However Pattinson is too caught up in the image he wishes to portray as a vampire instead of becoming his character for the film, and Stewart is likely in a quandary. The acting was so bad in the first one, but there is a huge fan base for Twilight. How does she make the character better without straying too far from what was done in the first film? That being said, Bella's character was ruined before they even started filming New Moon. Unless they rebooted the series, there was no saving this film.<br/><br/>What bothers me is that I know these actors can do much better. I've seen Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart do some good work in the past, and it seems they've both let the Twilight attention get to their heads. Their acting is pretentious and dull in New Moon. I hate seeing scenes with them together because I'm numb with boredom every time they are.<br/><br/>This movie was slightly better than the first as a MOVIE, not as a representation of the novel. I have no comment about the novels because I have never read them, nor do I intend to. Vegetarian vampires, and the struggle of two people who want desperately to be together is not really my thing and quite frankly it's the oldest story ever, are not really my thing. How about every religious person and their desire to be with a God who may or may not exist? That's how old this story is."
"jonathanruano","3","5","6","28 July 2010"," Thumbs down for New Moon
","Kristen Stewart once called herself as a ""professional liar"" when referring to her performances in movies, like Twilight. The problem with ""New Moon"" is that the performances of Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattison, Taylor Lautner, Anna Kendrick and others are so obviously a lie that it is nearly impossible to believe in any of them. In this respect, New Moon is a very inferior film to the first Twilight which, for all its flaws, at least had believable characters and a believable love story. The main reason for this major flaw in New Moon is that the script lacks compelling dialogue. Most of the dialogue, especially in the beginning, is absurd; and the actors know that their dialogue is absurd because they give the consistent impression that they do not believe in what they are saying. So the result is a superficial vampire movie. <br/><br/>But the problem with ""New Moon"" goes even deeper than that. The plot is not really interesting. For most of the film, Bella is meant to be depressed after her break up with Edward Cullen that is never properly explained. But Bella never succeeds in establishing a connection with the audience - not least because the Kristen Stewart voice-over sounds so fake - and therefore watching her depressed is a boring experience, instead of a touching one. There is a somewhat interesting part of the film with the wolves, which in my view really do upstage the actors. But the part with the volturi, who are meant to enforce a rather rigid set of vampire laws, was done completely wrong. If the film-makers were smart, they would have done something unique and original with the set, like create a whole new vampire world hidden from human civilization with its own unique look (why do vampire buildings have to look like human buildings, for instance?), culture and way of life. Instead human beings can see the volturi simply by walking into an elevator, clicking the basement floor - how unoriginal (what happened to secret passages) - and then walking into a throne room that looks like a baroque cathedral from a tourist guide. The volturi themselves, moreover, are not that scary, even when they do come close to killing Edward Cullen (I really stopped caring by that point, because I wanted an early end to this film). Martin Sheen is miscast as the head volturi, because he lacks the stature and command to make that role work. Sheen was much better in ""Frost/Nixon"" because in that film he was supposed to be a mousy interviewer who seemed way over his head financing and carrying out the interview of President Nixon. Perhaps Frank Langhella would have made a better volturi or Eva Green. But Sheen is all wrong for the part. The same is true for the other actors attempting to look scary as volturis. The female volturi, for instance, looks like one of those part geeky, artsy theatre chicks one meets while attending the fringe festival. Of course, the script does not give the volturis much to do or anything interesting to say. So these actors are also hamstrung from the start. <br/><br/>Overall a disappointing film. Thumbs down. The other sad thing about this film is that Graham Greene, who was so brilliant in ""Thunderheart"" and ""Dances with Wolves,"" is in this film, but the film-makers only gave him a bit part instead of utilizing his considerable talents in full. What a sad day when a great actor's potential is not exploited to make a bad film, like this one, somewhat better."

","The first movie was great - hence all the buzz about New Moon. Then why did they change so much? 1) The makeup on the Cullens was awful. They were much more pale, ashy, and dramatically different from Twilight. It was distracting, not to mention made Edward much less gorgeous, which we all know is 1/2 the reason why most 15-30 year old girls went to see the movie (which I think is most of the viewing audience, right?). 2) The costume choices were bad for Alice. Really really bad. 3) There was obviously too much coaching going on for the actors - they did great in the first movie. Don't overcoach them. Especially Alice and Jasper. And Rosalie. It made for some less-than-professional scenes. The worst: Bella and Alice in Bella's house with Jacob. Oh, it broke my heart to ruin the movie like that. And that bad taste carried through to the end of the movie. I hope Eclipse will rectify these problems and re-set to the original plan (which worked)."

She does everything to live recklessly and this leads her to her old friend Jacob. Jacob is a hands on type of boy and he helps her fix up some old junk motorcycles. He falls in love with her, and she even begins to fall for him in a needy desperate sort of way. He admits to her that he is a werewolf and he hates the Cullens. When one of the Cullens show up to tell her that Edward isn't doing so well they both flee to find him. They kiss and make up and he comes back to the states with her. He and Jacob become enemies and Bella tells Jacob bluntly that she loves Edward. She goes back to wanting to be turned and it was even promised to the high priests of the vampire clan that she would be, but so far nope...where will part three and four take us? What a let down. I wanted so many things to happen here but they didn't happen. The only good thing about this was the love between Bella and Edward and this stupid movie takes that away from it.

Production values were bad in this film. What was with the old wise high priest vampires? They were so corny and cheesy and then Dakota Fanning was just horrible and useless here. I hated the whole side story aspect. The wolves and how they were all just cocky teenage boys. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) really got in shape here and cut his long ugly hair which made him a good sex symbol to keep the girls attracted to this movie, but Edward is who she loves and thats where they should have stayed, but I get it, the wolves and Cullens need to be enemies. Edward looks so much worse in this movie, his eyebrows are bushy, his teeth are less clean, he looks older and just not as good, which is great because he's suppose to have that tired look. Jacob has the ugliest nose of any human being I have ever seen, just had to point that out. The mention of marriage is nice way to end it.<br/><br/>All and all, its a let down. It is boring and badly directed. I didn't care about the characters, it brought nothing new to the table and took away anything beautiful the first film gave us..

"Matt_Layden","3","5","6","8 April 2010"," I Can't Believe I'm Saying This...Twilight Was Better
","Bella hurts her arm, Edward's brother wants to kill her, he flips out and leaves her. Enter Jacob, a werewolf, he loves Bella, she doesn't love him, teenage drama.<br/><br/>This is New Moon in two sentences, I could have done one, but I thought it would try to expand it a little more. The film though, it easily have been done in 90 minutes or less. Why do I watch this stuff? So I can say that I've seen them and make fun of them. To make fun of it without seeing it would be too harsh. But in all honesty, I do give all films an equal chance. After the horrendous film that was Twilight, I knew I would watch the rest of these films because surprise, the actual story of vampires and werewolves is interesting. I wanted to know how everything was going to end, I wanted to know why everyone was in love with these character. After two films, I'm still wondering.<br/><br/>New Moon is basically a film with no antagonist and no purpose. It's a filler film, set-up, for what I think and hope will be a better conclusion of the events of the first film. As I said in my brilliant explanation of the film. Bella is turning 18 and in celebration she goes to the Cullen's house. Apparently she prefers the company of dead people than her own father. She cuts herself and it sends one of the forgettable Cullen family members into a tizzy. He wants to kill Bella, Edward stops him and then he decides to leave in order to protect her. Make sense? While he is gone, she flips her nuts. She can't sleep without screaming like a teenage girl would do if someone was stabbing them numerous times. She apparently has no reason to live. Great message to give young girls who are in love with this stuff. If your boyfriend leaves, you're better off dead. Bella has no career aspirations, no motive to be with friends, spend time with family or enjoy life. She simply wants to die to be with Edward. Again, great message for the young ones.<br/><br/>Enter Jacob, the second teen heartthrob and rival to Robert Pattinson for the teen love. He is buff and filled out, as Bella says a dozen times. He walks around with no shirt on so that the girls in the audience can scream and cheer. He does this so either A: He doesn't have to buy no shirts every time or B: Girls are horny. He is in love with Bella, she is using him to get over Edward. The film is all about her wanting Edward but not being able to be with him and Jacob wanting Bella and not being able to be with her. The drama is boring, useless and makes for a boring romance film. <br/><br/>The film looks and feels better. The special effects are not as bad, the make up looks half decent now and the films have a bigger budget. Unfortunately it has the same actors doing the same stuff, and the same source material that was not good to begin with. The so called vampires still sparkle and have weird powers and the werewolves, who are actually shape shifters look horribly bad. Me saying that the special effects are not as bad really says a lot about how they sucked in the first film.<br/><br/>New Moon will please that rabid fan base that wants nothing more than to simply see the books up on screen, no matter how good or bad it is. Kristen Stewart will still bite her lip and brush her hands through her hair. Robert Pattinson will still have awkward kissing scenes with Stewart and have zero chemistry and Taylor Lautner will walk around with no shirt on. This is the Twilight Saga and nothing more. <br/><br/>Looking forward to Eclipse."
"doctorsmoothlove","6","5","6","14 March 2010"," Twilight Saga: Bad Movie Night
","Twilight took off with its modest budget of 20 million to make over ten times that amount in 2008. That's a hell of a return on an investment. I'll admit that even I was surprised by its total gross. We got the sequel New Moon exactly one year later. The movie is at least better than its overly-bland predecessor, yet manages to look even cheaper. When someone transforms into a werewolf, among other instances, we never get the impression that the character is actually on screen. It's like watching a stop-motion project rendered with Nintendo 64-era visuals.<br/><br/>New Moon is the sequel Stephanie Meyer never anticipated writing. The whole film plays out like it was thrown together at the last minute. Twilight ended on a high note. Edward and Bella are finally together and Bella's assailant is dead. Now, for almost no reason at all Edward sudden decides to leave Bella and his family disappears. This is strange since at the end of last film he was nearly killed trying to protect her. Meyer uses this stall tactic to rip off Ann Rice and insert a needless and delightfully cheesy interlude of Bella pining away over her lost love. Kristen Steward sits rigidly in a chair and we are shown a montage of the months changing as the camera swirls around her.<br/><br/>Try to remember the American Indian guy from the last movie (Jacob, the teen werewolf). Since he is the only slightly masculine teen guy in her life, she spends time with him. They build dirt bikes and Bella continues to whine about Edward. When she attempts to ride her bike, an apparition of Edward appears and discourages her. Let's ignore Jacob for now, like the screenplay does. Bella begins to do stupid and anti-feminist stunts to see Edward like jumping off cliffs into the ocean. I don't think this behavior is actually supposed to be sexist as teens really will do crazy stuff for love. It's actually kind of funny, especially since Edward hears about her cliff-diving and decides to kill himself since he thinks she has died.<br/><br/>He doesn't actually get to, as the vampire elder council Volturi, which consists of European actors who aren't Anthony Banderas (key in an awesome Dakota Fanning cameo) won't permit him. He decides to reveal himself to humanity, which is a death sentence. Bella arrives out of nowhere to save him and is brought before the Volturi. Bella is spared, but only if she will be converted to the vampire ilk. Edward agrees on terms that she will marry him. Jacob is dismayed.<br/><br/>There is no authentic emotional display in New Moon. The story is only loosely connected to its previous installment and is therefore forced to rely on its actors to move it with their spatial talent and facial expressions. And none of them can do it. The movie was a chore to act and direct and will be a bore for most viewers. Meyer did not conceive Twilight as a series so I guess this was the writer's block novel. The next ones have to be better than this one. It really is that bad.<br/><br/>Still, I found myself enjoying the bargain theater screening I attended. This is one of those hilariously bad movies that is so inept it produces unintended chuckles. The Nostalgia Chick will tear this one up in 2020. Its failure is based on the fundamentally flawed premise that Bella Swan would be desirable to not one, but two supernatural hotties. The girl is incredibly ordinary and doesn't display aptitude for anything except being ditzy. She is portrayed by Kristen Stewart who has not yet showed me she is capable of delivering lines at any real emotional level (making her a great choice for Bella). Every line she says is curt and empty. The movie needed her to either be very attractive or gifted otherwise for it to work.<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, the whole screenplay is peppered with what I think are nods the overall shoddiness. Consider the interplay between two of Edward's vampire relatives when Bella turns 18 at the beginning, ""what's it like dating an older woman?"" And, and, when actors have the good sense to shut up, we are usually treated to a Clip Art battle sequence featuring a werewolf and something else. Maybe Chris Weitz should stay away from teen novel adaptations featuring speaking, fighting quadrupeds."
"gpunkts","3","5","6","10 March 2010"," Sorry, but not good enough
","You do not have to be in the target audience of a film to be able to evaluate it. And this film - sorry, but is just not good enough.<br/><br/>At first I thought that the acting was very bad, but then I realised: you cannot really expect much of an actor to do, if the plot is full of shallow clichés. But what is more important - the general direction of the plot just does not cut it (and I guess that is more a problem of the book). Are we really expected to be passionate about heroes that are making unnatural choices? The film did not provide a problem/paradox that I would be dying to find out how the heroes cope with, and sorry - you cannot have a story without that. It is not enough just to have nice art and cinematography (which was actually very good, indeed). The film did not have any tempo to it(though, that is an often thing for an adaptation of a famous book, where you need to include a lot of details that do not benefit the film).<br/><br/>I have to admit that I was not a huge fan of Twilight 1, which I saw just as an average film, but after seeing the terrible reviews of New Moon I thought: ""It cannot be that bad!"" Well, that is exactly what it is. Sure, the fans of the book will see it, and some will also enjoy it even, perhaps. But if you are not a fan - do not watch it, as then it is just a waste of time."

The dialog seemed forced an unnatural an Bella seemed like she needed a bath through the whole movie, she was very unwashed an greasy looking. I do have to say Jacob was very cute an his scenes were very good he seemed natural. This movie was definitely made for preteen girls the theater was full of them.

One of the best movies of the years for the people who like this kind of movie. I could watch it over and over again.<br/><br/>Why go to see the movie is you hate the books, or the idea of the Saga? People who hate The Twilight Saga just because of what it is go see it, then go home, get on their computers and start telling everyone how bad it is.<br/><br/>This is not right. What these people are doing is the same as when a person who hates football goes and sees a movie about football and then goes home and starts complain about how bad it is.<br/><br/>And I am hating how people are saying the wolves are just eye-candy. Hello, have you ever gone to see an action movie made for men and some of the characters happen to be beautiful and sexy female fighters? (And fight each other while wearing tight clothing?) It's the same thing as in New Moon. All the men who are complaining about New Moon, go see the genre of films that are made for you.<br/><br/>Because this one is made for women. Some guys might like it, like how some girls might like movies made for men and so on. But this movie is made for fans not haters.<br/><br/>And for the people who are saying the Vampires are not Realistic, VAMPIRES ARE FICTIONAL CHARTERS! They can be any way the writer want them to be. The Twilight vampires are no different than other vampires as they both come from peoples imagination.<br/><br/>Anyway onto my review: I loved New Noon, I found it much better than Twilight and a whole lot easier to watch. The actors and actresses did a great job and the special effects were wonderful. It is a great mix of humor, drama, romance, hot actors and actresses and action. I liked the screenplay, it was quirk and quirky.<br/><br/>I'm fifteen, but I went with a whole bunch of people ranging between the age of nine and fifty. (Male and female.)

","I have no idea why people are saying that it's awful, terrible an abomination, all I can think of is that, maybe, they went into the wrong theater. I honestly thought it was great, the first one sucked, mostly because of the directing, New Moon, not so much. first off the directing was better, and that right there makes a huge improvement, also the acting has improved from the first one. The acting in Twilight was OK, not bad, just OK, no one particularly wowed me, but New Moon, wow. I have a lot of respect for Kristen Stewart and I think she's a great actress, but didn't love her performance in Twilight. New Moon is a whole different story, she was so much better. She had to go to a very deep place for some scenes and that shows talent. Also, the other actors have improved, mainly Rob Pattinson, who wasn't the perfect Edward in the first one, he was much better in New Moon. The resemblance to the book also wowed me, Twilight left out a lot of scenes and did that crazy mix and mash thing, taking conversations that were supposed to be and putting them there. New Moon, however, so closely resembled the book and made me feel like I was reading the book, the whole time. I loved how thy showed Alices visions and Bella as vampire (that was a strange scene, though, I'll admit, running through the woods, Edward in a vest and Bella in a fairytale dress) and I liked how they showed Edward after he talked to Jacob on the phone, it showed how much he adores Bella. Another thing I loved was the way they showed the passing of time, Bella sitting in her room with the seasons changing around her and I loved how she kept emailing Alice through out the movie. The Volturi scene was great, Aro was pretty creepy. The main thing that I disliked about the movie was the very end, ""Marry me, Bella"" camera looks at Bella, Directed by: Chris Weitz.... Overall it was a great movie and totally worth the wait. I absolutely can't wait for Eclipse, as it's my favorite book and we get to see Edward and Jacob together, fighting over Bella. All I can say is, I'm so glad they're not waiting a whole year before Eclipse, lie we had to for New Moon, only 6 months! LOL 10/10 (I'd say that's a pretty good rating)"

"Da_Anders","2","8","11","21 October 2010"," New Moon – because the first movie wasn't awful enough
","If you like boring melodrama with wooden acting and unlikeable characters, then New Moon is something for you! Okay, to be honest I haven't read the books (and frankly, probably never will), so I will try to judge the movie on it's own merits.<br/><br/>The first movie Twilight was an underwhelming experience, and I didn't expect anything else from this release either. The biggest problem, I think, with these movies are the main characters and their strange motivations and overall behaviour. Edward behaves like a creepy stalker that not many girls would find very attractive in the real world (at least if they got to know him a bit first). But of course, he IS more than one hundred years old, and if you had to keep re-doing the high school years all the time you'll be a bit crazy and strange too! I have heard from my sister (who have read the books) that Edward, due to being so darn old, is an educated doctor and all kinds of other stuff and that the vampire family can stay longer at the same place if the ""kids"" start in high school. Is that explained in the movie? I don't think so! Maybe I dozed of during that part... The point I'm trying to make is that the movie takes it more or less for granted that the audience know stuff like that (but here I think the first movie is more guilty of this). Sometimes it's really hard to know what's going on, so I just make up my own back story as the movie goes along!<br/><br/>I cringed every time one of the werewolf guys appeared without a shirt on. Christ, that is simply awful. It's a silly, lazy and obvious way to tell the audience (without brains) that WOLF PEOPLE is SEXY and STRONG. The ""drama"" between Bella and Edward and MR WOLF is not very engaging, but that is probably because the characters are so two-dimensional. To be honest, the story is not very original and one can probably guess what's going to happen at the end of the movie anyhow. In the final 20 minutes or so, our friends end up in Italy to confront some old-fashioned vampires who are supposed to be the ""eviiil"" dudes. I thought they all looked like retarded members from some goth band playing in their drummers grandmas' garage. The leader of the vampires looks like a rabbit with a wig. Very intimidating.<br/><br/>Some almost good parts, then: although the ""werewolves"" looked more like beefed-up mutant dogs, I kind of liked them, mainly because there's a bit of action going on when they appear. The CG effects are not spectacular, but okay. The musical score fit in quite good, so nothing to really complain about here. Some of the songs were terrible, though.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is sappy and boring and with one of the worst dialouge lines to end a movie ever. Don't watch it unless you want a hemorrhage in the part of your brain where the logical thinking resides."

But It is impossible. It is obvious why any girl would love this. I mean come on, guys? I mean If you are guy and you love this, It's a sign that you should come out of the closet now, If you already haven't.<br/><br/>One thing I like is the music. It gives this kind of a serene Indees feel that I kind of like. (Indee as in Independent movies). And Kristen, she does seem pretty okay to me when not with any one of her boyfriends, both Cullen and that other wolf boy. Actually she seems to have more balls than both of those pansies combined. <br/><br/>And a note on Face punch?!? Seriously this writer only knows about romance and that's it. It is so lame how she tries to make action movies seem stupid. Well the jokes on her! As for the little action sequences and FX present in the movie,(compared to the previous one, very little) I guess it's pretty all right to me. Actually more than all right. Ironic, considering the writers disposition towards action movies. <br/><br/>Haven't had any high hopes with this. But seriously much more worse than the previous installment. They say the next one is kind of good. I'll be the judge of that in the future."

","The entire series is the biggest joke in the history of film making. It is a Hollywood disaster made famous by fanatical teens that clearly support the further abomination of society. The production value of New Moon is better than the original Twilight, but the two dimensional acting and dull storyline is comical at best. The only true validation with regards to this movie is any formal spoof made on it's behalf. But take this into consideration:<br/><br/>There is a line said by soon to be gone actor Taylor Lautner in about the third quarter of the film where he raises his voice to Ashley Greene's character and says ""...or I could get very angry."" I thought this was a joke. Did they not do multiple takes of this scene? This is the best they could come up with?<br/><br/>Not to mention, they have completely ruined all vampire allegory and novel adaptation for a solid decade if not an entire generation. A sparkly vampire that runs fast? This is so irrelevant and incoherent."

","I think this movie needed to be directed and edited by a woman because at no point could I sink into the emotions between characters. Woman love emotional stuff. But this just gave a dry account of the events, instead of developing believable characters.<br/><br/>Not sure how the characters were portrayed in the books, but in this movie Bella and Edward were really annoying - I found myself rolling my eyes and making fun during many scenes. I found their relationship really depressing and unempowering. Instead of showing deep love, it just seemed like an unhealthy co-dependent relationship.<br/><br/>The movie had nice filming and imagery (cool red cloaks in Italy). And I loved all the werewolf men - needed more werewolf scenes.<br/><br/>So for the next film - slow it down. Think of what young women like: they like romantic words and feelings between characters so they can swoon and talk about with their friends. Women value the subtleties of characters, not a sports-desk rundown of a sequence of events."

Second, she's more masculine than he- the sparkly, fangless vampire- is. Third, every single word that comes out of his mouth is corny and sounds like it's supposed to have substance, but isn't really.

","In some quirky way, I can actually empathize with a vampire romance series. I suppose there are people out there who would find a love triangle with a vampire and a werewolf respectively, intriguing if not downright tantalizing. And I also suppose that if I had the inclination to read the Stephenie Meyer novel that forms the basis of the series, or had watched the first part, some of the movie may have actually made more sense to me. The fact of the matter is that none of these aforementioned wonderful things came to pass. So here I was, watching The Twilight Saga: New Moon wondering what's going on. Which viewer in his right senses would be moved by the mediocre acting, the uninspired dialogue, and the downright horrific graphics. Was left wondering how the disjointed pieces that came together in the movie fit together. Wondered whether someone actually expected that the revelation of Jakob Black (Taylor Lautner) as a werewolf was actually a matter of suspense. In the end, I could not recall a single thing that I actually liked about the movie.

"user-37636","3","8","11","7 December 2009"," The Twilight Saga: New Moon. For fans only.
","I haven't read the books, but I found the first Twilight movie quite 'watchable' and I actually liked it, so I decided I couldn't miss the second one. Regarding that the theater had been crowded everyday since the movie came out and that the first movie had been a success (more profit, a better budget on the next movie), I was expecting to watch quite a cinematographic production.<br/><br/>But oh, boy... what a deception. For someone who didn't read the books, this movie sure had confusing situations. For instance, when Mike is in the toilet while Bella and Jacob are chatting, Jacob is having a sweet predictable 'i love you' talk with Bella. Out of nowhere, when Mike comes out of the toilet, Jacob wants to beat him up with no reason at all, then in a sudden, he doesn't want to see Bella anymore(this was explained later in the movie though, but the situation was quite out of context). Or when Edward is in Brazil, then Alice and Bella go meet him up and suddenly show up somewhere, which we thought was Brazil, but it was actually Italy, because Edward was suddenly in Italy, too.<br/><br/>The script was super poor. Loaded with expressions like 'Without you, I can't exist', 'I'll never hurt you' (this was said I don't know how many times), 'I love you' and all those simple and easy phrases we already know. All the cliché.<br/><br/>The vampires, for some unexplainable reason, had glowing eyes 24/7. On the first movie, this only happened when their vampire instincts were active, which only happened in certain situations. And they also over-exaggerated the make-up.<br/><br/>When Bella hit her head on the rock, the blood was a layer of dried fake blood glue on the side her forehead. Then Jacob's intentions were good, but the scene was clearly intended to show off his muscles to the young melting girls at the theater.<br/><br/>Some other shots were ridiculous, like when Emily is left alone in the kitchen surrounded by five sexy shirtless dark-skinned muscular young boys, or that Edward's first appearance in Alice's vision, happily running through a shiny beautiful flowery fairy tale yard. This last scene made the audience crack up.<br/><br/>The acting is also overall poor (especially Robert Pattison, sounds like he's reading the script as he acts), though I wish I had seen more from Dakota Fenning. The characters are poor as well (but I won't judge this, since I don't know them from the book), Bella and Emily two ladies physically victims of their beloved boys' violence (that's also from the book, I suppose).<br/><br/>The movie has a big lack of action, it is slow, boring, filled with cheap endless talking. I did really like some artistic shots of it, though. I think the movie would have worked quite better if the producers had taken advantage of the previous movie's profit for a higher budget on this production, focusing more on the picture, action and special effects.<br/><br/>Basically, I think this movie is dedicated to the young fans of Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattison and the fans of the Twilight Saga books in general. Now, if you ain't into the books, or haven't read them yet, this one ain't for you. And boys, KEEP OUT."

After analyzing her life her life we see no hobbies, no sports, no particular influence of either parent because Renee is away and Charlie doesn't *hover* around, no academic pursuits (I mean she has got it at Dartmouth and she is not interested, how realistic is that but oh! we can't talk about realistic when it comes to this Vampire-werewolf series), no human-friends (A question for Meyer:Is that to show she is different from other girls?),no interest in fame and wealth( She doesn't even want to celebrate her birthday, how *noble*)--she couldn't be more imperfect...right? And with no charm and persona she has got the supposedly most gorgeous guy ever- Who cannot be more perfect! What message is going across for all the teenage girls out there-""DO NOTHING!"" How immature can a storyline get! Coming to the actors playing it, Kristen Stewart has no charm at all; she fails to bring any life to her character. She looks as if she'll fall unconscious any moment in the WHOLE movie. And can't she smile? It would be good if she stretched her muscles for a while when she sees her *love-of-existence* coming!<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson has got along well and he is the sole reason of people watching this bogus movie.Taylor Laurent has also coped with it but he is no where near Jacob Black - there is a 2 feet difference!!!

At least pick an ugly chick who has some acting skills. I'm a big fan of vampire movies in general, but this was a very long movie with horrible acting, very little action and weak drama.

","Twilight I have now seen 10 times at the movies, and was very much looking forward to New Moon, but ended up very disappointed. The disappointment started right from the the very start with the Summit logo, and then the very slow New Moon words. I hated and could not get over what they did to the Cullens eyes, found it hard to concentrate on anything else, so had to try very hard to ignore it. The biggest disappointments was the lack of emotion between Edward and Bella, and the fact that any scene with Edward (and his family) was rushed and cut so short! No arriving back in America and being greeted by his family, or billy having his say when they got home! I so wish they had waited for Catherine to make this, I believe putting a man in charge of such an emotional movie was wrong (I see a different male has been put in charge of Eclipse). I am going to see New Moon again, and hope I can get into it more. Will buy the DVD when it comes out (but will wait for it to be on sale, whereas I brought Twilight the day it came out), and am hoping the eyes will be less noticeable on the small screen. Im glad to read that others enjoyed the movie a lot more than I. Thanks, Lee."
"DavidSim240183","3","13","20","3 December 2009"," Straight from the hearse's mouth
","When I saw Twilight last year, I hadn't read any of the books. When I saw New Moon last night, I'd read at least two of them. Since I don't fit into the teen, female demographic they're aimed at, I was unimpressed. Stephanie Meyer is the JK Rowling of vampire fiction - a bland, unremarkable writer who had one idea in her life that led to inexplicable success. One suspects she'll spend the rest of her career milking that success.<br/><br/>But when I watched Twilight, since I hadn't read any of them, it didn't come with any baggage attached. So, I was prepared to look at it with an unbiased eye. But I found Twilight overrated even before I picked up any of the books. It only seemed half a good film. It worked well enough when Bella was trying to crack the mystery that was Edward Cullen. But when it came to the vampire side of the story, it was tame and toothless. Something I blamed on the certificate (12A) originally, only to find that director Catherine Hardwicke was just being faithful to the book.<br/><br/>When the film became a global phenomenon, Hollywood rushed into production the rest of the series, hoping to start a new franchise along the lines of a Harry Potter or a Lord of the Rings. Having already endured the dull read that was New Moon, I walked into the cinema with the naive belief that the film would rise above it and turn in a far more enjoyable sequel. But one had a sinking feeling about New Moon when I discovered it was made by Chris Weitz.<br/><br/>Weitz had already ruined one great fantasy novel with The Golden Compass, an excellent book with a rich, fully realised culture all its own destroyed by someone with no feel or affinity for the text. After The Golden Compass bankrupted New Line Cinema, that should have made Weitz unemployable. Why Meyer (and Summit Entertainment) would trust him to lay a finger on New Moon is anyone's guess?<br/><br/>New Moon isn't quite the disaster The Golden Compass was, but it's still a disappointment. Weitz has stayed faithful to the book, but therein lies the problem. Like TGC, he recreates scenes on a page without the flavour to animate them. And because Stephanie Meyer has given him a dull story to tell its a dull film as well.<br/><br/>Where Edward and Bella's romance was the heart of Twilight, New Moon pulls us in many directions. After one of Edward's family almost puts the bite on Bella on her 18th birthday, the Cullen clan uproot and head for safer pastures. Bella falls into misery, but also falls into the company of a pack of werewolves. And when she gets attracted to they're dangerous lifestyle, it summons up visions of her beloved Edward, leading her to take more and more dangerous gambles with her life.<br/><br/>For all its faults, at least Twilight was about something. It was a tighter, more focused film held back by a weedy certificate and a prosaic author. The problem with New Moon is it tries to do many things that all add up to no purpose. Like we never find out what is causing Bella's visions of Edward. Whether its some magic ability on his part? Or has Bella's grief become hallucinatory?<br/><br/>The film brings back Victoria, the vamp from Twilight baying for Bella's blood. She wants to kill Bella to avenge the death of her lover. But the film introduces her, and then just forgets about her. That would have made a far more substantial story, and lent the film a dynamic it desperately lacks. To clutter things even further, we get a trip to Italy where we meet the Volturi, a rival tribe of vampires. It even drafts in great performers like Michael Sheen and a grown up Dakota Fanning and gives them criminally little to do.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I anticipated New Moon with some enthusiasm was because I knew it gave Kristen Stewart the chance to take centre stage. I've always been a great admirer of Stewart, ever since her tough, intelligent debut in Panic Room. Compared to glamour models that pass for actresses, Kristen Stewart actually has acting ability, as well as good looks. I was interested to see what she would do with Bella.<br/><br/>But again, Chris Weitz doesn't give his cast a chance to do anything. Stewart is saddled with a boring plot where it just requires her to mope after Edward for much of the running time. And her relationship with Taylor Lautner is woefully unconvincing. He's completely wooden and never fills the role of a werewolf with anything approaching conviction.<br/><br/>New Moon pushes the fantastical element more than the first film did. We get a few gimmicky special effects shots and some full blooded werewolf fights but I always knew they were CGI. Like TGC, Chris Weitz just doesn't have a flair for special effects, and can't direct them without drawing attention to how false they are.<br/><br/>New Moon is also annoyingly geared towards The Twilight Saga's bread and butter...a young, female audience. Most of the male leads swagger in slow motion, take off their shirts regularly and proudly show off their buffed bodies and sculpted abs. Even Robert Pattinson is guilty of this. Its a disgusting tactic purely designed to appeal to a slavish fanbase.<br/><br/>New Moon ends on a cliffhanger, but not one I'm dying to know the outcome of. If it had focused on one single aspect of its story instead of trying to juggle them all like a circus act, it might have made for a better film. Since each one gets a short shrift, it winds up being more a tangle of disconnected strands then a story we can care much about."
"zeroand09","1","13","20","3 December 2009"," Why do people eat this garbage up?
","I'll admit, when I saw the first Twilight film, I wasn't going to give it a fair shake. I was surprised that it wasn't awful, it at least at decent cinematography. I sat through mediocrity, much as I do with a majority of movies. It wasn't anything special. I went into New Moon the same way, I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>This was a horrible movie. The plot was inane drivel with souless acting all around. The only character I felt for was Jacob, as he was being friend zoned from the start. Bella is a selfish c*** who will do anything and use anyone to get back with her equally selfish ""vampire"" boyfriend. Jacob bends over backwards for this incredibly bland girl with nothing to offer and time after time is reminded that he won't be getting anything from her. When he leaves, she is distraught, but not because she truly loves him. No, it's because she doesn't have a b**** to take her mind off of Eddy. I would have given anything to have seen her die a horrific death. Even when Eddy and Bella get back together, Ed keeps conspiring to get rid of the person he ""loves"" the most, because he doesn't want the hassle. The funny thing is, he hasn't gotten anything from her either. The only reason he is attracted to her is because of her pungent smell. That alone should tell you this relationship is super f***ed up from the get go. I fail to understand why two guys are fighting over such a person.<br/><br/>So when I see the fan reaction and the records it is breaking...I just don't get. Do all girls eat up garbage like this? I can only assume the books are better, as is usually the case. Still, you have to call a bad movie when you see it. The only positive is that there's only two movies left. In two years, the craze will die and we can move onto the next irritating thing. It'll probably be the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Or Snorks."

","As a reader of the books, I was sorely disappointed with the movie. The first movie was nothing more than glorified fan-service, and I was truly hoping they would rectify that with New Moon...unfortunately, it's even worse. Between the unnecessarily copious amounts of half-naked teenagers running around who aren't attractive at all, and the poorly delivered script, I could hardly stand New Moon. The books that Meyer crafted were passable in that they told a story - a ridiculous and unrealistic story, but a story nonetheless. These series of movies so far are all about crazy hormone-driven ""teens"" who can't act worth a damn. Honestly, it's porn for adolescent and teen girls who are too cowardly and so far detached from reality to get a real boyfriend. Your time and money is far better spent elsewhere, and I regret bringing along my boyfriend when we could have done far more entertaining things that night."

","Overall, the movie was disappointing. Jacob/Bella story was well presented but some things could be left out. Up until the part when Alice returns the movie is OK. From that point on however it sucks. They omitted both trips to and from Italy which wasn't good because the audience does not have the time to built-up for the Edward/bella story that is coming. The Cullens weren't expecting them to return and thank bella for saving him and as a result we saw the cullens in 3 minutes in the film. Most importantly however they had no respect over the Voltera sequence. Edward and Bella had a conversation after she stopped him from being exposed that was in the last chapters of the book and it had no place happening there. And they cut the conversation of Edward and Bella in her room after she woke up when they cleared things up. The movie rushed to end but had no problem being slow during the Jacob storyline. The director missed the feeling, the audience was out of place and the movie was destroyed. The Bella/Edward/Jacob scene at the end was good however.

"Likes_Ninjas90","4","47","89","19 November 2009"," This pitiful sequel retains none of the qualities of the first film and could be one of the most disappointing pictures of the year
","The second film in the Twilight series begins with Bella Swan (Kirsten Stewart) having a dream about herself growing old. From her eighteenth birthday, this is the start of one of her fears that she will age, while her love Edward (Robert Pattinson) will stay the same and not be as attracted to her. At a gathering on her birthday, Bella cuts her finger accidentally and is nearly attacked by one of the Cullens, only to be saved by Edward, leaving a gash on her am. The thought that she could be harmed again and other reasons, leaves Edward to announce that he and his family are leaving and that he does not want Bella. Distressed, Bella finds comfort in her friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who offers to help her fix up a motorbike after she becomes an adrenaline junkie. Yet with the arrival of wolves in the area it is clear that Jacob is hiding something.<br/><br/>The first Twilight film was a solid entry into the franchise, a dark and highly atmospheric love story, handsomely crafted by director Catherine Hardwicke who carried a real interest in teen behaviour. This pitiful sequel retains none of the qualities of the first film and could be one of the most disappointing pictures of the year. Taking over from Hardwicke is director Chris Weitz who was previously made About a Boy and started the unfinished trilogy of The Golden Compass. The narrative in Weitz's film is primarily at fault here. Whereas the original Twilight was enjoyable for the way it compressed much of the tedium of the novel, this film is not only painfully slow but it is also uneventful and compressed to the point where it becomes nonsensical. It only takes just one brief ride on a motorcycle for Bella to turn into an adrenaline junkie and the exposition directed towards her reckless behaviour is minimal. Prior to performing anything daring like riding or cliff jumping Bella is met by apparition of Edward who warns her not to do it. It would make more sense if he came to her in near death performing the act, not before it.<br/><br/>Bella's motivations are as convoluted as Edwards though. His depart in particular is problematic for the narrative. Not only is his eventual explanation for leaving highly contrived but in his absence the romantic substance of the film is evaporated, leaving very little for Bella to do. Pattinson has the most minimal role, only appearing at the beginning and the end in person, and occasionally as an apparition. Although it may be true the novel, fans are still likely to be disappointed by the actors absence. Stewart is still a very beautiful young actress and although she looks tired in this film at times, she does her best with some very poor writing. It is to her credit at least that she is one of the better performers in the cast. The excessively soppy dialogue though is still is difficult to take and the allusions to Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" are particularly lazy and obvious.<br/><br/>The first film achieved a great sense of dread and uncertainty because of the mystery of the vampires and the stunning photography of the woodlands. Structurally, it was also punctured by an exciting final third and a highly visceral climax. New Moon is not only lacking in romance but the action is also scarce and dramatically flat. The few brawls in the film are almost all entirely in super slow-motion lessening their impact. The main threat in this film is supposed to be the werewolves and the secret that Jacob is hiding. Yet given everyone who wanted to see this film has probably watched the trailer at least twice there is no surprise as to what he is hiding. He is a thoroughly uninteresting character, devoid of any of the romantic sensibilities that were apparent in Twilight. What is most frustrating about his presence in the film is the blatant attempts at trying to create sexual tension with Bella by having him shirtless for almost the entire film. It is the sort of thing Matthew Mcconaughey might have made a career out of, but here it is not only repetitive but bordering on embarrassing, as it blatantly attempts to win the heart of female audience members. The scenes where Jacob wipes the blood off Bella's forehead with his shirt or stands outside her window half dressed, were met with laughter from the audience. Mostly likely this was unintentional, perhaps signaling that audiences are not fooled by the sheer phoniness of the sexual tension in this film. Where the first film was endearing and sweet in its romance, here it is just superfluous.<br/><br/>At 130 minutes, New Moon is longer than its predecessor but also inferior in almost every aspect. The romance is absent and the action is disappointingly flat. Why Hardwicke was not brought back as a director who created such a vivid and fresh atmosphere is incomprehensible. Weitz has done a pretty poor job with this film and rather unsurprisingly, he is being replaced by director David Slade (Hard Candy) for Eclipse next year. It is a shame that those who wish to see if the next instalment is an improvement will have to sit through what is an extremely tedious and dull experience."
"eline-hoskens","3","9","13","11 August 2013"," So bad it's actually funny!
","After I watched the first movie, which I thought was okay, I got interested in reading the books. So I headed to the book store and read the blurb on the back and it said something like: ""Bella is still torn apart in her choice between Edward and Jacob.""<br/><br/>So I thought: Okay, let's skip this one and have a look at the blurb of the next book, Eclipse, which said something like: ""Bella's mind is tortured by the still ongoing dilemma between Edward and Jacob.""<br/><br/>The Breaking Dawn blurb still mentioned some emotional attachment to Jacob even though she clearly had something going on with Edward, which is clear from the start. <br/><br/>So I decided I didn't want to read the books anymore and I patiently waited for the movie, hoping something else would happen besides love trouble and childish romance dilemma's. <br/><br/>As it turns out, it was only about the love obsession. You don't sympathise at all with the main character. She's somewhat of a selfish bitch, actually. ""I miss my boyfriend so I'm doing all this crazy risky stuff to see him! Don't expect me to be home for dinner! I mean it! I'm gonna do it! Look at me! Look at me! Oh, Jacob put his shirt off! I'm doing it! Wiiiiiiii!"" The incredible part was that she still had friends after all the sick and childish behaviour. <br/><br/>But it IS a really funny movie to see with friends! Don't bother not talking through it. It's funnier with audio comments. Try Rifftrax."

","First of all, I watched Twilight before I had ready any of the books. I thought the movie was good, so I went back read all 4 books. I have to say that I was very disappointed when I saw New Moon. I felt like the movie was more like a collection of 15-30 second clips with no transition in between. It just didn't flow very well, and a lot of important stuff was left out. I also didn't really care for the way some of the scenes were portrayed. For example, the motorcycle repair scenes and Bella's breakdown were mostly music and short clips with very little conversation. I felt that you had to have read the book in order to know what was going on. I also would have liked to have seen more from the other characters."

","I'm a terrible writer, yet i felt it was my duty to register so I could try putting into words how bad it is.<br/><br/>The movie was slow, so slow it could easily be mistaken for a slide-show, scene by scene we saw some scenery, some one on one dialog, never really building to anything, never really breaking from the near constant awkward silence, still the worst of it all was the character ""chemistry"" or should I say lack of it, they're supposed to be madly in love to the point of being unable to live without each other yet they seemed to show it with the ease of two brothers being forced to kiss. Maybe Bella is really an old lady because she sure as hell doesn't act like 18. My friends couldn't take it and fell asleep while trying to watch this, but I remained awake in disbelief, 2 hours of Edward dry humping Bella would have been better then this, I give it one star for ""Face Punch"" (the only entertaining part of the movie)."
"Dillin2603","1","9","13","3 December 2009"," The credits are enjoyable
","I tried not to expect anything when I was going to watch the movie just went in thinking nothing. Through I think the first..... five minutes or so I began to get bored and annoyed with the actors then after another five this movie was a complete fail for me. I'm sorry to say this to Twilight fans but everything in this movie was awful. I have read the books and I KNOW that nothing can be the same yes, yes it is a 600 or so pages, the thing is though....that was not the problem for me. The movie does its best with the adaption to the book but the way the actors interacted...Kristen Stewart just...can't act.. she can't. Bella is alive in the book show's personality, in both Twilight and New Moon Stewart is so wooden her face hardly ever changes emotion, her voice tone hardly ever changes EVEN in situations where one just scream, yell, have a higher tone. Watching her is annoying for people who have not read the book still don't have a clear image of Bella other then some chick who fall's for a vamp, then goes crazy when he leaves. Robert Pattinson he still to me hard to believe too, I think he is still trying to learn to be an actor he does strange faces and like anger, sadness like seeing if this face goes with the situation. The two don't to me have any chemistry what so ever, once again to people who have not read the book the way the two act one will wonder WHY they are together. What sad is that the best acting comes from the minor characters, Anna Kendrick, Michael Welch, and Billy Burke bring so much to life the characters the are playing. That's basically the main problem with this movie...that and music, script (yes I know I said I didn't mind it but still it was bad how it was written begin slow ending fast and blah) acting. I don't understand the whole obsession over this its WAY OVER BLOWN....<br/><br/>I give it a 1/10 this movie is a wast of time I wish Hollywood was not making another...."

"sariforever","3","25","44","21 November 2009"," ?!! What happened?
","First of all I read all four books (not a teenage girl!) and I have to say that movies will never be as good as the books! But apparently that's not the bad news about the movie. New Moon is actually just plain boring. The Story is told without depth and I don't know who hired the actors but they are simply bad! Neither Robert nor Kristen delivered any emotions. Which is exactly the problem because the whole book is just about emotions and heartbroken teenagers! It's about love, desire, friendship and Bella is supposed to be bursting because of her loss. Her heart is broken but what the hell happened? Kristen Stewart looked as she would have been bored out of her mind or just wanted to be somewhere else but not in this movie oO No heartbroken teenager on screen! Girl start acting or quit the job! Same goes for Robert Pattinson. I've never seen him as the next De Niro anyway but that it would get worse.. outch! There is no connection between him and Kristen at all(which was at least one reason I liked Twilight). If those two are actually dating well then good luck for that relationship. Next to that I wouldn't hire the make up artists of the movie again! The faces of all Cullens looked like cheap Halloween costumes. The contact lenses are exorbitant and I still don't get why all Cullens are suddenly forced to wear smeared red lipstick?!<br/><br/>The only really good thing in this movie is actually Taylor Lautner and I'm not just saying that because that 17 year old boy is way better in shape than his fellow Robert Pattinson (who BTW. is supposed to be the most handsome guy in this movie.. ahm NO!). No I'm saying that because he did a great acting job and made it possible that I was totally Team Jacob for once! <-- which is basically a miracle because when it comes to the books I'm totally an ""Edward girl"" (hey and wasn't Taylor the one they wanted to replace with another guy so badly? Wow! Way to go if you want to make a bad movie even worse)<br/><br/>I guess one problem with Edward here is that Robert Pattinson is not the greatest actor and the second reason is that they picture Edward in a different way in the movies. It's always just the desperate and ""wise"" Edward but they tend to forget that Edward can be cheeky and fun as well. How many times did I spend laughing because of him and Bellas stupid reactions?! New Moon ruined it!(well yeah it's not the book with most of the fun parts of Bella and Edward but what happened to the proposal scene? Unbelievable!) <br/><br/>Next to all that it seems hard to follow for everyone who hasn't been reading the books by now . There are so many plot holes and seemingly unfinished scenes! Hard sudden cuts. I just wasn't impressed. The movie has some cute jokes (some of them unintentional) but hey.. please please don't go this way with Eclipse!"
"ssvikas","3","10","15","14 December 2009"," For all its hype, New Moon suffers with a weak story & sleepy pace!
","If you thought the first ‘twilight’ was a sleepy teen-romance, new moon sleepwalked itself to another level. Continuing from the first flick, Bella and Edward are deeply in love. With Bella turning 18, she starts to have nightmares about becoming old, while her lover remains as youthful as ever. Reluctantly, she attends the party which the Cullens have organized for her where she accidentally cuts herself and Jasper can’t resist blood.<br/><br/>Edward becomes increasingly concerned about her continued vulnerability and his family leaves Forks. Soon our pretty lady finds solace in the adoring Jacob Black who later turns out to be a werewolf. The rest is a triangular love story and the tale of who saves Bella from the vengeful vampire Victoria. At this point, one wonders, can’t Bella really find ‘normal’ boyfriend or does she have an inclination for abnormal stuff?<br/><br/>New Moon introduces the well dressed Volturi, the law enforcers among vampires who have lived on for thousands of years. While this may look creative for an idea in a book, there is a glaring lack of depth in the treatment of characters. Worthy of mention though is the talented 15 year old Dakota Fanning as ‘Jane’ the Volturi vampire who can cause feelings of pain. It’s anyone’s guess that her casting would keep younger teens happy! <br/><br/>Before you can write twilight off, the bland New Moon does have a few sparks. Taylor Lautener who was just a silly long haired kid in Twlight turns into a well-chiseled Werewolf. The only efforts on visual effects are seen in the human-werewolf transformations and camera angles for chase sequences are also neat. Sadly, it doesn’t do much to redeem the damage done by its weak script and sleepy performances.<br/><br/>Criticism apart, the books and the movies are equally successful though the meat of the story in all the four books is only good enough for one movie of two hours. But, when the movies are raking in the moolah from ticket sales to souvenirs, owing to its teen craze internationally, why bother to change anyway! Here though, the audience count on a Friday night at a leading multiplex was a mere 14! Definitely not worth it!"

Now imagine paying the ticket to see the second one in the movie...Yes, it breaks my heart...Breaks my heart i paid to see a movie with actors as bad as they can get, with the worst one being the main character. This situation reminds me of a tragic Greek tragedy... But what can be more tragic than a girl screaming for her life when having a tiny little nightmare? Unfortunately, it is even more tragic the expression of ""Bella""'s face. I mean, different emotions should trigger different face expressions right? Apparently someone missed that when producing the movie.<br/><br/>After watching the trailers i was expecting a minimum of quality, but then again, i was horribly mistaken...<br/><br/>It boils down to this: Want a motive to kill yourself?

"adsmurfin101","3","47","91","20 November 2009"," stick to the book
","OK, it's pretty much a given that no movie was ever going to completely live up to the book. Still, I can't express in words what a massive disappointment this movie was for me. While it did touch on just about all that happened in the book, it didn't have any flow. I also felt whenever the actors were supposed to deliver any lines seething with emotion, they didn't do it. It was very daytime soap opera-sh for me. I honestly thought that Bella and Jacob's characters were very much lacking in that department. Even though the movie was over 2 hrs long, I felt it could have been a better movie if it was longer, so they could have delved deeper in these scenes than they did. The whole movie felt rushed, like they were trying to throw as much of the book as they could into a 2 hr time slot, and then chopped the scenes in half or more. <br/><br/>My other disappointment was the Volturi fight scene, though I would have taken it happily if the other parts of the movie had just been better. For anybody who has read the book, we know there is no fight scene in the book. It would have been hard to really show the tension we all read in the book, but I think they could have done it. The whole thing with the Volturi is that they never actually fight them, there's just the anticipation of the fight. The idea that I got from the books was that they could never fight them, because they could never win. Also, the scene where they show how Alice is showing Aro how she sees Bella as one of them.......terrible. They could have shown the whole family together, sitting around talking, and Bella looks up and her eyes are golden, or something better than Edward dressed like a schoolboy, and the two of them frolicking through the forest. Everybody in the theater was laughing. I hated that they screwed with some scenes from the book. When Edward and Bella reunite in Volterra, he seems very standoff-sh to her in the book, and she is thinking he will just take off again when they get back to Forks. Then, when she wakes up in her room with him beside her, that's when everything is supposed to unfold, about how he left her for her own protection, he still loves her, they kiss, etc. I absolutely hate it when screenwriters take matters into their own hands, and feel they can do it better than the author. The reason people have been dying to see this movie is because of the author, because they loved the book, so stick to the book. Conclusively, I felt like the scenes were rushed through, the acting was lacking emotion, and they left out some really important stuff to add scenes like showing the plane flying in the sky, or showing Victoria running through the woods with the wolves,(a scene that was never in the book), and the author's perfection was tampered with."

"lieventje_lagastje","1","6","8","9 June 2010"," What were they thinking?
","First of all why is everyone so freaked out about Robert Pattinson? Second of all how does this movie get close to be nominated for best kiss let alone winning it on the MTV Movie Awards. He can't even touch her without wanting to eat her alive. Then we come to the clichés of the movie, come on did the movie really have to include a 360° spin around Bella sitting behind her desk whit a sad face, why? Is it really so interesting seeing something like that. And then the wolves. Hah, to me they're just over grown,and over animated, huskies, you know polar dogs. Then over to the acting, could it be worst, I mean Jacob Black is one of the least interesting characters in a movie, or book for that matter. Yeah , I know it's because he's changing he becomes an asshole, but could it be executed a little better. Like, here it go's, so he like just starts getting sick and so on but not start yelling at everyone. Oh, here's the best part. So Jacob and Edward both want Bella (don't get me started on her) but still they're both saying i'm dangerous you shouldn't come near me, but still they are willing to fight a death match over her. Jezus... end now to the ending, 'Bella will you marry me?'. So this it what she should say: 'Yes Edward (blablabla)', but this is what she will say (and haven't read the book) 'i don't know Edward', or 'Oh my God' or 'I don't know how to answer to this...'. That is not a cliffhanger. Cliffhangers work like, 'Will you marry me?' (few seconds) ""(Blablablabla)"", but still in the same movie you hear me still in the same movie."
"nemesis47-1","2","6","8","24 April 2010"," This was just painful
","Okay I understand that this movie is made for fans and teenage girls who lust for Edward and Jacob. And I could accept the movie for what it is. But there are so many things wrong with it, that are impossible to overlook. Kirsten Stewart, My God is she high in this movie ? every frame is her being in the same dull, stupid expression.Subtle acting does not mean being stoned all the time. Pattison and Taylor at least understand their roles, they are monsters who try to hide their own beast within. What was the deal with the werewolves, are you f*&king joking, I have seen more plausible werewolves in the 40's movies. And I don't want to mention completely illogical actions made by characters why Edward can't just leave his family and stay with Bella if he really loves her so much ? Is he really such as sissy boy that he can't just leave his family? He could simply visit them on vacations like someone who was not retarded would do. But of course we need to have this stupid excuse for the sake of plot(can't even believe I am writing this).

"learningthelingo","3","6","8","12 January 2010"," Eat Your Heart Out Laura Mulvey: A New Moon Reading
","Like millions of other people, I flocked a screening of New Moon in its first week of release. I knew that I wouldn't enjoy it after what the first movie offered me, so saying that I did not enjoy it is like saying I went to a funeral and found it sad. Despite this, I still chose to be a sheep and follow along with the crowd to help break box office records.<br/><br/>The only way to experience this movie (in my humble opinion) is in an audience filled with swooning girls, just to really soak up the atmosphere that the film projects. That was my intention, and luckily I succeed by going to a screening early enough after the films release. I could tick the audible sighs and swooning sounds box on my expectations list, and soon to follow was the obligatory chest shots.<br/><br/>Without going into boring synopsis of the film, which would be as simple as a bus full of Miss America contestants, I can put forth a much easier description. Perhaps only students of film, scholars, academics and cultural critics and theorists will understand it, but regardless, here's my synopsis: Laura Mulvey, eat your heart out.<br/><br/>Mulvey's seminal theory (Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema) discussed the idea of the triple male gaze in the mid 1970s. This triple male gaze is the projection of a woman through a male characters eyes, put forth by a male author (director/writer) for a male audience. In New Moon we see this turned around. It is not the female that is the object of desire anymore, and instead it is the men who are subjected to the ""to-be-looked-at-ness"" aspect of Mulvey's claims. Her theories have been subverted, and not for the first time (let us not forget Casino Royale with Daniel Craig coming out of the water, like an Adonis, a la Ursula Andress style.) As we see this idea the idea of the triple maze gaze being turned on its head as at least a double female gaze now, if not even triple with Stephenie Meyer's book, the character of Bella and her male contemporaries (or should I say pieces of meat/eye candy.) But despite this, the Bella is still a dull girl who relies on the comfort of vampires and werewolves to stay amused and happy.<br/><br/>Consensus among female teenage (or tweenage) viewers finds the film ""hot"" and ""steamy"". Edward is ""dreamy"", Jacob is ""ripped, but 12"" and there is an instant divide between Team Edward and Team Jacob (one that could result in heads being ripped off and a ritualistic sacrifice in the name of the Twilight.) Perhaps it's because I've been watching too much True Blood, but the Twilight films leave something to be desired for me. I require that big bite that Twilight and New Moon lack in their ""nothing much happens"" plot lines. I don't consider myself an action chasing adrenaline junkie, but in I needed some proverbial action and I needed it desperately. Luckily New Moon offered me more than the previous instalment, but I was still not as satisfied as the tweens and ""twi-hards"", who seem to be feeding on some kind of unexplainable and unquenchable supernatural level."

I really was getting annoyed by the mainstars they looked to each other the whole time like they were on some kind of drug. At no point I was feeling the true romance between Edward and Belle.<br/><br/>The thing what made me even think less about the movie was the strange make-up choice. The red eye vampires were a big joke. Basically almost all action shoots where in the trailer so if people do want action don't go to this movie.

"moonspinner55","4","19","33","21 November 2009"," Bereft, sexless teen titillation...both emotionally static and psychologically dense
","Stephenie Meyer's ""Twilight"" series moves into its second cinematic installment with this technically marvelous but otherwise empty monster-romance targeted at a very specific, impressionable (and undemanding) audience. Teenagers will swoon as high school senior Bella asks vampire crush Edward Cullen to ""change"" her before she gets too old. Instead of complying, the pale, doe-eyed hunk gives his human girlfriend a rambling goodbye speech out in the woods, something about living a normal life and always loving her forever. Heartbroken Bella suffers...and suffers...and suffers, until she finally finds solace in her friendship with muscular Jacob, who's about to spring another surprise on Bella (which is preceded by yet another kiss-off speech!). The dialogue, fraught with teen angst and halting emotions, is predictably stilted, while Kristen Stewart flip-flops confusingly in her devotion between the two guys. This isn't a movie meant to last the ages; it has been conceived and designed to appeal to the here-and-now. Once its initial sheen has worn off, I imagine the film will appear as it really is: a shallow commercial product--laden with poorly-timed rock music cues--which refuses to take any chances lest it turn off its core viewership. The final battle inside the Volturi is so ridiculously overblown, one isn't sure where the characters stand with each other, while blood-thirsty Victoria (who wants to kill Bella) is left swimming about in the coastal waters, perhaps waiting for Installment #3 to make her move. ** from ****"
"werstnightmare2002","10","63","128","20 November 2009"," Exeedingly Better Than The First
","First off, I don't understand all the bashing for this movie. It was beautifully made and was FAR better made than the first movie. Then again most of these reviews don't have proper spelling or grammar so I can't take them very seriously. They also don't have clear understanding of the book and are not judging the movie on how its made and how the movie sells the story line to someone who has never been exposed to the Twilight Saga.<br/><br/>To start off, the beginning of the movie was sweet and slightly painful. Kristen Stewart's acting with Robert Pattinson is horrible but then has the best chemistry with the rest of the characters. The moments with Jacob are touching and heartbreaking and I was damn-near brought to tears a few times because of it. Bella was actually sarcastic this time and what do you know, even the Cullen's had their own personalities that 'sparkled' perfectly! <br/><br/>The story line was very true to the book, other than a few instances where I have no issue giving concessions since what they did helped the story line. There was only one major continuity issue, Harry Clearwater's death, and some minor ones, the last scene was backwards Edward was supposed to propose to Bella and then have the confrontation with Jacob and I'm pretty sure I saw a sandy werewolf during the Victoria chase scene which would have been Seth who wasn't introduced in the movie at all though he was in the book. <br/><br/>The Werewolves and the Volturi had the perfect amount of screen time each in correlation to the book. The Werewolves were the band of brothers I always imagined and the Volturi were just as terrifying. Charlie, as always, made the movie even more perfect and even the little bit of Harry Clearwater we saw was brilliant. <br/><br/>All in all, there isn't much more I could have asked for from this movie. I only ask that those who don't like the Twilight Saga, to which I have no issue with seeing as I live with three people who hate the series so much they leave the room when I say the word 'Twilight', see how well done this movie was made, especially compared to the disaster that was Twilight."
"mellowfi","3","30","56","20 November 2009"," Very disappointing- Bring back Catherine Hardwick!
","I loved the first movie. I loved hardwicks direction, the blue hue of the screen, how she emphasised the supernatural in a strange and eerie light. It was undertstated in many ways. She created an atmosphere, a tone and a style that this current director clearly totally lacked, or decided to completely drop. You shouldn't mess with a good thing as they say. I think dropping Hardwick was a huge mistake. In my eyes she captured the feel of the story and visualised the book to its best effect.<br/><br/>This movie was a real let down for me. I felt it was very by-the-book, and contained no real step-up or true continuation from the first movie. It lacked finesse and atmosphere. It lacked so many things I don't even know where to begin. Im not sure if it was the screen play or the direction, but something clearly was amiss. However, on a better note, the performances from the cast are superb. Speaking of the cast, the film barely see's the majority of the Cullens on screen. The story of the Quillette tribe and the wolf pack should also have been given more attention.<br/><br/>I just hope the next movie is better!"
"marista20","3","28","52","21 November 2009"," Makes Me Sad
","SMALL SPOILER <br/><br/>Alright, I'm gonna start by saying that I AM die-hard Twilight fan. I have been to Forks, WA (I know, pathetic), I have read the books countless times, I have dressed up in a fancy prom dress for the 'Breaking Dawn' Release Party. I have done it all, and I am not ashamed! <br/><br/>But THESE movies... MY GOD... THESE movies just kill them. I tried to love them I really did. I kept going to see the first movie a couple of times in the vain hope that I might in fact realize I love it. I convinced myself the second one would be different and that I would adore it, but I JUST CAN'T. The books just get butchered in their transition on screen, and it's weird cause I usually like movie adaptations just as much as much as the books they go with, but in this case it's impossible. <br/><br/>The acting is horrible, the dialogue is cheesy, and the whole thing is just awkward and painful. Kristen and Rob make the whole relationship between Bella and Edward seem so serious and like it's such a job. I mean it is serious, but not 24/7. Even when their kidding around w/ each other it sounds like their in the middle of a major business deal, and the jokes are just there to be polite. I mean THERE ARE light moments between Edaward and Bella in the book, but none in the movie. It's all just doom and gloom w/ them. And their so awkward and feeling-less. Even when Rob's reciting Romeo's dying lines (which by themselves are tender and passionate) it sounds like he's reciting the Nutrition Facts off the back of a bag of cookies. It hurts me. Kristen, also looks like she's attempting REALLY hard to get her feelings across, but she just can't. <br/><br/>The other characters are alright, but if you don't have Edward and Bella down perfectly than the entire thing automatically becomes a disaster, because I'm not there to see the 2 scenes Emmett or Carlisle have (who are both pretty good). The only principal character I did like was actually Jake, and not because I'm a Team Jacob fan, in fact I hate it when Jake tries to be more than just friends w/ Bella in the books. I think I like him more in the movie because Taylor just seems like a likable guy in real life, and he's not a half bad actor. In fact he has a lot of potential, but even he can't make up for Kirstin and Rob's bad acting. And it is bad acting, because I actually kind of like both of them in real life (they seem like decent people), and they only bug me when their on screen.<br/><br/>Also, unlike the first movie, the soundtrack wasn't even that good this time. That was pretty much the best thing about the first movie, and now it's gone. The action is pretty cool, and I am a girl who enjoys action movies so I can appreciate that. <br/><br/>However, the book is lost, even if New Moon does manage to keep to the plot of the book better than Twilight. It's the feelings that the book inspired that are lost, and what remains is a dry, poorly acted, melodramatic, movie about vampire love. AREN'T THERE ENOUGH OF THOSE ALREADY? <br/><br/>I suppose I'll just have to resign myself to the idea that I will never muster up anything more than a love for the books when it comes to the Twilight franchise. <br/><br/>If you're a 10-14 year old girl who wants to go swoon over the whole thing, than by all means go.<br/><br/>If you're a true romantic at heart who wants to see a deep and interesting love story mixed with some fantasy here and there, go but don't expect it to be anything special cause you'll be VERY disappointed. <br/><br/>If you're someone who just wants to see what the fuss is about, then go but don't expect to understand why everyone is in such a craze over Twilight (if you really want to understand I say:Read the books.) <br/><br/>If you just want to see a random yet entertaining (and maybe even good) movie on a Saturday night, then don't go. There are plenty of better options that will actually stimulate you as a viewer both intellectually and emotionally."
"DizzyDitz","8","34","65","21 November 2009"," Keep your expectations low and have fun
","This movie greatly exceeded my expectations, but that is because they were low. I've read and enjoyed all of the books but it is really an exception to my movie going/reading habits. When Edward enters the screen for the first time they film it in slow motion, while he gives a bit of a swagger, and super-cheesy music plays. Bwahahaha! Love it. <br/><br/>It does not significantly differ from the books. The wolves, well, they're okay, not fab but not so realistic either. I recall seeing the Golden Compass (which Weitz BOMBED) and the daemons were similar. Fortunately they don't talk or tap dance. <br/><br/>I'm disappointed in Robert Pattinson. He actually can act, but for some reason he decided to adopt a mono-expression of pain and suffering from the very beginning until the end. Stewart is okay, I have actually always enjoyed her Bella, who is very introverted. Taylor vastly improves upon the book character, who I find to be a cocky little git. <br/><br/>So with all this bad stuff, why did I enjoy the movie? Because it was campy and fun, and I didn't take it too seriously. I recommend large amounts of audience participation and to go when there are a maximum levels of gushy teenage girls around you, so that they squeal when the trailer for ""Remember Me"" comes on."
"Bucketsofguts","4","54","109","20 November 2009"," A step in the right direction
","As an esoteric film, New Moon will not be enjoyed by those who have no prior knowledge, or even interest, of the Twilight Saga by Stephanie Meyer.<br/><br/>It is a film purely for the fan base, and as a fan of the books, New Moon was immensely satisfying on screen. The plot was handled very well by Chris Weitz who must be commended for his fantastic work in direction and cinematography. There was no hint of excessively overbearing camera shots that so coloured Hardwicke's style in Twilight. It was clean and crisp, and quite visually stunning (two scenes in particular spring to mind). <br/><br/>The lack of score in this film is not necessarily a bad thing, as it compliments the direction in which Chris Weitz took this film; which was far far away from the embarrassment that was Twilight. <br/><br/>There was a noticeable improvement in the acting; all crass dialogue was quite bearable, and it seemed that the actors had a better feel of the characters they were portraying.<br/><br/>Overall an enjoyable portrayal of Stephanie Meyer's New Moon."
"jdesando","Null","33","63","20 November 2009"," Baying at the moon, big time.
","""I love you. You're my only reason to stay alive."" Edward Cullen <br/><br/>How many times can ""I can't live without you"" or its variant be said in a movie? Too many when it's New Moon, the new teen tease of the Twilight Saga. I get the idea that teens long for each other much more than adults do, making teens the horniest animals on the planet. Wait. Wait. ""Animals"": That's the big motif because were-wolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) substitutes for vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson), who is on vacation from Bella (Kristen Stewart). It's just another sexual frustration for her. This girl might stand a better chance in a nunnery.<br/><br/>The slow teen romance has some of the worst dialogue this year. Bella says, for instance, ""The absence of him is everywhere I look. It is like a big hole has been punched through my chest."" While she says this, she gives her endlessly distracted look, the one that says how difficult life is for a teen with two wild hunks pursuing her.<br/><br/>When the teens are not mooning in the second half, there is some satisfactory action as Jacob and his shirtless boys turn into very big wolves. In fact, so many shirtless boys and no scantily-clad girls leave me to suspect a homo erotic sub theme. Do girls really want to date gay men?<br/><br/>Would that there were a lusty gay leitmotif, for then it would have saved me from a film whose first half is so slow I began thinking about The Fourth Kind, the most boring film of the year so far. Who would have thought vampires and were-wolves could be dull? When they're teens, that's when."
"funnyface1201","3","32","61","21 November 2009"," Crap for anyone who actually read the book.
","Okay, I had some real issues with the first movie. For one thing they couldn't have found a worse actress to play Bella. She speaks every line the same, keeps the same facial expression throughout the entire film, and has a very masculine voice. They did decently well with Robert Pattinson but he is nowhere near the most gorgeous guy in the world. The previews for the second movie looked a lot better than the first movie. It looked like it would actually go based off the book, which it did, sort of. However, this movie was full of cheesy dialog and the for the most part the characters didn't even attempt to deliver it with any real emotion. My first real annoyance with the movie is the way everything felt rushed. it was like from one minute to the next something that took two chapters to build up to just happened and was over with in ten seconds. Hey, i'm happy with Edward. thirty seconds later, Edward leaves me. Ten seconds after that Jake and I are best friends. forty seconds later, uh oh my best friend is a werewolf. and then it continued on like that for the entire movie. Anyone who is even mildly entertained by the series would not have minded tacking on another thirty minutes to the movie to keep an actual flow going.<br/><br/>My second annoyance came with Kristen Stewart's once again horrible acting. She was a little more animated than in the first movie but only marginally show. When Edward is breaking up with her she just blinks a lot and stares at the ground and does weird things with her breathing, which I guess was supposed to be her in excruciating emotional pain. I think the most annoying thing about her is her voice, however. It's sort of deep and she always sounds like she's being very, very serious, even when she's supposed to be delivering a line I assumed was meant to be funny. If they replaced her I'm almost positive the movies themselves would improve. they wouldn't be cinematic masterpieces or anything like that but they'd be better with a person who actually showed emotion.<br/><br/>My third annoyance would have to be where they threw things from the book into the movie. For example: when she's racing up to Edward in under the clock tower. In the book they go through this dialog of him believing he's in heaven and Carlisle was right about his soul. Bella must then convince him he is alive. They do NOT have this in depth I'm sorry I left you but I did it because I love you conversation until after they get from Italy, not in under the clock tower like the movie shows it. Another example is at the very beginning of the movie Jacob just suddenly shows up at Bella's school. WTF? That never happened. Jacob does appear in the books until after Edward leaves. They also shove Jasper into the school scene, which he's not supposed to be. Also, what book did the production crew read that said anything about a fight taking place between the volturri and Edward? It didn't happen. There was no fight scene then, like the movie showed. I could go on and on with examples like this. i understand they had time constraints but my biggest issue with books into movies is that they screw up the timelines so bad. This another perfect example.<br/><br/>Lastly, I have to say some of the things I enjoyed about the movie. for one thing when I read the series I find Edward and Bella's relationship funnier. It isn't quite so life and death as the first movie showed it. I laugh at lots of the things they say to each other. The second movie definitely depicted their relationship in a funnier way. The beginning of the movie was actually pretty funny. Also, many of the characters made the movie worth watching. Sadly, it wasn't any of the main characters in the film. It was the ones that were barely there. For example, I loved Billy Burke as Charlie Swan. His character made the movie good, at least when he was in the scenes. Also, the girl who plays Jessica Stanley did awesome. She was funny and during the pretty one scene that she's in the movie (the night in port angeles) I laughed. By far my favorite character was Mike Newton though. He wasn't in much of the movie but in the scene at the theater with Jacob and Bella he was awesome. He was funny and portrayed his character very well. Jasper's character is scarcely in the movie, maybe like three or four scenes. The ones that he is in he plays his character well and he delivers lines that are well done and most of them fairly humorous.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was pretty a major disappointment. The acting by the major characters was horrible but all the minor characters that did well in the film made the movie worthwhile. There were more of the minor characters than I mentioned but those were my favorites. The action scenes, despite the fact that they never happened in the movie, were well done. The transformation from human to werewolf was well done, even though you could totally tell it was special effects. The movie is worth seeing and it will entertain you but not in the way you think it will. If you're going to the movie because you love the series, be prepared to be disappointed. If you're going just because, I'm sure there is some redeeming quality you will see in the film to not make you regret spending your money on it."
"gabriella-c","1","23","42","22 November 2009"," Didn't read the books. Still disappointed.
","I'm in my early 30's. My husband and I saw the first movie in the theater and thought it was a laugh. But we did enjoy moments like the ball game in the field when the bad vamps appeared, and the action when Edward was saving Bella towards the end. So we decided to watch this second movie. People said that the different people involved with its making was a promise for a better movie. They were WRONG. While there were no ridiculous moments of Edward fairying around in the air with Bella on his back, there was also little story, no action, and a disappointing ending (the entire theater full of teens went ape at the end in anger). It was laughable. I am sad that this movie will show great numbers for opening weekend. It doesn't deserve the hype.<br/><br/>Best part: Jacob's body. Worst part: everything else."
"abeburnett","2","23","42","22 November 2009"," Loved the first one, HATED this second one
","The only reason I give this film 2 stars (and not 1) is that the acting was good. I thought all the actors did a good job of portraying angsty (melodramatic, self-engrossed, intense, my-life-really-sucks-even-though-there's-nothing-really-wrong-with-it attitude) teenage attitudes.<br/><br/>That said, I HATED numerous aspects of this second film in the series. Bella--who reveals herself as a massive flake who won't make her own decisions and who is basically a doormat--spends the whole movie being little but a glorified doormat. She's just in the movie to sit around and preen while two guys fight over her. The thing is, as a guy myself, I couldn't understand what everyone thought was so amazing and attractive and wonderful about Bella. I simply couldn't understand everyone's infatuation with her. She's good looking, true, but she's boring, has no life or hobbies, no great personality (hardly any personality at all), nothing interesting about her, and poor character on top of it all: she's selfish, flaky, indecisive, a bad friend, a poor daughter, and a horrible girlfriend. I hope teenage girls don't take notes from Bella because they'll get the wrong message. Good guys like girls who have their own interests, who are opinionated, who can make decisions and take responsibility for their decisions, who are fun and self-empowered, who treat other people well. Bella was none of those things. I loathed her and I loathed the fact that Edward--who should have enough experience in 109 years of living to eschew such a simpering melodramatic empty husk of a girl like Bella--doted on her and indulged her. And Jacob, the really GOOD guy...I constantly wished that he'd realize that he was WAY too good for Bella and let her know that she had things to figure out and he wasn't going to just ""be around"" to be her surrogate emotional boyfriend, while Edward is her physical boy toy, etc.<br/><br/>Other than my hatred of Bella's character and how everyone pampered her and coddled her, I also thought the story was disconnected, boring, and repetitive. Indeed, when Bella first goes to hang out with Jake she alludes to how strong and ""beautiful"" he is. She virtually paints him as just another Edward: the next super-human boy toy to bend to her whims. Lame. The story just hops around from scene to scene with very little to connect the dots. This film just lacked a lot of the ""magic"" that made the first film special: from the awesome soundtrack, to the fact that she had a lot of ""normal life"" to deal with like parents, and friends, and stuff going on. In this movie it seemed more like a TV show where the characters don't really have to work, never really go home, and we don't even know if they sleep, eat, or crap.<br/><br/>I HATED this movie and highly recommend that people avoid seeing it. If you need your vamp fix, watch Twilight again."
"Darkfrog24","5","45","90","20 November 2009"," True to the book and reasonably fun to watch
","People who liked either the first movie or the New Moon book will probably have a great time at this movie. People who didn't like them still might have fun laughing at the moments of glorious teenaged awkwardness--Michael Welch returns as the hilariously down-on-his-luck Mike Newton.<br/><br/>As a sequel, New Moon is excellent. It maintains the same tone as the first movie, smooths out some of the rough edges and builds from there. On its own it's mostly quite enjoyable to watch. There were lots of intentional and unintentional humor and of course the movie takes only a bit of the edge off the book's more than slightly unbalanced story structure.<br/><br/>Things that impressed me? FIGHT SCENES. They actually let us see Felix toss Edward around like a rag doll. And they might have robbed us of the sight of spooky elder vampires petrifying in their old age, but they did let us see Edward's head literally crack like an eggshell as he gets slammed into the floor tiles.<br/><br/>I also like that they expanded Alice's role and showed Bella actually missing someone in addition to Edward. I really wish that both the books and movies had gotten more into the Bella-Alice friendship. Also, the idea that a person's spouse is the only relationship they need is a relatively new one. If even a romantically obsessed book series like Twilight can focus on the fact that Bella is reacting to the entire Cullen clan and not just Edward, then maybe we're moving toward a healthier idea of what love is.<br/><br/>Also, Michael Sheen is the champion of creepy. Sorry, Bill Nighy; he played Aro before you played Greyback! My final recommendation? Go see this movie with a big crowd for all the squealing and shouting at the screen. It's like a floor show but with body glitter."
"paine394","2","22","40","21 November 2009"," Well... At least it was better than ""Twilight""
","I've been a fan of the Twilight series since 2004ish, before it became such a huge craze. The books are full of plot holes and melodrama, but they're so bad, they're actually good. I can't say the same for this movie.<br/><br/>I went to see if with a friend and we spent the majority of the the movie giggling at how horrible the film was. Kristen Stewart is an awful actress. A block of cheese could probably show more emotion than she does. Robert Pattinson is awkward and not nearly as attractive as a handsome vampire should be. Charlie, Jacob, and Alice are the only three characters whose actors have something that resembles skill.<br/><br/>The story is one giant plot hole. If I hadn't read ""New Moon"" I would have had no idea what was going on half the time. It's like someone took a copy of the book, ripped out every other 50 pages, and made a movie out of what was left.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you're a die-hard Twilight fan (or want to drool over Taylor Lautner's chiseled abs) and don't mind wasting 10 bucks, go see it. You'll get a few laughs out of how horrifying it is. If you've never heard of ""Twilight"" and just want to see a good movie, stay away."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","7","10","4 September 2011"," Weak Sequel
","New Moon (2009) <br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Second film in the smash-hit Twilight series has Edward (Robert Pattinson) leaving Bella (Kristen Stewart) who then goes into a deep depression. The one thing that saves her is her best friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) but she doesn't realize that he's a werewolf and soon she's going to have to pick between this friend or the love of her life. Opinions on this film are probably very mixed but I think everyone could come to an agreement that Mrs. Bella needs to have her head checked as she has a pretty strange taste in men. With that said, I'm not familiar with any of the books and I'm watching these movies without knowing very much. I do know that the director of TWILIGHT was let go and Chris Weitz was brought in. Weitz has made some decent pictures in his day but why on Earth they selected him is beyond me because he certainly doesn't do anything to keep this film going. I thought the first movie ran way too long but it's nothing compared to this film, which has enough story for about a twenty-minute short yet it gets pushed to over two-hours, which was just painful to sit through. I'm sure fans of the books are going to take away more than someone like me but I personally thought the story was incredibly weak, some of the character motivations were beyond me and the pacing was just so bad that I had a hard time staying awake. I think things got off to a pretty poor start with a rather silly opening sequence that really adds nothing to the film but sadly things don't get any better. I thought the relationship between Bella and her father was good in the first movie but it's hacked up here. Her relationship with Jacob just never held much interest from me and I think that even the chemistry between Bella and Edward was lacking here. I always say great actors can drown in a bad screenplay and it's interesting to see how Stewart and Pattinson do here. I thought they were terrific in the first film and while they're still good here their performances are certainly a major step down. I think a lot of this has to do with the tired screenplay that doesn't give them much to work with including some lame dialogue that doesn't help things. Lautner, sorry ladies, wasn't all that impressive but I'm guessing they got him so he could constantly have his shirt off and not so much for the acting. NEW MOON doesn't even look that good and the CGI werewolf effects are embarrassing at times. I found TWILIGHT to be an entertaining little movie but sadly everything good about it is turned bad in this sequel."
"mrUniverse2010","2","7","10","5 April 2010"," wooden acting, weak story line, nothing happens, why the hype ?
","Having read other reviews of this movie, all I can say it is a shame that people have given this 10/10 whilst openly admitting they think it is only worth 4 or 5 by their standards but they want to ""even it up a little from the people who have given it 1/10"". The 4.odd/10 it has received is a little flattering (well... very) by any standards, this is a dreadful dreadful movie, a straight to DVD production at best, if it should have been realised at all. The marketing team who have managed to make this such a box office and DVD success are geniuses !! I had a Twilight and New Moon marathon inflicted on me earlier this week, having watched Twilight (and being very disappointed) I was promised the second was better so optimistically donated another 2 hours of my life to watching it; I CAN say this is better than the first one of the ""saga"" (strictly this is a saga because it is a long story comprising a sequence of events, don't let the attachment of the word to these movies make you think it can be considered in the same breath as Starwars, Lord of the Rings, etc etc though) but only in the same way breaking your arms is better than breaking your legs, you wouldn't really choose for either of them to happen...<br/><br/>I can honestly say this is the worst movie I have ever seen (well, second worst to its predecessor), the quality of acting is comparative with 5 year olds in a nativity, the plot follows some kind of love story between a vampire (which the author has made an ill attempt at updating the genre of, he (they) sparkle beautifully in the sunshine instead of dying with no attempt (unlike the far superior Blade) to explain why) and a weird brunette who becomes somewhat of a bunny boiler, has a bit of a flirt with a werewolf, then goes back to the sparkly vampire. I have labelled this section as a potential plot spoiler but don't be mislead into thinking there is a plot to be spoilt. Imagine (English readers of this review will understand this) Hollyoaks with poorer acting, no sex, no plot lines, no beautiful women, and rubbish mythical creatures and you pretty much have the Twilight series.<br/><br/>Given the hype around this movie and the others in the ""saga"" it must seem that I'm in some way taking the micky out of this movie etc, but you have me on scouts honour that words really CAN NOT describe how bad this movie is ! I have rated this as 2/10, it would have gotten 1 if zero/10 was an option, as it is not; it has received the lowest score possible from me plus a bonus point for the CGI in turning man -> werewolf -> man.<br/><br/>The 130 minutes spent watching this could be much better used painting a wall, alphabetising your CD collection or passing a kidney stone !!"

","I have to admit that I was quite entertained with the first Twilight film, despite it being steeped in teenage puppy love, and breaking plenty of established rules about vampires, such as sunshine giving them a funky glow rather than turning them to ashes, or them being without fangs, so it's a good thing though that their thirst for blood was left intact. And well, being the completest that I am, I just have to continue with the franchise, and New Moon suffers from the usual middle-movie syndrome, inheriting and choosing to dwell on what its predecessor did without adding any significant meat, and yet not being the second last movie to have increased its pace and intrigue, if any to begin with.<br/><br/>Instead, New Moon are for Twilight fans who support the other hairy side, where hot boys run around half naked almost all the time to show off their toned bodies, driving female members in the audience into a gasping frenzy each time a shirt is taken off. Yes, Mr Metrosexual Vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) really pales in comparison (pardon the intentional pun) in the buffed body campaign, so thank goodness there wasn't much of a pissing competition between him and werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner, who was very close to being dropped).<br/><br/>Otherwise we''re where we left off, with the initial scenes recapping some of the issues the lovers Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward face with her being the tempting meat hanging around a pack of reformed vampires, and her incessant whining about wanting to belong to the immortals, because of her innate fear that Edward will leave her once she turns old and wrinkled. In a sudden about turn, Edward and family decide to leave her for her own good and protection, given the events from the first movie, they think it's for the best so that they do not implicate her, or rather, wanting to risk their own lives and limbs to save her from other vampires out for easy meat.<br/><br/>So yes, Edward dumps her in the most unceremonious of ways, and is quite the liar for continuing to appear to provide sound advice to stop her from taking risks, and basically from having a good time. Talk about selfishness. His retribution? Being as stupid as Romeo from Shakespeare's classic, a character whom he loathes, and frankly the third act of the film based on the same level of stupidity, having to fulfill his own suicidal tendency. Once dumped, our girl then spends the rest of the movie moping, whining, and being depressed, that she inadvertently leads Jake on, and quite timely too as he was on the verge of finding the other strutting half-naked boys too attractive to resist. The wolf got let out of the bag, and Bella learns of the secret of her best friend, along with plenty of rules and regulations governing the truce between vampires and werewolves.<br/><br/>If compared to the earlier film, New Moon is quite the bore, with the never ending indecisiveness of Bella. It's not that she doesn't know who she wants to end up with (no prizes for guessing she wants to remain youthful forever), but then the short term appeal of a hot bod bad boy may prove to be too hard (heh) to resist. Furthermore, on one hand you have a vampire who's such a new age metrosexual with a penchant for heavy foundation and lipstick, but on the other the tremendous power and rage of an angry were-man would potentially leave one physically scarred in any moment of insanity. So if you're a rational person, the choice is rather obvious, despite wolf-boy always wanting to hang around to play hero, being sworn to protect the human race from evil vampires. With great powers come great responsibility, we understand. <br/><br/>Set action sequences were severely limited in this installment, although they were designed for the wolves to spring into action. And these wolves are really huge, almost Ultraman sized as they hunt for their vampire prey in fast moving packs. Transformation from Man to Wolf is effortlessly done and happens in a blink of the eye with shirts and pants ripping into nothing, though you don't get to actually see the reverse happen, because this is a family friendly movie, and the filmmakers chose not to give young teenage girls too quick a start into the anatomy of our hairy friends. The vampire battle sequences here were also nothing to shout about, preferring to overuse slow motion because, well, they move fast.<br/><br/>In any case, this film is review-proof. Immediately when the end credits start to roll, I heard a few female voices around me proclaiming to want to watch this again. God knows this is their umpteenth time already! It ends with a cliffhanger, since the next film was shot back- to-back, and what a wonderful way to make you anticipate its release. I only hope for more sensible action given the introduction of Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning's oh-so- powerful Volturi council characters reliant on tourism to bring in the bacon, rather than another ai-mai-ai-mai (want-don't want) tussle on the affairs of the heart. Make a decision people, like means like, so stick to it."

","I was so looking forward to this movie, I was counting down the days - catching trailers where I could, I thinking how many times I could see it but I could only manage the one viewing because, and it burns me to say it, but I didn't like it...AT ALL. I loved Twilight, I've lost count the amount of times I've seen it and it never gets boring. Yes it was low budget (who can forget the mop on Taylor Lautners head), but those kind of things never detracted from the story or the smooth flow of the movie. New Moon was such an anti-climax. It's clearly a rushed movie, the studios would have still made just as much money and we (the fans) would have gotten the movie we deserved, if they had been patient enough to let Catherine Hardwick have more time as she'd asked. I've no doubting Chris Weitz's ability as a director but there was something missing in New Moon, there was no passion/emotion, no flow, no time to reconnect with the characters, it was all very matter of fact and came off as some choppy wannabe action movie, with a bit of popcorn romance randomly thrown in. Director continuity is sometimes as important as all the other elements - look at the success of the 'Bourne Supremacy & Ultimatum' Also, maybe take a tip from those movies and have a kind of recap or references to how they came to this point in time, at the start or somewhere in the film, - In New Moon there was no connecting bridge from the first movie - it just jumped in and took off, and ended just as abruptly. The CGI was impressive but it was just cringeworthy to watch, the acting overall was far worse than Twilight - the only sigh of relief was when I realised Michael Sheen was one of the volturi...a brief glimpse of a real moment of acting. Unfortunately, I believe that 'Eclipse' is already in the 'can' so no chance of getting Catherine back, all I can ask is that the editing is a bit more considerate of the storyline this time."
"lopcar1993","1","7","10","8 December 2009"," More stylish than the first but more pitiful and terribly acted and plotted than the first..
","While New Moon boasts new locals, better acting and some over stylized action sequences it can't in noway measure up to the the minor success that Twilight had. It's style too earnest, it's story to contrived and boring and while the acting is much better than what was given in Twilight can't really save this film from being nothing but another entry in one of the most undeserving popular film adaption of Stephine Meyers' worldwide sensation books, making it a boring and under-made teeny bopper romantic adventure. Is New Moon good entertainment? Sorry to say, but no. Is it unbearable awful? Nowhere near it but it does come close in some scenes.<br/><br/>New Moon is dull, dimwitted, over-stylized, under-directed, under-plotted and basically suffers from every problem imaginable and can't even surpass the first film but does give you a good look at what a strained relationship looks like. But besides that it can't seem to keep it's head afloat long enough to entertain or even convince us of what is going on in the story. But I will give it credit to it's new director Chris Weitz(Director of the atheist film, The Golden Compass.) He does well in elevating the acting and adding action sequences to the film to make it more appealing. But even the action is flat and lifeless and just adds to the nothingness this film already is. But all in all New Moon is nothing new at all and is just a failure that got lucky.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart does elevate her performance here for the most part but she falls short when the dramatic scenes come up and helps make this film extremely unbelievable and unconvincing. Robert Pattinson impressed me with bring his performance from bad to alright, and boy was he bad in the first film. But Pattinson up his performances and just when you think he's going to keep climbing but instead he falls right back down the ladder to the bottom again. Taylor Launter is nothing new or anything good in this film but I will give him credit for trying his hardest with the soapy dialogue and the dumb down plot. But even he can't save the film seeing as he is one of the reasons it fails with his bland and emotionless performance. But all in all the cast falls and when they do you can hear it a hundred miles away.<br/><br/>Twilight Saga: New Moon is not what you expect or even want, it's a mess of a film that suffers heavily from it's poor script and under direction. It's nothing more than a crowd pleaser if you can call it that it's nothing new and certainly nothing special and it's a film I regret wasting m time on. All in all New Moon is an A-Bomb times a hundred."
"nmcbabygirl1980","4","7","10","7 December 2009"," My thoughts on New Moon
","I want to say that I have read all the books of Twilight. The books I feel were pretty good. I am all for fantasy. Anything that helps me escape the reality of my life. I had a very hard time putting the books down. Now for the movies I felt let down. Twilight was good but it could have been better if there had been more feeling put into it. Some not all of the actors showed more than a few emotions in their voice and expressions. Now in New Moon I saw the trailer for it and couldn't wait for the movie to come out. I waited for hours to see it due to it being sold out. I was more disappointed in this film than the first one. It doesn't even come close to the book. I was bored watching this film. When I left the theater I was felt unsatisfied. So a week later I went back to see it again thinking that maybe just maybe I had missed something. Nope, I hadn't missed anything. There were a lot of holes in the movie. Stuff that they shouldn't have left out. If I hadn't of read the books I would have been confused. I feel for the movie being 2 hours long there was a lot of the plot missing. Yes, I will give them the credit of having good graphics but that is it. I expected way more passion and connection between Bella (Kristen & Robert)and Edward than they gave. Their acting was soooo not up to par. I hope Eclipse is so much more than this one. I hope that maybe some of the actors and the director of the next movie read these comments and learn from them. I mean aren't they making these movies to connect and entertain the fans of the Twilight series? keeping my fingers crossed!!!!!!"

Bad movie, please tight up the cast and PLEASE different director next time, please. This story needs a lady director!

"tcmerritt","3","7","10","6 December 2009"," I just don't get why...
","I suppose it's just me, but I can't for the life of me figure out what drives people to actually applaud this tripe. I did give the books a chance, and thought they were OK, but this depressing weak-willed self- pity / teenage angst phase has got to be the most damaging crap this country has even seen. Before I sound too much like an old out-of-touch jerk, know that I really wanted to enjoy these movies. The acting in this latest movie is tepid, the actors are either overacting a great deal or not even trying, and the entire cast really are nothing more than B-film at best. I can only assume that the people who love this movie so much are hardcore fans who wanted to believe in it after the books success, because as an average audience member I was not impressed at all. I'd say the showing I went to was split about 60/40 disliking it (Judging by the snide remarks near me). I guess it's a rental later on if you liked the first one, but if not - hype is a terrible thing in this case. Buy the books with the money you save not seeing this in a theater....<br/><br/>TICM"
"j-pryde","1","7","10","5 December 2009"," Dull
","In a nutshell, save the money for the ticket and watch (type in your favorite teen romance) on DVD instead. It's a waste of time. The acting is bad and if you are one of those Robert Pattinson fans - he is overall appearance in the movie doesn't even accumulate to 10min. It's quiet irritating that he is even on the poster and gets top billing. Waste of time and money.<br/><br/>The plot is ridiculous. Kristen Stewart seems to be set on playing the same type of roles in all of her movies and action is non-existent. The movie borders on a homo erotic flick...Almost all male actors are semi- nude for large parts of the movie. <br/><br/>If you are under 16, New Moon will satisfy your needs. If you intend to have a good time with your significant other - chances are that the both of you will be bored out your mind.<br/><br/>Watching a re-run of HSH on the Disney Channel is far more exciting than this crap on celluloid."
"insomniac_rod","4","7","10","5 December 2009"," Was this the complete film? Did I miss something?
","Uh, didn't see that coming definitely! I didn't get the climax or I don't know what happened, but I think this movie lacked of an intense conclusion.<br/><br/>I felt it ended abruptly, without the most important situations getting a resolution.<br/><br/>I mean, I watched it on movie theaters but it felt that it was an incomplete film. There were many sub-plots thrown but never completed and in consequence left the audience with the impression that the movie was just a transitional situation for the sub-plots resolutions.<br/><br/>The romance was tedious this time and the action sequences felt more like dramatic/ kitsch oriented situations. OK, so Jacob being the wolf had a special meaning but why showing it frowning in sadness?. I know it's a teenagers in love oriented film, but some rough PG-13 situations wouldn't harm.<br/><br/>The visuals were not as spectacular in the original, and I didn't see interesting art direction or cinematography. There wasn't improvement over the production values. But I must say that the San Marcos procession was really good.<br/><br/>Then, what was the intention of showing Bella's almost suicidal tendencies just because her vampire boyfriend left her? I didn't buy her almost fanatic love for Edward.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is really pretty and candy for the eye but her performance felt wooden and inexpressive. I didn't buy it. Robert Pattinson was a cold act all the time, I didn't think he managed to perform a decent performance. Taylor Lautern was very expressive with his facial expressions and was in my opinion the best thing bout the movie. Same goes for pretty-barbie look alike Dakota Fanning.<br/><br/>Alice was a fresh character and added some funny moments (like calling Jacob a dog). I wanted to see more from Rosalie Hale, not only because she's hot! The vampire trio of leaders was interesting and added creepy moments but it wasn't truly explored.<br/><br/>The vampiric situations weren't interesting and I expected to see more from the Cullens.<br/><br/>Having read my opinions, you can see I expected a lot from an incomplete product that officially ended my intentions to become a fan or follower at least of the saga.<br/><br/>So I guess we have to wait until ""Eclipse"" for having ""real"" action and emotions.<br/><br/>""New Moon"" is just a cash in occurrence. It served only as a transition phase for the third movie. Ugh."

"SebaZava","4","7","10","30 November 2009"," Only to be enjoyed by tween girls and die-hard fans.
","Die-hard fans of the Twilight novels and movies won't be reading this review. Or at least, they are not my target demographic. People reading this review are probably like me - guys - and maybe girls - who haven't read the series of novels written by Stephanie Meyer and who watch the films from a very neutral point of view. We watch these movies precisely as stand-alone films, and not as adaptations of our favorite novels featuring our favorite characters and our favorite scenes. I don't know how well adapted Twilight was - all I know it was a very mediocre motion picture -, which means I haven't watched New Moon with specific expectations. All I wanted was to watch something mildly entertaining and hopefully better than the last installment.<br/><br/>Well, now that I have watched the film, all I can say is that, as a professionally-produced motion picture, NOT as an adaptation of some novel I have not read, New Moon is mediocre. Not good, certainly not god-awful, but just painfully mediocre.<br/><br/>If the performances in Twilight were just bearable, then the ones in New Moon are simply god-awful. Although the romance between Bella and Edward wasn't particularly credible in the first movie, at least there was some palpable chemistry between the lead actors that helped the audience relate to their supposed love - a kind of chemistry that is unfortunately absent in this film. And it's not only that - Robert Pattinson plays Edward like a mannequin and appears for about 20% of the movie's running time, and Stewart's Bella is nothing more than a useless, crying girl who doesn't seem to know how to live without a man by her side. If Twilight showed that women could be chauvinistic too, then New Moon conveys a very backward, old-fashioned and stupid view of love and relationships.<br/><br/>At least some of the actors are competent. Taylor Lautner's Jacob is a thousand times more charismatic, interesting and lively than Edward, which means a romance between himself and Bella would be much more satisfying both character-wise and plot-wise. (I somehow sense this won't be the case, though.) I'm not saying Lautner is a good actor, but at least he's got some screen presence and tries to develop his character more than the stiffer-than-a-tree Pattinson. Secondary actors are not very important, the only standout being the great Michael Sheen, who is suitably disturbing and scary as the leader of the vampire royalty.<br/><br/>Speaking of vampires - I have no clue why Meyer decided to call this overly-sentimental and whining monsters ""vampires"". True, they do drink blood and are immortal, but they also lack fangs, screen presence, charisma and, most importantly, they are not scary at all. But don't get me started on the most laughable concept Meyer introduced to the vampire mythos - that of the creatures shining or sparkling when exposed to light. Why the hell would this make sense? It looks laughable on screen - and I'm pretty sure it doesn't fare any better on the written page - and it makes these so-called ""vampires"" look even more ridiculous. Actually, James Berardinelli, one of my favorite on-line critics, has a perfect name for these guys: VINO. (Vampires In Name Only.) At least the movie looks better than its predecessor, although that doesn't mean it's got a more competent director in the form of Chris Weitz. (I suspect it's got more to do with budget.) Special effects are OK, I guess - the wolf pack - especially Jacob - look good when in animal form, and some of the blue screen work is pretty decent. Certainly nothing groundbreaking - but who cares? It's not like all the tween girls and moms who have allowed the movie to break a gazzillion box office records care about the action or the visual effects. All they want is to see their favorite characters on screen reciting some awful dialogue - most of which was extracted verbatim from Meyer's novel - and showing off their biceps. I admit it was pretty amusing to see all the hormonal girls shouting in the middle of the movie theatre every time Jacob took out his shirt and started posing like a gay porn star.<br/><br/>Like I said in the beginning, this review is for those who know very little about the Twilight saga - ""Twi-hards"" certainly won't care about what I have to say, nor will they care about the lackluster screenplay, the mediocre special effects or the horrible acting. The thing is, movies are supposed to be for everyone, something that becomes even more poignant when talking about adaptations - the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter films are as successful as they are because they can be enjoyed by die-hard fans and newbies alike. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the Twilight films. Hopefully, this will change once we get to see David Slade's vision of Meyer's story - I'm pretty sure a decent director like him will at least try to do something remotely interesting with this set of - at least until now - boring and brooding characters."

","The first (Twilight) was at best, average. This one would have been better if not for too many reasons. The only positive parts I can remember are The werewolf pack (apart from when they went all gay (mush like turning the vampires into diamond necklaces instead of burning them up as in the first movie) and felt the need to protect humankind from the nasty vampires) and Victoria's chase. Edward... well Captain Boring would have been a more adequate name, then there's suicidal Bella... (Wooooaaah exciting NOT!).<br/><br/>Now take the film, take out the repetitive use of the word ""Bella"" and that must bring it down to close to half an hour, not since X-men have I felt the urge to start counting because of over-usage.<br/><br/>My wife and daughters are big fans and I don't see why anyone can invest so much time in these movies. I believe the fans are called Twihards.... hmmm going by the movies I think Twits would be more appropriate!<br/><br/>It's quite a shame really as i'm sure there is a decent story there somewhere....<br/><br/>At best I felt the urge to call our next daughter Bella."
"Quinoa1984","2","18","32","24 November 2009"," a momentary blight on good storytelling, vampires, and other things
","Watching the sequel to Twilight, New Moon, is like looking into a dark, scary vortex. Not because the movie is scary or the director creates a compelling mood or the characters are particularly creepy (at least in the way intended). Heavens, no. It's the vortex of a cinematic nightmare of unintentional hilarity tinged with boredom, a romance movie with no touching romance, a horror movie with no horror, a love story without the love - or, rather, there is love, but it's the kind that speaks to a time before the feminist movement actually did things meaningful. And the characters have no concerns, nothing that interests them or makes them anything outside of their one-dimensional (if that) parameters, aside from the push-pull bond with Bella, and some kind of organization called the Voldroi or something. Even the aspect of 'vampires' and 'werewolves' becomes bunk. This is PG-13 non-sex nonsense porn of a high order.<br/><br/>The film picks up right where the first left off, a couple of months later and Bella and Edward are still together, dating and being all snug together, until at Bella's 18th birthday party she has a paper-cut and this sets off Edward's other hungry vampire relatives. So, because of this incident, he says he's leaving with the rest of the Cullen vampire family, without Bella. Why he does this entirely is made only by mild sense- mild being mumbling in the woods about ""You're not good for me, I can't be near you, blah blah"", and this, of course, sends Bella into a tailspin. For three months she just stares out her window doing nothing except moping and having screaming-dream fits. This changes when she reconnects with the local Indian guy with the six-pack abs (believe me, they're shown quite often), who, as it turns out, is a werewolf.<br/><br/>And other things happen too, like lots of ""adrenaline junkie"" scenes like Bella jumping off a cliff, and (badly) riding a motorcycle, and then a whole big preposterous climax in Rome where the vampire council is meeting and more things happen like fates decided and yada yada. In New Moon there's a new director for all of this, Chris Weitz, and unlike Catherine Hardwicke he doesn't put a light blue sheen over the movie but makes it look just regular-tinted... this is probably his only real positive contribution. It's not that his direction is of the completely mind-boggling or cine-vomit variety of Michael Bay. Albeit, I must note, that his skills at direction action set-pieces is atrocious (in that slow-FAST-slow-slow-FAST-slow motion makes me pine for Zack Snyder's 300) and his creative decisions with the camera like Bela's waiting for three months (the 360 camera spin with title cards saying the month in case *outside the window seasons change* didn't clarify it) or just the blurry appearances of Edward in front of Bela to give her advice when he's not there, are haphazard at best.<br/><br/>No, what makes this a badly directed film, most of all, is how he treats the script and his actors. This script, coming from a book by hack Stephanie Meyer, is just about the dumbest, mind-numbing and bloodless (no pun intended.. OK, some) from this year's lot of bad movies. Characters look and talk to each other without chemistry or anything that really makes them believable past their necessary stereotypes. Let's see; Bela: stuck-up and, to put it lightly, 'moody' girl with an obsession and without any direction aside from her crush; Edward: subtly (or just) psychologically abusive, without personality except for a crappy emo-kid imitation by Rob Pattinson; Jake: caring boyfriend-type whose face barely ever changes its expression, though a mullet was apparently harmed during the making of this movie. And the words given to them to speak ranges from hilariously stupid (so much so that you'll be laughing so much inside you may just cry) to painfully dull.<br/><br/>New Moon, unless you're already a die-hard with the books, or someone who takes in hackneyed romance seriously, is actually quite boring for much of the time. This, too, was a huge problem with the first Twilight film, and in this case it kind of sneaks up on you. Watching scenes go by, particularly in the mid-section when hairless boys aren't transforming in a nano-second into werewolves and having fights- where's Rick Baker when you need him (?) oh, wait, he got a call on the common sense train to not get anywhere near it- there isn't much going on in terms of a developing story or characters that grow at all. By the end of the film all we get is where things were at the start of the film, only with the teaser (spoiler) that Edward and Bela may get married (!) And it cuts to black just to get an audience full of helpless girls and older women clamoring for more.<br/><br/>The acting is stiff, the characters are depressive idiots and the craftsmanship from the cinematography to the music to everything else is bargain basement gussied up for a big-time blockbuster. There are two ""teams"" for this movie, and no I don't mean the ""Team Jake"" ""Team Edward"" teams, silly gooses. There's the team of people who go for this sleazy and demoralizing claptrap, and those who don't. Suffice to say, I don't. At all. Cuss this franchise!"

","Kristin Stewart can not act...I realized that in Twilight. And because she can not act, she spoils every scene she's in. And the scripts should have given more lines and scenes to Billy Burke, her dad, and to Graham Green, two fine actors. The other actors in the two films must have rolled their eyes as they tried to interact with her or watch her...very painful. Read Roger Ebert's reviews of the two films--hilarious observations. For their third installment, let's hope Stewart has a firm director who can pull some type of performance out of her that resembles a living person, one with more than her limited expressions and mumbling delivery."
"CaterpillarEffect","2","8","12","4 December 2009"," Ridiculous. Extremely disappointing.
","I have never been this disappointed in my life. <br/><br/>I am female. I'm a teenager. I have read the books, and I'm okay with them, bit of soppy, kitsch fiction never hurt anyone, eh? Saw Twilight before reading the books, thought it was great at first, then read them and had time to analyse the film. Got to the conclusion it was pretty bad. The only things that saved it for me were Carter Burwell and Catherine Hardwicke.<br/><br/>I only watched New Moon to compare it to the books and Twilight, and all the reviews I was reading. Many of my Twilight-mad friends had seen it and loved it. Fair enough, I will find a way to watch it without wasting my money on it.<br/><br/>I found it, I watched it. I don't even remember half of it; it didn't pull me in at all. The actors had obviously learnt their lines very well, but unfortunately could not master the part called 'show (adequate) emotion when saying your lines'. The characters were almost drained of any emotion whatsoever, just like Edward Cullen of his humane colour throughout most of the film.<br/><br/>The film started off in a similar way to Twilight, and the books-monologue from Bella and all that. Unfortunately, this time it was even worse than in Twilight. Phlegmatic seems like the adequate word for any dialogue coming from Kristen Stewart, especially that wretched monologue. <br/><br/>After Bella's nightmare, we go on to the real world. Here, I saw Billy Burke as a rather convincing Charlie. Some emotion from his character can be felt, and he behaves quite naturally, not over the top. <br/><br/>Bella goes to school-meets friends. The four actors playing Mike, Eric, Angela and Jessica did a pretty good job here, and in Twilight. Believable, realistic. Nothing forced.<br/><br/>Enter Edward with his perfect strut in his icy-cold glory. I could imagine the fan girls dribbling at this point. First conversation between Edward and Bella so far in the real world of the film. They kind of pulled it off here, even though I wasn't impressed.<br/><br/>We are then met by Alice and Jasper. Jackson Rathbone gets to deliver one line, which doesn't take much effort, but he doesn't do it half bad. Alice, on the other hand, I don't know what to say. Over the top, but that's the character of Alice. I think Ashley Greene tries too hard to deliver the lines Alice-style. It just ends up fake and again, unrealistic. But how realistic is a pixyish vampire<br/><br/>Birthday party and one of the two occasions where we meet the Cullens throughout the film. The only two that deliver their lines on an acceptable level are Kellan Lutz as Emmett and Peter Facinelli and Carlisle. They make their character quite likable, especially Facinelli. <br/><br/>Then go on to break up. Awkward. I just wanted them to get on with it and save me the pain of watching it. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>For there on not much to say. It's all pretty bad. There seems to be no actual plot, just a story. Kristen delivers all her lines in the same way, her expression changes based on if she's frowning r not. Taylor Lautner plays Jacob better than I expected him to, he does appear rather stiff in delivery from the point where he's joined the pack, but overall not bad.<br/><br/>The pack were okay, didn't get that much screen time, so I'm not going to judge. The makers could have concentrated slightly more on them, but limited time means getting rid of the parts of a lesser importance. The wolves were, umjust wolves I guess. Nothing that would necessarily impress me or make my jaw drop.<br/><br/>Will now skip to the end and the Volturi. The actors cast for the roles of the royal family' were perfect. Doubted that Dakota Fanning would manage to bring the book Jane to life, but she managed. I was not too happy about Jamie Campbell Bower though. He ruined the Volturi for me. Again, line delivery rather poor, and he just didn't exactly fit the role. Fight scene? OK. Again, not jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>Two things actually made me laugh. One was Jane, Felix, Demetri, Alice, Bella and Edward in the elevator (was that in the book? I think I might've missed it), it made me think of awkward rom-com moments in lifts, or TV adverts. The other thing was Alice's vision of Bella being a vampire. Edward and Bella skipping along. So amazingly cheesy, and completely unfitting, from my point of view.<br/><br/>I want those two hours of my life back. It was bad, bad, bad. The only good points were Billy Burke, Peter Facinelli and Kellan Lutz at one point in the film, Taylor Lautner, for half of the film, and the Volturi, excluding Jamie Campbell Bower who made me want to grab a pair of scissors and cut him out of the screen. Also the score didn't impress me, neither did the soundtrack. The score of the first film matched the action very well, and it got to you. It made you feel a part of the action, even without the film in front of you. Here, the music was almost unnoticeable, and it didn't match what was happening at all. <br/><br/>Since I saw a positive in the film, I will settle for two instead of one star."

","Now, I understand that this movie is a fiction and it is about vampires and werewolves. So I'm not going to question anything in relation to the story itself.<br/><br/>The only thing I liked about New Moon is Jacob's and his friend's transformation into wolves, and the fact that they were topless almost the whole movie. And Charlie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, even Jacob's body can't save this movie. It is excruciatingly BORING. I understand that in a trilogy, the 2nd installment is normally slower but again, I am not questioning the story. It's the bad acting, the delivery of the lines, the lack of feeling that frustrates me. Bella's expression is the same throughout the movie. Bella and Edward don't appear as if they are in love at all. Way too many unnecessary pauses especially from the main characters, can't they speak properly? Bella's 'nightmares' were way too often they become irritating. I was head over heels with Edward in Twilight, but in New Moon, his facial expression is tiring it made me rolled my eyes!<br/><br/>I haven't read the books and do not intend to. But I wonder if this girl Bella is as selfish and ungrateful in the books (the way she treated her dad and Jacob)...all because of her love for Edward. I'm not saying that she should reciprocate Jacob's feelings simply because he was her shoulder to cry on, but how can she simply shove him aside whenever there's a Cullen around. From my point of view, she used him and dumped him..so much for a best friend. She doesn't even care for her father's feeling.<br/><br/>I thought Twilight was okay, could have been better with additional fighting scenes, but New Moon was a waste of time."

","I took my students to see this movie last night. Well, I had no expectations for it. They, on the other hand, were hysterically impatient. There wasn't any moment I could say I enjoyed. All the action was pretty lame. The female main character can easily drives anyone crazy (in the bad way). The way she asks to be bitten by the vampires is just ridiculous. She sounded like a whore asking for money. The story is confusing and boring at the same time. My rating for it is very fair, at my point of view. I'd definitely recommend you to keep yourself away from it, unless you want to get bored, waste money and 2 hours of your precious time.<br/><br/>Peace."

","Many comments mentioned that the bad reviews are generated from competitive studios that envy Summit for the production of this, I can't call it a movie. But the movie is really awful!! and trust me, i am not close to this industry more than the cinema screen.<br/><br/>We went as a group of friends to watch it with low expectations due the general feedback about it. The title on the screen took 30 seconds to go, taking all the time they need. All people are excited, applause at the start. Eventually, Black berry chatting started and people were falling one by one, defeated!! What makes this movie bad is the directing, editing, music and the most important is the acting. The editing at the end of the movie is so bad. It took 3 minutes of the movie time to know that Edward wants to kill himself till Bella save him!!! but the worse part, goes to casting Kristen Stewart. God, what is wrong with that girl. She is half asleep during the premiere show, as if she is on drugs!! In the whole movie, her reaction is either blinking with her eyes, or the hard breath taking. Furthermore, what's with the nightmare screams?? she is having a nightmare, not delivering a baby!!! here it is Chris fault.<br/><br/>Shifting to the romantic and drama scenes, that's my favorite. Kristen and Robert should be nominated for Razzie awards. They will win it because the voting for them will be the same rush people are rushing to watch this garbage.<br/><br/>If there is a law for bad movies, we should file a fraud case against summit to get our money back and compensation for the 2 hours lost of our life, ""As if they never existed""..."

","Thought Chris Weitz was a far better director than Hardwicke. Enjoyed the film, set up for Eclipse quite nicely. This review is probably more of a response to others negative reviews:<br/><br/>Yes, it is cheesy, and goofy at times, but hello! The writing in the book isn't that great either! And I'm a fan! This is not a vampire movie in the sense of, ""I've come to suck your blood!"" This is based on a fantasy book whose main characters are vampires, and gives a different idea of what that mythical creature could be like. I think given the story they did a great job. It is definitely a bit different than the book, but if you don't expect that by now, you need a reality check. There were a few scenes that seemed.. choppy. As if they were missing something. I would definitely watch it again, and look forward to owning it on DVD."

","I do not walk out of the movies until a movie is done... except for Twilight II: Cloudy with a Chance of Idiots.<br/><br/>From start to finish this movie never ceased to keep me in a state of perplexed awe, from the beginning scene, to the over-glorification of the entrance of Robert Pattinson, to the incessant spinning of the camera, to more and more useless one-liners such as: <br/><br/>""Hey Jake you're so warm, it's like you're your own sun.""<br/><br/>This movie has proved that there was something that could possibly come close to sucking as much as ""I Know Who Killed Me"" (a movie which I'd rather been beaten with a lead pipe into concussion than see).<br/><br/>With that said, here's the story in a nutshell:<br/><br/>-Emotionless vampire leaves girl for no reason. -Tells her to not do dangerous things, yet only appears to her when she does dangerous things (moron) -She hits up her friend and coaxes him into building her two near-death machines -She meets a black guy in the woods. -Black guy dies -About a half hour of meaningless, emotionless, interaction between her and her friend. -More self-pity about the situation with her ex, who could care less anyhow. -Stephenie Meyer is allowed to continue her full-on mutilation of everything I've ever known of Hollywood vampires, turning them into emotionless high school-ers that transform into emotionless high school-ers with what would appear to be body glitter, much like that a stripper wears.<br/><br/>That was where I walked out, with 15 minutes left of the movie, I realized that these fifteen minutes may very well be way too much for me to handle, and I do not regret that decision whatsoever."

","Why this movie was made? I don't know. Why these books were even written? I don't know. Why this movie made so much money at the box office? I still don't know. The point is, I don't see what the whole fuss is about. <br/><br/>Let me start off with the acting. Kirsten Stewart, who plays Bella, looked like she was about to fall asleep on screen. Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward, was like an emotionless alien, like in the first one. I think Taylor Lautner wasn't paid to star in this movie, and was paid to show off his muscular physique. Even though he seems like a nice guy in real life, his acting in this was bland, and during the second half of the movie, he was acting like an obsessive stalker.<br/><br/>The vampires in these movies don't even have sharp fangs. The ones in movies like 30 Days of Night and Bram Stoker's Dracula are real vampires, because they don't sparkle in the sun or whine about their feelings. I was unimpressed with the werewolves because they were hardly in it, and they weren't very impressive looking. The ones in movies like Ginger Snaps and the Howling are real werewolves, but these weren't very brutal or vicious as werewolves should be.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a pile of crud and deserves to be unwatched by everyone, and they should've had Buffy or Blade come in to slay the Cullens. It's a vampire romance film, and I would say watch ""Let the Right One In"" instead and it has vampires and werewolves feuding against each other, but I would say watch the Underworld movies instead.<br/><br/>Rating: 3/10"

"hulahoopwounds","8","44","90","21 November 2009"," Watch it, don't scrutinise it.
","I'm not a serious 'twi-hard' fan, I only got into the whole thing in the summer. I put off reading the books because of the hype, I didn't want to jump on the band waggon. Four or five days and Breaking Dawn later, I can sympathise with the hype. The books after fantastic, even as a 22 year old female, they take you back to childhood fantasy, romance, lust and love. <br/><br/>I of course watched Twilight, pretty much after I'd finished reading the book and loved it, it was fantastic seeing the pages of the book come to life. Yes the acting wasn't great, and some of the direction and script didn't really fit, but it was good. I watched it for what it was, a film, not a scene by scene take on how much it fitted the book. <br/><br/>For New Moon I did exactly the same, went to our midnight showing with an open mind. I didn't think ""I hope the put this bit in, or this bit or this"". The film is derived from a book, a book and a film are two completely separate things, this is something I think a lot of people are forgetting. Bearing this in mind, I was extremely impressed by New Moon. <br/><br/>My first big thumbs up was the direction, Chris Weitz has done a fantastic job. The cinematography, the locations, the colours, the soundtrack in particular were all just brilliant and fitted the film superbly. I actually think it stuck to the book a great deal more than a) I thought it would and b) Twilight did, but I do think you have to have a prior understanding of the whole thing. I can totally understand why somethings were left out, and some added too, like I said before if it was done page by page, it would probably be long, slow and un- enjoyable. I think New Moon is a more mature film, as in Twilight was a younger more inexperienced sibling, while New Moon is the well developed older brother. <br/><br/>I honestly loved every second of the film, and couldn't believe when it was finally over. I don't think I've ever sat through a film with such a roller coaster of emotions, my heart pounded and bled, I shed tears and held my breath, which proves that all aspects of the film came together, flowed and captivated the mind. The actors I think have matured, especially Kirstend Stewart, she was just totally brilliant and I really connected with her, as I did with Bella in the book. <br/><br/>All in all, I loved New Moon and am slightly annoyed it has only received 4.2 on IMDb. I know for a fact the people who gave it such a low rating will be the sceptics who hate Twilight. Also, I cannot wait for this to be released on DVD, watching it with in the comfort of my own room, as sitting in a theatre full of serious Twilighter going ooooo and ahhhh every time Edward was on screen or Jacob was topless ruined it slightly."
"boxman-3","3","9","14","8 December 2009"," I'm pretty sure I hate Bella Swan
","Posted at www.pictureshowpundits.com<br/><br/>Admittedly, I am not a fan of the Twilight series. I have never read one of the books but I didn't hate the first Twilight movie. I thought it kind of worked on its own merits even if it wasn't for me. However, New Moon is a crushing bore and a mess.<br/><br/>I can precisely indicate where everything goes wrong for the abysmal New Moon – the character of Bella Swan. For the majority of this sequel, I didn't just detest and dislike her I downright hated her. I hated her. I understand her appeal to the millions of Stephenie Meyer's literary acolytes, but man does she come across as a self-centered, casually cruel, messed up girl who spends most of her time being whiny, mopey, and sulky. It's not just that she has a guy interested in her, it's the absurd notion that every man cannot get enough of this sullen gal. As presented in New Moon, Bella is such a dour and lifeless personality. I cannot see whatsoever why she is worth such effort. This criticism may be tracked all the way to Meyer's source material, making Bella absent in defining character dynamics expressly so pre-teen readers can insert themselves as the character and swoon over being the object of universal desire. It is insultingly thin wish fulfillment that this girl has every man, vampire, and werewolf fighting over her in the Pacific Northwest. After Edward leaves, she shuts herself out and rejects all her friends. We see in one camera pan that she spends literal months in a stupor. I understand that teenagers think everything is the end of the world, but she and Edward were together for, what, a few months? Then again, heartache is something that knows no exact time frame for healing, so consider this but a quibble. Bella seems to push others away except when she needs a set of ears to whine.<br/><br/>It is post-Edward where Bella becomes insular, self-centered in her pursuit of danger placing herself in stupidly reckless scenarios, and hurtful. Where Bella really infuriated me is her treatment of her lifelong friend, Jacob. Obviously the big guy has a thing for her and she knows this, which allows Bella to string Jacob along for almost a whole movie. She leads this little doggie along, teasing him with a ""Maybe I will be with you, maybe I won't"" dance that becomes irritating and rather loathsome. Jacob is a swell guy who has looked out for Bella from day one, accepted her coupling with a vampire, sworn enemy of werewolves, and he's been the best listener to all her self-involved drama. Plus this guy is ripped and has hip flexors that could cut glass. And he is there for her and didn't abandon her like Edward. So Bella toys with her self-described ""best friend"" until she can hear the word ""Edward"" and then she can think about nothing else, even after months of complete separation. I understand that Edward has the sexy, brooding, bad boy appeal, where women think they will magically be the key ingredient to change the troubled man for the better. But on the flip side, Jacob thinks he's the key ingredient to finally get Bella to commit to a healthy relationship, and he gets screwed. Seriously, what's the worse thing about dating a werewolf? You may have to take him for more walks. I suppose this makes me sound like I'm on Team Jacob, as the fans call themselves. I'm really on Team Bella Deserves to be Alone.<br/><br/>What also sinks New Moon is how it repeats the same plot from Twilight. Once again Bella feels alone, she finds comfort in a boy that says they can't be together, this intrigues her and pushes her into action, she's warned of danger, and then finally she settles in with a pseudo relationship with a supernatural stud who makes blanket promises like ""I'll always protect you,"" and, ""I'll never let anything happen to you."" It's not complex folks; Meyer is just feeding pre-teen girls their fantasy of a male romantic interest. Because of this repetitious plot structure, very little of substance happens during the overlong 130 minutes of New Moon. Bella kinda sorta almost gets involved with a werewolf, there's some lousy Romeo and Juliet allusions, and thanks to a delightfully hammy Michael Sheen (Frost/Nixon, The Queen), we learn a little bit about what makes Bella special to the world of vampires (it's telling that her ""specialty"" is her lack of reaction). Beyond that, this is two hours of posturing and some gratuitous beefcake shots of shirtless men. My theater was sold out and packed with the Twilight faithful who swooned when they saw Edward strutting in slow-mo and openly hollering in approval when Jacob first whipped off his shirt. For supernatural creatures, they do more brooding than anything.<br/><br/>The plot of New Moon is a shadow of the first film, the main character is annoying and hard to sympathize with, there's so little of consequence that happens, it's way too long, and, oh yeah, did I mention how much I disliked Bella Swan? At this point, the Twilight franchise is a juggernaut that cannot be contained (as I write this it's poised to make over $70 million on opening day) and the Twi-hards will find the movie to be catnip, swooning at their visualized male sex objects. For anyone outside the cult of Twilight, the movie version of New Moon will fail to communicate the appeal of the series. The movie feels bloodless. Twilight is like a tedious soap opera scrubbed clean of teenage hormones. I think I'll stick with HBO's True Blood, a more nuanced, adult, sexy, and just plain fun series following vampire-human love. Bella could learn plenty from Sookie Stackhouse, least of all how to be interesting."

"blawson2010","2","9","14","3 December 2009"," Dead acting and empty dialogue brings in the big bucks
","Last Friday tween girls flooded movie theaters across America to catch the release of the next installment of the Twilight Saga, New Moon.<br/><br/>In this chapter of the series Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, breaks off his relationship with Bella, Kirsten Stewart, to protect her from himself and his vampire family. The only thing Bella can find to comfort her is seeking out danger with her childhood friend Jacob Black, played by Taylor Lautner, who ends up being a werewolf.<br/><br/>Most of the time Stewart was on screen she looked like she didn't want to be there. She couldn't seem to generate enough emotion for her part in the movie. <br/><br/>Pattinson followed the same suit as Stewart but he did manage to master brooding, which he appeared to do most of the little time he was on screen. Also his character was supposed to be attractive but so much makeup was put on him to stress his vampire- paleness he looked like a drug addict with good hair.<br/><br/>Pattinson and Stewart's characters were supposed to be passionately in love but the actors looked awkward and uncomfortable together. Their dialogue felt empty and looks that were intended to be intense and passionate seemed vacant. <br/><br/>Lautner played his character better; he made Jacob Black a likable person. He had some solid comedic moments but wasn't up to par in the emotional scenes.<br/><br/>The plot itself is not presented well. The movie is dry and slow for the most part. When an important moment does happen it is too quick and not completely explained. Someone who has not read the books might not completely understand what happened at the movie's climax or other plot turning points.<br/><br/>The movie itself was pretty hollow and superficial. The film is supposed to convey a great love story but it lacked meaning. It was hard to like the characters. Director, Chris Weitz, seemed to care more about putting shirtless boys on screen than character development.<br/><br/>The best part about the movie was its soundtrack. Every song chosen set the right tone at the right moment.<br/><br/>In short, if you are looking for a meaningless but flashy movie featuring vampires, werewolves and lots of shirtless boys then New Moon is for you. But if you are looking for an engaging plot and talented acting and directing then you should stay as far away from this movie as possible."

I understand that books-to-film are never anywhere near as good, but I think they could have casted two main leads to more interesting people. I have never appreciated the acting skills, or lack thereof, of Ms. Stewart and these movies prove why. <br/><br/>I hope that the director and all the other people involved with the making of this popular series reads up on the comments left by the public and try to make some positive changes to the next movie."

To protect her, Edward decides to end their relationship, and the Cullens move away from Forks. This leaves Bella heart-broken and depressed. In the months that follow, Bella learns that thrill-seeking activities, such as motorcycle riding, allow her to ""hear"" Edward's voice in her head. She also seeks comfort in her deepening friendship with Jacob Black, a cheerful companion who eases her pain over losing Edward. Bella later discovers that Jacob is a werewolf. He and his fellow werewolves protect Bella from the vampires Laurent and Victoria, the latter of whom seeks revenge for her dead mate, James, whom the Cullens killed in Twilight. Meanwhile, a series of miscommunications leads Edward to believe that Bella has killed herself. Distraught over her supposed suicide, Edward flees to Italy to provoke the Volturi, vampire royalty who are capable of killing him. Alice and Bella rush to Italy to save Edward, arriving just in time to stop him. Before leaving Italy, the Volturi tell Edward that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire. When they return to Forks, Edward tells Bella that he has always loved her and only left Forks to protect her. She forgives him, and the Cullens vote in favor of Bella being transformed into a vampire, to Edward's dismay.

When I awoke, it didn't seem like I had missed much at all. I was able to pick up wherever it was that I left off (I was told that I missed about 10-15 minutes). In my opinion, the Bella and Edward figures seemed like nothing more than Hollywood posers, ready for the red carpet. Weren't they supposed to be so passionate about each other that they were contemplating soul shattering sacrifices for the sake of their love? I didn't see anything like that at all. They both seemed like stick people. If the books are anything like the movie, I think I'll find something better to read."

","I usually don't give much sway to user ratings, this time however i wished I'd listened. The first movie was, much to my surprise, very enjoyable. It had a good plot and a couple of moments of genuine suspense. This one has neither. I don't know how they managed to get the actors together with a two page script. Nothing happens. We discover the werewolves who don't do anything. They spend an entire movie chasing after one vampire with no success. Bella does even less, her actions are limited to being depressed and stopping Edward from killing himself. That's it, that's the entire story.<br/><br/>The entire thing does nothing but promise future conflict. It's a trailer for the next two."

","I went to see New Moon this morning and got exactly what I was expecting: not much.<br/><br/>I haven't read any of the books and HATE it when people remind me of that when I talk about these films. I hate it, because it makes no sense whatsoever. Why? Because that's EXACTLY why I *AM* in a good position to rate these movies as their own right as they SHOULD be reviewed and NOT as an adaptation! And they suck, because they're boring, corny, utterly cheesy and just plain stupid.<br/><br/>The actors look fittingly bored the whole time and it's no wonder when you consider the moronic dialogue of a garbage they have to spill out with a straight face. And the less said about the shirtlesness the better.. ""oh look, Bella has a teeny weeny cut on her forehead. What would make her feel better? I know, I'll take my shirt off."" The only good thing about New Moon were the wolves. They looked cool, largely thanks to their massive size which made them genuinely a bit threatening. That's really pretty much it. Garbage and a waste of time.<br/><br/>Next time a woman complains to me about films like American Pie (and yes, I am aware of the coincidence of these films having the same director) objectifying women, I'll throw The Twilight Saga right in their hypocritic face and tell them to shut up right then and there.

New Moon was the least favorite of the book series for me, but the acting was fantastic by the three leads. Kristen captured all the emotions perfectly. Taylor really stepped into the limelight to take a leading role in this movie. And Robert Pattinson--plays the tortured vampire to a T. Loved it! In regards to some of the critics reviews being poor--cranky old men just don't ""get it"", and it sucks that they are in a position that people will hang on what they say.

"honorhorror","7","57","122","19 November 2009"," Warning: this is not a fan-boy's review.
","Have to say, New Moon the most anticipated romance tale of the year, is decently made. So allow me, a non-fan of the series to make this comment.<br/><br/>First off, I know people hated it for what it is. The whole idea is like a coming-of-age story of several abnormal kids. I know it's a homage to Shakespeare; and I definitely noticed the similarity with Underworld series it began to show. But I also have to say that sometimes people hate it because they assume it's stupid, and despised the puppy love illustrated in such a fantasy scenario. But, it's the film-making that grabbed my attention.<br/><br/>Throughout, New Moon demonstrates with superb pacing, sophisticated art design that overflowing with the whole story, and smooth special visual effects that well fit in. For a standard Hollywood production it should be like this, but allow me to say it adds points to the whole experience. It's not a movie you'd expect an awful lot of actions in it, but believe me you will see plenty of compelling actions that keep you entertained if not delighted. Some scenes are like TV-commercials, but allow me to say they are a lot more beautiful and more genuine than those outrageous built-in advertisements in ""2012"" or so.<br/><br/>The other aspect I'd like to give a nod, is the professional attitude of the whole production. The story is about a bunch of teenagers, but the movie never fell amateurish or video-game-like. The actors all fit into their roles naturally, and again allow me to say there was not anything in performances amateurish or in-genuine enough to distract me from the story. Of course the movie is not Oscar-level, but it successfully captured the youngsters' ignorance, arrogance and all kinds of struggles between immaturity and responsibility. Shouldn't we be a bit more open to teenagers? I am not saying this movie is perfect in doing politics right, but it's not bad for a family ride that can make chances for some family talk.<br/><br/>So, 7/10 is a fair score given the movie is not Oscar stuff, but admit it that so many people just gave it a 1 even before they see it."
"jon.h.ochiai","6","17","31","22 November 2009"," Dim ""New Moon""
","Ironically in ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) watch a movie of ""Romeo and Juliet"". Edward eloquently recites a passage from Shakespeare when called upon by his English teacher. Like ""Romeo and Juliet"" what had made ""Twilight"" so captivating the first time around was the star-crossed romance of Edward and Bella—vampire and mortal. So why does Edward (charismatic Pattinson) disappear during the prolonged middle of the movie? Instead we suffer through shredded Werewolf boy Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and rebounding Bella (Stewart), who have absolutely no chemistry. Granted Lautner bulked up and looks amazing, but he and Stewart have no sparks and this falls completely flat. Pattinson and Stewart have a genuine visceral chemistry which over comes much of the narrative misgivings and often time awkward dialog. Forgoing that for a good hour of the movie is puzzling. It seems like the movie is shooting itself in the foot.<br/><br/>Perhaps, Director Chris Weitz (who replaced Catherine Hardwicke) and Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg are too beholding to the Stephanie Meyer's novel. I never read the ""Twilight"" series novels, but I am guessing this is the case. ""New Moon"" is awful. More precisely it is a horrendous miscalculation, and disappointment. I really liked ""Twilight"" which had a great Gothic romance; about heroes fighting great evil. Here the romance is displaced by the plot line, and the battle between good and powerful evil is ambiguous. Perhaps, again we are just catching Act II of the 5 Act play. None the less, this is not a satisfying experience. Pattinson and Stewart do their best, and almost salvage. However, here they are overwhelmed by the story.<br/><br/>As ""New Moon"" opens Bella celebrates her 18th Birthday. She loves Edward, but fears what happens when she grows old, while he remains forever young. Edward confides to Bella, ""It's my job to protect you."" Bella's birthday celebration at the Cullen's turns horribly wrong, as Jasper (eerie Jackson Rathbone) nearly goes native vampire on Bella, who accidentally sheds her blood. Convinced his being with Bella will do her harm, Edward tells her, ""You're my only reason to stay alive."" He leaves for Italy to the Volturi—Vampire Royalty. He tells Bella, ""This is the last time you will ever see me."" <br/><br/>Distraught Bella falls into depression suffering debilitating nightmares. Edward only appears as Jedi-like ghost attempting to protect his beloved. Slowly Bella pursues a relationship with childhood friend Jacob (Lautner). Jacob himself is going through a transformation—becoming a Werewolf. Recall that Vampire and Werewolves are immortal enemies. New hero Jacob becomes Bella's protector from vengeful vampire. Soon like Edward, Jacob fears he too may inadvertently harm Bella. Bella is forever in love with Edward, and she and his sister Alice (spirited Ashley Green) fly off to rescue Edward, who may be sacrificing his life to the Volturi.<br/><br/>There is neither compelling dramatic arc in ""New Moon"" nor any vanquishing of great evil. This is really disappointing given some of the amazing performances. Michael Sheen manifests a dark presence as Volturi leader Aro. Dakota Fanning is chilling as powerful vampire Jane. Kristen Stewart authentically embodies the anguish and wonder of teenager Bella. Pattinson is powerful and charismatic, but isn't on the screen nearly enough. ""New Moon"" is an unfortunate miscalculation that may correct itself in the next go round. At least one would think so."
"haras2213","2","39","81","18 November 2009"," Disappointing
","Overall I was disappointed, the movie didn't flow it jumped around a lot, many vital bits were missing and why were random bits thrown in, I have read the books and I don't recall a fight happening with the Volturi. the eyes were wrong they were too bright, in the first movie you could see that the Cullens eyes were golden, that James and Victoria's were red and Laurant's were purple, but it didn't stand out, in this film it was the only thing you noticed, and it was very distracting. That is not how the second book ended, Jacob did not turn into a wolf and run away. While I have enjoyed much of Chris Weitz's other work I think that he should stick to a genre that he understands. I think that they need someone more like Catherine Hardwicke to direct the next film, or maybe someone who has read the book and understands the relationships between the characters. And what was with the ending? that is not how the book ended, and if they are going to finish a film with a question like that and leave it hanging, surely it should make me keen to see the next movie to see Bella's response, but I don't, the question was just sort of casually thrown out and you don't even see Bella's reaction, it's like they don;t really care and were throwing bits in to fill the time"
"maykennon-64639","1","4","5","17 April 2015"," This Movie Was Even Worse Than The Original
","I seriously didn't think that it couldn't get any worse. I should never assume what I think would happen.<br/><br/>The characters are still flat and dull. Watching these 'actors' perform these horrible roles makes watching paint dry look amazing. No one gets enough screen time to develop their characters. Which doesn't help this movie. The romance is even worse in this movie. Bella and Edward have no time together building their relationship since all they say to each other is 'i love you' or 'turn me into a vampire'. Bella and Jacob have little bit of chemistry but no enough to start a relationship and plus she doesn't date him but Edward. The love triangle is hardly mentioned and is only shown till the last five minutes of this movie which is what all this fuss has been about. The story is boring, period. All Bella does is mope for most of the movie how Edward isn't with her or trying to figure out what's happening to Jacob. Because of the pacing it's dragged out long. Nothing exciting happens until the third act at break neck speed (just like the last movie). Plus I had tons of questions to ask. How does Alice powers work? Why couldn't she see earlier that Bella would become a vampire so we wouldn't have a pointless action scene? Why do the guys fall for Bella? There's no appeal into her. She has about as much personality as a dead tree stump. They never explain why they love each other.<br/><br/>I know some people say 'Well in the book...' I don't need a book. I shouldn't have to USE a book.I don't need a book on my lap when the movie can't give me the information I need. Harry Potter didn't need me to ask questions because I knew about it. I didn't start reading the books till the second movie and I was caught up with movies enough so that I didn't need questions.<br/><br/>Sorry Twilight fans but this is just terrible."

","I had mixed feelings all the way through this and let me tell you, I tried hard to like it more than I did. To my surprise the first thing I noticed was a kind of role reversal of the two main characters. I actually found Kristen Stewart to be more interesting and likable in this. Not drastically, but she was less robotic than before. A less pleasant surprise was that I found Robert Pattinson to be much less magnetic and intense. He was still effective, with his whole brooding presence thing, but it seemed like they had turned him into a bit of a pouting brooding vampire puppy. Whenever he and Stewart were embracing or something in their scenes together he kept looking like he was gonna cry. It might sound odd, but I went off Mr Patterson a little when I discovered that he was actually British-and my image of him was really shattered when I recalled seeing him before as the campy over-the-top theatrical villain from Harry Potter 2! He's not the man I thought he was. Another mild surprise for me was that I found myself feeling the strong chemistry between the two of them, as opposed to Twilight, where I never did. It must have worked its ""magic"" on me more than I'd known-who knew! But, what the hell, no sooner do I find myself actually enjoying watching the two of them together, than he is whisked away for the main chunk of the film-and then it's enter the Taylor Lautner. Didn't care for him a bit. I didn't like his face, with its smug ear-to-ear grin. He looked like Hillary- f*****g-Swank. I just thought he was an awful character. And I thought it was a heck of a lot to ask of the audience that they accept this, new great supernatural love affair with him based on what, 20 minutes? The guy had nothing on Pattinson. After Edward vanished from the movie I just completely zoned-out and was bored to tears with it.:::2::: They wisely canned the crazy wire-work leaping and bounding and the body glitter was now kept to a minimum, but they had been replaced them with something far worse... The mega- lame, pathetic-looking giant cgi wolves! My goodness, they looked so freaking bad! I mean, the waving of the fur was effective, but what were they thinking?! The things simply looked pitiful, and poor Kristen Stewart frankly looked idiotic and lost running around them in the scenes. The wicked Victorian vampire lady was a welcome return, as she was one of the few things I loved in the first one, although she didn't get to do all that much. She certainly cut an awesome and richly Gothic figure running through that ""twilit"" wood. Sure hope she's as impressive as she looks if they give her a bigger part in the further sequels. My absolute favourite part was when everybody went to the French château- looking place where everyone was celebrating vampire remembrance day or whatever, and they confronted the ancient council of vampire elders in the magnificent cathedral/mausoleum building. I actually loved all of that sequence. It was the tense, knife-edge atmosphere of danger, the various impressive looking new characters that I bet we see again, and mainly for seeing more of the mysterious vampire special powers, like the creepy effeminate guy who could read souls via his icy touch-I found it all most brilliant and enthralling. Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't like that. I liked the unexpected cameos of Cameron Bright and Dakota Fanning! They didn't do anything, but I was seriously liking them in that room. They suited playing ethereal supernatural beings, already looking pretty weird as they do! At the end of that sequence I was surprised again when something honest-to-god horrific happened! It may occur off- screen, but I still thought it was a shocker of a moment. Yeah, that's what vampires actually do, lest we forget! It was a little strange and bugged me a little how quickly the guys left after that happened. I know there wasn't exactly a thing they could do about it, but it felt like: oh, about 40 innocent tourists were just horribly slaughtered but whatever! If you think it's a good idea lover, let's head on home! When push comes to shove, my beau comes first. After that as the movie drew to a close I found myself bored once again. This definitely has its moments, but for me it's just way too slow and glitzy and full of itself, there's too damn many of the endless romantic face montages that I found myself chuckling at. The pretentiousness of this series doesn't bother me, as it's not the hurtful kind. It's so overdone that it becomes something fun to laugh at. This sequel was okay and very enjoyable, but when it was all over I wondered why I had bothered with it. It's shallow, but harmless supernatural teen fun. Not altogether unapproachable if you're not a fan of this kind of thing. Thanks."
"Velociraptor256","4","4","5","26 June 2010"," Far from being the best of 2009, regardless of what the MTV Movie Awards might say
","The first Twilight film, I didn't think was all that bad: in some ways, I actually liked it better than the book. The film adaptation of New Moon, on the other hand, doesn't really work, on multiple levels. <br/><br/>The story itself doesn't flow very well: there are some scenes and dialogue fitted in quite awkwardly, so it feels fragmented. Unlike in the first film, there are occasions where the music really doesn't click with the scene (e.g. when the werewolves are chasing Victoria). And the special effects used with the werewolves are pretty poor compared to other films these days. <br/><br/>The characters are a mixed bag: for example, the werewolf pack are a breath of fresh air compared to the Cullens – they're more proactive and fun, and are pretty enthusiastic about their special powers. On the other end of the scale, while Bella Swan wasn't exactly an all-time-great heroine in the first film, here she's barely tolerable. She becomes ridiculously depressed after Edward leaves her (to the point of screaming in her sleep as though she's being tortured), her interactions with Jacob are unstable to the point that you feel she's leading him on, and when Alice Cullen reappears on the scene, Bella's desperation that she not immediately leave again seems pathetic and needy. <br/><br/>Aside from the werewolves, Bella's school friends, and the always brilliant Michael Sheen as the leader of the Volturi, the acting in this film is bland, bland, bland. Robert Pattinson barely seems to be trying anymore as Edward: he fails to convey much emotion in any of his scenes. Kristen Stewart is just as dull and flat as she was last time. And while Taylor Lautner has some good moments as Jacob, he's not terribly impressive either. <br/><br/>All in all, New Moon is a generally bland film, and unless you're a real fan of the books, I wouldn't recommend it."
"Pegassuswings","5","14","25","22 November 2009"," The problem is the book, not the film
","What do you do when you are forced to put together a movie that should not be made? You do your best to please the fans (i.e. keep the script as close to the original book as possible regardless of whether it all works or not) and you try to get it out of the way as soon as possible so that the next movie in the series, with a much better and interesting storyline, gets released. I don't envy Chris Weitz's job as I don't think I would have been able to successfully turn Meyer's mediocre second book, with a very poor storyline and completely stereotypical characters, into a film I would have been happy with. For this, I have some respect for the director and I spare him in my criticisms of the movie. I think he actually managed to recreate the events narrated in the book quite faithfully and allowed the characters to at least try to develop. The reason why this movie does not completely work is that the director does not have much to work with in the first place and does not have the freedom to improvise as he goes. Let me explain my point. Think for a second what happens in New Moon which makes the book really a must read. Yeah, that's right, the answer is nothing, absolutely nothing. Let's see, we have boy leaves girl, girl gets depressed, girl gets closer to her (really hot and) supportive friend who falls in love with her but boy reappears at the last minute and both are reunited in the end. BORING! Really, really boring; we've seen it before, and we've seen it done much better so there is not much new that New Moon offers to the viewers. What made the first book and movie in the Twilight saga relevant was that they offered a new version of the impossible-love dilemma but that was already explored and dealt with in the first book. So, we are left to deal with Jacob now, it's all about him and the fact that, like Edward, he has a special secret and is in love with Bella. Great, that sounds interesting, so how come the whole thing does not really work in the end? Because, despite having all the ingredients for love to rule again, tragically and unbelievably, the moment when Bella is supposed to succumb to her passion never actually materialises. Oh, Bella, Bella, Bella, you embodiment of all virginal purities of this world, who is going to believe you as a character. You martyr, you angel, you the chosen one to be free from all sins. We would be able to feel warmer to you if you could show us some of your weaknesses as a young teenager. We would be OK if you decided to hate your boyfriend for leaving you without a warning and then give yourself some time off with the werewolf, even if it's just a few smooches one in afternoon after a hard day's work in school. We wouldn't judge you Bella if you decided to go ahead and forget your ex-boyfriend for a few hours because we know that, after all, you are young and you are human. Anything else would be an unrealistic expectation. What could anyone do with such a character to begin with? The lack of a powerful love storyline weakens this second movie which is only partially redeemed by the action scenes in the last twenty minutes or so, but by then some of us have grown bored of the pointless moaning. The potentially interesting plot of Bella finding out that there is somebody out there who could be equally, if not better, for her than Edward is never actually fully explored and the whole hour of interactions between Bella and Jacob is an absolute waste of the paying audience's time. This is not the director's fault but the author's. The corny dialogues and uninteresting characters with no room to show how multidimensional they can be are not Weitz's fault either but Meyer's. <br/><br/>I am glad I watched this movie in the cinema if only to see how the characters I have read about are brought to life, but I don't expect a lot of other people to enjoy it as it suffers from some of the serious clumsiness of the book. I look forward to movie number three with the hope that it will be a better experience all around and I leave with a message to whoever is assigned the job of directing book number four: please don't, it's just not going to work. You've been warned."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","3","14","25","21 November 2009"," Despite bright spots, it's downright terrible. It's time to get a new writer.
","It's hard to believe only a year has gone by since the last Twilight film came out, which is weird, because this summer, I'll be saying something like, ""it's hard to believe only a few months have gone by since the last Twilight film came out"". This is the running joke throughout the entire film. Is Summit's fear of financial collapse so great that they feel they have to churn out these movies as fast as a printing press distributes newspaper? Or is it that they secretly don't have faith in the franchise's long term prospects, making their only blockbuster series unable to truly stand against the heavyweights like Harry, James, and Jack? Whatever the reason, the biggest problem with ""New Moon"" is how rushed it is. Strangely, I've got to hand it to Chris Weitz. Few directors could have handled the production schedule this film probably had, and he's managed to do a better job than his predecessor. That said, another reason I'll give Weitz credit for doing a job well done is his ability to handle what is easily the worst screenplay of the year. At least Street Fighter and Dragonball had heart. There's no passion. Almost every line is a false cliché, something that in the end makes the film one of the funniest of the year, and takes away from people that actually did well on the film.<br/><br/>Before I continue onto the bad, I'll state the good. As far as acting goes, it starts and ends with Taylor Lautner and Michael Sheen. Weitz did a great job as far as picking some crew members, but not all of them. For example, he pulled off a miracle when he got Alexandre Desplat to score this film, and Desplat's score does not disappoint. It out does the first film along with the cinematography, but that's where it stops.<br/><br/>I don't know what happened to Kristen Stewart's ability...I know it's there, but she simply just doesn't care, isn't trying, or is just flat out bored the entire film. I found myself begging her for expression, in between my laughter at almost everything the absurd character of Bella did. I found that one of the strengths of the first film, the slightly charismatic Robert Pattinson, isn't one anymore. His reduced screen time is not to blame, as Pattinson just lost all charm he had before, and he also forgot how to act. I liked Peter Facinelli and Ashley Greene, while Nikki Reed annoyed me. Anna Kendrick's role is still a scene stealer, while I had a hard time determining if Jamie Campbell Bower was a man or a woman, or if he could be any creepier if he tried.<br/><br/>The work of Michael Sheen and Taylor Lautner are two of five good things about this movie. Sheen delivers a delicious turn as Aro, and I enjoyed every minute he spent on screen. By far the best performance from any of the Twilight films. It was the perfect balance of slight scenery chewing mixed with a deliciously devious line delivery, reaffirming him as one of my favorite actors. Lautner is someone I've got to give credit to, mostly because he's not cringeworthy like Stewart and Pattinson (well, until he says a stupid line that's not his fault, but he played the character well), but the main reason that Lautner did a good job was because almost everyone I've talked to sided with his character and liked him better than the main characters. This is the mark of an actor playing a role well. Lautner's physical transformation is also quite impressive, as every female will have no problem saying.<br/><br/>I just can't get my head around how awful Rosenberg's script is. How anyone can include some of the lines that are in here is beyond me. Sure, some of them were probably from the book, but as a writer of film, you have to know what works and what doesn't work. Sure, New Moon has its intentionally funny moments that Weitz inserted to break the serious tone for a bit...But what Weitz and Rosenberg seem to have forgotten is this: because the film is so rushed, the dialog so cringeworthy, the visual effects so terrible, etcetera...New Moon ends up as a parody. The entire beginning of the film, and Jacob and Bella's friendship, plays out like an episode from an MTV reality show, providing laughs for even the most die hard fans of the series (I know this because the entire theater was cracking up whenever Bella would be sad or Jacob took his shirt off for whatever random pointless reason).<br/><br/>What's even more unsettling is the subliminal messages these films send...Bella is willing to give up her soul to be a vampire with Edward, which he refuses to oblige. How can Bella be the role model Meyer and Rosenberg obviously want her to be when she is literally the biggest pushover I've ever seen? Her character is so unbelievably flawed that it's next to impossible to root for her, and it's also next to impossible to see how two actual nice young men fall in love with her. She has no redeeming qualities, and only shows how easily persuaded a young girl is. To all the young girls reading this, it's fine to want an Edward or Jacob in your life, but it's entirely something else to want to ""be like Bella"".<br/><br/>So, in short, if you want to laugh, look no further than this ""film"". I honestly don't think the next movie will be worse than this one, because the crew would literally have to not film anything and sip margaritas on set for it to be worse...wait, actual footage of the crew sipping margaritas is probably better than this abomination of a film. The few bright spots are overshadowed by the terrible script, and the only guy I feel bad for at the end of the day is Weitz."

","I loved the books and first movie flaws and all. New Moon is not without flaws but enjoyable for a die-hard fan.<br/><br/>The movie is long and rather slow paced but if you love the world of Twilight then you don't mind. Kristen Stewart holds the movie together. Luckily there's a strong actress for the part of Bella otherwise this movie would fail miserably. She truly delivers the pain of losing Edward. There were tears in my eyes during the break up scene.<br/><br/>As for the wolves - Taylor was decent but the rest of them need to take some acting lessons.<br/><br/>The Volturi - Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning were fabulous! I adore Robert Pattinson but his constant look of pain in the movie is overdone. I wish he'd stop scrunching up his forehead. It became distracting after awhile. He isn't on screen much but he was pretty good.<br/><br/>Overall the effects are better in New Moon than Twilight as well as the acting. But I enjoyed the story in Twilight better than New Moon. Of the four Twilight books I enjoyed New Moon the least. Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy the movie as much.<br/><br/>Definitely go see the movie though!!!!"

","OK so I hadn't really been ""out"" with my girlfriend in a while and she likes all this Twilight stuff so I figured Id take her to see the movie. What an enormous mistake. I didn't see the first movie or read any of the books so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I thought it would be at least HALFWAY decent, judging by all the attention this series has been getting, but I could hardly sit through the atrocity. I even smoked a little something before we left thinking I could take a nap if it got too boring, but I was too enraged to even sleep. This whole phenomenon is everything that is wrong with this country's youth. First of all, Bella is just a total slag who shows absolutely no consideration towards either of her ""love interests"" and just bounces back and fourth between the two without sitting down and talking to either one of them about her feelings like a HUMAN BEING. Her behavior was so appalling, I left the theater actually considering converting to homosexually just so I wouldn't ever have a chance of meeting a female that is so self centered and egotistical. This would have been a good movie if they hadn't tried to make it so ""Ooh I'm so deep and brooding and my feelings are complicated and no one hurts as much as I do"". Also, how does that kid turn into a HALF TON 8 FOOT LONG WEREWOLF? He was maybe 6'2"" MAX as a human. That means he either took matter from surrounding objects or CREATED IT OUT OF THIN AIR LIKE SOME KIND OF ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH WEARING HOUDINI. THAT'S NOT HOW MATTER WORKS!

","Alright I'm 40 and a Dad, I read all the books because I monitor what my girls read. Thought the books were excellent.<br/><br/>Watched Twilight very well put together and flowed well.<br/><br/>Now for ""New Moon""...I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I believe that switching directors in this case may have altered the personality of the film to much. (Maybe that was the goal) But the lack of genuine chemistry being portrayed between the characters was almost annoying. You can copy and paste the ""mushy"" sequences because they don't change at all. Same head tilt same lip curl. I believe as a director you have to notice those things in a movie to make it believable.<br/><br/>First 35mins are long, good moments but long.<br/><br/>The main interest points for me were the return of various characters from Twilight to move the story forward and the sequences regarding the high court of the vampires.<br/><br/>This movie was built to please teen girls (and the three older ladies behind me yesterday) And it has lost some of it's general audience strength. To many no shirt moments and not enough story telling. <br/><br/>Overall I think they took a fairly long book filmed what they could then edited it to the point of it being choppy and lacking real flow. Continuous shortened scene after shortened scene with no real smooth transitions to guide us through the film. Hopefully we get a director's cut that will need to be about 3 hours long but will be worth it, I hope."

","After the awful first installment, I hoped the change of director and the richer budget would help this saga to have a respectable film version. God, I was wrong.<br/><br/>New Moon is a big disappointment. It feels rushed when the audience should understand what's going on, and very slow and boring when the movie needed a cut-down. But the sad thing is that it's funny, utterly funny, when it should be serious: people laughed badly at some Alice and Edward's lines, and I couldn't stand Bella and Edward scenes together: they are sloppy and ridiculous, acted hideously by Stewart and Pattinson, who never change expression and say a word per minute. I even didn't like Ashley Greene this time, and the Volturis and other Cullens appear too little, and that's a shame.<br/><br/>The best actor this time is Taylor Lautner: his smile enlightens the screen and he can be very promising, if he picks interesting roles.<br/><br/>Chris Weitz does what he can, but he has to cope with a bad screenplay so he isn't given lot to improve the film: well, the action improves but the whole Victoria subplot is overlooked and this will be no good for Eclipse development, because the third chapter is entirely focused on Victoria's chase.<br/><br/>All in all, stay home and save money"

","Before I go any further, I'd like to point out i'm a 16 year old girl, who has read all the books and loves vampires :D so this review may come to a shock to you all.<br/><br/>OK. I might as well get straight to the point. I hated this movie. I was even tempted to walk out half way through multiple times, but was dying to see the scenes involving the Volturi - which were extremely short and very disappointing. Dakota Fanning is very overrated and does not fit in with her role in the movie. She added no personality! She's too old and not terrifying in the slightest. In fact, she was a very boring character and Jane is certainly not boring. When we were first introduced to the character, I was frustrated and disappointed instantly. It's completely different in the book; Jane appears from darkness and slowly reveals herself by pulling off her hood in a creepy manner. She certainly doesn't power walk down a hallway. <br/><br/>Who was good in the movie? Taylor Lautner was fantastic in this movie. I really believed he was Jacob. He portrayed the role of Jacob superbly. <br/><br/>The Volturi clan. Loved them all, apart from Jane. <br/><br/>Alice Cullen. Loved, loved, loved her! Brought humour and liveliness to the movie. <br/><br/>Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart gave a fairly average performance. Kristen was god damn awful. Never shed any tears once - signs of a bad actress. Kept doing this fast blinking motion with her eyes? Throughout the whole movie, she looked as though she was about to fall on her back and have an epileptic fit at any moment! It was exactly the same in the first one. I just hoped she would have brushed up on her acting skills. Sadly, she didn't!<br/><br/>Robert looked far older than 17. He passed for 17 in the first one, but he looks as though he's aged 7 years within a year? Could be down to ageing naturally of course, which can't be helped, but his make up, hair and clothing didn't do him any favours. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was pretty awful. It was very slow to start off with and felt fairly rushed at the end. I wished the volturi scenes had been extended and I felt they could have also have done the same with the cinema scene when we saw a different side to Jacob. This played a vital part in the book, but in the movie it seemed quick and short."

I headed to the movies tonight with the intent on watching it, but I remember all the bad fan reviews including my BFF...... She is a die hard fan and was sad that the movie sucked so bad and she will never recommend it to anyone ever, but she wanted me to judge for myself, misery loves company. Well ladies and gents..I lasted about 40minutes, I laughed, picked up my bag and walked out.... I say they need to start this all over with a new cast of actors and we need to sit down until someone gets it right. I have a BA in performing arts for theater and I smelled really bad BO tonight. WOW.. Please save your money and get the book at the library. It is better in your head. At the least the 1st one was not that bad and actually sparked some interest, including mines.

","I wish I could give a rating lower than 5, but 4 seems to low. This movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen, but it definitely doesn't deserve the attention it's getting.<br/><br/>I saw New Moon with on the 'advance screening' night with my friends; I wish I didn't. The Twi-hards made it difficult to understand what the characters (particulary those who are male and without shirts) were saying, and the perpetual screaming of pre-pubescent girls is very annoying.<br/><br/>The second time I saw this was the other night, as I'm still unsure about whether I like this movie or not.<br/><br/>Pros (for me)- The cinematography was amazing. The scene with Victoria running through the woods, chased by Jacob and his pack is amazing. Visually.<br/><br/>... Bella's best friend Jessica makes things funny and less awkward.<br/><br/>and that's about it.<br/><br/>Cons- The score isn't that great. It seems like some songs shouldn't be there.<br/><br/>The editing is very abrupt, and if you haven't read the books (although I have), very confusing. A lot was left unexplained.<br/><br/>Awkward. So so awkward. And not in a good way most of the time. The last kiss scene on Bella's birthday is painful to watch.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner was satisfactory as Jacob, and that's the highest compliment I can give to the main actors.<br/><br/>Why were Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson even hired? There is absolutely no chemistry between them... neither one of them seems to have more than 2 expressions. Do these people have emotions? It seems like the feel of the books is muted. Where is the agonizingly brutal solitude endured by Bella? She just looks bored most of the time, even when she is supposed to be happy. <br/><br/>Did they change the contacts the Cullen's wore? I thought vampires appearances didn't change. Apparently not.<br/><br/>I didn't like the 1st film, but I think I like this one less.<br/><br/>A poor film, and I wont bother editing my comment because there are endless problems with this film that seem too trivial too mention, but I am unsure still how I feel about this."

And Bella is so emotionless. I think they need a new main actress. Edward does well. Jacob sort of flops. Bells is the main disappointment-she cannot act.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was the audience. Of course all the teen girls screamed when Jacob took off his shirt.

It's god awful! it hurts to see.<br/><br/>The story to begin with is bad, but that's on Stephanie Meyer, not the filmmakers. The directing, whatever, wasn't brilliant, but a little better than twilight... Now, the dialogues?!!!! Are you kidding me? Even if the actors were particularly good (which they're not... though I do like Kristen, she manages to make Bella's lack of personality shine through), they couldn't have done a good job with that! IT'S A MESS.. They were, by far, the most artificial conversations I've ever seen in a movie, nobody says things that (for lack of a better word) lame! Kristen and Lautner's first scenes, in the garage, were almost good, but then it all went south... The whole movie from beginning to end is an ode to over the top romance and emotionality. But the highlight, oh the highlight!, of the movie was without a doubt Alice's vision of Edward and Bella running in the woods... I mean COME ON! that's something you see in a movie for 5 year olds and even then it's joking! Does Robert Pattinson not know how to do any expression but the ""I'm really sick of being with you all the time, gettoff, you smell"" one? Oh, wait, eventually he smiles... People say he and Kristen have chemistry... I don't see it... at all!<br/><br/>I'm not even gonna start on the anti-feminist front... oh, wait I will... Can a girl be happy without a strong male figure in her life? No. Of course not? How could she? Without a man she's nothing... nothing! ""It's my job to protect you Bella."" Oh please, it's your job to be there, if there's such a thing as a ""job"" to be done (He's her boyfriend-it's love, a partnership of equals - not his bodyguard) ... He leaves, breaks her heart beyond repair, and she welcomes him back unconditionally? Oh get a grip girl...! If your boyfriend leaves, you deal with it, you don't go trying to see his face by killing yourself, you try to maintain your self--respect. Or is this movie supposed to show that when a woman's alone, she doesn't have reason for self-respect? What's this supposed to say to the millions of 13 y olds that worship the twilight saga? An abusive boyfriend is the best, and furthermore, if he leaves you crawl under a rock, because you're not worth a dime given the fact that he doesn't think you are...? Unrealistic not because of the werewolves/vampires... because NO one is like that... I mean no one. Like Bella, Edward, Carlisle, or even Jacob... NO ONE. And no one talks like that... those dialogues! Oh...! They give me the creeps just for being that bad..."

","Having been recently converted to the series despite Meyer's illiteracy and inability to write at above a fifth grade level, I, like many other Twilight fans waited with baited breath for the release of the movie's sequel, New Moon. As soon as physically possible, I pre-booked tickets and waited a further seven days from opening night to see this movie in order to ensure good seats, only to be bitterly disappointed.<br/><br/>The film gets off to a slow start which is pretty much the basis for the next two hours and fifteen minutes. Bags of pointless dialogue had me feeling restless, bored and awkward, and the cheesy yet emotionless delivery of lines from both Pattinson and Stewart left much to be desired. Critical pieces of information were not mentioned, meaning that those who had not read the books were left to psychically fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>Thanks to Pattinson's linear acting, the vast majority of the audience finds themselves sympathising and identifying with Lautner's character Jacob, who unfortunately only appears to be used and abused by protagonist Bella. That is, Bella Swan; the forever miserable and manipulative teenager who only uses those around her when vamp boy has ditched her. Similarly to Pattinson, Kristen Stewart has about three different facial expressions: miserable, confused and a strained attempt at ""happy"".<br/><br/>In essence, the film was a mish-mash of events loosely stitched together to create a barely coherent storyline that was both hard to follow and hard to enjoy. For the entire duration, it felt like it was slowly building up to something, only to be coupled with an ending that was a rushed and unexpected anti-climax. Any attempts at action sequences were also hurried and stunted.<br/><br/>Admittedly, out of the four books, New Moon is the slowest and least eventful. However, this film is a disaster, and could ultimately have been done far better. The werewolves are the only entertaining and likable characters, and even their parts in the movie are short-lived and clipped. <br/><br/>Don't waste your money."

","This was a confusing movie. I have seen the first Twilight, but haven't read the book. I kind of liked the first one, a sort of a non-trivial out of this world love story. That's why this was so confusing. I first thought that they had changed the style from drama to black comedy or even satire. <br/><br/>The beginning it seemed to go like the predecessor. But then the boy leaves. The dialogue was so badly written that the actual reason was not well articulated. Apparently he was worried about girls safety and her soul if he (vampire) stays around. Well, then the girl mourns for three months, but finds this second hunk. First, it looked only friendship, but then the second hunk takes his shirt off to wipe blood from her head after the motorcycle accident. She runs her finger over his muscular chest, and says: ""You are so beautiful."" And BANG, they relationship is suddenly more than friendship, long stares, cuddling, breathing into each others mouth...girl is often talking and staring the second hunks chest like some men are talking to women's breasts. Then the second hunk got busy with vampire hunting, and girl is again without a hunk. So she goes and jumps off the cliff.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the first hunk is committing suicide, and the girl is decent and goes to save him. Of course she had to leave the second hunk, who stays begging on his knees her not to go. They come back with the first hunk, and girl goes to second hunk. She again runs her fingers over his muscular chest and says: ""Jacob, I love you."" But I still goes with that first hunk.<br/><br/>Seriously, teenage boys and men if you see this movie. This was just the weird story, don't believe it. Perhaps the book's author is like that, but there really are decent girls out there who don't behave like this mess."

I thought the things they added that weren't in the book were great additions...i thought Michael sheen did a terrific job as Aro...i loved the wolves...just so everyone is clear they are not supposed to be scary werewolves that transform under a full moon...they are really shape-shifters....each wolf is different in appearance demonstrating that persons inner strengths and personality...granted anyone who hasn't read the books might not know any of this.

It's not the best movie of all time...it doesn't compare with my favorites of Schindlers List or Braveheart, but it's not as bad as everyone says it is!!! When a movie comes out with this much fan base and attention some people are just waiting to condemn it!!!!! You know, i stood in line for a midnight showing of the Phantom Menace some years ago with a large group of guys dressed up as their favorite star wars characters...now that movie was definitely not the best out of all star wars movies, but i sat through it and enjoyed it just because it was part of the star wars movies...it told an important part of the story that needed to be told and hard core fans wanted it to be told!!!!! I just wish people would go in and see the movie with an open mind and not go in already hating it and laughing at it!!!

But oh boy, i was wrong.<br/><br/>The story is pretty basic: Edward leaves Bella because some vampire attacked her, so he feels guilty and dumps her. As you can see, the story sucks, but even though many movies have very simple plots usually they compensate that with interesting characters or with good story telling. Well, this movie has none of that! I swear Bella is the dumbest female character i've seen in a movie; she spends weeks crying because Edward ""sparkles"" Cullen dumped her. Oh, and about that, how dumping her is protecting her? She can still be eaten by other vampires. But back to Bella, she also does some really stupid stuff like riding a motorbike and epically failing at it, and taking rides with total strangers.<br/><br/>The love triangle is forced and i just don't see the chemistry. Lautner tries so hard to show some emotion (his acting is still bad), but Stewart just looks like she doesn't gives a crap. She's so bad and emotionless.

","This Films tells the history of a vampire (Edward) that, fighting with a always shirt-less werewolf in order to win the heart of a young, emotionless, girl named Bella and kill other vampire's order. And Curiously Bella don't seems to know what is going on the history. She is one's of the most annoying characters I've ever seen. She is the most vampire of all despite being an human. She never smiles and acts really likes a beginner. Kristen Stewart does not worth a penny! The movie has a tolerable amount of specials effects, but it is very motionless. Lots of love and talk scenes for no fight at all. The cast is very amateur and the plot is almost worse than ""Fifth Shades of Gray"", even the soundtrack is annoying Definitely one of the best NOT-TO-Watch Movies ever!"

","I am a teenage girl and I am very proud to say that I hate this movie. I almost feel most teenage girls being hardcore fans of this saga is like having a big black mark on them. It almost sounds like guys are genius and gals are like ""flies off when they see their heroes"" in this case Edward and Jacob. Oh for god sake grow up!!!<br/><br/>looks are not the only issue here. Performance, script, presentation and above plot line always stands first as Far as a real critic is concerned.<br/><br/>I never had the intention to see this film. Let me be honest now... I loved the first film twilight... I can't deny it. The direction was good. the plot was okay but some parts were still missing. As far as the performances were concerned Stewart seemed to have held up with how Bella was in the book. Pattinson was my favorite as he was quite remarkable. He was steadfast and controlled.<br/><br/>But after seeing this and eclipse i have decided to take all my opinion back about them. The biggest problem of Kristen was that she is too STEREOTYPED! With her open O mouthed expression, her blinking, shaking of the head, annoying breath, emotionless under toned speech and above all blank face she could top as the world's most stereotyped actress. All those people whose brain works will notice all this.<br/><br/>And Pattinson, he was my favorite. When I came to know that he was nominated for Razzies I was depressed. But after seeing this film, I thought, no wonder. He lost his brightness completely. He speaks as if he is trying to lift a heavy object. His acting in the volturi scenes really sucked.<br/><br/>Lautner was good. But he had some overacting here and there. He can't do very emotional scenes. Ashley Greene was okay but not spectacular.<br/><br/>Now back to the plot. It was very weak and less catchy. you will like only if you are a hard core twilight fan. The presentation could have been better but so far it is just the worst.<br/><br/>1/10"

","Admittedly I have only in the last 2 days watched Twilight and New Moon and I am totally baffled by the popularity of these movies. Especially New Moon this film was TERRIBLE. Taylor Lautner cannot act to save himself, yet next to Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson he looked like he had the talent of Catherine Hepburn. <br/><br/>Now, about the acting.... Kirsten Stewart has one face and that is the ""semi-sad"" look. For the most part ot simply looked like she couldn't wait for the film to be over. Robert Pattinson has one face and that is also the ""semi-sad"" look. I think he may be this decades answer to Luke Perry. There was a valid reason that the period between 90210 and Twilight had no ""Luke Perry types"". They can't act!! I fail to see the appeal. Taylor Lautner constantly does that thing where it looks like he is gazing about 20 metres away trying to read micro-printed reading cards and his lines come out accordingly. <br/><br/>And did it bother anyone else that Bella is just so accepting of the fact that vampires and werewoves exist???<br/><br/>Now I know these are movies made to be aimed at teens and tweens, but for crying out loud at least TRY and make a decent film. There are Werewolves and Vampires present. Shouldn't there be epic battles and much blood lust?? <br/><br/>Here are a few points that came to mind: 1) Twilight refers to the beginning of the evening between sunset and dusk and when Vampires and Werewolves get ready to come out to play. They ARE NOT daywalkers. If the characters are daywalkers then ""twilight"" is a pointless time of the day and had no reference to the story..... 2) Calling a movie New Moon where you introduce werewolves into the story would be OK, if the ""moon"" had anything to do with their ability to turn. Having them as daywalkers as I stated in point 1 defeats the purpose altogether. You may as well have called the story ""Cheesecake"", such was the relevance. (Mmmmmm Cheesecake).... 3) Vampires and Werewolves are creatures of legend and not a bunch of sorry ass ""Emo"" teens. They are vicious and bloodthirsty, not whiny and desperate. <br/><br/>Perhaps Stephanie Meyers has them confused with Waaah-wolves and Vam-criers? Yes?........<br/><br/>I am yet to watch Eclipse but it will need to be a vast improvement on New Moon because it was possibly the worst sequel ever....and yes I am including Police Academies 2 through 7!!! <br/><br/>A very generous 4/10 at best."

","I hate the Twilight series. But, I'm not a hater simply because it's the cool thing to do. I don't hate the series because I'm outside of the demographic region being a 22-year old male. No, I hate it because the series is appalling. Yes, the premise of a female human and a male vampire (both adolescent) is a superb idea. But, the way that Meyer executed her idea was atrocious. Rosenberg stepped it up a notch for New Moon and it's probably a lot of credit to throw at the male director for making it better too.<br/><br/>New Moon doesn't quite fail as much as its predecessor. In fact, it's a major improvement. Now, I'm not saying the special effects are better, which is sad because the movie got an approximate 140% budget increase. But actually what is better is the acting! Thankfully, Stewart's portrayal went from blinky, unemotional, boring girl to a girl with emotion in her lines and she conveyed love in her eyes. She became a bit interesting. Unfortunately, Robert's acting was still stiff as a bone, though.<br/><br/>Jacob is probably my most hated character, however. I mean, yes Robert's acting is horrible and Taylor's is not bad...but Jacob is a usurper as Bella clearly belongs to Edward. In Edward's absence, Jacob takes to bonding with Bella and attempts too hard to hold her hand or kiss her. For some odd reason, Bella falls in love with him. I never saw anything between them emotional. I think Taylor's muscle has something to do with Bella's growing hormones and she just wants to jump his bones.<br/><br/>In the finale of the film, Edward has a pointless fight with Volturi which is where a bunch of special effects come into play. It was very irritating to watch because of how pointless the fight was. I would have much preferred the fight between Edward and Jacob to happen. But the 'perfect' Bella has to get in between and tell them that it will hurt her. I would say that the werewolf effects are cool, but it's just simply not as good as the potential that it had. Jacob turns to a werewolf a little to quickly and it should hurt, in my opinion, when he does transform. But it looks like there is no downside at all to him being a werewolf, so what's the reason for keeping it a secret? I'm not saying that New Moon is good. I'm not saying I like it. But I will say, I don't hate it. It's not the worst movie ever made, but it's not good either. It's down at the bottom of the barrel but I just can't decide where."
"FilmFreak94","4","5","7","29 July 2011"," A little better than the first... but that's not saying much
","For the first thirty minutes of the movie, I felt that it was just the first movie all over again. Nothing interesting was happening, Bella and Edward's relationship was going nowhere, and everything was poorly paced and poorly acted out. Then after the Cullens celebrate Bella's 18th birthday and Bella accidentally cuts herself causing one of the vampires to attack her Edward decides it is too dangerous to be around her and leaves. Then the movie gets worse. As the next twenty minutes are spent watching Bella wander in the woods, moan in bed, and write letters to Alice(Edward's sister) explaining her sorrow and that she wishes they would all come back(even though Alice will never even get those letters). And we're treated to a scene where the camera circles around Bella sitting by her bedroom window as the captions tell us that months have passed. And what happens during that long scene... absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>The film finally starts getting interesting when Bella starts spending time with her childhood friend Jacob Black. Bella and Jacob start a relationship but it's not long before Jacob finds out that he is a werewolf and he joins a gang of other werewolves. He also tries to tell Bella to stop seeing him, but that works just as well as when Edward did it. The werewolves begin to defend Bella from an evil vampire named Victoria, who is after Bella because of the death of her mate James who was killed when he tried to eat Bella in the last movie. All the while, Bella sees images of Edward telling her not to do reckless stuff, but she doesn't listen and gets into one pointless misadventure after the other(like riding a motorcycle, jumping off a cliff etc.) The jumping off the cliff thing actually has some significance as Alice sees a vision of it and thinks Bella has died. Edward thought so as well, which causes him to try exposing himself by standing in the sun. Bella goes to save him in time and is introduced to the Volturi, who find out that none of their powers work on Bella. And then the events that follow are just like the last movie; a fight happens, then twenty minutes of nothing interesting at all. Seriously, the climaxes for these movies are awful, I just find myself asking 'How long until it's over?' every time. And the movie ends on a cliffhanger, where Edward asks Bella to marry him.<br/><br/>This film was bad, but not as bad as the first. For one thing, Bella and Jacob were childhood friends which makes the chemistry between them a little more convincing. And the middle of the film when the Cullens are absent and the werewolves are studied further are some of the better parts of the film. But overall, it's just not a film for people who didn't like the last one. If you're a fan of the series, go right ahead and watch this film. If not, give it a miss."
"Karlamon","4","5","7","27 November 2010"," Tedious and boring if your not a fan
","First of all, I have to admit that I am not a fan of the Twilight series and I haven't read any of the books, yet this series seems to be very popular with teenage girls worldwide. I was dragged into the second film in the series New Moon in cinemas during a high school camp and I hadn't even seen the first one yet (I saw that on DVD a few weeks later and found it to be alright).<br/><br/>Since I was unfamiliar with the series, I had to ask the girl sitting next to me about the story so far. She told me its about a teenage girl called Bella (Kristen Stewart) who falls in love with a vampire named Edward (Robert Pattinson).<br/><br/>If you haven't read the books or seen the first movie in particular, your easily going to get lost as soon as New Moon starts. But if you can pay close enough attention, you can get a picture of the story. Edward and his family leave Forks after an incident at Bella's birthday to prevent her from being in more danger of vampires. Bella later gets in touch with her childhood friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who is apparently a werewolf and shows interest in him, but she can't stop thinking about Edward and must confront herself with her new situation.<br/><br/>This film is a sloppy mess and feels like it was all put together in about a month. For those who haven't read the book, you will find out that the movie is hampered with confusing storytelling and there are scenes that will leave you scratching your head wondering whats happening. But if you have read all 563 pages of the book, you might be able to understand this awkward journey.<br/><br/>Comparing this to the first Twilight film, New Moon is a lot worse in terms of quality and storytelling. The acting of the characters is stiff at best and they lack expressive emotions or any signs of character development so not much really happens in New Moon. Screenplay is shallow and rushed, dialogue is dull and boring and the overall execution of the movie is just flat and unexciting.<br/><br/>But I would have to say that there were a few redeeming qualities about New Moon. The werewolf fight scenes were entertaining to watch. They add tension to the movie and the CG on the wolves actually looks pretty good. Also what prevents the film from becoming a complete bore is that its got a tense score and some decent popular music including Muse, Lupe Fiasco and Death Cab for Cutie.<br/><br/>New Moon is nothing more than a tale about a girl trying to figure out who she likes more. This was probably a rushed adaption just to keep demanding Twilight fans satisfied. The end of the movie prepares you for the remaining sequels Eclipse and Breaking Dawn and I'm just glad that nobody is forcing me to watch those at this time. And like I said before, I am not a Twilight fan and I'm not a hater either, so I'm going to give New Moon a C- at most. Unless your a die-hard Twifan, you should give this movie a pass. ""C-"""
"CanadianCinephile","2","5","7","20 November 2010"," Weird lessons, shirtless dudes
","Stephanie Meyer's Mormon tale of self-denial continues its filmic adaptation series with The Twilight Saga: New Moon. Unless you've been living under a rock somewhere, you know that Meyer's books were huge hits among the tween-teen girl set and that the movie series was destined to become a huge hit as well. Twilight was released in 2008 and the tepid vampire nonsense continues with New Moon.<br/><br/>All your pals are here for the fun, but there's a different director behind the camera if anybody notices. Chris Weitz, who directed The Golden Compass, is in charge of making the continuation of Bella and Edward's romance fly with its target audience. There is literally no attempt to reach beyond the target audience here, either.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is back as Bella Swan, the long-suffering, selfish brat living in Forks with her father. She is still in love with Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the vampire, and is concerned that she's going to grow into an old woman and Edward won't want her anymore. Of course, Edward is perpetually 17 and this bothers the now-18-year-old Bella. The Cullen family elects to throw her a birthday party and it is revealed that Bella may be more in danger than originally realized.<br/><br/>The Cullens decide to leave Forks and this sends Bella into a fit of insanity and weird behaviour. She starts hanging around Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and they develop their friendship and toy with the idea of romance. Soon, though, it is discovered that there is more to Jacob than meets the eye and beneath his buff exterior lies somethingwell, fluffy. Through a series of events and a little Romeo and Juliet twist, Bella and Edward are finally reunited in time for a crucial question.<br/><br/>There are so many basic problems with Meyer's entire series that it really leaves the film adaptations with no chance right out of the gate. Granted, a decent cast and a better script could make something out of the limp narrative and awful construction of the Twilight series, but most of this stuff was doomed from the start.<br/><br/>For starters, Bella is one of the most self-absorbed and repugnant characters in recent memory and she is touted as a veritable heroine. She isn't the least bit aware of the way she uses almost every character in the picture, either, and this is worsened when one realizes that she is incessantly drawn to men who are destined to abuse her. This concept is lightly brushed off as a byproduct of being with a ""werewolf"" or a ""vampire,"" but a deeper look reveals something quite sinister in the overall message.<br/><br/>New Moon finds Stewart's Bella asking Edward to take her soul. This is an interesting conception when one considers what's really on the line here. For Bella and Edward's epic romance to mean anything on a large scale, something must be on the line. Of course, Meyer and Co. realize that there is nothing to draw these characters together so the mythos must draw us (the audience) in instead. That leaves us with hollow posturing and showiness that the actors are only more than willing to portray insipidly.<br/><br/>See, Stewart and Pattinson and Lautner simply cannot make this stuff interesting because it means nothing to them. The idea that Bella is drawn into abusive relationships with men is ignored in favour of this great love; the notion that Edward and Jacob will hurt her physically is brushed aside because the ""love story"" should be the focus. Indeed, nothing about the ""love"" Bella feels is presented as dangerous. What is presented as dangerous is riding on motorcycles or cliff-jumping.<br/><br/>As a film, New Moon is incredibly dull, hollow and absurd. The effects are meaningless and crappy, the rare action sequences cut off just at the point of interest, the romantic angles mean absolutely nothing, and the inferences of Mormon moralizing are flat-out vile. Weitz pulls the movie deeper into the sludge, giving us characters who are reprehensible and, on top of it all, bland in their declarations of emotion to one another.<br/><br/>The goal, however, isn't for people to actually consider how bizarre and obscene the messages are here ('tis better to fall in love with a man who puts you in perpetual danger than it is to try independence and ride motorcycles). Instead, Weitz and everyone else involved with this turd have ensured that the audience is far too busy concentrating on the shirtless eye candy and inane attempts at tension and ""humour"" that take place here. And the scary thing is, for the most part, it seems to be working."
"Buddy-51","4","5","7","9 November 2010"," inert and drippy
","We've all dealt with unrequited love before, but ""New Moon,"" the second installment in the popular ""Twilight"" series, takes it to a whole new level. Bella Swan, the moody high school student who found herself in love with a vampire - the brooding Edward - in the first film, now finds herself attracted to a werewolf, her long-haired Native American childhood pal turned cropped-haired, muscle-bound super-hunk, Jacob. Now, that's a love triangle you don't come across every day of the week.<br/><br/>This disappointing, time-marking follow-up to the flawed but often imaginative ""Twilight"" is a tedious, slow-moving bore, consisting of little more than endless conversations about which of Bella's two ""monstrous"" beaus loves her the more and which is more likely to protect her from the danger posed by his rival and the assorted associates and kinsmen who come with him. In fact, so focused is the story on the romantic travails of the three main characters that the movie ultimately stalls out in a puddle of its own sappiness. And on a purely technical level, even the CGI werewolves are not as impressive as we'd expect them to be, given the massive amount of cash clearly lavished on the project.<br/><br/>Actually, the thing that strikes one the most about ""New Moon"" is just how much of a rehash it is of the previous film, with Bella's predicament simply being played over, only this time with a lover from a different species (especially as Edward voluntarily removes himself from much of the action this time around).<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson return as the human/vampire lovers, while Lautner gets to run around with his shirt off a good deal of the time (despite the damp, rainy climate). That may be enough to keep the movie's targeted audience of teenaged girls awake and glued to the screen for the duration, but the rest of us will have no trouble snoozing our way through to the next installment."
"revival05","4","5","7","15 April 2010"," Sparkling stupidities and bloodless chastity
","New Moon is a first base porn movie. There's no sex, but kisses in slow motion. There's no obscenities, just ""Oh. Kiss me"". The perspective is kind of ""female"", that is to say that the male characters are introduced and continuously shot in slow motion. The young men in the film don't like shirts very much. If you count the number of abs in it, I'm sure you'll still be counting around the time the third Twilight movie shows up.<br/><br/>Oh, enough jokes already. New Moon is not a good film, but I admit I did enjoy it a lot more than the first Twilight. That one left me confused and frustrated. I imagined something that had become such a phenomena should at least aspire some element of amusement. It was very un- amusing, though, since it took itself with a kind of phoney seriousness that felt speculative rather than sincere. It felt as if it assumed the audience were idiots and wouldn't care that nothing made any sense or that there was no consistency in anything that happened. It was a foggy, shining, sparkling mess of epic proportions. If you knew nothing of the novels this franchise is based on, you were left totally excluded. That is a film making crime. Not a small thing either, I consider it a big felony. It's junk food cinema that doesn't even bother to give you a list of ingredients.<br/><br/>That being said, New Moon was an easier burger to swallow. A lot of the inconsistencies of the first one applies here too - the characters act contradictory, you often have to guess what is actually going on in the plot and sometimes the film takes for granted that you won't ask basic questions of logic. There's this whole bit about the Vatican for instance, that is like taken out of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I went ""What am I even watching?"". Pattison's hunky sparkling vampire decides he wants to tell the world he's a vampire. His plan is to strip nude and walk out into the sunshine in the middle of the crowds around the Vatican. Right.... because then he'll sparkle, right? And.... then everybody will understand he's a vampire.... Hum hum....<br/><br/>Most of the movie is nothing more than a teenage melodrama, though, and for about half of the movie I did follow along before it, well, continued and went on, and went on some more and, yawn, kept going. In any case, at least I wasn't constantly annoyed as in the first one. Teen soap opera is after all less ambitious than fantasy adventure so when it's silly, dumb and inconsistent it's easier to just take it for amusement. The story involves poor Bella being dumped by hunky Edward and instead befriending Jacob, who transforms into a CGI werewolf when he gets upset. We don't really get to know much of what she's up to, her heart is broken and she is confused and perhaps suicidal but maybe only destructive. I'll get to this in a while, but in the peachy world where Twilight takes place, ""destructive"" means riding motorcycles with strangers (scary!) and jumping into the water from cliffs (nooo!). What, not even a single cigarette? Oh no, that would have been Way Too Destructive! We'd NEVER forgive THAT! Anyway, she might be going a little crazy too, because Edward is at times appearing like some kind of Obi-Wan Cullenobi exclaiming ""Bella! No!"" or ""Bella! Do this!"" or ""Bella! Don't do that!"". This isn't really explained further. It doesn't really matter either. The point of New Moon is really just to exhilarate it's target audience. I get it now. It's bad, but at least it's not totally inept film making, which the first film was.<br/><br/>I could have recommended New Moon for all future teenage audiences to come. But what's really ugly about it is the poorly hidden, church like conservative, 7th Heaven kind of message that goes with it. To put it simply, New Moon is really about two peachy, healthy, heteronormative teenagers who wants to have sex for the first time but need to get married first. I know this sounds far out for some innocents, but you listen to the dialog and you tell me I'm wrong. Edward is the male patriarch, he can do as he please with Bella, leaving her here, leaving her there, she will patiently suffer with about as much independence as a child left behind by her parents. Her destiny is to be his conveniently obedient wife slave. The werewolf character is not a threat to the other male patriarch either, because he is so obviously supposed to be the homosexual monster in the outskirts of the normal world. His werewolf friend tease him for having ""a girlfriend!"" and there's even infamous lines like ""Can't you find a way to just... stop? I mean it's... wrong"" and ""It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella, I was born this way, I can't help it"" and Bella's slightly disgusted reply ""It's not who you.... aaare, it's what you... dooo!"" I could pass it off with a laugh, and I do, but at the end of it these are not the kind of vampires and warewolfs I want kids to relate to. I think Bella is a charmless idiot. I like what warewolfs do. And for the record, Edward isn't all that hot anyway."

","I'm going to admit, right now, that I have never read any of these books. I did read a passage from New Moon, but that was only so I could find out how Laurent, my favorite character and the best part of Twilight, met his end. I wasn't impressed.<br/><br/>However, I have to say that this film is a vast improvement from the first one. Faster pace, marginally better acting (lets face it, some of the key actors and actresses won't get better), new and more interesting characters. It was just better, and I was actually able to sit down and, very nearly, enjoy. The directing was by far an improvement, and there were some genuinely interesting and even impressive bits of filming in this movie, and it even had some indication of thought and emotion, nowhere near as platonic as the first movie.<br/><br/>Of course, I still have the major peeves that hounded me the first film around: Fairies not vampires and why must they sparkle. Shape-shifters not werewolves. Put a shirt on boys. Kristen Stewart do something! Bella get a life and some character development he's way too old for you. The dialogue needs a serious re-doing. Special effects, while better, need to be improved. Honestly, I just don't think these stories are all that great. They're too much like the fantasy of a very sick 13 year-old-girl. They lack substance. More importantly, they lack that crucial element that is found in the best of fiction; truth. These characters are difficult to feel for, and the stories hard to relate to in the slightest because the emotions just don't seem real. It's too dramatic and too immature. Watching Bella run around trying to get herself killed just for a glimps of Vampire boy, her moping around was, while supposedly keeping with the story, awfully unentertaining. It just didn't stack up to other movies! Boring, laughable, and OBVIOUSLY aimed at the thousands of poor, lonely, misguided young ladies who have slowly and sadly become obsessed with these rather juvenial and lack-luster stories (no offense). Not deserving of any of the hype and fascination it has received.<br/><br/>Now, THE GOOD PARTS: Possibly the soul redeeming quality of this film, I thought, was Michael Sheen. I actually got excited when he came on screen as Aro. Very interesting, very fun, and very seductive. Now that Laurent is gotten rid of, I think that Aro will serve nicely as my reason for watching these films. Seriously, I had to suppress a squeal of delight every time he dominated the screen. I'm tempted to put the movie in and fast-forward to his part, just so I can see it again. He was simply dripping with malice, and had this gleeful little glint in his eye. I was almost jealous of Kristen Stewart, getting to ""act"" with Michael Sheen playing such a fun role. AMAZING! After him, I have to say that the person playing the Cullen father guy is excellent. He's not a recognizable actor to me, so that's good for the character. Also, I've no idea how close he is to the character in the book, but I don't care. He did an wonderful job in the role and made it very likable, sympathetic, and paternal. Also, the tiny bit that Laurent was on screen was just a amazing as I remember the character in the first film, so that was good too. Also, Taylor Lautner's performance was surprisingly good, besides the fact that I always wanted to give him a jacket. He needs to do a bit of maturing as an actor, but there is DEFINITE potential in that one.<br/><br/>These three actors are the reasons I'm giving this film 5/10. Without them, 3/10 easily, because this film didn't actually have much to it.<br/><br/>Not exactly a film I'd call a must see, no, not at all. Perhaps I'd call it a must-miss, or an avoid-if-possible-but-if-forced-to-see-don't-expect-to-much. Still, if you're going to insist on seeing it, wait until the end or fast forward; that's when Michael Sheen comes on!"

","I became a Twihard last December. Watched Twilight, loved it because it reminded me about first love and because the screen chemistry between Rob and Kristen was great. You could see they had fun, they enjoyed doing that movie, there was no stress. Probably a little flirt on the side.. Then watched NM. Bella does not show any affection anymore, Edward is telling her how much she means to him, that he would commit suicide if she would die and her reaction is...non existent! No passion, no trembling, just looks at him like a sheep. The beginning and middle of the movie drags on with Bella heartbroken, and ridiculous scenes like Jacob taking his shirt off to wipe her blood (yes, he has a great body I admit but he is already walking around half naked as a werewolf that he is, so no need to overdo it) and Bella overreacting when seeing imaginary Edward (beginner actors do a ""Huh"" like that when they are surprised, but not a big screen star). Rob plays well,I like his scowl, I admit it and the pain in his voice is real...the only minus is that awful old fashioned suit and the lipstick. Then somehow towards the end the producers realize this is only a 2h movie and suddenly cut to the chase like mad, bam phone call, bam plane, bam yellow Porsche, a bit of love, then a fight (I liked this idea, a bit of action finally, contrary to the book where I would have liked that too), then bam Forks again and everything is fine. No reunion scene, explanations, epiphany. Instead a ridiculous vision of Alice that had me laughing and crying with frustration. Poor Cullens just stand around like pretty statues, while Victoria just runs like mad. Charlie is still managing to do a great job with the few lines they allowed him to have. He is together with the teenagers (Mike, Angela, Jessica and Eric) and Aro (Michael Sheen) the best acting in the movie. Especially Anna Kendrick steals the show and Michael Sheen..aah, you just know when you see a great actor,it just feels so natural. Taylor also impressed me, he acts as natural as he can and his Jacob is coming over as a warmer and kinder Jacob than in the book somehow. Dakota did not impress me in any way, I just noted her shoes and thought of Minnie Mouse, and the red eyes were cute.Alice was Alice, in character as always! The music was OK at the beginning and then just faded, I did not even notice it later on. Overall, I like only 30-45 minutes of this movie: school scene, birthday, car, break-up, meadow Edward, cliff-jump, phone call up up to bedroom. I am a sucker for tragic love stories so the whole Volterra thing I absolutely adored. But the long pauses Rob makes when making the proposal together with the face Bella makes as an answer to that proposal left me a bad after taste, such a bad beginner acting it was. Overall 5 out of 10 because it cut out the really pivotal scenes at the end from the book and put instead ridiculous ones no one cares about (Emily cabin, Alice vision, Volterra glimpse at the beginning, they could cut those out instead of the great B&E car dialog or Victoria scenes that they did cut out and put on DVD). Hope Eclipse is better but I guess with all the media and fans the pressure is just so big to everyone (cast, crew) that out of sheer stress nothing will come out of it..if the cast would be experimented actors there would be no problem, but with young inexperienced actors like that this is way too much."

","Why is the new trend to have Vampires and Werewolves fight? I don't recall Dracula and the Wolfman getting into the ring together. Which is too bad, because that would have been HILARIOUS.<br/><br/>Instead we have a movie with virtually every male character trying to get Bella to swoon for them now that Vampire Ed has left. Yes, his family apparently stopped putting lead in the water, and people are starting to realize that he and his family are a little off (THEY'RE VAMPIRES) so they move away and don't tell Bella where they're going. So we get a long montage of Bella in full emo mode, stopping just short of cutting herself, until she decides to replace Ed with one of the other guys who is drooling over her. Yes, that's the moral girls, your life's worth is completely dependent on whatever man you are with. Great lesson.<br/><br/>In New Moon's defense, they get the weepy melodrama over with fairly quickly and get on to a story that isn't... well, it isn't awful. Local native Americans don't want vampires on their land, a couple of the bad vampires are snooping around, the native Americans turn into werewolves to fight them off, Vampires tasty, yum yum.<br/><br/>But once that's resolved, we're laboriously dragged back into the world of emo vampires as Alice shows up having had a vision of Bella's death, and apparently word slipped to Vampire Ed that Bella is supposedly dead and what does this macho, powerful, badass vampire do? He decides to kill himself rather than live without her. Just think about this, what if Sarah Conner had killed herself after Kyle Reese bought it? What if young Bruce Wayne had killed himself after his parents were murdered? These are tough as nails characters that rose above their traumatic event and became badass. Edward Cullen isn't badass. He is bad, and he is an ass, but he's not both. So instead of a fully raged, ticked off, super-powered immortal showing up to beat werewolf tail, we get whiny Vampire Ed who goes to some old fruity LARPing vampire elders asking them to kill him. What, kid, too much of a puss to aim the stake correctly? I'll help!<br/><br/>They refuse, so he decides to try and reveal the presence of vampires so they'll have no choice but to kill him. Bella stops him just in time, but the LARPers don't want Bella spilling the secret of their existence, so Alice says she'll turn Bella into a vampire... AND THEY JUST LEAVE!! Urkel could fight these vampires and win! ""She can't reveal our existence. Make her a vampire.""<br/><br/>""Okay.""<br/><br/>""... So, you'll be getting to that...""<br/><br/>""Later.""<br/><br/>""Okay, sure.""<br/><br/>They go back to rainy Washington, there's a brief little testosterone battle between Vampire Ed and Werewolf boy, but seeing as how neither one of them has any, um... fangs, the whole thing just ends and I'm still bored. Is it as bad as the first one? No. This one has some concept of pacing and dramatic tension. Is it bad? OH GLORIOUS VLAD, YES!! It's awful! But hell, if they keep at it, eventually one of these might be bearable. I can tell the kids have been taking acting classes, but next time around it'd be nice if they PAID ATTENTION IN THEM!!"

","I haven't read any of the books, so I have no idea if anything was changed. I watched New Moon as a movie completely independent of the books, the saga and everything else.<br/><br/>First of all this is a girl movie. And I knew that. That means my expectations were low. I don't like romance so let's enjoy the vampire part, right? WRONG. This is vampire blasphemy, He was SPARKLING!!! WTF?! Vampires don't deserve that. No way, man.<br/><br/>The dialogue is extra cheesy and the acting sucks overall. The main actors look like they never rehearsed together. They have a set of 4 facial expressions - not each, but together.<br/><br/>The production was done nicely, directing also, although there are a couple of messed up scenes.<br/><br/>OK, the movie has a target audience so I won't take points of for the idea or storyline. But, the acting and the script must be punished. The RAPING of the vampires also.<br/><br/>4/10"

","So, first of all, I did read the book. It's my favorite one of the Twilight Saga, because it shows the dark side of love so clearly, when Edward leaves Bella. The passages in the books made me shiver and I could completely empathize with Bella.<br/><br/>Now the movie...I was looking forward to the scene, when Edward leaves Bella and tells her, that it's over... I expected a burst out of feelings! And what did I get? Kristen didn't even cry ONCE in the whole movie! If you imagine that this was her hardest time in her life, EVER (Bellas life) that is just so ridiculous! She lies on the ground in the Forest, as Edward leaves and shakes...i don't know of this should be some kind of breakdown or if shes just freezing or what the hell....but it looks totally awkward and ridiculous! <br/><br/>Her bad acting ruined the whole movie, since after that scene you really felt that that girl deserves to get dumped!<br/><br/>So, 5 stars is pretty grateful, because I HATED Kristens acting, but on the other hand I LOVED the acting of the other characters (Edward was better than in the 1st part, and Billy Burke and Dakota fanning really lighted up this movie with their amazing acting)"

","Can a movie be both boring and funny? Yesterday night I discovered it can. ""New Moon"" alternates boring moments (such as the never ending dialogues about love between Bella and Edward) and extremely funny moments (Bella is so ridiculous!). Bella has the same expression during the entire movie: as if it wasn't enough her continuous whining because of Edward's absence...her dialogues consist only of:""Edward, Edward, vampires are the best, Edward, death, Edward, Edward, vampires, Edward"". It's funny to see poor puppy dog Jackob being walked all over by Bella while he tries to impress her: how pathetic! He doesn't understand that the fact he's only a werewolf isn't enough for Bella, who is in love only with vampires! Because the message of the film is that: vampires are cooler than werewolves, and werewolves con do nothing about that! Pattison can't act and speaks about his love for Bella as if he was reading one of those too well known and too much used quotations. My sister and I laughed a lot every time he talked! The presence of Jackob is meant only for his body. I feel pity for Bella's father: he's the only Twilight's character who minds his own business. So...only a waste of time, unless you want to laugh."

I have a question. The writer ever read a single phrase about vampire tales? How in the world she thought about this: - they are semi-daywalkers (if it's cloudy, it's OK) - the have sex? Oh, yes...they get a bone one, too. - after sex...they are capable of letting a woman pregnant. Yes, I know the end of the story. My girlfriend read all 4 books. As for New Moon, it's all about college relationship, nothing more. He pretends to be mature, he leaves her, she meets another guy. Another one bites the dust.

The whole thing does not seem to consolidate into anything of substance.<br/><br/>Also, I cannot tell whether Kristen Stewart's acting or her character is to blame, but Bella is quite annoying. Who in the world would fall for such a lame girl? She seems permanently confused and frustrated, not passionately in love, which makes the whole affair dull. There is nothing assuring about this Bella girl. Yeah, I suppose that having feelings for a vampire should burden anybody, let alone a teenager, but this story borders on futility.<br/><br/>It's a matter of opinion, of course, but I don't understand how a movie like this could become a hit.

","Let me start by saying that i didn't want to watch the film in the first place, i was actually working at the film as an attendant. Anyway onto the film. It was long, 2 hours long, and it felt a lot longer! It just seemed to me ( i am not a fan of twilight, i haven't read the books )that it was about Bella, who seemed unhappy the whole film, not knowing which guy to choose when judging by the acting, she had decided she already didn't like either of them. The scenes where rubbish, they just seemed to be thrown together to, im guessing, fit in with the book. The film wasn't fast paced at all, and it seemed to me that it was aimed purely at 13-15year old girls, and NO-ONE else Unless you are a 13-15 year old girl, Don't watch this film.

","Even if you did like the books, you will most likely find this movie terrible. If, like me, you didn't like the books.... you'll still hate it.<br/><br/>The lines are poorly delivered, the special effects are bad, and the script is so awful you'll laugh. First off, Bella is ridiculously moody; from her unrealistic obnoxious screaming while having her ""bad dreams,"" her utter disregard for anything that isn't ""Edward"" related, to her stupid ""I don't really like music anymore"" line. The character is clearly being made to relate to ""angsty"" teens, and at the same time generate sympathy from the viewer. It fails to do both. What is portrayed as ""true love"" is actually an obsession, and even if it was portrayed as an obsession this movie would still fail miserably. Secondly, Robert Pattinson isn't necessarily a bad actor, but his performance in this is incredibly wooden. While Kristen Stewart {Bella} overacts, he simply doesn't act. His lines seem to be devoid of all emotion, which sounds silly when he delivers the ""I love you"" lines. The movie practically has no plot, it's really a bunch of ""Edward/Bella"" dramatics. Even in the end when there's the big ""action"" scene there is no action. Edward basically get's thrown around the entire time, while Bella screams ""NO!"" Rent this movie for laughs."
"Blackbird8","2","5","7","25 December 2009"," So...you thought Twilight was bad?
","""You have got to be kidding me"" was the only thing my lips could murmur during my share of an hour and almost forty-five minutes ofnothing. To review this movie, first I see myself obligated of putting my general idea of the Twilight saga out there. <br/><br/>I read all four books (yesI actually did). When I read the first one I admit it became like a guilty pleasure of mine. It wasn't the best piece of literature to fall on my hands but heyit was sweet, sexy, tempting and dangerousall good fun. <br/><br/>I read New Moon expecting the same treatment to the story andsilly me. It as slow, boring and with a lack of creativity that just didn't make sense. This saga was obviously built to be just one book, anything that comes after that is a bad joke. <br/><br/>However, I had to admit that the minute Alice reappeared in the book the story picked up the spice it had had during Twilight. And I did enjoy very much the treatment the Vulturi plot gave to the Edward and Bella drama. During that last bit it became once again sweet, sexy, tempting and dangerousall good fun. <br/><br/>So I told myself that the movie was probably going to be just that: slow at the beginning and exciting at the end. But no. Almost two hours of absolutely nothing. Not only it was one of the worst plots of history (which is not the director's fault. We owe that to Stephanie Meyer), it was also one of the worst screen players in the history of adaptation. Why? You might ask, if it was a carbon copy of the events that took place during the book. Simple. There are only two things that save the Twilight saga books from being a chaotic literal disaster. One: is the structure of Bella and Edward as characters, very fictional and yet very human when it came to their interaction. It's delightful to read. And two: the dialog between the characters. It's rich, it's the one thing Meyer is really good with.<br/><br/>But the dialogs in this script were poor, little and at times so cheesy it really seemed like a bad joke. I can understand the target this movie was made for. But I don't think it's an excuse for corny dialogs, especially when the book is rich in that area.<br/><br/>The actingit was only okay. The main characters are still good actors but I'm beginning to feel sorry about Robert Pattinsonbecause the next two movies are not going to do him any goodat all, and that would be a waste since he's the one with the most potential. <br/><br/>For what is worth, the Vulturi scene was decent, but just decent, not extraordinary, not even great. <br/><br/>Go see it if you want, but if you're not a fan you might probably want to walk out of there after the first long, torturing thirty minutes."
"lord_kenzington","3","5","7","13 December 2009"," Don't see what all the fuss is about....
","Look it wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen but it was so far from the best, let down completely by the acting which for the most part was stagnant and horrible. Also the little things, like tender (supposedly) heart string tugging moments which is what this franchise should be aiming to nail on the head if they want to get any kind of recurring audience other than tweenie hormonal girls, seemed awkward and confusing. IF YOU LOVE EACH OTHER BLOODY ACT LIKE IT!!! I'd say if they want any chance of recovering their respectability, which I doubt they do, they need a decent director. Someone who has worked a successful romance before."

","I have never before been compelled to review a movie on this site, even ones I'm passionate about. I feel justified in breaking my silence to review ""New Moon."" Good Lord, where to begin.<br/><br/>First of all, I was bullied into going in the first place by a friend who is a closet Twilight freak. I myself can't stand the whole thing, but decided to go in with no expectations, i.e. I was willing to enjoy it if it proved to be remotely enjoyable. It did not.<br/><br/>The acting, as has been noted, was atrocious, but that's probably to be expected: Kristen Stewart is basically a cardboard cut-out of a pretty girl having a bad day. Robert Pattinson is handsome, it's true, but who can tell under the scowl and RIDICULOUS makeup? As for his acting... Don't hold your breath. As for poor Taylor Lautner... I felt like I was committing statutory rape every time he cavorted about half-naked. Isn't he like seventeen? How is it okay for a theatre full of housewives to drool over a child like him? I'm only 20, and I felt like he was a child prostitute.<br/><br/>There were so many awkward pauses I felt like I was in a centre for the incurably mute. In particular, please note the final ""scene:"" someone should time those pauses. Holy mackerel.<br/><br/>The story: blink and you'll miss it. What's that? movies usually have plots and characters generally have some form of imaginable motivation? Not in the bloody Twilight universe.<br/><br/>In short: Incomparably, unreasonably, wholly dreadful. Awful. Terrible. bad. The best part was the scenery, which was indeed lovely."

","First of all, I have never read the books - but I went and saw Twillight anyway, thinking that I'd perhaps read the books later. I didn't think the first movie was that great but it had some memorable moments e.g. the baseball game and awful moments, such as Edward's first reaction to Bella - when I saw that scene, I did wonder what's up with the guy? I thought Rob Pattinson's acting was awful in the first movie, he just mumbled through it. You might wonder why I decided to watch New Moon after that, well, I thought New Moon was going to redeem Twillight given all the hype. I must say, New Moon was Over-hyped. Rob Pattinson is an awful actor - he mumbles and aside from the hair, there's nothing endearing about him in the movie - I can't believe teenage girls are swooning over Edward when I can't see anything likable about him. Kirsten Stewart lord...where do I start. So wooden!! and Bella is such a tease for stringing Jacob along. The entire segment of her screaming in her sleep and going about lying on mucky ground - so over the top. I hope teenage girls out there are not taking her breakdown as being the norm -I can just see many cases of suicides because of this drivel of a movie.

"Ric-7","4","9","15","29 November 2009"," The horror! The horror!
","I saw the first film, basically for lack of anything else to do while on vacation. I saw about the first half of this one, before I decided to find something better to do.<br/><br/>Jacob and his buds chased Victoria from Forks ""up to the Canadian border."" Meaning they chased her out to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and they all dived into the water and swam out half-way to the border. Or maybe they chased her in a giant U-turn all the way around Puget Sound and up to Canada. Or maybe they took a Seattle ferry (eastbound is free) and they all did laps chasing Victoria around the promenade deck until the ferry landed and they chased Victoria up to Victoria (why the border? No passports?). This was one of the two interesting ""mysteries"" in this film.<br/><br/>Poor Bella. Her major B.F. is a vampire, and her substitute B.F. is a werewolf. And her father is oblivious. Doesn't know who his daughter is running with.<br/><br/>Vampires are apparently created, not procreated. A lifestyle ""choice,"" I guess. Whereas werewolf-ism is a genetic trait, apparently limited to teenage males of the Quillayute tribe. What I noticed was the vamps and the wolves dissing each other, using quasi-racist insults.<br/><br/>The pack of werewolves was interesting. Others have remarked on the Spandex. At first I thought it was a practical consideration, due to regular clothes being destroyed when the inner animal came out. But the CGI wolves were not wearing Spandex. And during one scene in which Jacob transforms, we actually see the shreds of his clothing flying off as he expands and changes in mid-leap. So when he changes back, where does he get the clothes? This was the other interesting mystery. I think the film makers cheated their teenage girl audience. Though it might be because Jacob won't be 18 until Feb 2010.<br/><br/>About half-way through, I could not understand why Bella was still interested in Edward, when there was a local teen wolf who had many admirable qualities and who loved her and he did not suffer from bad makeup. So I left. Maybe I missed the big scene at the end where Bella is bitten by a smart bug and develops some common sense and goes for the wolf. But somehow I doubt it."

I had my suspicion that ""New Moon"" wouldn't be any better than Twilight if not worse. I was right! One question though to the cast and crew: did you read the book? It would be really helpful if you did. Bella barely looked up at Edward in the movie though in the book she constantly reads his expression, meaning that she's actually looking at him! May be it's just bad acting... All of them. And why exactly Pattinson stands in the same pose over and over and over again? What's with the face? Have you ever try any other expressions boy? I feel sorry for the youngsters who admires these movies, 'cause it's bad ""art"". Then again, teen age will pass and there are good movies so our kids have hope. There were so many things that were not explained in the movie, it's really sad. Tough one for those who didn't read the book. Oh right, that's the cast! Bottom line: if you read the book, don't waste your time and money on the movie - you won't like it. If you didn't read the book, then you won't get half of what's going on and why in the movie.

","I was really excited about the release of this movie. I read all four books, and ""New Moon"" was definitely my favorite. Even though I gave this movie low marks, I'll try to be fair. I thought the CGI was pretty impressive. There was plenty of eye candy in the movie, too. Now, for the cons. However, cramming all of book two into a two-hour movie just tried to cover too much ground. They counted on one-liners to fill in huge amounts of the story. It left me feeling like I was reeling... jumping from scene to scene just to cover everything. As for the ""love story"" in all this... it was pretty lame. I agree with other comments that there was no real chemistry between Bella and Jacob, or Bella and Edward... or Bella and anyone. Kristen Stewart spent the whole film looking miserable, petulant, and even a little whiny. The way they ended the film really bothered me, too. I won't ""spoil"" it for any readers, but it was a total set-up for the third film. I hate when I'm conned out of my money just so Hollywood can make MORE money.

"phantom_fan89","7","27","56","20 November 2009"," Chris Weitz Saves Himself From A Mauling
","Weitz delivers a solid and faithful adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's insanely popular novel. Whilst keeping in tact much of what was good about the book, unfortunately a few faults were transferred over as well.<br/><br/>In New Moon Bella is left nursing a broken heart after her beloved Edward skips town. Fearing he was putting her in constant danger Edward broke of their romance, leaving Bella's childhood friend Jacob Black to pick up the pieces. As their relationship grows increasingly complicated, Bella is amazed to discover that Jacob is harboring a secret of his own.<br/><br/>The Twilight novels were always destined to work better as films than as books, mainly due to the fact that we are spared Meyer's unfortunate habit of waffling on e.g Bella's miserable, for the next one hundred pages I'm going to keep baffling on about just how miserable she is in case you missed the basic idea of the concept. Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg once again does a superb job of adapting Meyer's novels by snappily summarising the poorly paced book, mostly retaining the charm and skipping the yarn. Unfortunately like the book, the middle of the film seems to drag on, but this does seem unavoidable considering how true to events Rosenberg's script remained. New Moon is also flawed in the fact that, like the first film, many serious moments appear unintentionally funny which serves to dampen the quality of the picture.<br/><br/>After the relative Ishtar that was the Golden Compass, Chris Weitz has managed a return to form proving he can be trusted with a big budget and beloved source material. Weitz manages to retain much of what was loved about the first Catherine Hardwick adaptation-snappy dialogue with a unique balance of light and dark moments-whilst putting his own visual imprint on the film. Also remaining from the first film are the cast which has a lot to do with the Twihards acceptance of Weitz's vision.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart once again pulls of the inordinate task of making the insufferable character of Bella from the novel like able. Stewart brings a certain strength to the character that is sorely lacking in the books. Robert Pattinson however is devoid of the charm and charisma that made his first outing as Edward so memorable. In Pattinson's defence the character is chronically depressed and mopey throughout the film. However, as you watch the gamut of his acting abilities range from a frown to a scowl and back again you can't help but get the impression that he doesn't really want to be there, and considering the constant hysteria and media attention that plagues the actor's personal life, perhaps he doesn't. This film was Taylor Lautner's time to shine and he makes the most of his opportunity. As Jacob Black he brings great warmth and likability (as well as some crazy muscles) to the role that makes him a real competitor for Bella's affections. As an audience member you almost dare to think the impossible- perhaps Bella would be better of with this quintessential boy next door than the perpetual sad sack she pines for throughout the film. The rest of the supporting cast once again do well to add most of the comic relief to the film. New addition Michael Sheen as Volturi leader Aro proves why he is one of the most in demand British actors in the business, whilst child prodigy Dakota Fanning turns in a suitably creepy performance as the sadistic Jane.<br/><br/>New Moon is visually stunning. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe manages to give the dreary town of Forks a lush, almost otherworldly quality. The beautiful visual quality is emphasized when the story shifts to Italy and we are inundated by majestic scenery and vibrant colors. The only real disappointment are the quite poorly done CGI werewolves which looked about as real as Pamela Anderson's breasts.<br/><br/>All in all Twilight fanatics should be pleased with the latest installment and Summit Entertainment should sit back, relax and start counting the Benjamen's.

The story plodded along at a slow pace. It was just flat.<br/><br/>I did really like the special effects, they were a vast improvement on the first movie. I especially liked the wolves, I thought they were quite realistic.<br/><br/>I haven't seen too many films with Kristen Stewart, but my impression of her so far is that she is quite expressionless. I don't know if that is just the way she is portraying this character, but I always thought of Bella as someone with a little more fire. Kristen is just, again, flat. I can't get past her mono-tone.<br/><br/>Oh and another thing to note, I'm not sure if people who didn't read the books will be able to follow the plot.

","I am sorry to say that I went to see this movie. I thought the first one was rather interesting, so I read all the books, and thought that the next movies would be rather good as well. I couldn't have been more wrong. Both my mom and I agree that this movie is not suitable for children. It displays a young woman--Bella--falling dangerously in love with a vampire and when he leaves, she becomes depressed to the point of being suicidal. If this were a real person, she would have been committed to a mental institution because she displays the classic symptoms of borderline personality disorder. She shows no interest in friends, family, school, etc. It's not healthy for ANY young person to see this lest they think this is normal behavior.<br/><br/>The movie itself was downright dull. The first one had some action and it was worth watching. The actors barely had any lines. If they did, it was stuttering. I think Summit Entertainment did a horrible job with direction when they let Catherine Hardwicke go. At least she could come up with a story line that was more intriguing.<br/><br/>My advice? Wait until it comes out on video and rent it from $1 box."
"bigtrig21","4","8","13","5 December 2009"," Wow
","The first movie was..OK..it was bearable..but wow the acting was terrible! Between the serious monotone speaking of Bella and Jacob, it would put you to sleep! My sister is a big fan of twilight and the books and she even stated that the movie was completely dull. Now if twilight fans are saying that the movie was dull and boring, its kind of a big statement towards the movie saying it was weak.<br/><br/>Better wait for this one to come to your redbox in town if you want to see it, thats about all its worth. Ill go ahead and get star trek and watch that 100 times before this joke! Alice Cullen though..she looks good! Need more of her, but thats just my opinion."
"xMissMe","3","8","13","3 December 2009"," As a film and book lover i would have to say...
","New Moon, New Moon, where do i begin? Lets start with the actors, we all enjoy decent acting in a film, if its the most amazing story in the world, it can still be regarded as trash due to the actors. So Yes, lets start with them. The acting from Kristen Stewart made me want to gag i actually looked over to my friend and said very loud. 'They should have cast a monkey, it would have been more enthusiastic' This girl, uses Bella's 'Sadness' as a excuse for the fact, she only have 2 expressions in her acting vocabulary so to say, and for that. One tone. So Kristen for me, was the worst bringing the movie down, before it began. Robert Pattinson's character Edward, though absent a lot, when he was on. Nothing happened. This is meant to be a man tortured by his love, what does Robert look like? Pretty much a wet ass in need of a few more acting lessons. Of course, this may also be due to the script and can simply be misguided as bad acting though in this case, i doubt it. However Taylor Launter, vaguely saved this film from being killed. Being a fan of him since Sharkboy and Lavagirl and onwards though, we can see how this film is making him hold back his talent. On to the plot in general. Whereas the messages towards girls , that they cant live without a man, is untrue and bad for a teenage girl to watch, this story is pretty much a acceptance for twilight. Bella, whining, Jacob, the handy nice friend is there to save the day, Edward comes along, Bella OMG its Edward i love you. Go away Jacob. Jacob = Sad. The character is a horrid girl in this, and as for the plot itself, it doesn't develop in the book and it doesn't here, however the book provides more information...<br/><br/>Overall this film gets a 3. Bad acting, Bad script, cheap production. I could write more but my hand is tired and its nearing 1am here. I will edit and Add later. Pip Pip for now ."
"bennyisking","3","8","13","30 November 2009"," The Best Part of this Movie was the Trailer
","Where do I begin? Expecting to see some action as portrayed by the trailer I decided to go and see what I can now only describe as a very disturbed 12 year old girl's outlook on love.<br/><br/>Firstly If you want to see vampires fighting werewolves don't waist your time with this movie. There is no werewolf for the first hour and a half and if there is 1 vampire sighting outside the first 10 minutes it's a lot.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie is that it is a movie about vampires and werewolves yet not 1 person is killed or even hurt in the whole movie. Dracula was a love story too and people die left and right. SO the whole ""it's a love story"" argument doesn't work.<br/><br/>Vampires vs Werewolves??? In an argument maybe... There may have been a brief scuffle but nothing serious especially considering that there are 2 monsters 1 super strong super fast vampire and 1 GIANT wolf who are supposed to be FIGHTING over the love of a girl. Listen I'm not sure how it is today but in my day when I was in high school and 2 guys liked a girl we scrapped. Not saying the winner would get the girl but there would be a physical altercation not stair downs and threats and people walking away. Maybe that's why society is so sensitive right now. I'll tell you this much if this movie was made in the 80's-90's the body count would have been off the chart and the amount of fight sequences would have been ridiculous.<br/><br/>Now that I got that off my chest let me just say the violence would have been a welcomed distraction from the absurdity of this movie. ""Oh no! I'm 17 and I've already found the person I'm going to be with for the rest of my life but I can't be with that person so let me try and kill myself while my father sits around listening to me having panic attacks and does nothing."" Listen I didn't have a sister or anything but if I did and she decided to act like this I guarantee my mother would have beat the living sh*t out of her. I mean I think my mother would of beat her just for watching this movie then she would have beat me for letting her watch it. THis movie was Lame!!! and at the risk of sounding lame myself, what type of message are you trying to send these kids now days that if you don't get what you want out of a relationship you should just kill yourself??? Get over it they're 17, they don't know what the hell is going on in life. IN reality the girl would have been upset for about a week then she would have hooked up with whoever was available at the moment and forgot about the other idiot.<br/><br/>My final problem with this movie. Calling it a ""Romance"" or a movie about ""Love"" doesn't quite hit the nail on the head. It's more of an obsession and an unhealthy obsession. If your significant other throws themselves off a ledge, crashes a motorcycle and knowingly/willingly writes letters to a person who never gets them just to feel like they are close to you or to emulate some sort of feeling you give them your going to call the police and a psychiatric ward and have that person institutionalized. You may even want to get a restraining order on that person.<br/><br/>This movie gets a 3 just because the werewolf looks cool."
"screenwriterenator","3","8","13","30 November 2009"," Another Disaster
","Chris Weitz is a Hollywood disaster. Everything he does is a tragedy. The Golden Compass, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, and many more of his projects could have been a whole lot better. This is a person who can take a book and ruin it. You think somebody who would tackle big literary works would do a much better job but no. He was just part one of the disaster known as The New Moon.<br/><br/>The next part was the acting. You would think it would probably be better than the first one. If I had to choose between this and the Harry Potter movies..... I think the Harry Potter movies would win by a landslide. Honestly, the best vampire movie series to date is Underworld. I would like to see City of Bones as a movie. The only thing that tried to get the people not to think of the horrible acting was Lautner's well toned steroidal body. Even that couldn't distract how awful it was. I don't think they should make anymore of the series.<br/><br/>The third part was the screenplay. Are you kidding me? A little child could have wrote a better screenplay than that. The dialog was skewed and the actions didn't make any sense. The whole movie was consistent in sucking. It wasn't any good."

","As a starting point, i've read all the books (even though the last two were a bit weird and freaky)& seen the first film, which was indeed not very bad (probably that's just in my opinion but anyway)... As follows i wasn't waiting a lot but still hoped for something & i (in comparison to my little sister) really thought that it HAS to be good (at least because of the feelings all the characters are supposed to through - break-up, unhappy love etc.)... BUT back to the reality - film was very, very weak & mostly not even decent, what's actually a surprise considering all the money what's invested in it. & actually everything would be thousand times better, if the acting were at least good. Unfortunately, the acting was so bad (at least for some of the actors) that it made me sad & even sorry for them, because some of them seemed as to forced to say the lines and moved. OK, not all of them of course. I kind a enjoyed Jacob/Bella (acctually Taylor did pretty good job) story line (at least i believed them on the screen). To be honest, not Kirsten but just Taylor was good. I literally could not stand Robert (what is strange because i used to like him a lot in the first movie). The movie was the worst at the beginning (till he left) & at the end (when he returned). & this situation is a complete opposite to the book, because while reading it i felt vice versa. Robert looked either mad (completely nuts) or blank (most of the time). Kirsten was simply boring & without any emotions in the scenes with Robert. All the conversations between them looked as if they were talking about math or something even more boring. Taylor was surprisingly very good & he kind a saved the film (& Kirsten in some scenes). As about movie in general, i could say only that it was good that i was in the cinema, because otherwise i would have not watched it till the end or have skipped all the scenes with Robert & Kirsten on them..."
"bcrazey","4","8","13","27 November 2009"," What a let down....
","I hadn't heard of the books until I saw the first movie which I thought was pretty good. I then read all the books (twice) and was very much looking forward to New Moon as it was one of my favorites in the series and boy was I seriously let down. The film is clunky with absolutely no flow from scene to scene with a dialog to match. I was amazed that it was the same screenwriter. Weitz's spinning camera effects were enough to make you sick and the scene of Bella and Alice driving the Porche was so cheesy it was laughable. There was a reason why Hardwick turned down making this film which she said a quality film couldn't be made in that time frame - she was right. Summit is trying to rake in the dough capitalizing on the fan base without caring about putting together something of quality. Wake up Summit, your fan base will dry up pretty quickly when your putting out such crap."
"evelyn_evelina_eva","3","8","13","27 November 2009"," film totally fails emotionally - horrible score
","i was so totally disappointed by new moon. it has no soul, there's no atmosphere (that Hardwicke was able to create in twilight for example), there's no real suspense at all (and there would be sooo much potential!). one of the biggest disappointment was the score, which in my opinion completely fails to create any kind of the right mood... =( i mean it's supposed to be a deep movie, loaded with emotions, serious tone... people were laughing in the cinema (but not because it was supposed to be funny), the film just gets ridiculous too many times. it's just really missing the passion and the emotional load. =( if they could only do the score again - i believe this is one the major weakness of the movie. it totally misses the point of the story, in every single important scene - it's completely detached from the action, doesn't fit at all. it's more like a classic epic kind of music (totally flat and boring) - it really doesn't do the story justice. the soundtrack songs saved some scenes though, thank god. the overall impression of the film is its emotional emptiness. there’s no real coherence between the scenes, it’s cut off from one scene to another too abruptly too many times. you can’t really feel the development of characters’ feelings etc. you can’t really feel for them. it just remains flat in all aspects. i just can’t ignore the feeling I got watching this movie that they just wanted to include everything they thought is important in the book, important for the story (providing all the facts) but not letting the characters to develop in depth – which is most essential for the story – to feel the emotional load… the film just rushes through the story line. even in most critical and emotional moments of their lives Edward hardly even approaches Bella, they’re standing strangely remote and apart from each other, and when they do kiss, then the music fails, or, the previous and following cut destroys it…and so on. another thing that really bothered me was the bad taste in design of the birthday party and of the clothing of the Cullen family. it just doesn’t do them justice. Alice’s clothes are just downright ugly and the decoration of their house is just a disgrace. anyone with just a little taste would agree, i’m sure. it’s really a pity, cause the story is bursting with potential and the film just suffocates it. i think they should redo it. at least do a new score to bring some emotions to life!"
"distribution-593-36379","4","8","13","27 November 2009"," Well...not good!
","Well,i had read the books without being a huge fan or anything but i so far was disappointed from both Twilight movies. Twilight for me was one of the worst movies of 2008,maybe i had too many expectations from New Moon,i don't know and was disappointed in the end. Firsty i think Kristen Stewart is a terrible actress.She just stood motionless and boring throughout the film causing my constants yawning when she should have dazzled audiences with pain and sorrow.She had the whole movie on her back and wrecked it. Robert Pattinson was kind of improved in my opinion since Twilight but nothing dramatic...Awkward and indifferent. Taylor Laughtner on the other hand i think was very natural and cool in his role,especially during the period of his transformation.I wish they had him shirtless in less scenes so that he had a better an opportunity to be remembered for something else than his abs. Thank God for Billy Burke and Michael Sheen!!!I thought i would cut my veins without those two in the movie.Though i expected the role of Aro to be more...frightening? The screenplay was awful just like in Twilight,did not expect much anyway! However i liked the music very much and in my personal opinion it was a good call to replace the director.<br/><br/>Anyway that's all from me. 4/10 max..."

I've seen the first movie, haven't read any of the books, but obviously my girlfriend has. She ensured me that it would be good, as some of her friends have seen it and were delighted with how good it was.<br/><br/>They either watched a different movie for two hours or have some insane blind loyalty towards the books and films.<br/><br/>The acting was non existent and awful, there were about six expressions shared amongst everyone on screen. The story was full of holes, also extremely slow in places and in other places felt extremely rushed, as though the people making the movie couldn't be bothered. Very disappointed.<br/><br/>I wish I could get back the two hours I wasted watching it and the money I spent on it."
"afterdays","1","8","13","26 November 2009"," Gave me chills..oh wait ,that was the cold theater
","I'm giving it one cause that's the bare minimum. After hearing soo much about this i decided to see it after work, So i started the movie then went downstairs to see why people were flocking to this. After wasting 2 hours of my life away, I can say this is definitely for young girls, or those people that read those harlequin romance novels. This movie was 2 hour soap opera, and was REALLY boring.<br/><br/>The Character Development? if there was any seemed to set up a Love triangle between Jacob, Edward and Bella, But the marriage proposal sorta squashed that idea. And for two movies now bella has wanted to die. for love of god won't someone oblige her? Depressing is an understatement pertaining to this movie. Everyone seems like they're gonna cry at the drop of a hat. The Acting as exciting as watching grass grow. The CG werewolves looked like big overgrown husky dogs, nowhere near frightening. The constant apparitions of edward every time bella did something dumb were annoying, and waaay overdone.<br/><br/>The bright spot if Any was Taylor Lautner's portrayal of Jacob, as he seemed to be actually NORMAL until he starts jonesin for Bella, then automatically he turns wooden, and depressed, and boring. Maybe it's bella's gift..The vampires can't read her soul, or hurt her..why? Probably because Bella's not real, just Carved of wood. No wonder why Robert pattinson seemed like he didn't wanna be there, it's hard to act in the woods, when the trees have more personality. overall the movie was completely predictable, and I feel sorry for all the boyfriends who had to sit through this with their girlfriends. but he maybe it was a price to pay in order to see ninja assassin, or something.<br/><br/>Boring, entirely predictable, and as unentertaining as the first one. but what do you expect from a movie based on the nonsensical writing of hack writer stephanie meyer."
"estewan_cito","4","8","13","26 November 2009"," disappointing, but
","OK, where to start? I've read Twilight and New moon and I'm not a fan of the series, but I think they are OK. However, I have to admit that I was expecting something else from this movie and that I was totally disappointed by the bad acting of the lead actors and the cheesiness of their lines. Besides, I don't understand why the action sequences were so short. Every time there was an action sequence and I was beginning to feel excited it was abruptly cut and I have to stand Bella's expressionless face and depressing lines over and over again. I was also very shocked by the poor camera work in this movie. If we compare this movie with the previous one, we can easily notice that the previous director (Catherine Hardwicke)was more adventurous and did a great camera work and some of the shots were just amazing. However, I have to admit that Taylor Lautner surprised me because he was the only one who didn't look like he was just reading and delivering lines without understanding what he was saying. To sum up, New moon was too lame, too cheesy, too mediocre and absolutely overrated."
"l-scarff","4","14","26","22 November 2009"," Nice effects, shame about the dialogue.
","Okay so I'll first admit that I am not a fan of Twilight. I haven't seen the first film or read the books. Neither do I indulge in any of the teenage-girl drooling over Robert Pattison.<br/><br/>But I'm not one to judge without trying, so when a friend asked me along to New Moon I went along with an open mind, willing to pick up the story as it went along. Seeing all the hype around it, I hoped it would be an exciting ride.<br/><br/>Oh boy.<br/><br/>And here I can review without the taint of obsessed fan-girl love or by comparison to the books. I will just review New Moon as an independent film. It is weak with a capital W-E-A-K.<br/><br/>The script sounds like it has been penned by a 12 year old girl who still fawns over boy bands and watches Disney movies. It is just a set of cliché after cliché, without any real character development. Unsurprising however, as the majority of the actors appear to have been hired based on their appearance rather than their acting credentials. The two leads especially did absolutely nothing for me, and the main male characters just spent as much time as possible with their abs on show to distract you from the lack of plot.<br/><br/>The plot itself, without giving anything away, is just a weepy mess about a girl who can't look after herself without some mysterious guy running to her rescue every 5 seconds. Yawn.<br/><br/>One thing. The special effects were pretty stunning, especially when it came to the werewolves. But I think that may have had something to do with the millions of pounds they threw at this film, shame they didn't spend more on the actual script.<br/><br/>Not anywhere near worth the hype it is afforded."
"Leofwine_draca","3","6","9","13 July 2013"," Not my sort of film, I'm afraid
","TWILIGHT: NEW MOON is the follow-up to TWILIGHT. I hated the first film; I'm not a teenage girl so it just didn't appeal to me, and the kiddified romance just rang hollow from the outset. NEW MOON seeks to develop that story, and also to explore more of its supernatural world, but it's just as big of a bore as the first film.<br/><br/>The plot, in essence, sees Robert Pattinson's Edward go off in a huff, leaving Bella (the ever miserable, one-expressioned Kristen Stewart) to hook up with werewolf-on-the-quiet Taylor Lautner. If you're a fan of bad acting, check out the incredibly wooden Lautner, who somehow manages to seem like a sissy and a little girl at the same time. I never thought I'd be longing to see Pattinson back on screen, but believe me I was.<br/><br/>The tiresome, overlong love story is punctuated by moments of expository back story (which are equally dull) and a few half-hearted action sequences, clearly directed by someone with no understanding of how action works. There are halfway-decent CGI scenes involving werewolves which are fun if cheesy, but as a whole this is perfunctory teen-friendly fare with nary a moment's danger or intrigue to propel it forward."
"HelenMary","4","6","9","20 May 2013"," close to the book but not great a film. annoying & frustrating
","The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD).<br/><br/>Like first book in the series, the second film sticks closely to the books. In the book it works better than on screen despite the cinematography being very attractive and it's a nice film to watch in terms of the view. However the acting and lack of engaging script let the film down and it's a shallow experience. The interaction with Bella and Jacob and his family is the best, and the whole Cullen family scenes, but all the Edward angst and back and forth is just painful. It is in this film that we first meet the Volturi and whilst they are supposed to be scary they were a little too camp but it was interesting to see their workings and history. There's a lot of CGI that works to varying degrees of success, but sets and costume designs etc are good. Edward's desire to keep Bella safe are admirable in the book but in the film the lack of communication - dialogue - between the two is just plain frustrating and annoying. Jacob was the sanest thing in film number two."
"degenerat3","1","6","9","3 January 2012"," Bella, the miserable human, is left by the ""over-protective"" vampire
","First off I will start with the fact that this movie seemed to last not a couple of hours, but more like a couple of long, long, long days...<br/><br/>The main character - Bella starts to realize that she is going to age and Edward...well, he's just going to remain the ""handsome-vampire-she- thinks-he-is""...Now this is very frustrating for our main character because she's afraid that she will lose him, because of losing her looks and eventually one day dying like a normal human being. So she has a birthday and becomes an 18-year old... Gets a paper cut, Jasper attacks her, Edward pushes her away (in fact, quite strong), she gets even MORE hurt and he attacks Jasper...<br/><br/>I believe this is just the beginning of how completely boring and weird this movie was. <br/><br/>During the whole movie Bella is THE MOST BORING CHARACTER !!! Not to mention completely stupid. Edward is acting like a little child (more like a little girl), not knowing what he wants, trying to prove his overly ""deep"" love for her by...leaving her. Amazing. Bella decides to become an adrenaline junkie because she sees his image (another really stupid decision)when she's being threatened or scared...or jumping off a cliff. <br/><br/>None of the scenes were connected in any way. Everybody was doing something and in the end you couldn't really understand what exactly was going on. I found myself lost in the beginning of the movie and even more lost at the end of the movie. I couldn't really get the whole ""deepness"" of the relationship between Edward and Bella. Or not to mention her even weirder relationship with Jacob - the wolf guy. None of the characters became sympathetic to me. I found myself wanting to grab a gun and shoot Bella...or tell her to get over Edward...and Jacob ( who is acting even weirder than Edward at some point). I have had it with these almost-kiss scenes. The fact that vampires appear out of nowhere at times when you don't get the whole idea with what exactly is happening. I mean it's like...you finally try and understand why Bella is behaving like this, why Jacob is being so mysterious and BOOM!!! A vampire appears out of nowhere - ex. Victoria...or Alice...or the Will.I.Am. guy. This is completely WRONG and at some point disturbing. I mean, you ask yourself ""AM I insane or is this movie just pointless?"" <br/><br/>And it actually is. Bella misses Edward, Edward leaves Bella after he knows that Victoria will come back and try to kill her, he tells her not to do anything ""reckless"" after he himself tries to get killed... (I'm not going to comment the vampire society because it was the biggest load of **** I have ever seen in a vampire movie (except for ""Blade"" maybe...where the plot was actually even more interesting). <br/><br/>Jacob becomes really annoying too. ""Remember the story I told you, Bella...when we were at La Push..."" God, EVERYTHING in this movie is SO CONFUSING and with the story being some weird version of ""Underworld"" where vampire and werewolves are sworn enemies it becomes even more painful to watch. Why couldn't Jacob just go to her and tell her that Edward is an idiot for leaving her and he doesn't deserve her after deserting her. WHY!? Was it so hard? Is it just that he doesn't want her that much. What is with that secret society of werewolves?! Okay, that's it...Watch the movie and see for yourself but I recommend you don't."

","When Hayden Christiansen gave his robotic performance of Annakin Skywalker he was widely panned and ridiculed.<br/><br/>Double standard. I actually believe Kristen Stewart achieves the Keanu Reeves Hall of Fame for non-expressiveness in this movie. Watch her panic as she runs towards Edward. Then watch as she sorrowfully sits in a chair by the window. Same face. I actually forced myself to rewatch a few ""pivotal"" scenes and yup. No change of expression. Nada zilch. How did she get into Hollywood anyways? She's not even that good looking...<br/><br/>Anyways, on to the review. As with most sequels the 2nd one tries to amp it up a notch. In this case Twilight was an absurd movie, changing all the rules for a vampire to the point where I expected the Cullens to wear red capes with blue tights and a giant S on the front. They can fly. Their skin turns into diamonds in the sunlight. Absolutely ridiculous. Completely ignore the vampire lore from the past century and makes it up as they go.<br/><br/>Now they do the same for werewolves. No full moon? No problem. Watch as Jacob turns into a werewolf while leaping in mid air to fight a vampire. Yup. Suddenly a werewolf's primary source of prey is a vampire.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much it. Not much story in this one. I really hope I don't get forced to watch the third one.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality here is the campy performance by Michael Sheen. Sure it's over the top. But hey, who says a vampire has to be sullen, depressed, and expressionless all the time... oh, right. The Twilight series...<br/><br/>3/10"

He spends half the film falling all over Bella and the other half telling her to leave him alone while being shirtless.<br/><br/>As for the special effects werewolves, half the time they looked huge and in other scenes looked just a little bigger than a dog. Also, so much more should have been done with the werewolves.<br/><br/>Then I thought the ending was horrible. Bella and Alice go from her bedroom to Italy in a few seconds to rescue Edward.

Because of our low expectations it surprised me that it was at least somewhat entertaining, although far from a masterpiece. <br/><br/>So when New Moon came out we decided to go. I can only tell you I'm not making that mistake again. Basically, Bella and Edward part at the beginning of the movie and this kick starts a very long depiction of how sad this makes her. We get to watch incessant scenes of her crying, not leaving bed, looking out her window, etc. Meanwhile all the boredom is only broken by extremely cheesy scenes and lines like her getting a minor cut while riding a bike which immediately prompts the teen wolf she was with to take his shirt off for some reason. <br/><br/>Then Bella goes to Europe to save Edward who is about to kill himself and some more cheese is handed to us. Seriously, I actually laughed at some of the things that came out of their mouths. <br/><br/>Never before this movie did I hate the main characters and actors so much, I was actually rooting for the bad guys.

Perhaps it is but surely this is an insult to their intelligence. <br/><br/>I very often can get a good laugh at a badly scripted movie, but not this one. Ironically there is a scene in the movie of three characters going to see a guns all out blazing movie. One of the characters is displayed with a look of disgust on his face as he watches the nonsense on the screen. But how come I was saying to my self I wish I was watching that one. Anything but this.<br/><br/>My brothers 12 year old warned me not to hire it on DVD. I should have taken her advice."
"MovieProductions","5","6","9","30 June 2010"," Neither better nor worse than its predecessor
","** out of (****)<br/><br/>Chances are, your feelings toward the film ""Twilight"" will match your feelings for ""New Moon"". Mine sure did. This film basically did nothing for its predecessor, which is a shame since the trailer looked somewhat decent. I thought that maybe an above average Twilight flick would make its way, but I guess that's too much to ask these days. The characters are surprisingly more stale than before, although this movie is a little more interesting. For everything that is in this movie that was better than Twilight, there is also the opposite. However, the special effects improved slightly and fortunately we get more action than romance. Still, this movie is basically neither better nor worse than ""Twilight"". You can take that as a complement or a negative, and you know which side you're on. <br/><br/>""New Moon"" revolves around Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattison). Edward leaves Bella in the forest and now Bella is all alone. However, she meets Jacob (Lautner) and gradually develops a crush on him. Although, Edward returns and Jacob has a secret: he's a werewolf.<br/><br/>I think it's kind of humiliating that a director gets a better script, yet makes a film that's on par with Twilight. I mean how could this have not been good? You have werewolves vs. vampires. That sounds cool already and imagine the type of execution that Scorsese can make *faints*. Folks, if you think this latest installment is impossible to have worse acting and dialogue, then you are dead wrong. Yes, it might seem improbable, but the performances and dialogue have gone from beyond awful to officially the worst I've seen. Moreover, I thought the first hour was way too boring and a chore to sit through. <br/><br/>Now, there are some redeeming qualities. The technical aspects have improved. Not by much, but a sufficient amount. Moreover, the last hour is actually watchable. The action here is also not too shabby. Also, I thought that the story was slightly more interesting. <br/><br/>""New Moon"" is basically on par with ""Twilight"", but that isn't a complement. Both films boast decent technical aspects and interesting stories, but also boast terrible performances with an awful script. ""New Moon"" is neither a bad nor good film and compared with its predecessor, it matches its film quality. This weekend, I'll seek out ""Eclipse"" and see if that film can break the mediocrity streak. Hey, David Slade is directing. If the third installment is even just the slightest better than ""New Moon"", I'll be satisfied. Until then, this is my review of ""New Moon""."

","Well, this is 2 more than I gave the first movie.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book - of the comments that I've read, if you've read the books you seem to give it a higher rating.<br/><br/>I found the storyline incredibly hard to follow. Most of the special effects were really bad and were akin to the d-grade movies of the 50s.<br/><br/>The scene where Jake turns into the wolf above Bella was great - except that all the wolves, which weren't meant to be scary, looked disneyesque. They all looked so cute and cuddly that they weren't remotely scary. When Jake turns into the wolf to threaten Robert Pattinson, it looked like it was a dog wanting to be patted.<br/><br/>It got more interesting when it moved to Italy - the Voltari bit was the only bit in the movie that had any real tension. But how they got there was weird. One minute she's in Forkes, the next she's in a car in Italy with no explanation of how she got there.<br/><br/>Despite it being done by a different director, it still has the same bad makeup. The vampires' faces are painted white,but their necks are normal colour. But the funniest is that they'd painted stripes on Robert Pattison's body to make him look more muscular (a common Hollywood trick) but instead of making him look muscular, it made him look like a skinny guy with stripes painted on his body."
"TheLittleSongbird","4","6","9","5 April 2010"," Okay, but disappointing
","The first Twilight film was pretty good, while not necessarily being my cup of tea. It wasn't a 5-star masterpiece or anything like that but it was watchable. New Moon was okay, but its many problems make it disappointing too. I am one of those who hasn't read the books, but I have friends and relatives who have and while some say the books are good and the movie keeps to the style if not the details of them others say both the books and films are not good. My sister belongs in the former category, though she remarks that the book New Moon was her least favourite of the series and yes she liked the movie. I didn't like the movie as much as her, it had some good moments but it felt dragged out and unconvincing.<br/><br/>I will say there were some good things. There are some scenes in the film that are quite nicely shot, with some decent cinematography and lush scenery, plus the CGI wolves and the special effects in the fight sequences were fairly impressive to say the least. Secondly, Alexandre Desplat's score did have some pleasant parts to it. I will not say that it is particularly memorable or anything like that, and Desplat has done much better work before, but there are some themes that are very nice, particularly Hearing Damage. About Chris Weitz, initially I thought he was a curious choice for director, as I know him best from The Golden Compass, which I admit was a better film. But while he lacks the style of Catherine Hardwicke, he does a decent if not entirely exceptional job directing.<br/><br/>The quality of the acting was uneven, at best it was decent, at worst it was wooden. Taylor Lautner was not bad at all as Jacob not to mention incredibly hunky and handsome, I could tell he was trying to bring some life and momentum into this film and it showed, and Robert Pattinson was a marginal improvement from the previous outing as Edward. Dakota Fanning despite her role being brief is fine as Jane even if it required a lot of staring. Billy Burke is also amusing as Charlie, his and Lautner's acting came off best. Michael Sheen is a great actor, he was perfect in The Queen, and while he has an intriguing and imposing presence he does have a laugh that is quite irritating, even more irritating than Tom Hulce's laugh in Amadeus. However, I wasn't impressed at all with Kristen Stewart as Bella, her facial expressions are limited and her delivery didn't convince.<br/><br/>Other than Stewart's performance, there are other things wrong. One is that the dialogue is incredibly corny and disjointed. Second, the chemistry between Bella and Edward is non-existent, it is better with her and Jacob but it still feels awkward. Thirdly, the story drags so much, not much happens, and when you think something exciting is going to happen, it is just another dragged out scene. I think the most exciting the film got was some bike stunts and some werewolf-vs-vampire scenes. Fourthly, while the scenery is nice, the editing and transitions from scene to scene was rather choppy. Fifthly, the pacing is quite pedestrian, the first 20 minutes or so were so slow moving I almost bailed out but decided not so as it isn't really fair. Finally, the ending, way too abrupt. When Edward said ""Marry me Bella"", then pause, then finish, I was like ""That's it?"" I even re-winded to see if I had missed anything, no I did not.<br/><br/>Overall, it was okay, but it wasn't really my cup of tea. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
"kosmasp","4","6","9","23 March 2010"," Could've been
","First of all, I haven't read the novels/books, so I can't say how close this is to the source material. I've heard that, the first movie (Twilight) didn't bring everything from the book onto the screen (which makes sense, because otherwise the source material would've been really slim/weak). While we had our introductions in the first movie (and I'm assuming you have either seen that or at least read the book), we should be able to have more ""fun"" with the characters this time around ... well if you thought that, than you are very wrong!! <br/><br/>The things K. Stewarts character (Bella) has to go through, come across. But while some additional stuff has been made up (or so I've been told), that wasn't in the book, to have a ""special"" character with more screen time, this all adds up to a pretty dreadful experience.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't really top notch from part 1. There is no reason for that. And I think the only one coming out of, mostly unscathed, is Taylor Lautner. And the girl who played in ""Up in the Air"", forgot her name. But that's more due to the movie ""Up in the Air"" than to her role in this one.<br/><br/>While nothing much is happening (not only acting wise), the movie still tries to be as dramatic as it can be. The problem being, it isn't at all! And while there are a few nice action pieces, the whole thing feels utterly ridiculous, which makes it quite hard to really enjoy it. Again though, as with the first one, this was aimed at a female audience group and if you saw it in theaters, than you might have heard quite a few of them screaming. There is one ""special"" scene that really made them happy ... and some guys too (although they might have been cynical)! While the scene as it is, didn't excite me and influenced my vote directly, the impact it has/had, does reflect in my vote, as well as the fact, that the target audience seems to love it ..."
"blacklist-1","4","6","9","23 March 2010"," Still bad in a lot of ways, But this is better than Twilight!
","I saw the first film Twilight when it came out and absolutely hated it. From the acting to the story and special effects to the script and dialogue. I promised myself I would never ever see New Moon. I broke that promise as I saw it at my university at the film society with friends who were girls who begged me to come along. I was bored at the time and it was free and thought I could just fall asleep or maybe laugh at how awful it is but heavens above! This was actually mildly enjoyable! What has helped maybe I don't know is the new director Chris Weiz who took over from Catherine Hardwicke. The main problem still with the last film that hasn't changed is the acting from Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. It's still really awful. There is still no chemistry between them and Stewart with her character of Bella is still boring and won't smile and just broods about. The two actors can't seem to finish a sentence without pausing awkwardly as though they have forgotten there lines. What Stewart and Pattinson need to do is eject more emotion into there voices that would convince me that they care about each other. Weiz has failed to instruct the actors more. The script and dialogue don't help as it is corny and clunked. Though less so than in Twilight that is an improvement. Another criticism is that the guys in the film always seem to have there damn shirts off. Have they heard of a shirt? Now obviously it's done because the teenage girls love it but logically within the realism that should be apparent in the film, it's just silly. Guys no matter if they are werewolves or vampires don't run about with there shirts off! But that is a minor criticism. Some of the music was also cringing, particularly one track that was played a couple of times when Bella was missing Edward, the girl couldn't sing!<br/><br/>However one big improvement is those special effects, they were much better! Because more was spent on the film. When the guy Jacob and his friends transform from human to werewolf and vice versa was impressive to watch. I also did like some of the music as well. But the best thing about the film, which made the rating even this high was Taylor Lautner who played Jacob. His acting was surprisingly good. There was emotion in his voice when he talked to Bella and told her how he felt, which made me believe he really did care for her. (Take note Stewart and Pattinson) Other actors in it like Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Michael Sheen as the vampire Aro and Anna Kendrick as Jessica who is Bella's friend make the most of there tiny cameos. In the end New Moon was watchable but still too long. I would be willing to see the third one and hope that there will continue to be improvement, hopefully with Stewart and Pattinson's acting. If it does get better along with better dialogue and script (though in New Moon it was better than Twilight) I would give it a higher rating. This is bad in a lot of ways but there have been improvements and are some good things about it. Believe me I'm surprised I even mildly enjoyed it. Let's hope the third continues on the road to improvement."
"mariesun","1","6","9","6 January 2010"," I just feel like crying...
","First of all, I am pleased to say that I may be the only Brazilian girl who's not in love with Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, and, of course, the Twilight saga (both books and movies)... I seriously think that the book is poorly written and definitely improvised, knowing that Stephenie Meyer has NEVER SEARCHED anything from VAMPIRES (the main topic in the books), and just pretending that she invented all the vampires mythology, she made a vampire that SHINES. A vampire that can HAVE SEX with someone... a vampire who's got a CHILD. And Bella, STOP talking about Cathy and Heathcliff. They're awesome, which you and Eddy will never be. <br/><br/>OK, but that's not my point. Kristen Stewarts acting AND face just scares me. Taylor Lautner was actually good, although his character hasn't helped at all. Robert Pattinson was just fine in Harry Potter. But once again, Edward came into him bringing JUST AWFULNESS.<br/><br/>And SO, SO bad directed! I really feel like crying. And WHY are people in love with that?! WHY?!<br/><br/>(Sorry about the mistakes, as I said, I'm from Brazil)"
"guttesisse","3","6","9","27 December 2009"," Horrible
","After seeing Twilight 10+ times I was really looking forward to see New Moon. Teasers and trailers only helped on that part... I thought they looked amazing. First scene took off and I thought 'this should be good' but I couldn't have been more wrong. From the scene where Charlie wishes Bella a happy birthday and onwards it just went downhill with only 1 good scene - the wolfs chasing Victoria. The acting was horrible especially Kristen Stewarts. It was so bad that she actually annoyed me at the ending, left me wishing that they would replace her in the following movies. Being a die-hard Rpatts fan his acting was the one I anticipated the most and I must admit that he also failed horrible. Both looked like they were wishing they were elsewhere. But what disappointed me the most was that Chris Weitz made in into a 'comedy' perhaps not intentionally but none the less.. everyone was laughing at certain scenarios and lines and it made me quite sad since that totally ruined the purpose off the film - which is to follow the book which isn't the slightest bit funny. I even went to see it two days in a row hoping it would change my mind, unfortunately it only got worse :/ What makes matters worse is that my favorite book and most anticipated movie is Breaking Dawn and I've read that Chris Weitz also will be directing that one and I can only hope that he won't ruin that as well"
"Bunty-at-IMDB","5","6","9","19 December 2009"," Better then Twilight, but nonetheless bad
","After watching 2008 adaptation of the first part of Twilight series, I hardly had any expectations from this film. This film has several new entries in the series - director Chris Weitz, cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe, music maestro Alexandre Desplat and notable production designer David Brisbin. But alas, these people were not able to improve the bizarre story of the franchise.<br/><br/>New Moon, starts off with Bella's dream of herself being old, and Edward being young. She is worried that she will lose her beauty, and Edward, being a vampire will remain young forever. Anyway, I won't go further into the story as it is really very dumb and uninteresting.<br/><br/>The film is full of cheesy dialogues, cringe-worthy scenes and over the top acting. Kristen Stewart can't act. Robert Pattinson's acting is as cold as vampire blood. Taylor Lautner is just present in this film to show his six-pack abs. Actors like Michael Sheen were like sunshine in the storm. <br/><br/>Melissa Rosenberg's script is pretty weak. It leads to nowhere. The film itself ends without any conclusion. The new moon ends without turning into full moon.<br/><br/>Only good thing about the film is better cinematography than the previous one. Alexandre Desplat music is too good to be in this film. Visual Effects were better than Twilight, but again, they were never 'very good'.<br/><br/>Overall I think New Moon will be enjoyed by its target audience. Other than that, I think it will fail to impress other range of audiences. It is a film full of clichés, horrible acting and terrible screenplay.<br/><br/>5/10"
"rperez14-608-667897","3","6","9","14 December 2009"," What the Hell?
","To be honest I only read the first book and although it kept my attention in the beginning it quickly lost my interest as did the two movies made so far. ""Bella"" is a human doormat with no personality what so ever which begs the question why does ""Edward"" find her interesting other then the fact that he cant read her mind (not like there would be much going on), so Kristen Stewart was PERFECT for the role because she cant act to save her life and (yet in real life she comes across as being a stuck up bitc# for god knows what reason but I guess beggars can be choosers). As far as Robert Pattinson goes at least he's tolerable to watch other then that good lord gain some real muscle Kristen was buffer then he was. Taylor's acting for the most part was gay the lines shouldn't matter its the actor who sells the words and he didn't do a good job, he should have worked harder on his acting instead of focusing on JUST his body which I will admit was VERY impressive. The other actors who played the wolf's should have joined him at the gym because they all with the exception of ""Paul"" look fat or out of shape really they did. As far as special effects go they looked way better in this movie which Twilight really lacked, Van Hellsing looked more realistic then the special effects in the first movie. Inconsistencies were very apparent, in the first movie ""Laurent"" didn't look white at ALL nor did his eyes stand out as much as they did in New Moon, also the cullen's eyes are ridicules I mean who doesn't notice a person with yellow almost cat like eyes? And the film maker should have explained it better for people who have not read the other books. It doesn't make sense how Bella isn't affected by any of the vampire's powers yet Jasper is able to manipulate her emotion in the beginning when Alice gives her a gift or the fact that Alice can see her future. This movie drags in the beginning and then jumps and skips in the end horrible (alice just stealing the car, how?) I know that some directors will pick unknown actors for their movies (X-men) but seriously there's a reason some actors aren't well known and obviously they didn't take that into account when they hired most of these ""actors."" All in all New Moon was better then Twilight ONLY because they had better special affects and soundtrack. The chemistry between all the actors sucked almost as much as the chemistry in the Star Wars movies 2 and 3 (Hayden Christiansen and Natalie portman). So honestly people don't waste your money on this movie unless your a teenage girl with no common sense or depth."
"eyecandyforu","3","6","9","6 December 2009"," ""Oh look, I have a paper cut""
","The juggernaut that is The Twilight Saga rolls along with it's latest entry, New Moon. Basically a study in repressed teen sexuality the story, which involved four novels could have easily been shortened, but that would have meant less money. New Moon is what I would call a ""filler"" film, stretching an already interminable plot out to the point that we might as well know what every character had to eat, day by day. Kristen Stewart plays Bella, a rather bleak girl who is transplanted to Forks, the town that gives new meaning to boondocks. But wait, this isn't just any Nowheresville, it's full of vampires and now, werewolves. Vampires have always represented sexuality, but Miss Meyer has decided that it's time for vampires to go to the teen scene. Didn't we cover that pretty well with a girl named Buffy? I fully expect some clever writer to next make millions off of vampires in pre-school. Sex is hidden as rage and depression, frustration and angst all under a supernatural veneer. Take away the fantasy and you have a story that would flop even on Lifetime. This is of course not the real world, so it's entirely acceptable for a young girl to have practically every male in her community want her, whatever their supernatural inclinations may be. Forget about the fact that Bella has no charm or charisma whatsoever, she smells good. But Bella is safe in her knowledge that she really, really loves Edward, a creature that is not only over 100 years old, but for all intents and purposes, dead. It helps that Edward is good looking, I seriously doubt the dynamic would work without that little detail. I kept wondering why any immortal would constantly attend high school, decade after decade. Isn't there anything else more interesting to do? Travel the world? Discover a cure? In this entry we also get Jacob, who was introduced sparsely in Twilight but has now grown into a Chippendales hunk who gives us two versions of hairstyles to choose from. He and his pack of woofy wolves do not like shirts. Conflict ensues. Bella seems bright and mature but does not exhibit any signs of either. She throws herself between Nosferatu and Werewolf, ceasing their super strength fighting with a flick of her hand. She stands among a coven of the undead (who are celebrating her birthday for God's sake) and makes the idiotic mistake of holding a finger up and announcing that it's cut and bleeding. At one point she takes every opportunity she can to risk her life, a nice little lesson for girls in the audience who have been jilted. She is either the most oblivious mortal that has ever lived or some sort of conniving vixen, hell bent on driving her menfolk insane. A large chunk of the film is Bella brooding that her corpse lover has left her. Jacob the hunky dog boy jumps in, trying to cheer her up and thus get her... It's all played out very romancey and sweet, with almost no violence. The story hinges on a precarious line between what can and cannot be. This is easily solved by Bella's decision to convert, which flies in the face of any common sense; the age old concept of laying down your life for the one you love it turned on it's head and comes across as laughable. Is there a witness protection program for new vampires? Does she love her father? Finally, toward the end of this torturous thing some pretty cool vamps show up and get all vampy like you would expect them to. I just wish that SOMEONE had said ""Edward, you must grow out of this school phase, get on with your undead life and drop the downer girl. Now run along, you have hunky dogs to kill."""

So a good start.<br/><br/>Now i haven't read any of the books - just the hype from friends, and young female friends of the family. As a film it was poor, very poor. <br/><br/>I have a female friend who hates the whole series and does her impression, it goes a little like this: ""I love you Edward, I love you to Bella, oh Bella i cant live without you, I love you so much Edward"" and this is pretty much the 1st 30minutes of the film. As stated by quite a few people with some of the worst acting seen on the big screen since.....well....the 1st twlight film. <br/><br/>The next 40/50 minutes is a very boring outing about Jacob and his back ground story. Which again sees some very strange acting, mood changes and poor story telling.<br/><br/>It then ends with the most interesting part of the film (last 20minutes) which tells you the most information the whole film, and the revelation and relevance to the story is very good with some nice action.<br/><br/>This i feel was a total lose of opportunity - seems they were after purely the 12-15year old girls with a poor script, poor acting and general bad production - the only plus i could see and which was done OK was the induction of 5 buff young men which will keep the young girls/older women happy. When compared to such a film as titanic which imo was a very successful mix of romance and action and worked for men and women of both ages.<br/><br/>New moon? i think more PMT!!"

She is a beautiful young woman, which you acknowledge inwardly, but that's all you get for 2 hours. Whatever else she has performed successfully, or not, does not matter. I went to see New Moon, and I wanted to see acting in New Moon.<br/><br/>She has virtually the same expression on her face throughout, which is boring, and that defines her performance: boring. She can't deliver an intelligible line to save her soul, which drove me to distraction in the first movie (the constant blinking tic is gone in this movie, small relief). She still mumbles the ends of too many sentences. If speaking at the speed of light is a skill, that she has. Maybe you have to be a vampire to hear her.<br/><br/>She does serve the purpose of making her male co-stars look better talent-wise, and that gets everyone more excited to see Edward or Jacob in her scenes. However, she brings the movies down, and really makes them less than their potential, which is a real shame because the books held a lot of promise, but they do center around the feelings of Bella, and Kristen Stewart apparently has none that she can deliver, save ennui."

I've read all four books of the Twilight series and liked them (except for the last). But what reads well, doesn't PLAY as well in a movie. I actually broke out laughing when someone said to Bella (with a straight face) ""Werewolves aren't the best people to hang around with""...and SHE'S a vampire!!! The plot twists and turns that read so well in the book just did not transfer well to screen. Also the movie was far too long and moved slowly. Even worse, the sexual appeal of Jacob and his brothers was never played up--in a film aimed at a female audience! What really hurt this however was the acting. Kristen Stewart was TERRIBLE as Bella! All her line readings were wooden and her face never changed expression--not once! Lautner was only a LITTLE better than her. Pattinson and his family were great--but they're hardly in the movie. On the plus side the CGI werewolves were impressive and a fight between two of them was lots of fun! But, all in all, the slow pace and dreadful acting really sink this one.

The only thing that can actually keep you in your seat, besides your girlfriend :D, is this overly exaggerated drama that you can make fun of. <br/><br/>So... my point is, if your girlfriend's dragging you to this movie because she likes that Robert Pattinson dude and you can't do anything about it, at least trick some of your friends in to joining you and make fun of those ""almost kissing"" scenes where little Meg Ryan wannabe(Kristen Stewart) almost has an orgasm :)"

I wouldn't complain that the plot was awful and the actors seemed to be tired of the roles. I want to say that there were enough male striptease, so I was satisfied ;) But we must note that after Jacob's inflated shoulders the Edward ones looked skinny. At the end of the film I lost the line and couldn't even understand who was who. Can anybody explain me who were amazing people in the castle? To sum up, it's not very awful.

","I watched the movie with a friend of mine who has never read the books; she watched the last half of twilight and didn't like it much. Basically, she didn't know much about the series at all. So from her enthused reaction to the movie, I knew I wasn't being bias because I'm a fan. The chemistry between Taylor Lautner and Kristen Stewart was much better than I was expecting-beating out what we saw between Pattinson and Stewart in the previous movie. The acting was not God-awful but could have been better, and I have to admit that I had a few ""I could have said that line better than that"" moments. However, even the acting is a big step up from the last one. Especially from Stewart who had me cringing at her deliveries in Twilight-I was embarrassed for her. Lautner however steals the show. Pattinson I think does well but was not given much to work with. His character requires that sort of constantly in melancholy, internal battle, unrequited love embodiment, and I think he does that well. The effects were very impressive. Chris Weitz does an amazing job. He exceeded all my high expectations, which is definitely saying a lot. The story is heartbreaking, and yet light humor throughout keeps the viewer's heart from being completely crushed to a pulp; this statement maybe more true for the female viewer-ship though. I loved it. Everyone who was in the theater with me loved it (though I wish they would have kept it to themselves while watching). If you have an open-mind for fantasy, and not a complete cynic then you should love it too. It stays true to the book for those who were upset over changes in twilight. 9/10"

","No more movie critics. No more boys and girls who aren't fans of the books commenting on this film. New Moon is not meant to be a standalone Forest Gump. No more complaining about how bad a film is just because one doesn't see the appeal that others do. New Moon was first and foremost a Book. So that'll be enough complaining about 'too much eye candy and sexual Angst' because the writing is where details are. In the Books, Not the 2 hour long film, one will learn why it is such an epic struggle for the characters and why each long drawn out scene fits perfectly and is necessary.<br/><br/>My question is how were so many people confused about this film. The Name is not deceptive. EVERYONE knows that this film is the second in a series. EVERYONE knows what the theme of this film was going to be... Who would STILL be ignorant enough to go to this film with expectations of anything else? So everyone needs to stop illuminating their idiocy by continually whining about how bad this film was.

The same book series, same cast, different director.<br/><br/>""A New Moon"" was an absolutely worthless pile of drivel. Endless repetition of moaning and staring into empty space, dry dialogue with absolutely no purpose an nothing conveyed, and absolutely laughable sequences of terrible special effects, all took serious camera time while the plot (which was similar in depth to the first installment - take that as you will) all seemed to happen off camera. The relationship between whats-her-name and the werewolf boy was developed in 5-10 minutes with virtually no dialogue, while we were treated to 10 minutes of whats-her-name staring out a window and no less than FIVE sequences where she woke screaming (no different dreams, no dialogue, just whats-her-name tossing in bed then screaming).<br/><br/>This movie SUCKED.<br/><br/>If you were modestly entertained by Twilight, stand forewarned...

","Now, I am not a sexually frustrated, misogynistic guy writing pottymouthed rant because girls drool over Edward Pattinson and Taylor Lautner. And I love lush, otherwordly quality of good vampire movies - gorgeous fruitcake beauty of Coppola's Dracula or wonderful Hammer Gothic are first examples coming to mind. I have not even problem with idea of mad love, described as ""abusive"" by so many - forbidden love which does not care about conventional ideas of right and wrong is classic theme. Unfortunately Twilight Saga: New Moon is just... inoffensive bore at best. Yes, it is clean, cgi wolves are cute, and those vampire rules... for Heaven's sake, you stupid people, stop moaning over vampires who do not burn in sunlight: every book, short story, TV series and movie has their own rules, and vampires of folklore and classic literature like Dracula and Carmilla walked in sunlight before 1922 Nosferatu. However, love triangle between human girl Bella (Kirsten Stewart) and two boys, vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is told with all the lush, otherwordly quality of yours truly making coffee. Mad love between Edward and Bella is so boring, that their can't-live-without-you dialogue does not work. Yes, words are there, but they ring hollow. Nor filth nor gem thus 4/10."

","I don't like the books. I read them and they are rubbish IMHO. Then I watched Twilight and LOVED IT.<br/><br/>This movie ruined all that. The plot goes too slowly, and then too quickly. Some key scenes were so anti-climatic you really felt deflated, like you were melting into your chair trying to get away from the screen. Don't even get me started on how disjointed the plot was laid out. If you haven't read the books, you'd be completely and utterly lost, it doesn't stand on its own two feet.<br/><br/>Kirsten Stewart gives us the same looks as in Twilight, looks like she forgot to act like her character had grown. The performances by Jackson Rathbone, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are commendable though, especially Rathbone, adding many more layers to his character whilst still portraying his true nature accurately and with flair.<br/><br/>The only parts that saved this movie were the man candy, and the plot progression. I'm still really excited about where the story is going, I just hope the next movie does it justice.<br/><br/>Don't wait for the DVD - its worth seeing those hawt men on the big screen, but lower your expectations first so you're not as disappointed as I was."
"DeltaNu","10","23","48","20 November 2009"," If you loved the novels, you'll love the film!
","I just read through some ""professional"" as well as viewer reviews and as I suspected they were mostly negative.<br/><br/>Well, I am going to review this film while keeping in mind who it was intended for: Teenage Girls. Now the novels happened to appeal to a much larger audience than that, which is why so many people were super-excited to see both Twilight and New Moon. That doesn't change the fact that the whole story is still intended for female teenagers.<br/><br/>Is it long? Yes. Is it very slow paced, with many intense emotional moments? Absolutely. The film follows the book. If Weitz had changed the story to match typical film structures or left out the readers' most favorite parts, a gazillion people would have been disappointed. I think it's better to have some old haters mock the movie than die-hard fans be disappointed. The movie is not an artistic masterpiece, but it's not supposed to be. It's not trying to win an Academy Award, so I don't judge it by comparing it to those kinds of movies.<br/><br/>As a fan of the series, I loved the film. Weitz did a great job turning a novel that basically describes feelings into a film that entertains every second of its two hours. Technically, Weitz far surpassed Hardwicke's Twilight as well. There was one awkward cut to Edwards face that threw me off a little, but that's nothing compared to all the technical errors in Twilight. There were several references to the first film that gave the two movies a connection. I appreciated that, especially since the director changed. <br/><br/>As before, the actors have a great chemistry. And especially the three Volturi and Dakota Fanning were awesome new additions. Too bad there's not enough time to properly flash out every character. Rosalie and Esme had about a line each.<br/><br/>One reviewer said that it is almost impossible to follow New Moon without having read all the books. That's probably true. And if you haven't read the novels, Bella's illusions and the wolves might even be comical to you. And you might roll your eyes at Jacob's nakedness even though that choice had nothing to do with wanting cause hysterics among the teenagers.<br/><br/>My opinion is: If you loved the novels, you'll probably love the film."

My boyfriend compared the movie with a design kitchen set in 1999 -stainless steel every were but no reflection what so ever.

","A simpler titling of the first two instalment of the Twilight Saga movies could be ""Twilight: vampires"" and ""Twilight: werewolves"". But this is not a complete symmetry, as Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) tells Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) at the end of ""New Moon"" that if she has to make a choice, it will be Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). But I should back up a little.<br/><br/>Picking up from what was left off in ""Twilight"", this second instalment takes some time in developing Edward the vampire's agonizing internal struggle that culminated in his leaving Bella, making her believe that she'll never see him again. Then it's Bella's turn to agonize over whether to accept Jacob's love, fearing that this would end up in losing a true friend. Director Chris Weitz did take his time with these languid, melancholy establishing sequences.<br/><br/>Things do pick up when, by accepting Jacob's love, Bella soon finds that her nightmare is repeated. Jacob is a werewolf. But at least he cannot turn her into one. Just as this relationship sees some tantalizing possibilities, the vampires return – not Edward (at least not yet), but the bad ones that want to kill Bella. Things do pick up now and the rest should hold your interest to the end, and beyond, obviously – ""Eclipse"" has been scheduled for 2010 summer release.<br/><br/>The dialogue sounds like something that could have easily been written by a computer program (and not even ""AI"" grade at that) but don't matter an iota when it comes to the young cast's ability to charm the adolescent (be it calendar-reckoned or at heart) fans. To the rest of the world, there are two bright spots: Martin Sheen as vampire elder Aro and now teenager Dakota Fanning making a brief appearance as cool-as-cucumber vampire Jane, almost like a trailer for her appearance in the next instalment ""Eclipse"". In fact, that is what this entire movie does – setting up the scene for the human-vampire-werewolf triangle. I recognize this intension don't have much by way of complaint except one: why make it so darn long (well over 2 hours)?"

I could not have foreseen the horror.<br/><br/>The dialogue is horrifically infantile, the acting is about as good as my elementary school play (not very good) and the overall plot seems to have been written by a 13 year old angsty goth girl with a bad case of borderline.<br/><br/>All in all, this romance novel for early teen girls made me want to gouge my eyes out and I tried to pierce my eardrums with a drinking straw but it was a big straw so it didn't fit.

","Oh wow, where do I start? Let's see, the main things that went wrong with this movie:<br/><br/>First of all, for a movie to be effective, there needs to be an effective beginning/middle/end. This movie DID have these, but they did NOT fit together. It was all over the place, for God's sake! I can't explain it very well, you just get the feeling that all the scenes were so unattached..you end up feeling that this movie was incomplete. Also, so many unexplained things! I can imagine that if I never read the book I'd be confused as hell. For example, they never explained Bella's ""visions"" (if you will) of Edward..how she saw him when she had an adrenaline rush. In the book they specifically said he wasn't actually there..she was just imagining. I can imagine being just a little confused if I never read that in the book. Now, the soundtrack! Ohhh the best worst part of the movie. During the most crucial, action-packed scenes (eg. Jasper attacking Bella for her blood) they put god damn Tom and Jerry music. It seemed like a joke rather than a very serious part of the movie, come on now! And the main twilight theme wasn't even in the movie! Not once! I don't know about you guys, but this is the song I was looking forward to the most..They played it over and over in twilight, which is why I assumed it was the main theme...nope, didn't even have it. Bummer. Some scenes just dragged on and on and were way longer than they need to be. It got boring, even the title took half an hour to show up as ""New Moon"". I hate to be a complete Negative Nancy, so I gotta say that this movie was not entirely bad- some scenes were very entertaining. I enjoyed every minute when the wolves were on screen, those were incredibly well done. I loved everything about them.<br/><br/>But generally it still wasn't effective and was poorly produced...4/10. Please get the director of Twilight back, this one is no good.."

Speaking of Hollywood, this is just another cliché teen drama. It insults the intelligence of even the most shallow of teen fans, predictable to the end. And seriously... what's with the sparkles? Are these vampires or fairies?<br/><br/>I propose a new story.

","I'm reading through these comments and I am just... I don't even have a word. People upset about the long opening of showing the title... wth? What did that matter? It's quite a petty point. The eyes that they changed, which I had noticed from the trailers, I actually really liked. It was more of what I pictured in the book... and at least they didn't show any closeups that literally showed the contact lines like Twilight. Yes they went through things a bit choppy and quick relying a lot on the readers of the book, but they tried to put in as much from the book as they could. I found it extremely easy to follow and felt it completely put Twilight to shame (which I love so don't go down that road.) I don't know anyone that walked out of that theater disappointed. <br/><br/>I found the acting very well done, so I don't understand that either. Kristen pulled me into every scene... her devastation was obvious and her transformation from zombie to some what normal as she hung out with Jacob was very apparent. Her screaming from her sleep was quite realistic. Robert's dialog was emotional... which is what the whole book was about. The character Edward chooses his words wisely because he doesn't know what Bella thinks and knows she usually comprehends it the completely opposite, hence the pauses in between lines. The conversations in the movie were word for word from the book. Some people complain about Jacob taking off his shirt... saying they just put that in there... but that's what he did in the book. Some people didn't like the ending... but that is how the book ends. <br/><br/>I just don't understand what most of you are talking about. I went into the movie with High Expectations and found the movie exceeded them. Most of the comments I'm reading are from people that didn't even want to GO to see the movie. I feel like they don't like the actors that play the part for whatever reason and their opinion of the movie is bias. Perhaps my opinion is bias since I read the script and knew exactly what to expect, but I LOVED the movie. I LOVE the books. I LOVE the story and I left that theater euphoric. If you want to see a movie with bad acting go see 2012... which is all CGI and nothing else.<br/><br/>And just in case someone wants to go down this road... I am 27, I read a lot of books most vampire based. I'm not some 12 year old that will swoon over any hot guy. I watch and read for the story which I love and I am just baffled by these people complaining. I just don't understand.<br/><br/>Add On Next Morning: Okay now that I have sleep and I'm no longer illusive... I still say that the movie was unexplainably fantastic. I take back absolutely nothing I've said, but there was one thing that I realize in my sleep that they cut too short. And this is NOT a spoiler because 1. if you read the book you know what I'm talking about and 2. it was in the trailer. The one thing, and it is pretty obvious, that they shortened was the race to Italy. They go from Forks to Plane to Porshe in literally seconds... even cutting out the line from the trailer when Alice is warning Bella about the Volturi. That is the one and ONLY thing that they messed up and I will admit it's a pretty big mess up... but by no means did it ruin the movie in anyway.<br/><br/>ROUND 2: Took my mom to see the movie today and tried to go in with the perspective of all the people that said they were disappointed trying to scrutinize the movie to every last detail, because I want to understand why you guys were so disappointed and why you were thinking about all these petty things. Well with as much of a bad attitude I could find to go in to see this a second time in less than 24 hours. Do you know what I came away with... the disbelief to how so many people could find so many unrealistic and unreasonable reasons to not only be disappointed but to not even enjoyed the movie. I can honestly say that I don't know a single person that came out of either of the showings unhappy or disappointed in ANYTHING except that it came to an end. In conclusion... I just don't get it. <br/><br/>And so this ends the best to my ability a very complete review."

","This is the second episodes of the love story between the vampire boy Edward (Pattinson) and his human girlfriend Bella (Stewart). One of the many problems of this movie is that it is not a standalone peace, and even if it is based on book it should be. The editing and the screenplay are so in-cohesive, that one can only conclude this movie was made dollar signs in eyes after teenagers (parents) money. If one is really a hardcore fan, this movie might be OK just having the word Twilight in it, but others including those who actually liked the book, it will leave cold. The only two good scenes are in the last part of the film, the Volturi fighting scene and that other in the end of the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is very clinical, full of awkward moments and unintentional humour. When in the first Twilight one could smell the rain and moss, in this it is bleach and fish. The first Twilight movie had some sense-emotion-tempo element in it, but the New Moon has none of these; first it is too slow and in the end they had to rush to tell the tale. It is difficult to say if the director and actors actually failed, since the dialogue and original story were so bad. <br/><br/>In the beginning vegetarian reptile eyed Edward and the Cullens leave Bella because of a small paper cut incident and blood. Yes, it is well known fact that in the world of vampires women don't menstruate. Think how awkward that lunch would be. The loss of love of her existence starts her depression and boredom of the viewers. The appearance of melancholic and sleep deprived Stewart actually fits in as a heartbroken Bella. Then comes Bella's chase for astral Edward, meaty puppy Jacob (Lautner), vampires trying to kill Bella, hairy wild hogs trying and killing a vampire, Bella trying to commit suicide, Alice, Edward trying to commit suicide, orange eyed vampire monarchs Volturi trying to kill Bella (because she knows they are really drinking carrot juice, seriously; there are more scary creatures hanging around subway stations), someone in the theatre thinking about committing a suicide, Edward protecting Bella, Volturi trying to kill Edward, The Fight Scene, Alice, Jacob trying to ..., nobody kills Bella and Edward...Saldo one dead not so known non–vegetarian vampire.<br/><br/>The only emotion what is left from the book is Bella's depression. The other pivotal emotional cornerstones are lost in editing. Also Bella's help to hold on, the book's carefree and sunny, crack-up-a-little-bit-of-a-jerk Jacob is in the movie this overly serious bulked-up piggy boy turning into a werewolf,who talks about ever-nether stuff, pushes his jaw down and stares over the forehead, and takes off his shirt, and takes off his shirt, and takes off his shirt... supposedly this should have been a kind of a romantic-sexual chemistry. Instead it looked like a baby brother was trying to do his big sister in his hormonal outburst. Awkward. <br/><br/>Same take-out of all the playfulness and replace it with muscles and angry-simpleminded demeanour was done for the werewolf pack. In spite of being a great admirer of the male beauty, it just went over the top. These guys looked like they have gone through clonal selection creating an association if Quileite men ever consider breeding with anyone else than they first cousins. This together with hanging around only pants on gives again one of the movies unintended humorous associations. If Jacob and others would have started to sing YMCA and sniff each other's behinds, it would have been relief of the monotony. The CG-wolfs looked more hairy piggies than dangerous werewolves, but this might have been intentional; the Christmas is good for the toy market and fluffiness sells more. <br/><br/>There were just no surprises. All possibilities to keep the book's storyline and in addition to explore some other characters point of views than Bella's were not used. They could have made sneak a peek into Volturi ranks, or show the fear in Jacob's first shape shifting. Now poor Stewart had to be in every scene and eye and mind just would want to have a brake sometimes. <br/><br/>Shortly, this movie is like a salad; some lettuce, one year old herrings and pieces of carnivore meat in it. If viewer enables to eat through the smell and awkwardness, s/he might find a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on the bottom."

And it is much better than Transformers 2 or GI Joe. <br/><br/>However, in the end, a good movie is a good movie. A bad movie is a bad movie. This seems to succeed as neither. <br/><br/>The first movie had its charm. But at times it was painfully under produced, directed, etc.,. This sequel unfortunately keeps a similar mood. <br/><br/>At issue is Kristen Swan. She was decent in the first film, but she is in almost every scene in this movie, with the same expression. It's tiring. Perhaps I should be easier on her. Very few actresses can hold a movie at age 19. Except Keira Knightely, Scarlett Johansen, Ellen Page......see my point? Poor casting. <br/><br/>This continues with Robert Pattinson, who looks like James Dean, and seems to emulate Hayden Christenson in Episode 2 and 3. See the big problem? <br/><br/>Fortunately, there is Jakob, played by Taylor Lautner. He keeps a strong character (and strong physique) in his scenes. He is believable as a teenager in love.<br/><br/>The direction has no inspiration, the scoring is relies too much on pop songs, and the script is rather poor at times. As someone who loves movies, I am upset to see film studios rake in movie bucks for a lackluster product. This is the second time this year, with the embarrassment of Transformers.<br/><br/>But this is an event. The teen girls love this.

","Twilight:new moon provides the viewer with an eye pleasing cast (especially for the females) that unfortunately give a callous, hard and feeling less performance.

The long dragged film is all to familiar, pathetically predicable and ordinary. The film is flat and unsubstantial with no twists or turns to be surprised by. Due to the familiar plot the next step can always be predicted accurately before the sequence of events begins. The audiences minds remain dormant throughout this film with no imagination needed and no complexity to think through. Everything is handed to the viewer on a plate and fed straight to them allowing for the audience to sleep through the simplicity of the film.<br/><br/>Who is Bella? she wishes to give her soul for a lifetime of love with the vampire she longs for.

Without all the vampires and werewolves this film would have been the simple love story seen so many times and quite probably the better for it however with the vampires the film tries to grow a new dimension. It seems to end up confused between a thriller and a a love story. Unfortunately due to this cross and confusion the film is unnecessarily extensive, slow and to put it bluntly BORING!"

","OK I understand that these books have sold millions of copies and there are people that are to the point of obsessed with them (I consider myself one of them actually). However I have also seen more than enough movies to know that you can't expect a movie to be much like a book, if for no reason than books can tell you the internal motivations of any character they focus on, which movies can't do. Also take into account that it is a 600 plus page first person narrative (as in told from Bella's perspective only) and that makes it nearly impossible to convert accurately to anything resembling a movie unless you turn it into a 10 hour miniseries. So they changed the order of some things around, added a couple of things to make it a little more visually stunning for the movie person that hasn't read the books, and dropped a whole lot of stuff just so they could get it onto a movie screen. I think they did an excellent job of condensing it down and still keeping it coherent and somewhere within the themes of the book it is based on. The acting is generally good, especially Taylor Lautner as Jacob, who it the character the whole movie hinges on really, because if he wasn't such a strong presence the whole concept would collapse. Kristen Stewart who plays Bella even manages to be interesting, which is something of a feat considering she spends probably 80 per cent of the movie in something resembling a clinical depression. It is certainly a movie I will be adding to my collection when it makes its DVD release and I enjoyed it immensely."

","Let's see, where to begin...<br/><br/>I hated the first film and thought, hey I might as well venture along to see this one. I figured there was no possible way it could be any worse than the first with the budget and hype and all.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong. The film was probably in the worst 10 movies I have EVER seen, especially with the promotion and money put into production. The acting was HORRIFIC. The smaller roles actually did a fairly good job of developing their own characters with the writing constraints as bad as they were, but the main characters (the main 3) DO NOT KNOW HOW TO ACT! Why? I haven't the faintest clue, but I'm telling you, the only reason they are in the movie are for the whole ""sex appeal"" thing. Did they even have to audition besides taking off their shirts? Honestly, no character development, excessively cheesy one-liners, and NO EMOTION WHATSOEVER.<br/><br/>The script was terrible also. The actors, even if they were outstanding, could not have saved the writing. No plot progression. It spend a good portion featuring her staring a motorcycle, then decided to completely skip any explanation and jump into a cheesy romance line designed for impressionable adolescent girls. I have not the books, so following the plot was quite difficult. It was altogether absent from the movie. Quick synapse of the movie: Kristen crying over Robert at one point, and showing no expression of emotion at the rest. Kristen staring at Taylor, Taylor taking off his shirt, Kristen blinking rapidly in Italy, Rob throwing out a few lines of how much in contrast of the rest of the movie he actually is, and then Kristen running back to him while he stands hunchback and glares at the wolf. Not much of a plot. And besides the obvious fact, that vampires firstly do not exist, but are in fact portrayed as creatures from h**l, it seems that the author and the screenplay writer are creating a sort of delusion amongst teenage girls. Whether they understand that this is NOT HOW LIFE IS or not, it's NOT HEALTHY to be that obsessed over a stupid fictional story. <br/><br/>Women often say men are shallow, but I vouch that anyone who truly enjoyed this movie on the basis of ""romance"" (to which there honestly was little), are the shallow ones. Little girls screaming at Taylor taking off his clothing was about all the romantic content in this movie, apart from Rob existing for the majority of the audience.<br/><br/>Any good points? The backup characters. They did what little they could to lend themselves to the film. Is it worth seeing? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Thankfully, I did not waste my own $10.00 viewing this catastrophe.<br/><br/>I frown upon anyone who views these Twilight films with cult mannerism. It's one thing to love cult movies such as Anchorman, Fight Club, or even the recent Men Who Stare at Goats, but this is so poorly written I would hope and pray that all these spoiled, impressionable teenagers would open up their eyes and take a little look at what life really is."

","For teenagers whose movie knowledge only reaches up to Mean Girls it's OK, but don't watch it when you know a good movie from a bad one. <br/><br/>I got dragged to this movie by my friend who is sort of a fan. I downloaded the first movie and thought it was horrible. New Moon was a bit better, but still not in let's say Harry Potter's league. You read on the internet and papers that the chemistry between Robert and Kristen is so good. It's not. I haven't seen a single emotion on Kristen Stewarts' face the whole movie. Pattinson mumbles in a way that is hard to understand. Only the smaller parts were OK, Ashley Green did a good job and so did the rest of the Cullens. Bella's friends were also fine. Taylor Lautner had a tendency to overact, but was also believable. <br/><br/>From the trailer I gathered that the first movie was sort of like the introduction and this movie would be faster and more action and more emotion. Boy was I wrong. It's just as slow as the first one and the action was, well, nothing. The Vulturi fight looked amazing in the trailer, but don't be fooled! Everything you saw of the fight in the trailer (6 seconds) was what's in the movie. <br/><br/>Me and my friend just couldn't get over the fact that Bella is such a bad example for teenage girls! She gets dumped incredibly rudely by a (in my opinion not so attractive) vampire who leaves her and all she can do for months is cry and cry and cry and shout in her sleep. We were like: Hello! the guy is a jerk, get over it! But unfortunately she didn't. She also gets extremely suicidal over her 'loss' and does extremely dangerous things because then she 'sees Edward again'. That was really pathetic. I haven't read any of the books but that was the worst storyline ever. You already expect us to believe in vampires, but I will not cross the line of fantasy in believing that she can see him when she breaks her promise. <br/><br/>Good stuff, was the wolves. I really liked the gang of wolfs, the interaction between them, the friendly ways. The transforming was also done great. I would have liked to see more of them instead of Bella's mourning. <br/><br/>I just have to say one more thing about this vision of Alice of the future. Why o why did they show Edward and Bella dressed in, I don't know, middle-ages clothing and jumping around in the woods? The WHOLE theater was laughing at them. Not good. <br/><br/>When you like the books, sure go and see it. When you like vampires, go see it. When you like Taylor Lautner, go see it (that's why I went). But don't expect quality in this movie. You'll only be disappointed."

","Don't get me wrong ~ I enjoyed the first movie, and it adapted the book well, but this feels like a proper FILM in its own right. Beautifully shot (Bella's depression after Edward's departure contains some particularly lovely camera shots and editing), well acted and paced, it doesn't feel like a concept film, like the first did.<br/><br/>It tells the story well, but not in a way that excludes first time viewers or non readers, and the actors all have a handle on their characters. The supporting cast are well realised - from Jessica Stanley to Emmett Cullen, it all feels a little more detailed. The music is fantastic, and I have to give a shout out to Taylor Lautner who was brilliant. Exactly as I imagined Jacob.<br/><br/>It's not perfect - in my opinion Kristen Stewart has still not made Bella sympathetic enough; but perhaps I'm just nitpicking. All in all - pretty darn fab."

","The Twilight Saga [2]: New Moon (2:10, PG-13) — Other: Romance, biggie, sequel, OSIT romantics<br/><br/>In The Grand Jubilee (1981), the middle book of Suzette Haden Elgin's Ozark Fantasy Trilogy, we meet Responsible of Brightwater, age 15. Her far-future world is run mainly by the grannies, who disdain men as hapless tools of testosterone poisoning and who can think of no more contemptuous put-down of any woman than to say ""She just can't cope."" Young Responsible need not be concerned that anyone would ever think that of her, as she is highly competent as well as responsible.<br/><br/>In contrast, we have Bella Swan, 3 years older than Responsible as this movie begins, a hapless drip, slouching thru life without direction or visible competence at anything except mindless devotion, mooniness, and wounded-doe looks. I kept wanting to shake her and say ""For goodness sake, girl, stand up straight! Get a grip!"".<br/><br/>But no, Bella (Kristen Stewart) has been abandoned by her One True Love, the 109-year-old teenage vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) because (a) he fears that his presence will bring her danger, (b) he dreads staying young as she ages, and (c) the latter can be avoided only if she becomes a vampire too, but that would cost her soul. So he bails, and she spends endless hours pining soulfully away, interrupted only occasionally by phantasmal images of Edward warning her against the various stupid decisions to which she seems prone.<br/><br/>Things brighten up for Bella a bit when she renews her acquaintance with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a 16-year-old Indian lad who attends school on the nearby reservation. They spend a lot of time hanging out together in the most platonic manner imaginable. It gives away nothing you didn't already know to say that Jacob (like many other young men of his tribe) is a werewolf, and these guys have tempers that sometimes make them as dangerous as vampires around a paper cut.<br/><br/>Drag, drag, drag, big face, drag, drag, pine, pine, pine, soulful glance, big face, soulful glance, overripe lips, slouch, big face, pine, drag, drag, drag.<br/><br/>Bella finally reconnects with Edward in Italy, where he's gone to ask for death at the hands of the Vulturi (vampire aristocracy), having been misled into thinking Bella is dead. (Any echoes of the opening references to Romeo and Juliet being, I'm sure, purely coincidental.) Here we encounter Michael Sheen, the Alcibiades of the undead, moonlighting (heh) from his role as king werewolf in the Underworld series to switch sides and serve here as Aro, duke of the vampires.* Aro is suitably oily and sinister, and his investigation of Bella reveals that she isn't subject to any of the normal vampire powers (such as Alice's precognition or Jane's telekinesis, heretofore unsuspected talents in the vampiric repertoire). This is our 1st glimmer of any degree of competence on Bella's part.<br/><br/>Director Chris Weitz and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg spend no significant time reintroducing the characters, evidently figuring (probably correctly) that 99.99% of the people attending this movie had already seen Twilight and/or read the books. But this leads to a curious distancing from the characters. They remain beautiful, but it's harder to identify with them, and the innate interest of the basic plot doesn't suffice to offset this tepidity, let alone the glacial pacing.<br/><br/>FWIW, I gave Twilight a 7, and this one gets a 5 mainly out of inertia and good will, but the series is headed the wrong way; #3 (Eclipse, due out June 30 next year) needs to pick up the pace to avoid total snoozification.<br/><br/>––––––<br/><br/>*If the 2 vampire vs. werewolf franchises ever get into trial by combat over rights to Sheen, I'd put my money on Kate Beckinsale over Kristen Stewart any day; Kate can cope!"

","The following review may contain moments of satire and SPOILERS. So read at your own risk.<br/><br/>As I sit here on the couch with my laptop, just having returned from a showing of New Moon, I was curious as to what others thought of this adaptation of book to film. I just read through several pages of reviews which I found hilarious.<br/><br/>First off, many of my friends who already attended showings earlier in the week spoke very highly of this film, even having read the book. I also have read the book and I must say, what on earth? The dramatic scenes of this movie were quite boring, yet made for an entertaining evening in ways it should have not. I do not regret spending money on this movie, for the fact that it was so poorly done that I even chuckled at parts which should not have been deemed funny (ie, the unnecessary taking off of the shirt done by Taylor Lautner).<br/><br/>I can see how this film would attract young teen girls. The men were obviously good eye candy, but they provided not much else besides this. I fail to see what Kristen Stewart brings to the screen as well.<br/><br/>I will admit, the film follows the book rather closely. But, I never said the book was that great either."

","I freely admit that, despite my having a more than passing acquaintance with vampire and werewolf movies over the years, the fact that I am a 57 year old straight male means that I am probably not part of the target audience for the Twilight Saga. Not to worry, the cinema was full of female pubescent teenies. And me.<br/><br/>I also freely admit that, not only have I not read the books, I have no plans to do so. I did, however, see the first movie. Accordingly, I shan't be addressing ""this didn't happen in the book"" or ""they left this bit out"" - I shall simply be commenting on the movie.<br/><br/>As I recall from the first one, 107-year-old Edward is a member of a family of ""good"" (ie. they don't feed on humans) vampires. Seated next to new girl and terminal miseryguts Bella at high school, he is so taken with her sullen demeanour that he absconds and treats her very rudely, just to show her how much he instantly loves her. After initially misinterpreting his rudeness as rudeness, she comes to realise that the irritation she thought she felt is also actually love, and thus begins one of the great classic (and highly improbable) romances of our time, Part 2, New Moon (a title which has no significance whatsoever) starts with Edward being beset by guilt. Bella wants him to turn her into a vampire but Edward, not wanting to destroy her immortal soul, dumps her. He goes off to mope around the world while she takes up with the local werewolf. As you do. Meanwhile Edward, under the mistaken impression that Bella has died, seeks permission from the Vampire High Command to end his existence. Bella arrives in time to save his life, the two of them are reconciled, and episode two finishes with a decision to vampirise Bella after she graduates.<br/><br/>What can I tell you about this load of old tosh? Well, let me start by saying that the only action undertaken by any of the main characters which I found convincing was Edward's decision to selflessly try to set Bella on a life away from vampires. Otherwise, none of these people behaves even slightly credibly at any time.<br/><br/>There are three or four action sequences which, though short, are decently done. The special effects aren't bad.<br/><br/>Apart from the action sequences, the film is deadly dull - it's really difficult to stay awake. The material covered could have been told more succinctly (and more interestingly) in 45 minutes less. It's boring.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning has a small part. I didn't recognise her. And she wasn't very good.<br/><br/>Graham Greene has a small part. He looks embarrassed throughout, as well he might.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen was (as usual) rather good.<br/><br/>And, as in the first one, the character Bella is so woefully glum that you wonder why Edward wants anything at all to do with her, let alone be with her for eternity. But I had one of those realisations which strikes you like a thunderbolt. Bella is the audience. Because this stuff is wish fulfilment romantic fantasy for impressionable teen girls, Bella is written for maximum audience identification as a teen who gets the hot guy despite being full to overflowing with angst. This was pointed up when Edward delivered the final line: this was clearly eagerly awaited by the teenies in the audience who whooped, hollered, and burst into spontaneous applause.<br/><br/>To me, this was more horrifying than any vampire or werewolf activity in the movie!"

","When I walked into the theater to see Twilight, I carried low expectations and walked out feeling little disappointment. The movie was not, by any means, a classic, but it was entertaining and an overall good time. Fast-forward one year, when I headed on into New Moon with similarly low expectations; but this time around, I walked out while shaking my head and trying to overcome a sense of speechlessness. Yes, the critics got it right- New Moon is that bad.<br/><br/>I had an awful feeling that this movie was going to be terrible as soon as it opened to Bella (Kristen Stewart) half-heartedly calling to Edward (Robert Pattinson) that he should not step into the sunlight lest her ""grandmother"" see his sparkly skin and panic. The film's beginning only goes downhill from there, erroneously implying that Bella and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) were always the best of friends and providing a too-strong reference to Romeo and Juliet. When it came time for Edward to grimace his way through the goodbye and Bella to search in vain for the meaning of the word ""emotion,"" I was hopeful that something good would FINALLY happen! A big mistake on my part.<br/><br/>Whether it's Edward reciting Shakespeare with a dead stare and slouched posture or Jacob pausing dramatically while yelling that he and Bella can't be friends anymore, the entire film progresses at a pace that would make even the most obese snail jealous.<br/><br/>The largest amount of blame lies with Stewart; no movie is able to hold itself up when the lead looks like she would rather be slumming in a Brazilian ghetto than raking in a multimillion dollar paycheck. Stewart carries on in the Twilight tradition of staring vacantly with jaw unhinged and eyes fluttering rapidly. At times, her lack of expression is almost believable for the portrayal of the numb Bella, but it is when she opens her mouth and scoffs and stutters that you really start to feel bad for the girl (if you somehow don't already). The childish and corny dialogue goes right over the young actress' head, and no amount of praise from Stephenie Meyer is enough to make the viewer believe that this is a quality performance.<br/><br/>Pattinson is reduced to two actions in this installment- either standing in the background and brooding or walking in slow motion with clothes rippling in a nonexistent breeze. His entrances are hilariously overblown and erupted the entire theater into laughter. The Edward hallucinations are a waste of screen time, considering his lines of warning are delivered in a Stewart-esquire monotone and you can just tell that Pattinson is holding back an eye-roll. The lack of chemistry in Twilight translates very well into New Moon and caused me to look down at times out of sheer embarrassment. There is nothing more painful than hearing bad actors with an inability to make eye contact whisper ""I love you"" to one another.<br/><br/>Lautner, in all his lopsided-wig glory, seizes the opportunity to try and prove that his character is both better for Bella and better-acted. While it isn't a difficult task to one-up Pattinson's acting, Lautner gives too much of an effort and trips up the film's pace with his constant pauses.<br/><br/>For a film that is supposed to be about developing Jacob and introducing his wolfpack, they are not given even an adequate amount of screen time. Bella and Jacob spend a few minutes palling around in his garage before :BOOM:, he's ready to profess his love and she's biting her lip and calling him ""sort of beautiful."" Stewart once again fails to connect with a love interest, and I had a hard time understanding why these boring teenagers were friends, let alone potential lovers. The film did succeed, however, in that I found myself missing Edward. His makeup is horribly applied and he is filmed from the most unflattering angles, but I was still jonesing for an appearance after the parade of Mr. Universe wannabes.<br/><br/>Like in Twilight, the secondary characters outshine the amateurish leads. Michael Sheen (Aro) hams it up and looks to be the only person enjoying himself, while Dakota Fanning (Jane) puts in a bit appearance as a sadistic teen vamp whose attitude should connect well with the mostly youthful audience. Rachelle Lefevre (Victoria) is appropriately menacing and probably the best character, since she isn't stuck reciting any trite dialogue.<br/><br/>The Cullens are allotted token appearances this time around and show off their incredibly distracting contact lenses. Ashley Greene (Alice) is granted a larger presence during the last half hour of the film, though she sorely lacks whatever bit of talent she was able to squeeze out in Twilight. Greene overacts with gems like ""I've never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy!"" and merely watches with a blank expression as her brother gets tossed like a rag doll in Italy.<br/><br/>And speaking of that action sequence, it is one of the few entertaining scenes in this film. Weitz's directing seems off-kilter when not involving a motorcycle or fight scene, making his not-terribly-impressive action sequences much more preferable. The all-important cliff-diving scene is shrug-inducing, while the chase between Victoria and the wolves carries on a tad too long. Jane's mind torture and the fight between Edward and Felix (Daniel Cudmore), a Volturi minion, are noteworthy simply for the tortured faces that Pattinson puts on and thinks he can get away with.<br/><br/>There's very little praise that I can throw New Moon's way. I do thank Weitz for getting rid of the blue tint, and some of the scenic shots, most notably in Italy, are well-done. Alexandre Desplat's lush, romantic score would be a welcome addition to any other love story but is too sophisticated for this one. At times, it is overwrought and distracting, though considering the fact that the movie is a two-hour commercial for Ambien, perhaps a little drama isn't a bad thing."

","Twilight: New Moon - Picking up a little while after the first film, the film again follows the trials and tribulations of Bella (Kirsten Stewart), the plain but beautiful, dull but fascinating girl. She turns the big 18 and the Cullens invite her to a birthday party. An accident ensues, and Edward (Robert Pattinson *swoon*) decides to send his threatening family away so he can live with Bella in piece. Ha ha, just joking. That would have been the smart thing to do. Edward instead decides to leave Bella forever, out of a desire to not hurt her. Surprisingly this does not work as Bella has several hilarious bitch-fits and gets even more inhumanly stupid. She takes ridiculous risks such as taking an ill-advised ride with the biker dudes, cliff diving all in the name of seeing her boyfriend in weird unexplained visions. Man-tastic Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) is there to the rescue, though he is not all he seems to be. Bella must choose which man to go with and the stakes become higher as Edward, with two films to go, decides to kill himself whilst under the impression that Bella is dead.<br/><br/>It's funny that it took me so long to write that out, considering the fact that this film has almost as little plot as the first film. In fact by all accounts it is the same film told over. Bella, in a state of sorrow, meets another man and discovers he is a monster inside. Thank god this time she found a man who can even slightly act. Taylor Lautner is warmer and more engaging than Robert Pattinson, who still painfully stammers his lines and always seems to look down at a tree stump next to Bella when he is talking to her. If only they could both keep their shirts on (a thousand times over for Pattinson)! There is enough man-ab action in this film to make Mathew McConaughey blush and put a shirt on. There's also enough terrible CGI to make the guys at Industrial Light & Magic's heads explode. Seriously, I haven't seen effects this bad outside of the Sci-Fi channel.<br/><br/>I have finally realized why Stephanie Meyer has done so well with these books. It's not just that they are bastardizations of classical horror themes. It's that they are bastardizations of horror that are especially appealing to girls (or gay men). Androgynous pale men with glitter on? David Bowie's been rocking that look for decades. Werewolf men who never wear shirts? What's next, zombies with codpieces to hold their enormous packages? Some that glitters, however, is gold. Michael Sheen is very watchable as the villain Aro. It was lovely to be reminded what real acting is. Ditto for Ashley Greene as the spunky sister vampire Alice Cullen. Gee, Alice must have considered slitting her immortal wrists a couple of thousand times at reading all the melodramatic drivel Bella kept sending her in a grieved state. I can think of no worse penpal to have. As a matter of fact, can we just follow the story of Alice and the Vampire Illuminati for awhile instead? I'll probably get lynched for saying this, but these films are still an awful influence on young girls. Bella, with an absence of self esteem, is the worst role model for any young women and brings a new low to the empowered girl image everywhere. She tries to kill herself just to get closer to a boy. What could possibly be a weaker character image? Her main bargaining chip in all instances is that she could get hurt. Edward too is an awful influence on young women. He's invasive, domineering and caught up in self loathing. ""My life is awful as an immortal."" Um...maybe if you didn't put yourself through high school for the last 90 years things might be better.<br/><br/>New Moon is better than Twilight, though this says nothing. It's funny when it tries to be, and has fewer accidentally funny moments (minus for me actually). It has more likable supporting characters, and only about 20 minutes of Edward Cullen. It's still too damn long and melodramatic. I guess that's what happens when you give fan-fiction a film treatment. D+"

","I absolutely loved the creative writing of Stephanie Meyers in the Twilight Saga. Although I couldn't relate to any of the characters and I didn't like their motives and actions at times, I guess it made me enjoyed it more because it didn't whitewash teenage angst and emotion.<br/><br/>I will state Im female 31yrs, I don't crush on either Rob or Taylor, they are too young so Id feel creepy.<br/><br/>Twilight was good. I work in the film industry so I always like to watch the latest movies and crazes. You can tell it was low budget. But it did well to encapsulate the emotion of all characters. I really liked it. So I was thinking with a much bigger budget New Moon would be phenomenal. It turns out it was an embarrassment to the film industry. Its up there with Britney's Crossroads and Mariah's Glitter.<br/><br/>The CGI was nicely done. Makeup was great. Continuity was tenfold better. Visually appealing, great audio. BUT....WTF was with the acting?? It was pathetic. There was no real emotion in any scene, every scene Kristen was in was either so underacted or so overacted its like she was reading her lines off Que cards. Even Taylor had bad moments (kudos to finally having a movie where we see hot bodies and not tits and ass) and the scene where Alice tells Bella that Edward is going to the Volturi was so forced and fake I felt so embarrassed just watching. I enjoyed the portrayal of Jessica, Billy Black, Charlie and Mike.<br/><br/>I didn't believe for one second that Edward and Bella have some great love affair, like in Twilight. There was absolutely no chemistry between them. Its very hard to believe that Rob and Kristen have a real life romance and if they do /shudder I can imagine how unsatisfying it must be and figure it will fizzle as quickly as it started.<br/><br/>I do have faith in Eclipse though, if Carter Burwell & Alexandra Patsavas are brought back for the score and soundtrack and they get a new director even bring back Cathrine. Id say that through all the negative feedback that New Moon has received 'they' will go back to the drawing board.<br/><br/>Lastly the New Moon film does not do much for empowering teenage girls. Telling them that guys that don't respect them or their feelings (Jacob, even more so in Eclipse) are good, caring guys or that controlling domineering guys like Edward, as long as they are good looking, are positive influences. And that being a miserable, depressive, weakling is the appropriate response to having a guy you hardly know break up with you. I hope teenage girls out there have more self respect, self control and self worth then Bella."

","This movie was exactly what I had hoped Twilight to be. They cut out the annoying cheesy music and much of the awkward acting moments that just made me laugh in Twilight. So glad a REAL director had this one. Sorry Catherine, but you butchered the first movie with the jumpy scenes and awkward cinematography. I felt like I was watching an actual professional movie in New Moon, not a documentary. It was obvious that Rob and Kristen were much more comfortable this time around, and their scenes actually seemed sincere to the audience, contrary to the awkwardly laughable ones in Twilight. And above all, this movie actually had a beautiful music score. Hats off to Alexandre Desplat! I was relieved when I wasn't hearing that completely out of place grungy background music. These movies are based on love stories, not murder mysteries, so good ridden. Quite possibly the most important reaction that came from me after seeing New Moon was my want for more! It actually left me wanting to get home to pick up my Twilight Series books off the shelf again for another read. To me, New Moon really reflected what made all of us fans go crazy over these novels in the first place. Tween girls will be swooning over this movie, men will be bored to death with it, and true fans will adore its loyalty to the novel. 10/10"

","I am going to come to the defence of this film. OK so it probably should not be 10/10 but I am trying to add some balance to all the 1/10 votes that are also not reflective of the film. <br/><br/>Firstly, those who commented and gave 1/10 because this film offers a bad role model to teenage girls - oh come off it, what has that got to do with the film? Seriously, try and think back to when you were at high school and you ached to be with someone so much that it was painful and you cried yourself to sleep at night - then when you finally got with someone and they dumped you for whatever reason how much that really hurt - first time your heart is broken is a real killer, how quick you forget. Do you seriously want to do anything during those couple of months? Hobbies? Careers? Exams? Who cares about that when your heart is broken and all you want to do is curl up in a ball and die. Keep in mind that Bella is also in love with a vampire who is designed to be attractive in drawing in their prey - making the heartache much more powerful.<br/><br/>Secondly, those who commented and gave 1/10 because of mumbling and flat performances - keep in mind that teenagers tend to be like that in real life. They are acting as teenagers in the film so for me that actually made the film feel more realistic. Bella was supposed to be dull and ordinary in the books, Edward is supposed to be broody and sullen, Jacob is one of the most complicated characters in the book - starts off shy, but also has a happy go lucky attitude but also has violent mood swings (completely contradicting personalities in the books that Taylor pulls off pretty well). <br/><br/>OK now my own review... I felt that the film kind of rushed things, especially towards the end. There was not enough time given to really capture the heart ache either but I thought the scene with Kristen sat on the chair and the world spinning around was a good idea. Incidentally, Kristen was gorgeous in this film... I can understand a lot of jealous women not getting enough of Robert and feeling inadequate compared to Kristen's beauty. Personally, I was disappointed that there was not more of Ashley Greene who has to be the most talented actress/actor in the entire series (compare her role in this film to summer's blood). The cgi wolves were amazing - it was almost worth going to see the film just to see the wolves. Michael Sheen was also brilliant - I was probably most concerned at how Aro would be played and I think they got it spot on. Taylor was not as bad as some people were making out - probably another case of jealousy coming from the men this time. Once again, Taylor is supposed to be playing a moody teenager with huge mood swings because of the shape-shifting thing. More could have been done about Sam's 'cult' though and Jacob's fear. New moon felt more like a film while the first film felt like it was an extended pilot episode for a TV series. Although, I think had I not read the books prior to the film then I would probably have missed a lot. I could certainly sympathise with those who had not read the books feeling short-changed but those who have read the books should have realised some of the subtleties in the performances that are trying to match the books. Edward is supposed to be broody with a sullen attitude. Bella is supposed to be ordinary and dull and full of heartache - some people must be so lucky not to have had that experience in their lives when at high school. Jacob is supposed to be a shy teenager who then hits a kind of 'puberty' with massive mood swings. The worst acting in the film was actually Dakota Fanning's inability to smirk sadistically. Realistically, if I was not trying to balance the poor voting, this film was a 6.5 out of 10. More to do with the script than anything else that failed to capture the main points of the book."

","How does one describe a movie like The Twilight Saga: New Moon? The direction was amateur at best; the mood of the film changed every twenty minutes; the acting was terrible (except for Taylor Lautner but more on that later); the dialogue was boring and my little sister could have done a better job with the cinematography.<br/><br/>New Moon is the sequel to the inexplicably popular Twilight (both of which were based off of novels by Stephenie Meyer). The Twilight series is about Bella Swan, a teenage girl living with her single father in the small suburban town of Forks, Washington. During the first instalment, Bella meets Edward Cullen and quickly becomes infatuated with him and discovers that he and his family are vampires.<br/><br/>New Moon is the story of what happens when Jasper Cullen (one of Edward's ""brothers"") attacks Bella after she gets a paper cut. Due to this ""traumatic"" event the Cullens Leave Forks and Bella becomes disturbed with nightmares of Edward. After discovering that being reckless will bring her visions of Edward she rekindles an old friendship with Jacob Black (who is actually a werewolf) so he can help her rebuild two motorcycles. Eventually she develops feeling for him until Edward's sister returns to Forks to warn Bella of Edward's suicidal Intentions.<br/><br/>It is difficult to describe just how bad this movie was without ranting. As most people who despised Twilight, the change of directors to Chris Weitz (American Pie and the Golden Compass) was a welcome addition to the crew. It was expected that he would re-vamp the terrible special effects from the first movie and bring an interesting view to the story (despite the terrible source material). Well to say the least, he did none of those things. The special effects were a bit better but still looked nowhere near as good as they did in the Golden Compass, and the way he styled some of the earlier scenes in the film completely wrecked the mood that the ""dream style"" intro had produced.<br/><br/>Another disappointing part of this movie was the soundtrack. When the OST was released, it seemed as though the sound editors had chosen some excellent songs (including Roslyn by Bon Iver & St. Vincent). Unfortunately when being added into the movie, the scenes were incorrectly selected, which in turn created contrasting moods between what was happening on screen and what was being heard.<br/><br/>The acting was downright terrible, not that you can really blame the actors. The dialogue was dry and boring which was caused by bad writers and bad source material. There was no chemistry between any of the characters except Jacob Black and Bella Swan and even their scenes were plagued with overly clichéd romantic dialogue.<br/><br/>With that, I can finally come to the one thing in this movie that impressed me, Taylor Lautner. After weeks and weeks of the screaming fan girls waiting to see Taylor without a shirt, I was convinced that he was there purely as eye candy. I was mistaken because at the end of the movie, the only character that elicited any emotional response from me was Jacob Black. I felt sympathetic for his character and felt bad about what happens to him in the end.<br/><br/>Overall this movie ranks very high on my list of worst movies ever made. I recommend that no one go see it or at least that no one pays to go see it. If you like Vampires then watch True Blood at home but if you are so fantasy obsessed that you need Vampires and Werewolves then try Underworld. Just stay away from New Moon"

","I am not really a big Twilight fan and i have never read the books, but i thought the first movie was pretty good and something new so decided to check it out. Man, this movie just sucked so bad. Terrible acting, and a dragged out storyline and i dozed off a few times because some scenes were so uninteresting. I definitely think Robert's acting skills have improved since the first, but Kristen got much worse. I have to give the props to Sheen, he played The Volturi very well. This entire movie is just a soap opera; it's just way too dramatic and the hype definitely killed this movie. In my opinion, the first movie was much much better and i found the directing in the first to be better too. I won't recommend this movie."

","first of all, i am a fan of the books and very disappointed by the first movie. after seeing the trailers of new moon, i have better hopes this time. i expected the changing of director probably might improve the acting, but well, obviously it is the problem of actors now i have found. the few that can act are Michael Sheen and Peter Facinelli; the rest were playing either the roles of stone or wood.<br/><br/>i don't know what happened to kristen's eyes? sometimes in the movie she gave me an impression that she's stoned; and sometimes the way she blinks (very rapid) looked very annoying. she seems to have only one or two expressions in the whole movie. i can't see the joy when she's with edward again and the guilt she felt towards charlie.<br/><br/>rob is as bad as the first movie, no improvement at all. edward in the books is funnier and ""livelier"", but rob, jeez, my advice is he should attend some drama classes before taking other jobs.<br/><br/>taylor's acting is a bit better, but whose idea was it that every words he spoke was coming from his throat? maybe he was trying to be husky but hey, the way he delivered it just seemed unnatural and pretentious.<br/><br/>i wonder why this production team would still give us crap with the hugely increased budget? are they putting most of the resources on cgi only? or was it because the major casting was set, can't do anything about it? with their poor acting skills, the poor performance will be in consistent no matter how much more money to put in? look at true blood and vampire diaries, they are also adaptations from books but are way way better than the twilight movies. even the songs are better.<br/><br/>to be fair, new moon is better than twilight (most of the credits to Michael Sheen --- don't recall anyone can act in twilight), however, i can't give it a pass. it is a four out of ten."

","As her 18th birthday approaches, Bella (Kristen Stewart) is finding it difficult to live a life where she would eventually become old while Edward (Robert Pattinson) retains his youth. When Bella's small birthday affair at the Cullen household threatens Bella's life, Edward decides that it is best if he leaves her fearing that he is causing her unnecessary danger. This results in Bella falling into a deep depression which her friend, Jacob (Taylor Lautner), hopes to relieve her from.<br/><br/>Continuing the novel adaptation of the Twilight saga, New Moon is a misfit of sorts in the series thus far. Regardless of how accurately the novel is followed, the narrative appears to present little new or different from the story presented in Twilight. Bella is still a sad and pathetic person who needs the love of someone else to keep her going. Instead of Edward being her source of love, it is Jacob this time around. And like the first film, Bella's life is under threat from a handful of vampires, and these happen to contain the remainder of the original group from Twilight. In essence, New Moon is just Twilight wrapped up in new skin, arguably paler this time, and it will feel like this for a good chunk of the film until the introduction of the Volturi, the royalty of vampires. This small arc in the film definitely ramps up the narrative into more interesting territory outside the lifeless romance of before, and the characters this romance entailed. Though the story does have one thing going for it and that is humour, and the genuine kind to boot. The film is constantly comedic enough that you may even forget that it was meant to be a tragic romance of sorts akin to Romeo and Juliet, which the narrative blatantly tries to intertextualise with. Inevitably, the story has little substance and feels like a bridge between Twilight and the remaining sequels to come. This is because all the intriguing mythology added to the series in New Moon, such as the Volturi and werewolves, contribute nothing to the film but rather that they could be useful for the sequels.<br/><br/>The acting is largely a better affair in the Twilight sequel but this mostly comes in the form of the lesser characters. Of the lot the more noticeable supporting performances come from the charm of Ashley Greene, the acute coldness of Dakota Fanning, and that rather mysterious elegance of Michael Sheen as the Volturi leader Aro. Of the three protagonists, it is only Lautner who makes any commendable effort at acting: he starts off rather low-key but gets himself into a decent position. It is disastrously unfortunate that neither Stewart nor Pattinson become anything more than simply dull. Both their respective characters are meant to be pained at the loss of being separated from one another but they always appear somewhat bored when in scenes together and show little conviction in their emotions. On the other hand, Stewart's scenes with Lautner have more going for them even when Stewart loses her gaze to Lautner's abs.<br/><br/>Director Chris Wietz brings a commercial feel to New Moon which was lacking in Twilight, yet New Moon ultimately feels less unique than Catherine Hardwicke's efforts. This does not help the film in any way as it has less going for it than its predecessor did. Music is a love-hate affair: it feels way too forced in helping create a certain mood that at times the music feels oddly misplaced. The special effects are much improved and now look far from awkward. While the CG is never overly convincing, it is integrated well enough as to not be a distraction.<br/><br/>For a film based on vampire romance, New Moon is pretty sexless in appeal beyond Lautner being shirtless. There is the odd use of mild language and while violence is more abundant than in Twilight, it is never harrowing enough considering the vampire and werewolf mythology.<br/><br/>While somewhat enjoyable, New Moon lacks identity and this is solely based on the fact that it does little to enhance the Twilight formula. Richer mythology is added; the quality of acting has increased in the overall cast; and the special effects have undergone a needed retuning. But like Edward so blandly points about himself, the film lacks a soul. The brewing romance between Bella and Edward is lifeless with a general lack of development throughout all the characters. Likewise, the narrative never really seems to head in any viable direction and it is up to the lesser characters to get the film's blood pumping."

The special effects were overused, and the entire backdrop to the story was terrible.<br/><br/>My sister and I read the books together so we could talk about it, and It's no wonder the movie performed so badly. As me and my sister could agree, there was no way that anybody could find this movie to be engaging whatsoever, besides the inclusion of a bland, vanilla-flavoured heroine who could easily be replaced by somebody with delusions of romance.<br/><br/>Bad acting, terrible effects, and a bad storyline = 1/5"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","10","31","73","18 November 2009"," Longest movie title reveal in the history of movie title reveals. Seriously, could the words 'New Moon' have appeared any *slower*?...
","Having said that, I liked/appreciated this film even more on second viewing.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart, as Bella, goes through something so emotionally exhausting/painful, after the love of her life (who she deems herself unworthy of), Edward, leaves her. She settles into a severe state of depression, and Stewart portrays this extremely well. People complain about her never cracking a smile? Not like she has great reason to. Robert Pattinson (with his gravity-defying hair) as Edward is in a smaller portion of this film to Twilight, but what he lacks in actually being physically *there* for Bella, he makes up for with ghostly apparitions of himself (brought on by Bella endangering herself). <br/><br/>Jacob is the one bright spot for Bella after (Edward's departure). I really liked watching their growing friendship develop. Taylor Lautner has great chemistry with Stewart (though, different to Pattinson's) and really proved himself (not only with meeting the physical demands required of him, but doing the role justice in this movie). The change from the Jacob we met in Twilight to the Jacob we see in his rain-soaked scene with Bella in this movie is dramatic. He literally grows up before your eyes (exactly how it's described in the book). <br/><br/>The Cullens (now with nicely effective otherworldly eyes) are given a lot less screen time this movie than last. All except Alice (the perfectly cast Ashley Greene). The other Cullens (aside from Carlisle) are limited to one or two lines, at most, though Kellan Lutz manages to make the best of his. Alice, meanwhile, thankfully gets to interact with not only Bella and Edward, but Jacob as well. I really liked the different dynamics between them. Alice is a great character and provides some of the best bits/lines. Bella's lucky to have her as a friend. <br/><br/>Bella's human ""friends"", however, aren't so lucky to have Bella. She treats them like crap, especially Jessica (awesomely portrayed by Anna Kendrick, who's very funny). You can understand her attitude towards Bella, after she potentially endangers both their lives. Mike Newton (Michael Welch), while not as amusing as he was in Twilight, gets one memorable scene (involving him, Bella and Jacob going to see the laughably titled 'Face Punch' - apparently an exceedingly violent movie with hilarious dialogue). Billy Burke continues to be great as Bella's father, Charlie (getting some good/funny lines).<br/><br/>The introduction of the wolf pack is hit and miss. Sam Uley is good (Chaske Spencer shows promise), as is his tragically scarred fiancée, Emily (Tinsel Korey). The rest? Not so much (hopefully they'll improve). The reveal of the werewolves is well-handled (the movie actually sticks to the book very closely in most respects). The werewolves themselves look pretty good (for CGI). Jacob as a werewolf is quite expressive. Their fight with Laurent is given more detail than the book, which is nice. Rachelle Lefevre as Victoria is merely a cameo this time around (though her running through the woods scene was well done, I thought. Perfect use of music there).<br/><br/>The Volutri, like the wolves, are portrayed with varying degrees of success. Michael Sheen (who's switched sides from werewolf in the Underworld films to playing a vampire here) is quite good as Volturi leader, Aro. Despite my reservations, I'll concede that Dakota Fanning actually fills the role of sadistic Jane pretty well. The other members mostly just look freaky with their red eyes/lips and not much else. I did appreciate, however, the inclusion of even the smallest roles, such as Heidi (Noot Seear) and receptionist, Gianna (Justine Wachsberger). The scene of tourists (including kids) being led to the slaughter was very effective.<br/><br/>As far as plot goes, you can't help but see the slight wrongness in Bella/Edward's relationship (ie. Bella decides to endanger herself so she will hallucinate him). Everything goes to hell at Bella's birthday, when Jasper (Jackson Rathbone - who's *still* making that facial expression where he looks like he's holding in a fart) tries to kill Bella thanks to a mere paper cut/few drops of blood. This leads to Bella getting hurt and Edward never wanting to put her in danger again - so he leaves. However, this hurts her more than he knows. Following his departure, Bella's not simply in a grand funk...she becomes totally hollow (ignoring her human ""friends"", etc). <br/><br/>Jacob proves to be ""better"" for Bella in a lot of ways - she actually smiles around him/is far less angsty. The two are great on screen together (though I don't condone her using of him at her convenience. He's there for her when no one else is). Things change when Jacob discovers that he's a werewolf. He hurts Bella, as Edward did, by cutting himself off from her. When she in no longer hallucinating Edward, Bella goes cliff-diving (dangerous sport). Edward gets wind of Bella's recklessness (thanks, Rosalie!) and, thinking she's died, he pulls a Romeo and wants to die too. The Volutri (vampire ""royalty"") are able to oblige...if Edward reveals himself (and the existence of vampires) in a visually spectacular sea of red scene set in Italy.<br/><br/>Those who have problems with the New Moon soundtrack will be happy to hear the music is used in the film exceptionally well/just at the right moments. The effects/fights are good too. The direction is more that of an action movie when compared to Twilight. Chris Weitz knows how to make things more ""thrilling"", but he sadly lacks Catherine Hardwicke's skill at exploring the more character-driven/subtler moments. Twilight was a more 'intimate' film, while New Moon is far more elaborate. With only a few bits of the book skipped over and/or altered somewhat, the movie's very faithful to the source material (I enjoyed hearing the characters uttering lines from the book). The cliffhanger ending is a doozy (vastly inferior end credits to Twilight, though). New Moon is excellent, and while I might like Twilight a little better, here's hoping that Eclipse...well...eclipses them both."
"Troy_Campbell","5","10","19","25 November 2009"," New Moon has its moments but overall this is a disappointing follow-up.
","Not since The Dark Knight has so much hype surrounded a movie. Girls have gone crazy. Cinemas have sold out within minutes of making tickets available. Twi-hards have lived up to their name. I loathe to think what next year's Eclipse will bring. In it's opening weekend in the U.S. The Dark Knight made $158 million whilst Transformers 2 made $108 million. New Moon has already broken box office records everywhere. As far as dollars are concerned hype never lies. Shame that doesn't mean this film is any good.<br/><br/>When Twilight was first released on a considerably less euphoria-swept audience it was for a lot of people, including me, a guilty pleasure. Teen angst, first romance, glittery vampires – what's not to like? Actually the glittery part was a bit silly but overall it was easy to sit back and enjoy this tale of forbidden affection between human and vampire. New Moon is a much harder slog. The woozy-from-love atmosphere of the first is replaced with an exhaustively downbeat mood in the this sequel. What was simple has now become forced. And those 'pale-faces' are still glittery.<br/><br/>When Chris Weitz was brought on board to direct everyone was cheering about how the special effects would be vastly improved. Well they are, but at what cost? The CGI werewolves are superb to look at and the action scenes are definitely more seamless, however the drama and tension that was elicited so well from Catherine Hardwicke's direction is now severely lacking. Not a price I would be willing to pay: the strength of the story will have people returning for repeat viewings much more then the action.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are back as the on-again-off-again couple, only this time their chemistry seems to be missing. Stewart is solid as the dejected and melodramatic Bella whilst Pattinson is intolerable as the whiny, wimpy Edward. Hard to tell where the character starts and his acting ends, Edward / Robert may have girls - both young and old - whipped into a frenzy, however anyone who hasn't already sided with Team Edward will want to tear their eyes out when he is on screen. The added third party for this instalment, werewolf Jacob Black, is played well by Lautner; the 17 year old piling on 12kg of muscle and some extra acting talent for his bulked up role.<br/><br/>New Moon has its moments but overall this is a disappointing follow-up.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

Then they go ahead and ruin the hundreds if not thousands of years of vampire myth/legend/folklore, and go and make the guy immortal, and grow hair? when the sun shines...? How on earth do people actually sit through this, I mean, I have in the past bought tickets to a movie so I can stare at the girl who I think is hot, but cmon, the pattinson guy looks like he came out of rehab, looks like the mugshot of Nick Nolte, except without grey hair."

I'm proud to say that it was a great success as over $400,000 was given by Twilight fans.<br/><br/>Now for the movie! I would imagine that most fans of the series would have two questions? Did the movie follow the book and how many minutes of the film included Robert Pattinson. As most readers will know, its impossible to get a 500 page book into a two hour film. I think that the Twilight and New Moon movies have done a much better job of following the books than did the Harry Potter films. Robert is in at least half the film which is more than I would have thought from reading the book. There is a lot more action in this film and it sets up well for the release of Eclipse next year. The film has already set records for advance ticket sales at Fandango and with two more films remaining could well become the best selling series of all time."

"dolphinrobin","10","16","34","21 November 2009"," Wow.... Reading some hate for NM :(
","Well, I just wanted to voice my opinion on the New Moon movie. First a little background info just because - lmao. I saw Twilight before reading the books; in fact I just read the books two weeks ago. I read all four without putting them down. I read a lot, and wasn't expecting too much after the Harry Potter series, but this series took be by surprise. I was really drawn into the fantasy/romance. I also identified with Bella in New Moon (the book) because well I have been heartbroken and Stephenie Myer (I thought) did an above excellent job at describing what that felt like and then the relationship with Jacob where he felt more for her than she did, she knew this fact but couldn't help that she was broken. <br/><br/>I am a 34 year old women, successful and even though single VERY happy with my life so I do not agree with the stereotype of ""you would have to be a 12-16 year old"", or "" a cougar"", or ""emotionally inept person"" to enjoy these books/movies. I enjoyed Twilight (otherwise I would not have read the series in the first place, even though everyone I knew was bugging me to read it, so much so I was defiantly not reading them just because, lol) but was glad I did. I was looking forward to New Moon coming out and seeing how it was going to be portrayed with a new director and the work that Taylor went through to remain as Jacob.<br/><br/>OK, finally about the movie I saw the first showing with my mother then went straight to another theater to meet some friends to see it with them. I could still see the emotions as well as the love between Kris (Bella) and Robert (Edward) as I had in the first movie, Twilight. I personally think Kris, Robert, Taylor and the entire cast did a very wonderful acting job in New Moon, I could feel the emotions each were trying to portray and felt for each character as I had in the book. I thought the special effects in NM were much better than Twilight, and laughed when Taylor (Jacob) first took his shirt off to give it to Kris (Bella) for her bleeding head. Not because it was a bad scene but because of all the ooh's and ah's from the audience lol. Taylor did great with buffing it up and I think he did a fantastic job at fulfilling the very least my idea of Jacob I had in my mind. <br/><br/>I think that others need to realize that if they are not use to reading books before a movie, the movie may not meet their expectations. I have read dozens of books by Steven King and the movies have never matched with my own imagination. As we all know you just can't put everything from a book into a movie either, the book will always play out differently than what actors/directors/writers can bring to a film. Maybe, that needs to be a factor before the movie is watched. If you are not a big reader you may not know this and then may be let down by the movie. So, remember this whenever you read a book then watch the movie. These books are no exception even though NM does a good job of staying on track with the book.<br/><br/>The music however did NOT grab me as the music did in Twilight, it didn't seem to flow at all with the movie. As for some of the comments written on how Kris (Bella) is not a good role model for teens HELLO – It's a movie based on characters from a book about mythical creatures, it is a fantasy/romance . AND there hasn't been any sex, drinking, loads of cursing that many many other movies contain . Anyhow, I loved the movie (everything but the music ) And I am very happy with the books and movies thus far, but this is my opinion, don't listen to me or anyone else, just go read/watch the movie and see for yourself"
"AmandaLayne","10","16","34","21 November 2009"," Way better than I expected.
","I am obviously a big fan of Twilight and the entire saga. After Twilight last year, I was very excited to see New Moon. My friend and I went to the midnight showing, waited 2 hours for the movie, and were NOT disappointed. Yes, they changed a FEW things in the movie, but they're not going to do the movie EXACTLY like the book. It would have been a lot longer if they did. Kristen Stewart's acting was a thousand times better in this movie, she didn't stutter repeatedly, she didn't look awkward with her hand movements. Kstew and Rpattz have an amazing chemistry on-screen. Taylor Lautner was good as well. I didn't exactly LOVE his performance, but it was still very good.<br/><br/>The movie had a lot of funny lines in it that weren't in the book. And the movie did use a LOT of lines straight from the book. It was very very good.<br/><br/>Twilight fans shouldn't be disappointed. I definitely recommend this movie. Yes there are scenes they left out from the book, yes they changed the relationship between Bella and Jacob a little, but overall it was true to the book, and very very good acting. I can't wait to see it again."

","I can't believe that people are deliberately giving 1 star just because they don't understand the hype. At the end of the day this was always going to be a movie for the fans and further to this it's aimed at teenage girls. So, for the people who are marking it down due to the amount of half naked boys - lighten up! So many films use girls this way so why get offended? Secondly, New Moon is in a different league to Twilight. Weitz has turned this film into a professionally done blockbuster rather than the slow moving, un-flowing mess that was Twilight.<br/><br/>I loved this film. I've read all the books more than once and i'm definitely slightly biased but slating a film made for teenage girls? What did you expect? For me New Moon exceeded my expectations, It's more authentic then Twilight, the cast has settled into their roles and the story flows. Of cause there are a few scenes/lines that are sketchy and I don't think much of Kristen Stewart but on the whole, it's a good film.<br/><br/>It's not going to win an Oscar, but if you're a fan chances are you'll really enjoy this film and appreciate how much better than Twilight it is."

","It's been hysterical to read such negative reviews the past few days. I am truly stunned when people write 'it's a chick flick' or 'it was made for Tweens'. One word--- duh! It would be the same if I watched ""Saw"" then wrote a negative review because it was a horror flick. Please, please, do me a favor. If you have not read the books, DO NOT see this movie. Plain and simple. Let me break it down for you: 1. The books are always better than the movies. We've seen a hundred books become movies and are always shocked when they're not as good. Just as in ""Twilight"", ""New Moon"" skipped over a lot of things, and honestly a lot of important things that the book described. The sorrow and depression that Bella feels just isn't the same on screen. There was a lot about Jacob left out and their trip home from Italy was completely overlooked. The cliff jumping scene was particularly disappointing. Stephanie Meyer does such a great job of describing Bella's jump, Edward's reaction and her drowning, but the movie just couldn't do it justice. 2. This movie's target audience is girls ages 10-18. again, duh. If you're a guy, you are going to hate it. There's no sex scenes, no naked women, no explosions or bloody gore. Guys, just go with your girlfriend, see it and stop whining already. 3. This wasn't designed to be Oscar-worthy. It's a chick flick. <br/><br/>With those simple thoughts in mind, please stop taking this movie so seriously. It's just entertainment and let me just give you a head's up, ""Eclipse"" will be a romance movie. again, duh."

","I am a fan of the books. I enjoyed reading them. However, I do not like the movies. I saw Twilight last year and thought ""Wow, Summit ruined it."" I was generous and decided to give New Moon a chance with the movie having a new director. I am giving up being generous. <br/><br/>The Good: 1) Dakota Fanning as Jane was just how I pictured Jane in the books. Kudos to her. 2) Taylor Lautner, Peter Facinelli, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathborne and Elizabeth Reaser return and I was impressed with their performances.<br/><br/>The Bad: 1) What was with all the extra scenes? They weren't in the book!<br/><br/>The Ugly: 1) Why did Robert Pattinson take off his shirt? He's gross. When I saw New Moon everyone in the theater went ""Ewww"" when Pattinson took off his shirt. 2) Kristen Stewart CANNOT ACT! Why did they pick her as Bella? In the books, Bella has a personality, you know? Stewart portrays her as someone who is detached from this world. Emily Browning would have been a much better choice. 3) Robert Pattinson may be a heartthrob to some but he cannot act.<br/><br/>All in all, Summit ruined the movies and picked horrible actors for the lead role. Stop with the movies! You're ruining the books! <br/><br/>If you do want to continue the movies because you're not listening to the fans, pick better actors for the rest of the roles, please!

","Don't count me as some ""Twilight, fantasy chick flick"" hater, because I loved the book series and enjoyed the Twilight movie. Realistically the only good acting was Taylor, he transformed physically to become Jacob and his acting was rather spot on for his role. Everyone else was disbelieving and in some cases a little annoying (Kristen/Robert)!<br/><br/>The movie was a basic adaptation to the book but when it was off it caused you to wonder if it was still new moon or a different book movie all together. I understand why they added some action scenes because lets be realistic, if they followed the book word for word everyone who hadn't read the book would have left the theatre thinking, ""Where was the vampire vs. werewolf stuff?""<br/><br/>UPSIDE: Great effects, good laughs, and good action at points. <br/><br/>THE BIGGEST FLAW: This movie is an absolute horrible message for young girls. It promotes, and in some cases allows teen girls to completely break down and risk their life for someone they are ""in love with""! The reason I say this is a bad message is that all teenage girls think they are in love, and that if they were to have their hearts broken it's okay if they just break down till some other guy can help them get better... sorry but that just isn't healthy.<br/><br/>I'll leave with...

"phd_travel","4","6","10","4 December 2009"," Disappointing after Twilight
","I am a huge fan of the first Twilight movie which was fun, exciting, romantic and enjoyable. I know New Moon is the darkest episode but sorry to say the movie was just too dreary and slow, often lacking both intimacy and excitement. I actually felt sleepy during some scenes and I had been so looking forward to see this.<br/><br/>Firstly, New Moon does have good points: Wolf Pack animal effects were good - not over the top. <br/><br/>Acting: Great cast delivers. Kristen Stewart was natural and unaffected. Taylor Lautner gives an earnest and energetic performance. Ashley Greene was sweet, strange and right on spot. Rob Pattinson was even paler than before and showed a different side but might have been slightly too distant and subdued.<br/><br/>Attractive scenery in Italy and the Pacific Northwest. <br/><br/>Bad points: Direction. The plodding direction of Chris Weitz dragged the whole thing down to a BORING pace at times. If even a fan can be bored then he can't have done a good job. The romance between Jacob and Bella felt awkward. In fact most of the scenes lacked edginess and tension and intimacy and vulnerability when required. If only they had stuck to Catherine Hardwicke. A woman's perspective is valuable because this is a story centered on a female heroine and that's what made Twilight successful and different. If it ain't broke why fix it? <br/><br/>Music. The score mostly didn't suit the movie. The thick orchestral violin background music was out of place. I know they were trying to be more classical and less music video but it just sounded grating and old fashioned. The songs with vocals loudly distracted from what was going on instead of enhancing the storyline. Sometimes there was no music when music would have helped. I much prefer Twilight's score and song selection which helped set the mood of each scene and didn't overwhelm instead.<br/><br/>Supporting cast: Insufficient camera time and dialog for supporting cast namely the Cullens and Bella's friends. A little more focus on the people around Bella would have been good to show contrast and give some perspective. One or two more funny lines would have helped.<br/><br/>Screenplay: In Twilight the screenplay added humor and sped up the pace by combining characters and using certain composite scenes to make it a better and more fast moving story. In New Moon following the book more closely resulted in too many slow and uninteresting scenes and draggy moments. There wasn't enough improvement from page to screen <br/><br/>Cinematography: The change in filming location from Oregon to Vancouver was quite noticeable and it felt like a different place. The scenes in the woods were not as attractive as Twilight. Instead of being eerie and cool they looked bleak and washed out. The cool blue gray colors often found in Twilight became yellowish in New Moon.<br/><br/>Casting: Michael Sheen looked goofy and lacked both stature and a sinister side. Dakota looked unappealing. The other Volturi were unmemorable. Why use so many less than charismatic and average looking British actors? <br/><br/>So overall - if you are a fan or just dating a fan do go and SEE IT but be prepared to be disappointed and yawn a bit."
"rorosuperro","8","19","42","20 November 2009"," A far superior movie to Twilight and looking forward to Eclipse
","I'll admit it straight out I'm a huge Twilight fan but after reading some poor reviews here and some in the papers I wasn't excepting much from New Moon. This didn't bode well for me as I had been disappointed by Twilight.<br/><br/>But what can I say I was pleasantly (total understatement) surprised. The movie was very faithful to the book and the bits that were added in worked extremely well. I especially liked that there were far more comedic moments which I felt were needed even as I read the book. Taylor Lautner filled the R-Patz shaped hole in my heart. He was endearing and sweet as Jacob, I found myself loving him, where in the books I really despised him. Pattinson does what he does, effortlessly and sexy as hell, there's nothing major for him to do in this movie but he didn't phone it in which made me feel that he cared about this character and the franchise. Charlie is quickly becoming a more rounded character and I'm loving his transformation on the big screen, the man is far to 2-D in the book. But the best surprise here is Stewart who seemed awkward and bored in Twilight. Here she captures Bella's pain of losing Edward perfectly. The chemistry between her and Taylor is immense and almost rivals that of her and Pattinson. I'm so glad she upped her game as for me she was the major disappointment in Twilight.<br/><br/>Christ Weitz has done an excellent job and has cut through a lot of the cheesy lines that can make New Moon too angsty and almost patronising. The extra action is great and I thought the wolves looked amazing. Even the grunts and the thundering noise they made as the sped through the woods was incredible.<br/><br/>If there was any fault there wasn't enough of the Volutori but then again there isn't that much of them in the book anyway. Oh and the bit with Edward and Bella running through the forest made me burst out laughing which I doubt was its intention but all an all I enjoyed it immensely. I went with serious Twilight fans and girls who had never read the books and we all agreed, a far superior movie to Twilight and looking forward to Eclipse...only 225 days to go :)"

","The Twilight Saga seems to be a love it or hate it type of thing. If you are not a fan of the books/movies, do not go and see it, simple as that. That's what throws off the ratings of this movie, people who don't like it to begin with see it anyway and leave negative comments. That aside, I thought this was a really good adaption of the book. It really stayed true to the book. Which I found to be a good thing, it drives me crazy when I see any movie based on a book and they change a bunch of stuff. It did leave some important scenes out but you have to keep in mind it is a 500+ page book they can't keep every little thing in it. It is best to read the books and know the first book before hand or you might be a bit lost but over all it stayed really true to the book. I thought the acting was good and the actors did a good job with bringing the characters to life. Especially Taylor Lauter (sp?) with Jacob and no I am not a teenage girl obsessed with Taylor Lauther (I'm in my 20's) I am commenting just on his acting and I am not a fan of the character Jacob, but Taylor Lauter nailed the role of Jacob. All the actors did excellent jobs as well. So if you are a fan of the series you probably will enjoy the movie."

"Mer_Girl_Fits_Heaven","5","27","64","18 November 2009"," It's not right, but its OK.
","Chris Weitz doesn't seem to take thesource material quite as seriously as Catherine Hardwicke did, so thedull, grainy trying-to-look-edgy photography is gone, and the filmmakers seem to be having more fun with the Volturi, who are immensely entertaining in a campy kind of way. There is also a wonderful sequence where Bella Swann is under water and in more danger than she realizes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we don't meet the Volturi until nearly two thirds through the movie, and that little water sequence is a very brief scene in a movie that's more than 2 hours long. For the rest of the film, we have to deal with the supremely mopey Kristen Stewart as, who has turned in fine performances in films such as ""Into the Wild"" and ""Adventureland"", but here is playing below her pay-grade. After Edward breaks up with her, she decides her life is over and mopes for what feels like an eternity. This isn't particularly interesting or entertaining. In Twilight, Edward and Bella's romance seemed to be utterly miserable. THere were very few moments of happiness between them, making their infatuation harder to swallow. In New Moon, there are attempts to show that Bella and Edward actually enjoy each other's company, but for the most part they are horribly cheesy (such as a scene where they are jogging together in slow-mo) Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black is charismatic and sweet, but this is undermined by Bella's depression. It's hard (and depressing) to believe that such a ""winner"" would be devoted to anyone so self-involved. And the fact that he takes of his shirt at any and every opportunity, however contrived, makes it clear that this isn't a movie for discerning audiences, but super soft core porn for female audiences (not that that's a bad thing in and of itself, but it certainly detracts from the supposedly ""intense"" narrative). In conclusion, this is definitely an improvement on its predecessor and there are some good things, but they are too few and far between to merit a viewing in the cinema."

"All_Hail_Hurley","1","5","8","27 April 2011"," One of the Worst Movies of the Year
","After 'Twilight', I didn't think these movies could actually get any worse. I was, unfortunately, wrong.<br/><br/>The first problem with this film is the acting. I'm sorry to say this, but neither Kristen Stewart nor Robert Pattinson could act to save their life. Stewart's problem is that she's never actually acts--she just plays herself, over and over again, in every film she's in (not something to aim for when being an ACTRESS, mind you). She stutters, blinks and breaths unnaturally heavily the entire time, while speaking with literally no emotion whatsoever. Robert Pattinson at least attempts to play a character; I'll give him that. He instead takes what I like to call the 'constipated' approach: he scrunches up his big eyebrows, wriggles his nose around for a minute and then, finally, after taking a good five minutes to think his line over, speaks in a pained voice. Neither one of these two could muster up any chemistry whatsoever, which makes a movie about a love story difficult to watch. Taylor Lautner, on the other hand, showed a bit of hope. I could see him actually being an average actor if he didn't look like he was trying to remember his lines most of the time. Maybe, with some experience and a different cast, he could grow as an actor (although I'm not counting on it--but his abs will probably get him far).<br/><br/>The next problem is the script. The majority of the lines in this film were downright ridiculous and unrealistic, much like a soap opera from twenty years ago would have. The plot felt rushed in some places, and incredibly slow in others. <br/><br/>The last problem I have is the message it sends to young girls; normally I don't even bother with this, but since this movie is targeted at such a young audience, they should know better. Curling up into a ball and more or less allowing your brain to leave planet earth and die is not something we need to be teaching tween girls is acceptable behavior. Seeing as how Stephenie Meyer copied the Vampire Diaries in entirety, dumbed them down and published them (and no, I'm not exaggerating with that statement) you'd think that she could use her brain to come up with something that wasn't completely offensive to women everywhere. The makers of this movie, without a doubt, should have taken that bit out. <br/><br/>Finally, as a whole, I would give this movie 1/10 stars... and that's not even being harsh. Anyone with a shred of dignity would not have made this movie, and anyone hoping not to stain their reputation permanently would stay as far away from it as possible. I walked into the movie theatre with impossibly low standards, and yet this film still managed to thoroughly disappoint me."
"yoshi_indo","4","5","8","25 April 2011"," Well.....It was not boring :)
","To be honest I hate Twilight, I hate its message and I hate how it has butchered works of horror literature, and harlequin romance.Surprisingly I found this movie evocative (all negative emotions though), and that makes it a better movie than ""Knight and Day""<br/><br/>The Plot: Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) leaves to confront the Valturi (an elite clan of vampires),leaving Bella Swan (Kirsten Stewart) in a depressed state , to be only comforted by her long time friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner).<br/><br/>The Writing: The plot itself is intriguing, and by itself pretty good. The drama of choice between two different men, and Edwards love toward Bella stems from his inability to read her mind. This obviously means they can actually have passion in their relationship (due to him being unable to read her innermost thoughts). However the characters (or just Bella and Edward) prohibit this reasonable plot to shine through. The symbolism presented in this movie is also so very ham fisted it makes the allegory of homosexuality in X-men seem subtle. I of course refer to the were-wolves (which are more like just wolves, since they are not bipedal), a group of shirtless teenagers who enjoy playing ""physical jousting"" with each other and have no choice of them having this ability. This is especially prevalent when Bella tells Jacob that ""what you are doing is wrong"" and ""stop it"", Jacob retorts ""Its not like I have a choice"", ""I was born this way"". This sort of symbolism is so blunt it made teenagers being rejected by society wearing brightly colored leather, with ""special powers"" seem vague. Bella as character is just pure evil, in lamence term; She is a parasite. She is unable to live without a man, and the actions she commits to keep a man is beyond compulsive. She basically tortures Jacob to be with her, always giving him hope that they may be together, when she obviously loves Edward. The plot itself also seems to support this as every instance that they are able to physically bond (a kiss) a extraneousness circumstance seems to stop them doing so (this happens three times).Edward comes of as un- relatable to me due to the fact I am not a masochist. I do not see why she cannot change Bella into a vampire and forgo all the drama that is this redundant series. Jacob and the father seem to be the only characters that I can support, they are kind, (very)patient , and are flawed, however they are the biggest doormats and have to learn to say no to Bella for this movie to have a remotely good script.The script also completely destroyed vampires allowing them to walk in day light and werewolves being able to change at will. Those are minor complaints that are over used, but still bugged me. The movie was also to long being 130minutes ,making the development between Bella and Jacob become padding rather than character development. 2/5<br/><br/>The acting: Asides Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson everyone turns out a reasonable performance, the extras are able convey their grief, joy and anger with consistence. However the two leads are consistent to the point of ossification, they never convey a single emotion asides non-chalance. I can sort of let Edward go with this since he is a conflicted character due to his masochistic nature,but there is no excuse why Kirsten Stewart cannot show emotions (I mean she did that quite well in Adventureland). 3/5<br/><br/>The cinematography: Is average, the lighting is good showing the crisp natural colours of the forest quite well and giving some beautiful vistas of said forest.However there was an overuse of slow motion (that was just inappropriate and jarring), and I am still baffled about the sparkling vampires. I mean they do not just sparkle, to me it looked like they had a disco ball under their pores shooting out strobe lights. 3/5<br/><br/>The score: Just bad the music did not fit in with the fight scenes, and most of the songs played are songs of lament, that would sounds fitting for the plot but on execution just does not work at all. The lazy and sad voices of the bands playing do not fit with the calm soothing imagery provided by the forests that take up most of the movie. 1/5<br/><br/>I cannot give this movie a recommendation by its own merits, however I did find it entertaining as all these mistakes made me laugh quite a bit. I found this movie much more funnier than the parody ""movies"" that have been streaming out these days and on that merit it is worth a rental. Serious score : 4.5/10 As a comedy : 7/10"

"MaximumMadness","3","5","8","27 February 2011"," ""New Moon"" is an Overlong, Vapid, Pretentious and Painfully Boring Sequel...
","There's a point in ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"", where our heroine Bella Swan (Kristin Stewart) and a friend emerge from a movie theater, and her friend begins to rant about how she hates the zombie sub-genre of horror, and then preaches about how she thinks it's silly and lame that a particular zombie movie (George Romero's classic ""Dawn of the Dead"", though it's never mentioned by name, you know that's what they're referring to) preaches about consumerism. At this point, I angrily pointed my finger at the screen and uttered some words I cannot repeat here. It's not that they were making fun of ""Dawn of the Dead""- that's fine. The problem is that this film is a glaring example of squandered potential and storytelling, and it's downright offensive that they should say anything about a film considered to be a classic, by both horror and general audiences alike.<br/><br/>This film, directed by Chris Weitz, is a sequel to ""Twilight"", based on the popular novels by Stephanie Meyer. People who read my ""Twilight"" review know I actually thought it was decent. So I turned this one on a few days ago expecting another (somewhat) pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>When I first watched ""Twilight"", I expected a mess. I was actually taken by how well the film worked. It had a lot of problems, and I only gave it a slightly above average 6 out of 10, but it wasn't bad...<br/><br/>This was bad.<br/><br/>We begin with Bella (Kristin Stewart again an enormous bore), who has grown worried about her future with vampire squeeze Edward- she is having nightmares about growing old, while he remains trapped in the body of a teenager, and she fears one day, he won't want her anymore.<br/><br/>On her 18th birthday, she visits Edward (Robert Pattinson, who this time around, doesn't seem to be taking his role seriously, and just reads his lines flatly) and his adoptive family. However, when one of Edward's siblings attacks Bella from a sudden fit of his vampiric instincts, Edward decides it's too dangerous for him to continue to see Bella, and he vanishes, leaving her.<br/><br/>Bella spends months pining and sobbing for her lost love, but finds a new romance with Jacob (Taylor Lautner). Things finally start looking up for her, when suddenly Jacob disappears, and all hope seems lost. Finally, she reconnects with Jacob and learns that he has become a werewolf, and similar to Edward, he feels it too dangerous to remain with her. She also begins to see ghostly depictions of Edward appear around her, trying to keep her safe from the dangers of everyday life. And soon some strange events unfold, forcing Bella to confront both of her lost loves, decide if she's strong enough to pursue them, and ultimately, see if she's strong enough to save several lives- her own included.<br/><br/>The film does have some promises. The whole notion of the Romeo and Juliet-esque romance is interesting, some of the characters are likable, and there are some nice twists and turns through the story. Also, the direction was a lot better this time (Weitz does a much better job illustrating the visuals than Catherine Hardwicke did in the first film), and the music was fabulous.<br/><br/>But there are just too many problems in this entry, and it's really just a checklist of what NOT to do in a sequel.<br/><br/>For starters, the film is outlandishly boring. Running at 130 minutes, it felt like twice that. The story unfolds at a snail's pace, and absolutely nothing happened for the first hour. Everything seemed slow. It was a chore to watch. And the kicker? Anytime anything actually started to happen... the scene cuts. I'm not kidding, during the first big ""action"" sequence where two werewolves go at it (about halfway through the movie), we only get about 15 seconds of fighting, before we abruptly cut to the next scene- we don't actually get to see the fight, we just cut to another scene altogether. This happens repeatedly. Whenever something happens that promises to move us forward, we simply cut away to another scene. What?! This movie is a horrible tease.<br/><br/>Secondly, the writing (courtesy of both the novel and the script by Melisa Rosenberg) was painful. Nevermind some lines and scenes that are quite misogynistic, but also, the dialog is outstandingly soap-opera-ish. Edward never speaks without dripping off cheese (""Bella, you breathing is my gift!""), Bella spends her time spewing revoltingly pretentious and clichéd dialog, Jacob is basically a compilation of every corny ""bad boy"" ever, etc. <br/><br/>Also, the film has no structure. As I said above, it takes almost a full hour for anything to happen. And once the plot picks up, the pace quickens to a marathon speed, and too much happens. We are also given a number of plot lines that don't make sense and don't go anywhere (such as new villain Victoria who appears all of twice in the whole movie and never does anything... at all.), and enough plot holes to sink a ship. It was just too darned sloppy.<br/><br/>In addition, the humor is juvenile, the action is too brief (the climactic battle is cool, but over within seconds), there is no romance in the film (which is odd because this is a romance movie!), the editing is all over the map, the secondary characters are not developed... It felt like the first half of a larger story, with no climax. It was all establishment, and no pay-off.<br/><br/>Even the things that worked in the first movie are ignored.<br/><br/>I really am disappointed. I was expecting something that was at least decent, but this was just a waste of time, effort and potential. It is essentially a series of stitched-together sequences that don't contribute to an overall plot. There was no substance.<br/><br/>I have to give this a 3 out of 10."
"jboothmillard","3","5","8","11 February 2011"," The Twilight Saga: New Moon
","I knew that if I was going to watch the first film I would have to see the sequel, only because all things vampire were a big craze, and despite it being a low rating, from director Chris Weitz (About a Boy, The Golden Compass). Basically Isabella 'Bella' Swan (Kristen Stewart) has recovered from the previous events, and she is looking forward to celebrating her eighteenth birthday with her love Edward Cullen (Razzie nominated Robert Pattinson) and his vampire family. But when she is attacked again and they all see her blood exposed it is too intense for them to take, so the Cullens leave the Washington town of Forks for her sake. For a while Bella is not spending time with friends, keeping to herself, not talking much and feeling alone, but this changes when she starts spending time with friend Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). It is quite obvious after a while though that they are becoming much closer than friends, and she is also developing a high interest in living recklessly, despite seeing flashes of Edward. After a while Bella is becoming concerned with Jacob, and with the situation of people being killed in the woods, she not only finds out it is a wolf, but that it is Jacob turning into it, he is a werewolf. There is some big deal with Bella going against the dark forces, including an encounter with vampire Aro (Michael Sheen), as she is stuck in the middle of a war between the vampires and werewolves, but Edward returns. In the end Bella is wanting to possibly turn into a vampire herself, in order to be with Edward forever, and he only has one condition which is the film's cliffhanger, she asks her to marry him. Also starring Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Rachelle Lefevre as Victoria, Billy Burke as Charlie Swan, Peter Facinelli as Dr. Carlisle Cullen, Nikki Reed as Rosalie Hale, Jackson Rathbone as Jasper Hale, Kellan Lutz as Emmett Cullen, Dakota Fanning as Jane and Elizabeth Reaser as Esme Cullen. Once again the cast are alright, the scripting is much less of a grip, the moments of action and the special effects are fine, but this is certainly the lowest point of the series, a slightly terrible teen romantic horror fantasy. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Stewart and either Pattinson or Taylor Whatz-His-Fang and Worst Screenplay. Adequate!"
"beckyinindy","Null","5","8","19 November 2010"," Am I having a nightmare?
","Background to my entry to the world of Twilight: I first read ""Twilight"" this summer, right around the time ""Eclipse (the movie)"" came out. Two weeks ago I watched the first two movies (still waiting for Eclipse) after deciding that it would be a total waste of my time to read any of the rest of the books for two days when I can just watch a two hour movie. And so I laughed my way through ""Twilight"" and ""New Moon."" Most of all through ""new Moon."" It showcased the most pathetic excuse for acting I have ever seen from Kristin Stewart. And having just watched the premiere of the newest Harry Potter movie, in terms of acting at least, the two series are worlds apart, if not galaxies or lifetimes. ""New Moon"" was stupid and cheesy. Jacob showing off his abs every two seconds just creeped me out and Edward seriously looks like he's going to a. Vomit or b. Drop over dead at any given moment in time. And can Bella not shut up for more than two seconds at a time? Really, they dated for like, six months and didn't know each other at all before that and yet she's screaming in complete agony at night?? Oh yeah, and if the Volturi can kill people for revealing themselves to humans, why didn't they kill Edward a long time ago because he revealed himself to Bella and they obviously should have known by that point in time. Ridiculous. Can't wait for Eclipse to come out on DVD so I can laugh at it too."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","5","8","7 April 2010"," Actually, it is more tolerable than ""Twilight,"" but not by much
","As a movie-lover, I had to see what all the fuss was about, so I watched ""Twilight"" despite minimal knowledge of Stephenie Meyer's books. I didn't like it, but felt it could be done better, so with Catherine Hardwicke switched out for Chris Weitz, I decided to see if the franchise could back-up its hundreds of millions in revenue earned from ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon."" Weitz improves the action, but the romance is maybe even worse and the story still all over the place.<br/><br/>For one thing ""New Moon"" is a long three-parter for a romance-centered story. To its advantage, you come in with knowledge of the characters, but the movie begins with a lack of momentous conflict. Edward (Pattinson), our vampire, tells Bella (Stewart) he's leaving because she's ""not good for him,"" aka he's a vampire somehow she's gonna pay for that. As this happens we're slapped with Romeo & Juliet references, which for tweens is effective symbolism/analogy usage, but not for anyone over the age of 16.<br/><br/>Weitz could have cut 15 minutes at least from ""New Moon"" by virtue of erasing the pauses between lines of romance dialogue. If Edward and Bella spoke to each other like normal people do and without this weird attempt to understate the melodramatic tension through emotional sucker punch lines such as "" ...(pause)...you're not good for me,"" then ""New Moon"" could go under the two-hour mark and manage to feel like one film instead of three.<br/><br/>When Edward leaves we're treated to indie-music montages of time passing and Bella being depressed and seeing blurred visions of Edward everywhere and wanting a ""rush"" because she's so completely devastated by his choice. It's too much internalized conflict for the beginning of a film. The franchise's constant, writer Melissa Rosenberg, probably had to fight over book loyalty or drawing out parts that would make the movie flow better -- not an enviable position, but either way ""New Moon"" is structurally terrible.<br/><br/>The middle act is then Bella's budding relationship with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), her washboard abs Native American friend who also has his secrets: he's a werewolf. Poor Bella, she always attracts the late 19th/early 20th Century literary monsters. At least at this point the action starts to pick up when Bella realizes she's being hunted by the bad vampires from the last movie and werewolf Jacob tries to protect her. The movie lets go of the romance for about 45 minutes which is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>But before all is done the story rockets back to Edward and fast-forwards at lightning pace through the final act that takes Bella on a plane ride to see the Vampire leaders, the Volturi. It's the dessert we have to cram down before we get kicked out of the restaurant because we've sat down for too long. ""New Moon"" really is a three-course meal that has one or two good items but regardless, lacks anything tying it all together as a ""meal"" until the final five minutes.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Weitz manages not to do one thing Hardwicke did in ""Twilight"": make me laugh at the movie. I didn't find anything so cheesy that I rolled my eyes and that, as a total outsider to the Twilight books and Twi-hard fandom and such, is a huge victory in my opinion. The action, while abusive of slow-motion, at least has a sense of style, though certainly more budget flexibility existed with ""New Moon.""<br/><br/>A lot more work would need to be done to give the Twilight Saga a film it could hang its hat on critically speaking, but money talks louder in this case, so what does Summit care? I still think there's a good movie in this franchise somewhere, but guessing about the books and knowing what Rosenberg has done adapting them, anything more than tolerable would be a surprise.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"colinrgeorge","2","5","8","6 April 2010"," ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon""
","It really freaked me out when I first realized celebrities were getting younger than me. Two weeks out from twenty-three, I'm already starting to feel like an old fart. And so, in the interest of open-mindedly embracing my juniors' most recent box office obsession, or at least in an attempt to distance myself from those who've congested the internet with second- hand cynicism, I offered the Twilight Saga two hours of my time. Now, I've never read any of Stephanie Meyers' novels, and I haven't seen the first film, so my litmus test may be flawed from inception, but I gleaned enough from ""New Moon"" to not only catch up with its angsty supernatural love triangle, but also to deem it dead on arrival.<br/><br/>Chief among its misconceptions, ""New Moon"" is packaged as a blockbuster but deals heavily in the abstract. The heart of the film is loss and the desired effect should be a visual provocation of melancholy, but the story is often too silly (werewolfs) or too melodramatically pretentious (vampires) to earn the incessant pouting or self-pity of its egotistical protagonist, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). The film attempts her brain surgery with boxing gloves.<br/><br/>This second installment in the series also presumes its audience is already deeply invested in Bella's relationship with the 109 year-old vampire, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), but as a stand-alone film, we're given nothing that suggests the legitimate profundity of their connection except for the sweet, clichéd nothings they whisper to each other, one- dimensionally enamored in such a way as to suggest that the feelings they share are much too vague to be accurately filed, 'love.' If anything, their relationship seems only to reinforce the high school stereotype of overeager hormones as a surrogate for genuine affection. And as for Bella's centennial significant other, what does her grating persona offer that eleven decades of other women hasn't? Furthermore, where does this relationship fall in regards to pedophilia?<br/><br/>The film is further cheapened by its abbreviated visual shorthand for male attractiveness. Falling cleanly in step with the grand tradition of sexualizing women in boy's comic book films, The hunks of ""New Moon"" (which would make a great 2010 wall calendar), add little more than perfectly parted hair and bare, toned abdomens to the proceedings. Exhibit A: one Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), teenage grease monkey, wolfman, and all-around studmuffin, with whom Bella seeks solace after being left by Edward. The movie plays itself as a reconciliation piece for the majority of the achingly insubstantial second act, with Bella learning to cope with heartbreak and carry on. Her maturation is completely undercut, however, in that she won't allow herself to view Jacob as a replacement for Edward, and in a narrow elusion of Shakespearian tragedy at the end (call it Romeo and Juliet and Dracula and the Wolfman), is happily reunited with him. The excessive, plodding character development is rendered entirely ineffectual because everyone ends up precisely where they began.<br/><br/>--With one exception, which makes for perhaps the most ludicrously unnecessary cliffhanger in the history of franchise film-making. Bella wants in on the vampire scene, which like everything, Edward is moodily adverse to. In the final moments of the film, he agrees to grant her wish on one condition--her hand in marriage. Bella gasps, credits roll. I mean, shouldn't that go without saying? What else would this dunce call a life of eternal commitment? She'll swear her undying love and accept the curse of perpetual life, but has never considered the 'M' word? Are you kidding me?<br/><br/>""New Moon"" is a film that will be enjoyed almost exclusively by fans that are either too familiar or too enamored with the source material to judge it objectively. The premise seems to have potential as a bleak independent film, but these characters are marginalized to the point of virtual nonexistence. The emotional core of the film, its relationships, are unconvincing, and as pure spectacle, the action is unexciting. The themes have been more eloquently expressed in a thousand better films, and the visual effects have been surpassed by nearly every other major blockbuster this year. In short, ""New Moon"" is a corporate impression of art that rings hollow with each simulated emotion. It exists solely to sell a label.<br/><br/>So call me an old fart or take this review as further proof that you don't need to know the series to hate it, I can't disagree. Like an actual new moon, there's really nothing to see."

After I expressed my self-righteous indignation, she insisted that, contrary to my preconceptions, it was, in fact, thoroughly entertaining.

","I've read all the books 3 times each and yes I am a twilight fan. Twilight had the magic, even though the acting wasn't the best but yes it did have the magic that I wanted to see. <br/><br/>I actually didn't watch New Moon when it came out in cinema but I bought the DVD when it came out and I have to say that its the worst movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I do think Taylor is so lovable as Jacob and obviously handsome and cute, he actually could act from time to time but some scenes were just to awkward and artificial.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Bella and Edward just didn't exists, and the dialog was stiff and lack of emotions. ""Bella"" looks more bored and restless than in love with her one TRUE love Edward. There are some scenes were I do believe Bellas love for Edward and that is when ""possibility"" are played and Bella is sitting looking out the window really depressed and sad. The other scene was when she was under water, seeing Edward. But the rest of the acting from Kristen Stewart was pretty bad, just breathing heavy and looking bored and uninterested in everything.<br/><br/>The other thing that was nice to see was when Bella saw Edward, warning her and telling her to stop whatever she was doing, the werewolf was OK in most scenes as well.<br/><br/>but still,, the bad acting made me laugh from time to time..<br/><br/>So what can I say, I am not suppose to laugh at a movie like this since I read all the books and loved them all. Good book but bad Movie. Sorry! Hope Eclipse will be better."
"mentalepidemic","1","5","8","24 March 2010"," The Plan 9 of our Generation
","What is there to say that hasn't been said already? The acting is god awful, the ""special effects"" are poor, etc etc. Boy vampire decides he's just too dangerous for her and leaves, and human girl sets feminism back about a hundred years by moping around and jumping off a cliff. That's pretty much the movie. Oh, and throw in a shirtless werewolf to prance around and thicken the ""plot"". The plot, or lack thereof, is mediocre at best, but we have the wet dreaming, ""I got my degree in Literature but I still write like a six year old"" Stephenie Meyer to thank for that. <br/><br/>There were moments during the film where I literally covered my eyes because it was just too awkward to watch(such as the make out scenes). Kristen Stewart is the Da Vinci of awkward, and not in the cute, teenage awkward sense. I mean socially retarded, ""I can't bear to look at you because I feel embarrassed for you"" awkward. And Pattinson wasn't any better; when in doubt: look intense and glower and mumble. I was hoping that they would take the chance to improve how they interact with each other since the first film was so abominable, but they didn't. I would argue it got even worse, actually. They can't...get through..........a sentence....without a huge....pause.<br/><br/>One other thing that other people may not have minded so much but drove me crazy was the music. In lieu of a real score, which could have been artistically redeeming, it's just hip indie hit after hip indie hit that has nothing to do with what's going on. It's obviously just to get tweens to buy the soundtrack, which of course they did, so kudos on the marketing. It's basically the playlist of any depressed teenager set to a movie. <br/><br/>The only thing that made this bearable was watching it with Rifftrax, absolutely hilarious."

","I rented this movie just strictly for the purpose of making fun of it, and it certainly did not disappoint. From the cringe-worthy dialogue to the severely wooden acting, I probably will never understand why this crap is so popular because it is in a word ""pathetic"".<br/><br/>I don't buy the whole star-crossed lovers thing, why you ask? because its pretty hard to say you love somebody when you can't even look them in the eye? When Bella gets the paper cut in the first part of the movie, Edward throws her against the wall, but does he check on her to see if she's OK, NOOO he just frickin' stands there like a lump staring at her!!! To say the actors playing the characters have no life is a understatement. Stewart and Pattinson look like smiling might actually kill them. I honestly seen more life in dead people. Lautner at least tries to show some emotion, but in the end its just not enough to make anyone female outside the age of 13 care.

","OK. At first I didn't care less about the movie or the books. But somehow I ended up with moon light story on my hand during a fight. So I began to read it and I enjoy it. The book is full of sexual tension, passion, doubts, struggles, pain and etc. That was the most important key for the book being such a blast. I'm talking about its intensity. It makes girls wants to live in Bella's skin. You can't stop reading until you what's gonna happen. But then, it came the movie, I saw the first one, no big, didn't read the book. I got really, really disappointed with the New Moon movie. I don't know if it was the actors, if it was the director Whatever I know that I couldn't find myself enjoying it. Here SOME of the reasons: <br/><br/>1. Where the hell they put the sexual tension between the characters? <br/><br/>2. I couldn't see the evolution of the Jacob's and Bell's relationship to the heating passion. <br/><br/>3. Spent too much time in insignificant parts: the running after Victoria, the months passing by Bell's, spinning around (WHERE WAS THE PAIN SHE WAS FELLING BECAUSE EDWARDS LEFT HER BEHIND?). 4. It should have spent more time in: Jacob's and Bell's relationship - the heating growing between them, the moment that Bells and Edward meet again, the conversation that they had, etc. <br/><br/>5. It was a botched work. Some many mistakes happen on production and post production. <br/><br/>6. I couldn't feel ANYTHING, was like I got an anesthesia before get in the theater <br/><br/>I understand that much was left behind because of the age limit, but should the age be like 16? The whole movie looked like a synopsis of the book, sad.<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm very sad. I will have to choose between reading the next book or watching the movie, so I don't get this felling of wasted time. I read some comments before I made my own; here are a couple of them: -<br/><br/>""This is garbage, PORN for WOMAN"": and what is wrong with that???? Why it makes it garbage? If it is, the book is a good one!! =) LOL - <br/><br/>""About Bella being a reckless example for the girls because she is not thinking on college or something"". Well that's why it goes under the FANTASY category, COME ONE! You have to take everything as an example to live? So turn your TV Off, the Radio, shut down the Internet and go live on a farm I think that it must be some good examples there LOL Well I'm done Sorry about the English I'm Brazilian =) and I really hope that the directors is reading some of this comments before laughing the next one!"

","I am sorry to say that this was one of the worst films I have seen this year. If I had watched it on DVD instead the cinema, I would have switched off after five minutes. It is a very boring film indeed with very little continuity, though got to say that my 11 year old son loved it and he is reading the books. My guess is if you like High School Musical 3 and 17 Again, you will probably like this also. When people fidget with their handfones after only a few minutes, it is a sure sign. the love triangle of the human girl, vampire and werewolf is a curious one and I hope they explore that more in Twilight 3 rather than concentrate on Twilight 3 the Love Story. Many of the previous sentiments I echo. Bella as a young woman, should be portrayed as someone wanting to live and to represent moral and social values, not give herself to the afterlife with a vampire or a werewolf. Change of director, change of setting I think also needed, get the story back out of American hands and give it to the French who really know how to make a movie like this. I did like the scene in the town (French?) when all the townspeople were dressed up in red at midday and it helped to give meaning to the opening scene of the film but to contradict myself, the scene was an expensive overstatement to the film which is after all set in America not in Europe. The Jake actor has real potential but sorry Edward Cullen, you don't cut it for me"
"v_ady29","1","5","8","9 December 2009"," The greatest disappointment ever
","When I heard that New Moon was coming, I was extremely curious, because Twilight launched a new concept about vampires... That they are almost human... But what I saw in New Moon, disappointed me very much. This movie is so bad, that, if I wasn't at the cinema, I would have left... I heard that they want to launch the next chapter from Twilight Saga... Let's hope that is better than the last one... And, how they won't let me post this comment unless it has minimum 10 lines I'll say something about the actors: Kirsten Stewart can't play, I don't know how she got that part; Robert Pattinson has some acting skills, but I don't appreciate him that much... Taylor Launtner may have some talent, but his role wasn't so good... That's all folks!"
"newguy85","5","5","8","7 December 2009"," Meh
","I have not read the books, and am just basing this off of the acting and dialogue present in the story.<br/><br/>First, let me just that I felt as if the only player acting with any conviction was Lautner. His character was believably obsessed w/ Stewart's character, and you could feel the angst in his dialogue, regardless of how poor it was.<br/><br/>Greene was also a scene stealer, though her scenes were few and far between.<br/><br/>I gave this a 5/10 based off of Stewart's and Pattinson's performances. We are supposed to believe that these star-crossed lovers are deeply devoted to one another and insanely in love, but there was no chemistry, and no emotion in either of them.<br/><br/>The movie also tries to parallel Twilight to Romeo and Juliet in the first 20 minutes of the film... If you have to parallel your story to a famous romance to convey the relationship your two protagonists have with one another, you have failed as a writer.<br/><br/>Stewart acts like she's distracted or that she's too good for the Twilight crowd. The detachment that she feels halfway through the movie seems real, but she acts like that while she's with Pattinson. If she thinks this gig is just a means to a career, she has another thing coming, and she better fine tune her acting- I'll assume based on what I saw that her Joan Jett biopic will be a disaster.<br/><br/>Pattison is like a dolled up zombie for the entire movie, and his ""you are my everything"" lines scream ""we don't know how to write love"". He speaks with no conviction or passion, yet that's everything his character is supposed to represent... he also has a funny looking left nipple (see the scene where he rips off his shirt).<br/><br/>Actually my biggest pet peeve of both movies is the musical transition for the budding relationship. We're supposed to believe these people are falling in love, but have nothing but a music video to base anything off of.<br/><br/>Maybe the movie fails because of the actors, maybe it's the writers' faults, maybe it's both, but unless you're the obsessed fangirl that saw this movie in week one, the only character remotely relatable is Jacob, due to a fairly mature performance by Lautner.<br/><br/>I went in expecting mediocrity and that's what I got. My girlfriend is making me read the books before the next one, so maybe I'll have a different perspective this time next year."
"Killyoufirst","5","5","8","6 December 2009"," It is what it is
","SPOILERS BEWARE<br/><br/>In General: The movie bored the living hell out of me. That's the first thing that pops up when I think of it. I nearly fell asleep quite a few times. For the most part it just shows Bella moping around, risking her life, and building a romantic relationship with Jacob. Hmm..I'd say that takes up about 70% of the film. The other 30% is of Bella's birthday and the trip to Italy.<br/><br/>The Good: What's good? Well it was better than the first one. Plus, the Volturi were pretty cool. It would've been better if they were in it more.<br/><br/>The Bad: Acting was still bad, and some scenes that were supposed to be more on the serious side, were totally laughable. Why would you fall in love with these characters? How could you fall in love with someone who has no substance, emotion, or anything? Then, why would you still want them when they leave you like your nothing? <br/><br/>Overall: I believe it's better than the first one. It is what it is though. I won't harp on it for too long."
"si_walters","2","5","8","4 December 2009"," Not the worst film I've ever seen (but comically baaad!)
","I've not given this film a 1 simply because I've never seen the first so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt - maybe I just didn't have the level of involvement with the characters that I should have. Anyway this is the only film I've ever been to see where the audience have gasped and cringed audibly at the really, really awful bits (except for the odd dodgy horror flick, but that's part of their charm). The moment where the werewolf guy takes off his shirt after ""adrenaline junkie"" Bella bangs her head when falling off her motorbike immediately comes to mind...just laughable! The acting is breathtaking in it's badness too. Robert Pattinson is just tragic - he thinks mumbly = moody. Well in a sort of teenage, hormonal way it does, but he should be through the teenage moodiness now - his character is past the century mark. PLEASE LEARN TOO ENUNCIATE ROB - He makes my Northern English sound like I'm about third in line to the throne. The lead girl has loads more chemistry with Pattinson's on screen Dad, in fact after the ""papercut"" incident when he was fixing her up I kind of assumed the director had asked for some kind of on screen frisson. Hey I've not read the books so maybe thats where it heading, keeping it in the family and all that. Perhaps I'm too old for this rubbish and just don't get it? I should've known when I bought the tickets, when the seller gave a little giggle, where it was all headed, lol. Maybe like a vampire I haven't got a soul. I think this is just fair for teenage girls who aren't really watching, but they really need to be engrossed in something else to not notice how terrible this is."

Lot of blinking, lots of pauses and very monotone awkward dialogue, Kristen and Robert have no chemistry in this movie, their bad acting combined together was painful and laughable, however... <br/><br/>The movie haves a good storyline (even if people said that it’s not even close to the book) Taylor (Jacob) acting was really good compared to Kristen and Robert... and he is only 17, however Kristen and Taylor had a lot of chemistry on this movie, I could tell that so easy the way she looked at him at his chest and face/body, with such emphasis,<br/><br/>I think there is a lot of a characters conflict on this movie, perhaps they should dis Robert (Edward) because his acting skills are the same as Kristen (or even worse), and on top of that he is not that hot if you compare him with Taylor The movie was boring at certain points, but it was OK for me, I like movies with that kind of stuff The cgi animation was way too fake as well."

","BRAVO!!!! BRAVO!!!! BRAVO!!!! Just one word: UNBELIEVABLE!!! Congratulations to Stephanie Meyer and to the wonderful direction of Chris Weitz. I finished reading the book today at 3:30 p.m. and it met every expectation, the lines were perfect, the acting was superb, Taylor was hot!!! Oops did I say that!!! From the script to the acting to the beautiful scenery of Forks, Washington to the beautiful city of Italy. Everything was just amazingly accurate and breathtaking. This movie really brings out the best in Rob, Kristen and Taylor, they let their emotions fly and they were just phenomenal. I could not be a proud Twilight Fan and a true at that if someone had not encouraged me to read Twilight in the first place. I am now hooked beyond measure. I can't wait to see what Chris can do with the 3rd installment - Eclipse. This may not be a professional review, but it is a personal one. I thoroughly enjoyed myself tonight as I was captivated and kept on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to get this movie on DVD to add to my Twilight Saga collection. Again, this is a must see for anyone who believes in love and that love prevails against all odds."
"Melapi","2","14","30","20 November 2009"," Bring Back Catherine Hardwicke!!!
","Chris Weitz clearly doesn't connect with the love story that drives the Twilight series. I was expecting his adaptation of New Moon to be poignant, to bring to life Bella's painful heartbreak and her struggle to figure out her true feelings for one of her closest friends. I was not expecting it to be a second-rate teen movie! <br/><br/>Weitz's New Moon is packed with soap-opera moments, hot naked torsos and pretty poor special effects. The scenes shot in Tuscany end up being the most memorable ones in the entire movie, largely because of the stunning backdrop! Twihard tweens will probably love this movie, but I don't see how any other Twilight fans could.<br/><br/>Let's hope David Slade does a much better job with Eclipse."
"jayraj-rao","5","8","15","25 November 2009"," Don't go by the Promos will Disappoint
","Had loads of expectations from ""The New Moon"" but was disappointed.There are numerous reasons to dislike ""The New Moon"" . 1.Direction 2.Music. 3.Run-time. The run-time for the new moon should have been much more.You cannot be expecting a story in a novel being explained in a short run-time.The editing of the movie was just not upto the mark.Most of the scenes were left unexplained e.g.Jacob's transformation into a werewolf.The movie seemed to be moving hurrying towards the latter half which was again not acceptable. The effort should have been to portray the nuisances of the character in a much finer way than what twilight had done rather than hurrying through the motions just to create a sequel to earn quick bucks.The background score in the first movie was much better than this one.It was actually one of the reasons for which i liked Twilight. The direction lacked the conviction which was there in the first part ""Twilight"" it seemed the director merely wanted to make a really entertaining movie on a plot which is complicated,difficult to handle and therein lies the problem with ""The New moon"".It could easily have been one of the best movies of 2009 if given the right treatment was meted out with a bit more screen space to the ""Volturi"" which was primarily one of the entertaining things in the movie. Summit entertainment needs to get its vision for ""Eclipse(Post production)"" and ""Breaking Dawn"" right it needs to be clear on whether to provide classic adaptations or just churn out run of the mill adaptations and waste plots for classics such as the ""Twilight"" series.I wont be wrong if I say ""Rob.Pattison"" is one of the reasons for the success of this Series.And they cant be expecting him to carry bulk of the load on his and Kristen stewart's Shoulder's. And there are some reasons You might just like ""The New Moon"". 1.Rob and Kristen. 2.Volturi. 3.Cullen family. 4.Special Effects. Though kristen stewart looks out of sorts at times with the same expression again and again(as most people complain about her expression)she does a commendable job.Robert Pattison one of the saving graces of the movie does a really good job with the kind of screen space he's given.The ""Volturi"" and the ""Cullen Family"" require a special mention as they didn't go overboard in any of the scenes in the movie from what i remember.The Special Effects in the movie was much better than the first one which was expected by the fans of this series. All in all ""The New Moon"" was entertaining but in parts,it could have been a classic but sadly the justification to the script and adaptations of the character was not done. Go watch ""The New Moon"" with least expectations of being entertained(as it promises in the promos) and hope the production house gets its right for the other two parts with regards to the the Direction,Run-time and Music. A Chapter not conveyed properly."

","I went into the cinema full of high hopes, having loved Twilight and read all of the books and seen the exciting adverts for New Moon. Sadly after the cool opening title where it is slowly revealed by the moon for me it rapidly went down hill. The first thing I thought when the lights came up was god, that was boring!<br/><br/>In an effort to include as much as the book as possible I felt it skated over everything, never going into depth. Considering this film is supposed to be about the Wolves, they weren't in it that much although I did enjoy the bits that they were in the most.<br/><br/>When Edward left Bella, considering how well she'd acted at the end of Twilight when she was in Hospital and Edward suggested they separated, I thought we were going to see more of that in the scene where he leaves her. In this film she was sad, but she wasn't sad enough! In the book when he leaves its like all the joy had gone from the world, like she has been sucked into a black hole.<br/><br/>When Jacob first disappears after his change its weeks before Bella manages to see him again, but in the film this all happens in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>When Alice and Bella go to Itlay to save Edward, they get there far too quickly, in the book the tension builds because they're journey drags, they have to take a long flight, Alice gets stuck in the traffic, but they miss all of that in the film so it doesn't feel exciting because you don't get that build. When they do get to Italy in the film and are in front of the Volturi, it doesn't feel like a big deal like it is supposed to be, in the book its built up to be really dangerous. Although I thought the Volturi were well cast and well acted.<br/><br/>I really liked Kristen Stewart in the first film, I thought she acted really well, but in this film she seemed barely affected by anything. I liked Jacob a lot, he was the best thing in the film. I also enjoyed any bits that had Bella's Dad in it, he's good. <br/><br/>I thought the scene with Bella, Mike and Jake in the cinema was funny. I also really likes the scene where Victoria was running through the forest and the Wolves were chasing her I thought it was really atmospheric. <br/><br/>The part where Bella gets on that guys motorbike and goes off with him annoyed me because it seemed the like a pointless bit of Director's licence where he could get a bit more of action in. It was also frustrating that Jake shows up at the beginning of the film to give Bella a Birthday present which makes it look like they're already really close when in the book he's not in it till after Edward leaves, and that's when they're relationship first begins to blossom, because when Edward was around she barely spent any time with anyone apart from him, let alone Jacob.<br/><br/>I liked the score, but in the scenes where there wasn't any music it was really noticeable. <br/><br/>Also I thought the Vampires looked really odd in this film, especially Jasper, in comparison with the first. In the first film they all looked very nice but I didn't think they stood out enough among the collectively attractive cast, because they are supposed to be abnormally beautiful, but in this film they did stand out, but it was because they looked abnormally weird! Most noticeably their eyes. I didn't care about the Cullens in this film with the exception of Alice, they were boring, even Edward.<br/><br/>The end felt rushed but I liked the confrontation between Edward, Bella and Jacob (minus the part where she says don't make me choose 'cos if you do I'll pick him, I'm pretty sure that doesn't happen in the book) and the fact it cut off with Edward saying will you marry me like it was a massive cliffhanger annoyed me because nearly everyone in the cinema knew he was going to ask!<br/><br/>Perhaps it would have been better if they hadn't decide to go down the frankly unsuccessful Harry Potter route, having a different Director each film. I thought that the Catherine Hardwicke did a good job. I'm hoping I will like it better on a 2nd viewing, and also that the Director for film 3 will do a better job!"

","Well, i wasn't expecting something so special after i saw sample from the movie. So it wasn't big surprise for me how the movie was. New Moon isn't better than Twilight first part, for sure. It seemed to be more realistic the scenes, make-up and everything. Director could make better job, i am sorry but he really could. In some moments i thought that i am watching some movie for stupid kids. And it wasn't fault of the actors. They play quite good. Just movie isn't so good like the book. I hope the third director will make better job with Eclipse. However they change actress for role of Victoria it still can be very good movie, I hope at least. For me New Moon was quite disappointing."

","I was dragged to see this with my younger sister, even after telling her in no uncertain terms there was 'No way in hell I was going to see that stupid sparkly vampire movie' I had seen the first movie - found it okay if a bit ridiculous.<br/><br/>New Moon definitely has a different look and feel to the series. From the music to camera angles - it's comes off as very polished. I personally preferred the grittier low budget feel of the first movie but with the CGI involved with this one they wouldn't be able get away with it.<br/><br/>Some of the dialouge is horrendous. The classroom scene where Edward talks about suicide and Romeo and Juliet made me feel like gagging. But Robert Pattinson's slow motion walk through the parking lot kinda sorta made up for that.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewarts acting has gotten better. I'm not saying she's good - but she's definitely improved. That is, until the scene when Edward is fighting one of the Volturi and her horrible scream 'NOOOO!!!!' left me embarrassed and ashamed for her as a person.<br/><br/>Eye candy is aplenty, I wasn't the only one in the theatre that softly sighed when we're introduced to the shirtless wolf pack.<br/><br/>There were quite a few unintentionally funny moments - where the director seemed to be painfully striving for seriousness. One memorable scene was when Bella gets a tiny cut on her head and Jacob whips off his shirt. Really? the whole shirt for a cut the size of a small pea? couldn't just dab it with the bottom of the shirt? Ugh and the slow motion running Edward and Bella do *cringe* - when you see it you'll understand. And Jasper's hair, something was going on there - looked like a dead cat flopping around up there.<br/><br/>I didn't like the music, but that could just be me - my sister enjoyed it. I felt that the use of 'slow mo' was used abit too much.<br/><br/>I did however, love, love, love the Volturi - so freaking cool. And a great montage scene leading up to Bella jumping off the cliff. And did I mention the wolf pack? Sigh.<br/><br/>All in all a pretty decent movie for what it is. I was told by my sister that it was extremely faithful to the book. She also noted that movie Jacob is ten times better than book Jacob who comes off as whiney apparently."

","I'm with Team I-hope-they-all-die-soon-so-this-crappy-series-will-end.<br/><br/>The first one was bad enough, this is even worse. It still has the wooden, looking broody instead of acting, performances of the first, and the limited dialogue. However, the plot is even duller this time. And now, to add to the lack of acting, we have one ""actor"" whose only function seems to be to show off his abs at any opportunity!<br/><br/>Even worse, it just goes on and on. 130 minutes for something this bad - that's 120 minutes longer than the concentration span of its intended female teen audience.<br/><br/>Watch True Blood instead."
"joshuadrake-39480","9","3","4","17 April 2015"," The worst of the ""Twilight"" saga
","-- WARNING! This review contains spoilers!-- If you haven't seen this film, you might want to before watching this review.<br/><br/>The film follows Bella Swan as Edward Cullen leaves Forks, Washington with his family after a conflict with his brother Jasper Cullen trying to kill Bella on her 18th birthday. Bella starts being depressed for months after her unexpected breakup with Edward. However, her dad decides to send her back to her mom until she starts spending time with her friends and develops a strong relationship with Jacob Black.<br/><br/>That is just the main premise of the story, but there is more to this movie's confusing and incoherent plot.<br/><br/>I'm not going to cry like a little girl over this film but I hate this movie. It's a sequel based on a book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer and I thought it would interest me but after watching this film with my sister LeeAnn, I just walked out my room in disgust and a lot of angry.<br/><br/>The plot is confusing as heck because it's really dumb and not a good idea. A lot of critics put down this movie which I am glad they did because this movie does not deserve to have universal critical acclaim and it's not really good at all. The plot is slowly paced and it's very long -- being at 130 freaking minutes long -- I will not watch The Twilight Saga: NEW MOON ever again in my life. I read the book and it's okay. I loved the book version, but once I watched the movie, I just found myself saying, ""What in the heck did I just watch?"". That is exactly how much I hate this movie.<br/><br/>The one part of ""NEW MOON"" that really got me mad is when Kristen Stewart's character, Bella Swan, is screaming in her sleep after Edward leaves (because she misses him) throughout the whole darn movie. That is just stupid and what an outrageous idea. By the time she finally stopped screaming, I was really ready for this movie to end quickly, but i had to see more of this slow-paced movie. Her screaming, it definitely drove me crazy.<br/><br/>They spent a cheap worth of money on this movie and this movie succeeds at the box office? The film cost $50 million dollars to make. Man, that is crazy. If i have to say anything nice about this movie, I will bring up the acting and the music. The music is by far, really good by Alexandre Desplat, who would later go on to compose the final two films in the Harry Potter film franchise, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"" and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2"".<br/><br/>The acting, from my point of view, falls flat. But I will give credit to Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and also Dakota Fanning, who plays Jane, while Stewart and Pattinson are playing Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, for a second time. Michael Sheen plays the role of Volturi leader Aro and he is really good and he played the werewolf character, Lucian in ""Underworld"", ""Underworld: Evolution"" and ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"". He played that part wonderfully and to see him in a TWILIGHT film is spectacular.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner plays the role of Jacob Black once again and he does a good job, too, but even then, it's incredibly over the top and he tries way too hard to make Kristen Stewart's character, Bella, like him. I do love the CGI werewolf version of Jacob, but the rest of the CGI is terrible. Some of the dialogue is horrible, but some of it is also really good. The pacing and editing is slow and awkward.<br/><br/>So, overall, I hate NEW MOON! I know it has it's fan base and THE TWILIGHT SAGA films does have it's fan base, so if you like this movie, that's fine, because we all have our own opinions, but I just found this to be unwatchable, unbelievable and I found this to be a waste of time."

","Unless you are a 13 year old girl , it's not seen as a good thing to say you like the Twilight movies. I found out the hard way when i gave the first movie a good review. I really enjoyed the film having known nothing about the books and i was really looking forward to the second instalment - New Moon and to see what happens with both Edward and Bella. Sadly the answer is not a lot. New Moon is a bloated movie that drags , and drags and drags while not a lot happens. <br/><br/>Just after Bella's 18th birthday, Edward decides to leave her behind in an effort to protect her. As the heartbroken Bella sleepwalks through her senior year, numb and alone, she discovers she can summon Edward's image whenever she puts herself in jeopardy. Her desire to be with him at any cost leads her to take greater and greater risks, including a new taste for high-speed motorcycle jaunts.<br/><br/>With the help of Jacob Black , her childhood friend and a member of the mysterious Quileute tribe, Bella refurbishes a motorbike for her adventures. Bella's frozen heart is gradually thawed by her budding relationship with Jacob, who has a supernatural secret of his own.<br/><br/>When Bella wanders alone into a meadow, she finds herself face to face with a deadly attacker. Only the intervention of a pack of extraordinarily large wolves saves her from a grisly fate and the encounter makes it frighteningly clear that Bella is still in grave danger. In a race against the clock, Bella learns the ancient secret of the Quileute tribe and Edward's true motivation for leaving her. She also faces the prospect of a potentially deadly reunion with her beloved that is quite unlike the one she had hoped for.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced about a acting ability of Kristen Stewart. Having seen her now in two Twilight movies and Adventureland I'm starting to think that she flatters to deceive. After two hours of her constant moping and moaning in this movie and a similar performance in adventureland I'm not too impressed. Now with Robert Patterson , i feel completely different. I like his style of acting . Where Kristen Stewart looks like she is just going through the motions , Patterson puts everything into making Edward as mysterious as a Vampire could possibly be. New Moon isn't a total disaster . It looks great and there are a couple of really good fight scenes , one involving the Wolves and the other Aro's henchmen and Edward. The Problem is the story of whether Bella is to become a vampire is impossible to sustain throughout the entire two hours and it's difficult not to feel bored. The final scene is so anticlimactic and without giving anything away all i can say is , only a woman could find it in any way interesting . I just hope the next movie is a lot better otherwise i feel that the audience for these movies will just be the screaming teenage girls."

","I have read the books(I'm just finishing them for the 2nd time) and I went into the movie excited but not expecting a lot. A movie just never is CLOSE to as good as a book. The guys in the wolf pack were beautiful(as were the graphics.) Fanning and the guys who played Aro, Caius, and Marcus were all wonderful additions. Even Jasper's(Jackson Rathbone) acting is better! I loved it! It's full of action, adventure, and OF COURSE romance. I even jumped once or twice. (This coming from a CHEAP chick) I thought the movie was so worth the $10 we paid to see it that I'm going again!<br/><br/>My only dissatisfaction? I'm really frustrated by the number of people who voted low on this movie BEFORE it was even out. I may be wrong, but though there must have been a FEW people who saw it before it was out for the public, there were over 2,000 which leads me to believe that a lot of non-Stephanie Meyers, non-Twilight, non-Robert Pattinson fans must have voted. Oh well, I thought it was great!"

"brchthethird","4","4","6","13 November 2014"," A stale and boring rehash of the first one
","More of the same from terminally awkward teenager Bella Swan, and unfortunately this time it starts to wear out its welcome. That's not to say it's all bad, though. Some positives include improved cinematography and a good soundtrack. The cast also seems more comfortable in their roles this time, although the peripheral cast is woefully underwritten and seems to be there just to pad out the story/run time. This time around, Edward leaves Bella for her protection almost as quickly as they got together in the first one. This leaves more time allocated to supporting character Jacob Black, which wasn't a good thing. Taylor Lautner isn't as good of an actor as Robert Pattinson, and he lacks the (limited) charisma that Pattinson brings to his role as a 109-year-old vampire. Another positive element is several self-aware pop culture references and jabs at the nature of the story itself. But a few funny moments do not a good movie make. The story has some major pacing issues, jumping right into the story but then slowing down to a crawl as Jacob and Bella spend more time with each other. Also, in this installment, the audience is introduced (rather unceremoniously) to the Volturi, who seem to be some kind of vampire ""elitists"". After an offhanded reference early on (which does have a cool sequence of a vampire being ripped limb from limb), they aren't seen until the obligatory climax which this time involves Edward threatening to expose himself for what he is. One minute, Bella's in Forks reuniting with Alice and the next, she's whisked off to Italy to save Edward from getting himself killed. It all just happens so fast and without much aforethought. One positive thing I did get from this rushed final act was Michael Sheen, who plays the Volturi leader. He brings a certain elegant sleaziness to the role which I liked. He also seemed to be having fun with the ludicrous material he was given. After this sequence, the movie ends on one of the most ridiculous cliffhangers I've seen in recent memory. Overall, the movie doesn't cover any new dramatic territory, which results in it being stale and boring at times. However, the filmmaking quality was improved, even it just amounted to polishing a turd."

Kristen Stewart, Taylor and Robert did a great job, and so did the director. You could see that they had much more budget for this one than for Twilight.

"Susie-daisy","10","13","28","25 November 2009"," There is nothing wrong with this movie
","I was both excited and worried when first going to see New Moon. Excited because I love Twilight the film and all the books. Worried because this was the second film I'd be seeing where I'd read and loved the book first and was anxious to whether or not they'd get it right. I'd read and loved the Half blood Prince before seeing the film and the film became a huge disappointment. Although I'll never be fully happy because its impossible to fit a whole book into just over 2 hours and so there are things I'm gonna miss, i can't say I was upset. Most people who complain about the acting and the film as a whole are just non fans who can't stand that its become so big, and I'm getting bored of listening to these people online. I've read the books a lot, and so has my boyfriend. Neither of us are silly little teens, we're both mature 23 year olds and although he's more of a J.R.R. Tolkien fan and not obsessed with Twilight like I am, he thought New Moon had been done very well and stayed very true to the book. Some of his other male friends who'd been dragged to the cinema with there girlfriends also hated to admit that they enjoyed it. The acting of every main character was done exactly as I'd imagined from the books if not better. Although I love them both, I wasn't sure if Kristen and Rob could make the break up scene as heartbreaking as it should be but I actually found myself caught up in every second of it and was blown away. I feel like after Twilight they realised how special these books are to people and they put everything into knowing these characters. Anyone who wasn't impressed with there acting doesn't get the characters in the book. If they weren't doing it right, Stephanie M would have let them know. Jacobs character was also a lot like I imagined and the chemistry between Jacob and Bella was played out perfectly, as was Bella and Edward. I loved the way the film captured that even though Bella is growing closer to Jacob, he can still never be Edward, this is something I was worried about before seeing the film. And can I just say, Bella is a teenage girl who is so clumsy, always worrying and so insecure and helpless. Yet she always puts everyone else first and will risk her life in an instant to protect the people she loves. Okay she really needs the vampire she loves in an unhealthy type of way. But he needs her that way as well and thats what love is, thats why its such a strong story. Love that powerful makes you weak and tells a great story. And thats what the Twilight sage is about, its about Bella and Edwards love and how nothing can overcome it. Its a great love story and she's a great role model. Anyway, everyone did a great job, New Moon is beautiful and hasn't done fantastically for no reason, I'm just worried about Eclipse now but although I'm not sure about the director, I fully trust the cast. I've not been this excited about a bunch of movies and books in my life but I've given 9 instead of 10 because I really didn't like the vampire contact lenses this time around and being New Moon, like Bella I really missed Edward Cullen and no amount of muscles can help with that."

I get emotional with the characters and can connect with them. New Moon did all of that and more. It exceeded my expectations. I read the books and love all of them. New Moon wasn't particularly my favorite... I am team Edward all the way but this movie actually made me consider team Jacob for a second. I thought Taylor Lautner did a phenomenal job portraying everyones favorite werewolf. I thought him and Kristen did a fantastic job showing Jacob and Bella's relationship grow. I was extremely emotional the whole movie. They followed the book more than I thought they would. Of course there were things left out, but that is to be expected. They can't make it 5 hours even if we all want them to! I liked how they had Bella sending Alice emails to show us what she was thinking and feeling inside since a great deal of the book is in Bella's head. It was great seeing it move from the indie film style to the traditional film style. I thought the actors were amazing. Even better than in Twilight. The special effects were fantastic! From the fast, glittering, composed vampires to the HUGE wolves! The fighting scenes were wonderful! It was definitely a shocking movie in the best way possible! I don't know... maybe I have low standards? but I LOVE LOVE LOVE New Moon!!!<br/><br/>10 stars in my book."
"sharmikty","10","11","23","24 November 2009"," Bad example??
","To those who thought this was a bad example to young girls because she gave up her life for the man she loved. First of all it is fiction, a love story. Second of all should we ban classics such as Romeo and Juliet?? Juliet ended her life when she found Romeo dead. It is literacy and art. Vampires are fictional and so is Bella. This book and many other fictional books (okay so its been made into a movie, same thing), is created so people can step outside of their normal lives and experience something different. I thought that the whole series was brilliant, easy to read and easy to watch. If your teenage girl wants to give up their lives for a man, then perhaps instead of taking a stab at fictional characters, they should start by pointing the fingers at themselves as parents."
"aroy924","10","14","31","22 November 2009"," Excellent!
","First of all, it seems everyone with a bad comment has to tell everyone that they've read all 4 books. Well, I don't know if it makes you an instant authority on the subject if you've read them but, I have read the books twice, and loved the movie. I was surprised as most movies have their own take on the book. I think it was awesome as I felt that it truly captured the tragedy, angst and depression of the relationships that I felt from the book. If you can empathize with characters at all, you'll get what this movie (book also) is all about. The chronology in the movie is a lot easier to keep up with than the first instalment of Twilight, making it a lot easier for 'non readers' to follow along the time-line. If you liked reading Shakespeare, you'll like New Moon."
"Satiney","10","14","31","20 November 2009"," Definitely true to the book, and definitely NOT disappointing
","Well first I am a huge Twilight fan and needless to say I read all the books and was waiting for that movie for a year. But when I saw all those negative comments I thought OK maybe their expectations were high but so was mine.It's not an easy task to make an adaptation of a book, even a book like this long and complicated to adapt, so yes it was not entirely as good as the book itself, and the scenes were kept short and emotions were just cut out right at the moment when you're going to start to feel something. But it's purely for the reason that it was a book adaptation. I know how long and complicated the book is, and it was much more difficult to put it on the screen compared to Twilight. <br/><br/>Whatever they did, I think they did it, because they didn't wanna missed out a single chapter. And as far as I've noticed, they didn't miss a chapter. Everything was in there and perfectly screened. But because of that reason they had to make short scenes. But whatever the problems I think they did a good job and I generally like the movie.<br/><br/>When it comes to the acting, I think Kristen was on a lot of pressure. It was like she took the whole movie herself. And all those emotional scenes, Ä± think she managed it quite well. Unfornutaley we cannot see a lot of Robert in it but still he was perfect. Taylor was, no words for him. I mean he was Jacob Black! Everything Stephenie wrote in the book about Jacob was there in Taylor. He put so much into this movie and you can clearly see that.<br/><br/>So before making any negative comments I think you should consider the difference between book and its movie version, and most importantly you should look at it from the director's and the whole crew's perspective. Stephenie gave them a new world to play on, but it's not an easy world. You both need to add emotions, action and drama and comedy and fantasy everything was really hard to combine. But overall it's worth watching. And thanks for that cast and crew, they did a really good job..."
"georgiafawn","10","14","31","20 November 2009"," Worth Seeing
","This movie was way better than twilight. Better acting, funny, and not to mention all the guys. Taylor worked hard and it shows. Even though Robert Pattinson wasn't in the movie that much (sad) it was a great movie. i cried, laugh, and was completely in love with the movie. If you haven't read the books you should, you will get more out of it. And people have to understand they can't put the whole book in a two hour movie. They might have to change something from the book to just get the point across in the movie and to make it flow a little better. Will see again in the future. And will buy the DVD once it comes out and watch it a million more times than twilight."
"Geovanna","1","7","13","29 November 2009"," So awful that I thought it funny!
","The most ridiculous movie I ever seen! <br/><br/>I actually laughed at the ""romantic"" scenes! The lines are so poor and the actors so bad if you don't laugh at it, you can't watch it. The only good actress, Dakota, has only a couple of scenes! Why did she get into that after all? She can get better movies.<br/><br/>The plot is childish. People said to me the book is nice, it is the kind of reading you din't stop until the end comes. Maybe it is. If it is, the movie completely ruined it. Bad jokes, bad lines, poor characters, weak story. That's all I saw about it. And, as a director, when everything you got is bad, what do you do? Explore actors bodies! as a woman, I have to say, the only good thing in this, are the werewolves bodies. Don't waste your money watching this."
"Zac111111","1","7","13","26 November 2009"," awful, truly awful
","This movie was truly and utterly painful. My expectations weren't high, New Moon was my least favorite of all the books and I saw how they handled the first movie but this movie is an all time low.<br/><br/>The ONLY thing I will give them ANY credit on are the Vampire's eyes, the contacts were brilliant. Otherwise this was one big depressing train wreck.<br/><br/>The acting was wooden and patchy, with some crucial bits (such as the meeting with the Volturi) nearly achieving a comical status.<br/><br/>The music was acoustic assault, it was ill timed and placed as well as being complete garbage.<br/><br/>They have blown a lot on special effects with this one, and for what? the werewolves sucked. the animators completely slaughtered them.<br/><br/>The highlight of the entire movie was when Bella falls over a log. the acting was so bad, so transparent that you can't help but laugh.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm depressed I paid to see this movie. in fact, I would pay NOT to have to see it again...."
"melhassa","2","7","13","25 November 2009"," What happened to NEW MOON ?
","OMG was this the movie that had so much hype that even I got lost in it all ? I totally agree with most of the comments that the acting was BAD BAD BAD..doesn't Kristen know any other expressions than the ones in which she painlessly expressed in this second rate movie? Robert was bearable and yes I did raise an eyebrow when Jacob took off his shirt...suddenly felt a little hot under the collar. But what did it for me was that I actually nodded off for about ten minutes in the middle of the movie...any one got a pillow ? My husband then raised his eyebrows at me and silently spoke those words 'Thanks for dragging me along' to which I then silently gave that stare 'Sorry'"
"richnieh","4","7","13","24 November 2009"," Watch in Cinema only once. Forget about DVD.
","OK, the sequel is better than the first movie, that is my honest opinion, but it is only because the first movie was bad enough to make the sequel a better one. If you are a fan, fair enough, you would probably like it but I don't understand how you become a fan in the first place. I watched the movie because it is selling so well and I actually thought they made a much better movie than the original.<br/><br/>The acting itself is pretty bad as always. The story does not make much sense and the special effect is really nothing special if you watched 2012 (which by the way one of the worst acting with amazing special effect). I liked the area they are shooting the movie though, I enjoyed more watching the beautiful more than I enjoy the movie. Kristen Stewart was the only actress I thought had any acting skill which is still not very good. I thought at least I can watch some good story this time involve more with the history of the Vampires and Werewolves but it is still not very well explained. OK, you can argue that the movie is not going for that part of the story but the emotion aspect of the main characters. Too bad the love story were hardly romantic or touching or any kind. It might be the immaturity of the acting skills of the actors and might also be simply too hard to make the movie emotional.<br/><br/>The main topic of movie was not clearly identified. Sometimes you can mix several ideas in a movie so it can indulge several emotions from the audience but in my opinion, it is a very dangerous thing to do. Movies try too much always end up in disaster. Fortunately, there are always special effects to save the day and it does look pretty cool to see the wolf changing action, but that is about the only thing that is impressive.<br/><br/>It is a mediocre movie with unclear intention. It is not really a good romantic movie because there are very thin bonds between the couple (or their acting was so weak, I could not feel it). There are not enough actions to count it as an action movie. There is not even a strong story line to support the movie if you are comic fans. I would rather watch Buffy couple more times than watch this movie again. By the way, Buffy is one of the most overrated TV shows I have ever seen. I still prefer it over New Moon."
"richesm","10","15","34","23 November 2009"," If you've read the books....
","Then you will realize that Hollywood cannot fit over 600 pages of an awesome novel into a 2 hour movie without compromises. Yes I agree Kristen Stewart does not have more than one or two looks. She cannot show any expression ~ a horrible actress for this part. But the story is perfect for the book. I loved it. I'm a Team Edward fan, but this movie almost actually changed my mind to a Team Jacob fan. Taylor Lautner plays Jacob to a T. He's perfect. I also think that Rob Pattinson is an amazing actor for Edward. For all of you that have not read the novel and have decided to rate this movie very poor, you're idiots. You have to read the books to really understand the movie. Have you ever known any movie to be better than the book?? And if you've read the books, didn't care for them, then you shouldn't watch the movie. Of course you're not going to like it if it didn't care for the books. So stop leaving bad reviews."
"jdbocher2001","10","12","26","21 November 2009"," Fans of the novel will be pleased!
","Having read New Moon I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay was almost identical to Stephanie Meyer's novel with a few essential changes (ex: Edward being an apparition as opposed to Bella just hearing his voice). Once again the dialogue leaves something to be desired however the acting is better in New Moon. Better, not great. Also, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner play their parts flawlessly and display a great chemistry as ancestral enemies. As with the last film, the screaming fan girls are really going to take away from one's moving going experience. I found myself, being a guy and all, contemplating suicide but I can honestly understand their behavior. The ending made me very eager to watch 'Eclipse!' can't wait, fans of the novel should for the most part enjoy the film."
"wunderwhirl","10","12","26","21 November 2009"," It was a good movie. I don't get what everybody is gripping about.
","Okay, I don't usually spend time ever writing reviews like this, but I feel like I have to since this film is getting hammered.<br/><br/>First let me start off by saying, I've read the books, seen the first movie and am in my 20's so no, i'm not some overly obsessed tween fan girl. I went into this movie not having the highest expectations for this film after seeing the massively awkward text we call Twilight: The Movie last year. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the first but it had A lot of shortcomings.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed in New Moon was the color and the lighting. Everything as really rich with warmth and the colors chosen really popped. The lighting that was used in New Moon, I feel, made the actors look a lot better, which was the problem I had with the first. It was too cold and blue, and the lighting reminded me of florescence which makes everybody look bad.<br/><br/>Second: Having a Cinema director made all the difference! Cathriene Hardwicke was passionate about the series, but she just wasn't a movie director. And believe me, it showed. I'm happy they gave the project to Chris Weitz. Personally, I think he did fantastic work with his choices of camera movement and angles. His cinematography really invited me in as a viewer which is what it is suppose to do. Hardwicke's camera work really always kept me at arms length and was never really intimate feeling.<br/><br/>Third: The acting was a good bit better in this movie. We all know how much of a brick Kristen Stewart was in Twilight, and I was dearly hoping it would not be that way for New Moon. She's improved quite drastically, to my surprise. She actually was able to convey emotion when it was appropriate. They other characters held their own as well and improved their characters from the last film.<br/><br/>Finally, the time line and adaptation. I've heard a lot of people on here gripping about the scenes being too short or prematurely cut or jagged feeling. I'm really not sure what they're basing this argument on. I felt the movie ran along at a smooth place. Scenes are going to be shorter if not slightly altered from the book. It's an adaptation people! It can't be dead on 100% of the time. The movie would be 4hrs. I thought they did a brilliant job of capturing this book on film. Some things were altered, some changed but thats okay with me. I realize that it can't ever be perfect, and other people should too. Movies are complicated beings on their own, practically unruly when a book's involved.<br/><br/>Overall this film was a good movie. I honestly don't know why it has such a low review. The only way I can figure is that there are people out there that are dead set on hating this film no matter what. I give it a 8 out of 10 but i felt the need to score it a 10 to offset the unjust hate. If you've read the books and can appreciate the film as an ADAPTATION and appreciate the stylistic effort that was put into it, then you'll enjoy this film. It's a MASSIVE improvement from the first, but if you're dead set on hating it, then don't bother. You wont ever be happy with any of them."
"ArthurMausser","6","50","139","15 November 2009"," New Moon, I give you a Full Moon!
","I don't know if it was because it was overly exciting to get a true Sneak Peek at the New Moon before everyone else but the thrill disappeared when the movie started (just like drinking beer is no longer exciting after turning 21).<br/><br/>Bring an alarm clock with you. When the movie starts, set it for 40 minutes so that when you fall sleep it will wake you up. Bella and Edward ""Moo goo goo-goo"" and other boring banter in the beginning. It gets slightly entertaining after that.<br/><br/>Alice is the only one who brightens the screen not just because of how cute she is, but because her acting is good.<br/><br/>New Moon offers what Twilight fans expect: It is written for teenagers especially teen girls and they will love this movie. The costumes, makeup and artistry in the film are excellent but cater to the teens as well.<br/><br/>Most upsetting is that these Vampires would have had their butts whooped by any of the True Bloods or Bram Stoker's vamp. Even the Lost Boys make the NewMooners look like Lost Girls. Wolf Boy was kind of tough but the Vamps in this movie are really weak!<br/><br/>The Volturi are introduced in the New Moon movie. Jane being played by Dakota Fanning, who will most likely use this paycheck to pay for further acting lessons. <br/><br/>Of course, Stephenie Meyer wrote the 1st three books very well so I'm giving 5 stars for that (it's very difficult to mess this movie up with such good writing). I give 1 star for the make up and costumes. I give 0 stars for the Lifetime Channel dialogue between the teenage characters especially Kristen Stewart who is not acting but is just herself being overly dramatic at times.<br/><br/>Of course, most everyone reading this is going to see the movie anyway but I at least state now ""You're not going to miss much!"" Read the book instead if you have not already.<br/><br/>The next installment, Twilight Eclipse, will most likely have Teen Vampires from The Gap fighting Abercrombie & Fitch's Vamps!"
"jelenaskopje","10","13","29","22 November 2009"," Just like i've imagined New Moon...Kudos to Chris and the crew!!!
","Well, to be honest, i saw a pretty low quality picture...but knowing the fact that i live in Macedonia and would've wait for months to be able to see a better quality one...not to mention that it will never show in our cinemas...So long live the torrents:) Regardless, i must say that i am a huge fan of the books. Liked Twilight the movie, it wasn't perfect but the emotions were there and the actors were great, not to mention the music WOW! But NEW MOON, it was a surprise! And a positive one too! The characters are physically closer to how they r described in the book and how i imagine them (ex.Bella looks more human, red chicks and everything, while vampires are pale in contrast and look more angelic, more perfect, also the eyes are better, i think the color is better in whole). The thing i feared most of how would they transform in the movie were the wolves and i must say KUDOS CHRIS!!! I can say that the wolves coming out from the first time was my favorite scene, and than Jacob phasing ti fight Paul, the detail ""Bella in Jacob's wolf self eye"" was so touching!!! So, i understand that maybe this isn't a movie for those who don't like the books or haven't read them, maybe there will be a lot of people who can't understand the true meaning of the story, the myth, the love triangle...after all it is SCI-FI people!!! It is an imaginary world!!! And just few advice if you still haven't watch the movie: 1. Read the books before you see the movies 2. Go see Twilight before New Moon 3. Don't read any positive/negative comments, or get free from prejudice before you see the movie 4.Let your self free to imagine, to dream, to get lost in this magical world 5.ENJOY<br/><br/>10/10 from me...can't wait for ECLIPSE!!!"
"renapetes","10","13","29","20 November 2009"," GREAT!! WAY better then Twilight
","I LOVED this movie, it was so much better then Twilight which after watching a few times I actually like a little bit now. I have read all 4 books, this is my least favorite of all the books, but it really followed the story amazingly!! I'm disappointed in the reviews for it, either people didn't really read the books or i don't know!!! 1. Yes, if you loved the vampires they weren't in it hardly at all, but that was the same as the book. 2. Reviews have said Bella can't make up her mind who she loves, WRONG, she clearly says ""don't make me choose because it will be him, it has always been him"" to Jacob. Ummm...again if you read the books you know this. 3. People talk about the awkward kisses, well remember, her blood is so tempting to him...I think a lot of people forgot the story before they went to see this. I loved it, can't wait for the next installment, which is my favorite book!! The acting isn't award winning, but its a great story, go see it for yourself, just remember its Twilight, not Vampire Diaries, True Blood or any of the other new or old Vampire stuff that is out there!"
"nesa_fili","5","18","43","18 November 2009"," Disappointed
","I read the book days before going to see it and so much important details were left out of it. I found it had too much comedy when this is suppose to be the saddest and most tense book in the series.<br/><br/>At first, it started really good, but when the school scene jumps straight to the birthday one, I thought that just happened all too quickly and then it just kept happening throughout the rest of the movie. Was annoyed when it skipped Charlie getting angry when Edward bought Bella back home from Italy and the meeting with Jacob. The switch from Volturi to being home was too quick. So if you hadn't read the book, you wouldn't know what had happened. The motorbike ride when she was with Jessica I thought was a waste of movie time.<br/><br/>I was hoping to see Bella cry more, and I didn't feel the pain or emptiness she feels in the book. Also they made Kristen look pretty in the movie when after Edward had left her, she should have looked more like how she did after the drowning scene. Edward looked much more terrible than Bella did.<br/><br/>As for the werewolves, you didn't see the pack much. Taylor was awesome as Jacob. Thank goodness they kept him. Didn't like that his character wasn't as rude and mean as he is in the book. There's no real difference between Pre & Post wolf Jacob to Bella which I thought was really important.<br/><br/>Ashley Greene's acting was pretty bad. Alice just wasn't as good as she was in Twilight. They could have showed her seeing more visions and of Edward going to the Volturi. When she told Bella about Edward it seemed all too quick & casual. And the scene when Bella gets home to find her there, Ashley didn't do it justice for me.<br/><br/>Lastly, the music in the movie was stupid. Nothing catchy about the tracks. Twilight had much better music. There should be the same Theme song at least.<br/><br/>All in all, I think Catherine Hardwicke did a better job of bringing Twilight to screen.<br/><br/>Really disappointed, and maybe if I hadn't read the book, I would think it was an awesome movie. Although, in saying all this, I will definitely watch it again!"

I read to be KNOWLEDGEABLE, HAVE FUN & TO ESCAPE my ordinary life or uplift it. The ""Twilight"" series is superbly written and very youthful.

I'm 51y/o and I like keeping up with the youth in my life and what their into 'cause it keeps me young:0)!!! The ""New Moon"" saga was wonderfully done and I distinctly remember love and all its complexities being the most important thing in my life @ 18!!! Bella is a ""little old lady"" trapped in a young girl's body but someone who hasn't read the series wouldn't know or understand that!!! Calling her shallow or not wanting anything out of life as far as a career or knowledge just goes to show you what some knuckleheads truly know about the entire story.

","Just watched the early morning release of New Moon and came away with mixed feelings. While the movie closely follows the format of the book and tries to explain Bella's 'feelings' with the same type of narrative like in Twilight, I found that the scenes were a bit disjointed or stopped too short.<br/><br/>Little extras could have given the movie more flow and it heavily relies on the watcher having read New Moon prior.<br/><br/>I also feel it tries to quickly explain too many conversations and back up knowledge.<br/><br/>I think that all the hype and excitement of the movies upcoming release left me a little wanting when I finally saw the movie and will try to refrain in future from watching too many previews of Eclipse.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a movie for the fans. Taylor Lautner comes into his own in this movie and I am looking forward to seeing Taylor and Rob in their scenes in the next movie."
"neoptolemost","3","6","11","2 December 2009"," A - kind of fun - mediocre (spoiler)
","This is not a movie for all the Kusturitsa and Antonioni fans out there. This is a movie made from a series of books written for girls up to 16 yrs old. And I emphasize the word ""girls"". The mentality of the male heroes have nothing to do with the way a male thinks but everything to do with the way a female would like them to think. Heroes, protectors, strong/silent types, ready to sacrifice themselves for the heroine and so on (what happens when in real life a girl finds a guy like this is another story but the word ""looser"" is involved). It's a typical romance with a twist of vampire to sell it easier to your average dreamer. I mean, we have a 109 yr old guy (vamp or not not important) who falls for a 17 yr old girl and he's not a ... teen lover. Just seriously in love, probably cause they have a lot in common and tons of subjects to discuss in the forever they want to live together. And not after her body either! I guess the script you can make from a story like this goes so far. And to follow pace with it, the director didn't dare to add depth to any of the characters, in case he ruined the recipe. A very well thought idea! Good, bad and the rest of them kind of thing. <br/><br/>Said the above, the movie was a mediocre as an action flick and also mediocre in the special effects department. I won't write about acting cause there isn't any. Still, it gives you 2 hours of watching the wolf boy taking his clothes off (man semi-naked: major good thing, plain wolf: bad computer graphics) and the vampire boy not been able to breath from the heavy make-up (lipstick rather too red for my taste, face too pasty - the rest of his siblings had it a lot better). Have to admit that my age been around 35, I laughed a lot, especially at the last scene. Thankfully it wasn't only me but the whole theater, so no guilt over that.<br/><br/>Now, about the girl of the movie. Well, she's 17 and she acts her age (give or take 2 yrs). Honestly, I didn't know that when you're 17, traveling to another country is so easy when you're an American. You just say to your father ""be back in a day or two, don't have to know where I'm going, see you"" and all is OK. Unfortunately, here in Europe, parents demand to know a little bit more about small things like that. Culture, culture ...<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you're up to (stretch) 20 yrs old girl, go and see it. It's rather fun and not badly paced. If you are older watch a re-run of True Blood. More twists in each episode that in the whole movie. And the vamps are much much better looking with less make-up and faces that don't look like they've been hit by a shovel face on. Even, I dare say with confidence, better actors."

"purple_haze_hendrix","5","8","16","21 November 2009"," This Will Never Be Amazing
","First of all, I have read all of the books and watched the first film a million times. I'm a huge fan of fiction, and I do agree that the books are poorly written - yet entertaining for a one-time read.<br/><br/>I understand why people feel let down by this movie. Some of the special effects were cheap and the acting, from Kirsten Stewart in particular, wasn't great. However, I never felt bored once during New Moon - I actually preferred it to Twlight. I thought that lighting was a great improvement, it made the film a little more realistic. Also, the new appearance from the vampires were excellent - they looked exactly how I imagined them to in the book, with tired eyes and bright golden pupils. They are vampires after all - they arn't meant to look like humans.<br/><br/>The fight scene between Edward and the Volturi was visually stunning and despite not being in the book, the film needed that extra scene to make the film more exciting and to show how powerful and fearful the Volturi are.<br/><br/>This film will not appeal to ANYBODY who is not already a fan of the books or of Twilight, as they will not be able to look past the fact that these vampires glitter in the sunlight. It is not a horror film, it is a romance. The vampires arn't meant scary, therefore it is a little unfair to compare them to Dracula or true blood - its a completely different take on the vampire mythology.<br/><br/>Some of the dialogue was absolutely appalling though - some lines in particular had me in hysterics when I'm pretty sure they were meant to be serious. And the scene in the flash forward with Bella and Edward running through the forest must have been a joke, if not it could have been done so much better.<br/><br/>New Moon was not terrible at all, and I was not disappointed as the weak points that were in the movie were exactly what I expected. I thought that it stuck to the book really well and was much better directed than Twlight. Chris Weitz has done a good job at turning arguable, the most boring and depressing book of the series into a funny and entertaining film, which will make all 13year old girls weep with joy every time they see Jacob without his shirt on."
"lieksototally","6","8","16","20 November 2009"," A Beautiful Adaption - Yes, it is an ADAPTION.
","So, I am an avid fan of the Twilight Saga. I admit it is not high quality. I admit the books are poor quality. Yet, I still love it - I love the characters, the story, the romance. <br/><br/>I waited with ridiculous expectation for New Moon, and my high expectations were mostly rewarded. New Moon is a weak book overall, and I thought the film did an excellent job making it appealing.<br/><br/>The good: - The plot was well interpreted. Reviewers claim the film is 'boring', but I considered it to move along at a ripping, exciting pace. Much of the plot was crammed in, kind of like a checklist - but this did not detract, it enhanced. All the necessary elements were included and polished, and the weaker details were ignored - Overall, the cinematography was impressive and occasionally quite artistic - Special effects, particular the werewolf transformations, were very good - a HUGE improvement from the first movie (which is quite abysmal) - Kristen Stewart's acting had improved dramatically, even if I still dislike her acting style. She portrayed the pain and numbness of Bella's character quite well. - The Italy scene was almost entirely how I pictured it: Sweeping, melodramatic and intense - All additions were impressive: The wolf pack, and Volturi (particularly the gorgeously scary Dakota Fanning) - Stand out actors were Billy Burke, Taylor Lautner, Chaske Spencer and the humans in general, who added some nice comic relief. Oh Anna Kendrick, what beautiful zombie ad-libbing. - The gorgeous Ashley Greene as Alice - The ending make me smile - The soundtrack was beautiful, particularly the use of Anya Marina's Satellite Heart, Bon Iver's Roslyn and Lykke Li's Possibility. Perfection.<br/><br/>The bad: - Kristen Stewart still manages to stutter and blink more than what is normal for a human - Bella's initial escapades in Port Angeles - really? REALLY? - Removal of a few minimal key moments, such as a few lines spoken by Edward in the book which could have been included - Cheesy dialogue - 'you're like your own sun'. Let alone pointing out Lautner's biceps. Don't worry, we noticed them already. - Alice's horrible vision. A nice idea, badly shown.<br/><br/>All the bad points are very nit-picky points, so they can be disregarded if you desire. <br/><br/>If you love the book and the series, you should enjoy the film. Chris Weitz has elevated the Saga to new levels of quality, and is a huge improvement on Hardwicke's initial disasters.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the books - see the film, ignore the critics, and make up your own mind. I think it's worth it. It's not genius, but it's entertaining, devastating, melodramatic and romantic. What's not to love?"
"tinylight3","5","18","44","19 November 2009"," Better than the first one but not good enough
","I'll just start by saying that this movie offers some major improvements from the last movie. You can see that they were working with a bigger budget because they have better special effects. It is a good thing that they had a bigger budget considering that it was going to be tricky to do the transformation from human to werewolf. However, there are still a few cheap looking special effects but nothing major. The sparkly vampire effect could have been better as well as the people cliff diving but like I said it wasn't major.<br/><br/>The soundtrack its pretty good. All the music seems to go along with the scenes.<br/><br/>However, as good as these things are some things are lacking. The major problem that I had was that the two main actors, Robert Patterson and Kristen Steward,do not know how to act. What should have been a very emotional movie in the sense that we could see and sense the pain that they are going through by not being together, there wasn't. Kristen just always seemed to have the same facial expression be it when she was supposed to be sad or happy. I just never felt the emotions that she was supposed to convey. Robert seemed to do a better job but it wasn't much better. To me, he is more eye candy than actor. The director certainly didn't help his main actors to hide these flaws, most of the scenes have close ups to the face and I would get it if there was some emotional facial expression to be conveyed but like I stated earlier, there wasn't and makes these flaws more noticeable.<br/><br/>However, the rest of the cast seemed to act well. I was surprised that Taylor seemed a better actor than I thought. He conveyed most of the emotions that Jacob was supposed to be feeling well. He did seem to have a lot of shirtless scenes in the movie but if one reads the book, it sort of seems understandable. The movie was entertaining even if it was corny. The Volturi were freaky specially Michael Sheen. I think they made good casting choices from what you could see.<br/><br/>To the fans of the Twilight Saga, you will not be disappointed. To those that are not,do not spend eight dollars on it and just wait either for the dollar theater or DVD. Give it a 5/10"
"dazzlindancer","10","12","27","21 November 2009"," New Moon was excellent!!!!
","I went not hoping for much, because ""Twilight"" was good, but let's be honest, anyone over the age of 14 probably rolled their eyes at most of the dialog. I was prepared for the same. But I was very wrong. New Moon was brilliantly acted. The characters seemed much more real this time. Especially Alice, Emmett, and Carlisle. There was comedy in the right places, real comedy this time. Not lame comedy like last time. Stephanie Meyer should be very proud of this movie. The werewolf boys are brilliant, Dakota Fanning as Jane was miraculously haunting, and they kept you wanting more. In the theater I was in, the laughing, cheering, and crying said that this audience was more than satisfied. It was so good! I can't wait for Eclipse even more now!"
"anna-508","8","24","62","21 November 2009"," Better Than Twilight...
","Firstly I have to say that, no offense to Catherine Hardwick - who, btw, did a fabulous job with Twilight - but the second installment was an improvement. I am very spoiled when it comes to special effects and I always look at them when I watch a movie and New Moon delivers is. The werewolves were amazingly done. So much work must have gone into the fine details. Even with the little screen time we get with out favorite vampires, the La Push boys fill the space nicely, but not completely, of course. Of course the movie is flawed in some ways, every one is and there is no such thing as the perfect movie. I may be a Twilight Saga fan and have been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long, long time, I can say with 100 % honesty that it is well worth your money. The acting was actually better in this movie too. I'm not saying they were acting poorly in Twilight but there was something extra now. We have Chris - the amazing director - to thank for that. I am happily awaiting Eclipse and with the way that the movies are progressing, it's probably going to be even better than New Moon. Before I finish, I would like to add one important detail; when Twilight was just about to be released, I remember seeing tones and tones of released clips and TV spots and like the fan that I am, I watched all of them and that actually destroyed how I took in the movie a little bit so this time, I only watched the two or three trailers that were released and I loved the movie all the more because of the mystery. It's not fun if you see all the good parts before. In summary; excellent movie with great special effects, romance and more action than the movie provided (and in this case, that's a good thing). So I give it 8/10 which I think is the most appropriate."
"cmb56-586-640162","Null","24","62","19 November 2009"," embarrassing
","I am extremely bothered by the fact that the vampires in the twilight saga can come out into the sunlight. There have been many changes in vampire lore through out the years, but the most consistent component in a vampire story and pretty much the cornerstone for myth of vampirism is that they can't be exposed to sunlight. Once a vampire is exposed they die a painful and hideous death they don't simply glow and only come out when its cloudy. I feel that this concept is embarrassing to all vampire genres. I think Blade would even be upset at this silly notions.they incorporated pretty much all of the other components of vampire lore but left out or altered the main idea. I can't get past this and it. I think bells also accepts the fact that her love of her life is a non living night stalking creature. Even Sookie Stackhouse put up more of a fight before giving in. Thumbs down"
"aperollphobia","10","9","19","22 November 2009"," Pretty amazing!
","I loved New Moon! I mean, I do agree the chemistry between Bella and Edward was way off! But that isn't really the actors fault. The book is a different setting for them and it has them both on their toes with their feelings. I loved the wolves and just everything! Like most books to videos, I would change a few things but all in all it came out great!! I think everyone just got all wrapped up in all the hype and didn't really see the true points between the acting and book. Personally it does set a good message for girls, not the best, but good, it shows to fight for what you love, because you'll regret letting them go!"
"bexi_dfs","8","9","19","21 November 2009"," Fantastic sequel to twilight
","New Moon is a much darker sequel to twilight and although some of the content of the film may be lost on those who have not (but really should!) read the book I believe it is a truly captivating story and brilliant film adaption .<br/><br/>Bella's torment and depression are captured in an excellent style and some of the shots and sequences really convey the deep feelings she is going through. Some may say the film drags a little, but these slower sections are intricate to the the plot and development of the story, which will become much, much more complex especially in the next two films.<br/><br/>Although there are a couple of surprise additions to the original story the film basically keeps to the same story with lines taken right out of the book and spoken perfectly. The chemistry between all the actors is clear and really drags you deeper into the story.<br/><br/>All in all the film is a must see especially for any vampire or twilight fans, but I'm sure it's not them that need convincing to go see the film. Give it a chance and seriously read the books. Although this is an amazing film nothing can compare to Stephanie Meyers enchanting novels."
"brownah18","8","9","19","21 November 2009"," Twilight Saga: New Moon Flop or Not, The Review is in!
","In somewhat of a frightening dream of being old with Edward, Bella (Kristen Stewart) wakes up and it's the day of her birthday. Joking about getting old, Edward (Robert Pattinson) says he is one hundred and nine and she is only eighteen. Jake comes to talk with Bella and gives her some sort of a dream catcher gift. Edward saying it's unfair that Jake gave him a gift and doesn't get to. Edward saying it's unfair that Jake gave her a gift and he doesn't get to. Edward's gift is to just have Bella in his life and to be with her.<br/><br/>This movie had a lot more action than the last movie and was more exciting to watch. This movie was serious, yet it had jokes to lighten the mood sometimes. The special effects were great and it was great to see the guys morph into wolves and just see how it looked on the big screen. Having no knowledge of the books the first movie wasn't really that good, but usually when doing more than one of a saga like this the first movie is the best, but not in this case. The relationships with Bella and Edward and her and Jake were very intriguing to watch. You felt bad for Bella who is just trying to figure out what she really wants in her life after starting it when she kept getting more and more close to Edward. Stewart, Pattinson, and Lautner are the main stars in this movie and they had a great performance along with the others as well, but theirs was overall more important. The Twilight movies can only get better and not looking to read the books anytime soon and get too much into the craze I will just be looking forward to the third movie coming out this next summer of 2010."
"rogersgh1234","8","9","19","20 November 2009"," Good film, better than the first, done just right.
","I enjoyed the film more than I expected I would. The acting is better for all of the main actors. Especially Kristen who does a near perfect job of getting the emotions just like in the book. You could see the strong feelings she had for both Edward and Jacob and the resulting conflict she felt about it. I think Robert did a better job in this movie than in the first movie, more like the Edward of the books. Don't mind a few negative reviews. If you loved the books, and liked the first film, I think you will like this one even better. If the films keep getting better, then I think the fourth (fourth and fifth?) films will be fantastic. And they really did a great job casting the Quileutes."
"sir-kennyalot","1","9","19","20 November 2009"," Can't believe it
","Alright, so I *was* a huge Twilight fan until I saw this movie. Having read all eight books I felt like this movie owed it to me to be stupendous; however, all I received was stupendous minus the endous, adding an extra 'id'. Which seems to be one of the driving forces behind most of the horrendous acting that took place before my eyes last night.<br/><br/>The dialogue was hands-down one of the cheesiest things I have had to endure since the Great Cheese Explosion of '98. I mean, it's hard enough for myself to suspend belief at the sight of sparkling vampires, but talk is cheap and there was too much of it to go around in New Moon.<br/><br/>In closing, I was very disappointed in how the movie turned out. Sitting in that theater last night..it still makes me furious. It felt like 130 minutes of losing the game."
"twilighter123","10","10","22","22 November 2009"," New Moon is awesome!
","Let me just start off by saying that The Twilight Saga is not meant for everyone to like. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. That being said, not many people enjoyed watching this movie, and the main reason for that was because they are not fans of the books. In addition to this, if you have not read the book, you will be confused of what is going on with the story. And many of the people who disliked it were mainly men, who think that the fact of a sparkling vampire is a complete abomination. So me, being one of the rare guys who enjoy the movies and the series, thinks that is an understatement. Vampires are completely fictional and therefore they will STAY fictional. I accept Stephanie Meyer's version of vampires, so that certainly eases up with the tension out there.<br/><br/>New Moon was much better than Twilight. It followed the book exactly the way it was supposed to, and the effects and the directing were SO much better. I loved every minute of it and I was entertained. I cannot wait for Eclipse."
"snapcrklepop45","10","10","22","21 November 2009"," Much better then twilight!
","Wow. This director finally hits home with new moon. The only thing really lacking was some of the emotional moments from the actors. It follows the book pretty well, better then twilight. If you like the book, you'll love the movie! I give them props on the birthday scene, it was so intense. I feel like Kristen did well during the depressed part, but when bella and edward met up again, she didn't pull her weight. Also, Taylor worked out very hard and brought it. Yeah Taylor! The beginning was particularly good. I wonder how they are going to top New Moon in Eclipse? The ending was really really really good, but I'll leave it to you! bravo!"
"gypsydarling8888","8","10","22","20 November 2009"," A very poor sequel to Twillight and disappointment to the book.
","I watched Twilight 10 times in the cinema. It was my favourite.. the cast was perfect and it was so well directed, edited and every scene pleased me that i didn't mind the special effects being amateur. The Soundtrack was awesome. The chemistry was awesome. dialogue was great. There was humour in every turn and overall it was my favorite movie last year.<br/><br/>New Moon was the complete opposite. The special effects were probably the ONLY thing that they did semi well. Everything else sucked. The screen writing sucked. None of the scenes flowed properly. You would have had to read the book in order to understand what happened in between the scenes. There was hardly anytime to show chemistry developing between Jacob and Bella. I hated it that the movie didn't show any scenes that helped show how Bella's dad got angry at her going way to set up his disapproval for the next movie when Bella decides to get married. And the Cullens - what has happened to them? Every Cullen was over acting every scene. Alice was too PERKY. Emmett was too playful. And the the bright eyes were really a mistake! It made it completely unbelievable that these vampires lived with everyday humans without being suspected as being anything more than humans. Come on! IN twillight you could see the yellow eyes but it was subtle and not glowing like in NEw Moon. Bella's friends were so weird too. Jessica sounded like she was from LA rather than Forks. There was nothing to explain why her friends turned sour on her.. in Twilight they were like her BFFs.<br/><br/>CHRIS WEITZ has killed this movie. Killed it. I was looking forward to this movie but in my opinion it was really poorly put together and Chris did not deserve to direct this movie after Catherine Hardwicke did such a stunning job in the first one. <br/><br/>I hope Summit reconsiders and brings back Catherine Hardwicke for Breaking Dawn. They REALLY screwed up by dumping Catherine.<br/><br/>****************** UPDAte to my comment *************** I watched this a second time and I believe the movie has grown on me and I've upped my rating to 6. When I first watched Twilight i had never read the book so it was the movie that I fell in love with first, not the book. For New Moon it was the reverse so I think I was very hard on the movie because I had already envisioned the book differently in my head.<br/><br/>Watching it a second time, I now see that Chris tried very hard to do a lot of what was done in the first movie. I'm now convinced that what spoils the movie is the SOUNDTRACK. The songs were all wrong for the scenes. Twilight had this raw teenage-grit Sun-dance feel to it. in New Moon they have made it into a ""pop"" teenage film with the wrong kind of music. The Wolf-chasing-Victoria scene was so good but the action was drowned by the melodramatic soundtrack that pervaded the whole movie.. <br/><br/>Maybe I should watch it a third time - it might improve on me!"

","I, personally, really like the movie... once you get past the TERRIBLE acting of Robert and Kristin. I cannot stand watching either of them act. They are two off the worst actors I have ever seen in my life, and Robert is very unattractive (I can't understand why girls are drooling over him). One of the reasons that New Moon was better than Twilight was that Edward was hardly in it (I am team Edward, but it's a relief that at least one of the movies will be semi-okay without Robert Pattinson). Taylor Lautner really made this movie great. He is one of the best actors in it, and of course is totally gorgeous. I have read all of the books at least 6 times, so I pretty much have them memorized, and I couldn't think of any important scene from the book that wasn't in the movie, unlike Twilight, and I liked the scenes that they added to the movie, like when Victoria attacked Harry Clearwater, causing his heart attack. Overall, much better than Twilight, and an actually okay script. Just ignore the bad acting. P.S. If you haven't read the books, you can't slam the series. The movies suck compared to the books."

","I give a 1, because I would not see any of the twilights. I am here putting this because of the Summary (title) of this review. I will not see this at all. It is sad when people start making wolves into werewolves when they are not. I seen the preview of this movie and it was a turn off just because of the wolves thing. A werewolf attack someone that person attacked turns into one them self if they survive the attack, but an attack from a wolf they die. They are not the same thing. Wolves are real, and werewolves are not.<br/><br/>Anyone that knows about werewolves and wolves know they are not the same. This is just to show how lame and stupid people really are. The movie with jack Nicholson as Wolf, was not even a werewolf movie. It was him turning into a wolf. So quit the stupid movies that you think you make anything up to get people to watch and make money off of it. I will not watch stupid movies.<br/><br/>As far as this being a chick flick. I say it is. I do not watch them, and I will not go sit and listen to teenage girls make their noises when seeing a movie or even pay for the movie to hear them in the background. It is annoying as it is with PG-13 horror with any teenager screaming in the background when it is not even scary. I do not see how there could even be fans of this. It is terrible even from the first preview of the first movie. They said the reason near dark never got a remake was because of this crap.<br/><br/>I would of seen that remake of Near Dark over this crap any day. At least Near Dark was better.<br/><br/>I do not recommend these movies and never will watch them even if I was drugged. I would kill myself first."
"Barloq","3","5","9","3 April 2010"," Twilight recycled, now with 90% more werewolves!
","First off, I'm a guy, so before you completely disregard this review let me say that I am trying my hardest to review this in a neutral manner. So, infuriating fan-girl hate aside, let's get this review going...<br/><br/>New Moon opens up with the most drawn out title sequence since Terminator. Coincidentally, this ridiculously slow moment sums up the movie pretty well (although it is infinitely fun to yell ""EW MOON!!"" as the letters show up). Anyway, New Moon quickly insults its audience with some truly terrible acting (Bella has only one facial expression, I swear to God) and plot, which culminates in Edward breaking up with Bella. The audience is then subjected to a criminal amount of teenage angst as Bella wallows in her sorrow until she *finally* starts to fall in love with Jacob. Hysterically, Jacob and Bella have more chemistry than Edward and Bella ever did.<br/><br/>Soon, it becomes pretty obvious that New Moon is a retread of the first Twilight. Bella falls in love with mysterious boy, she slowly realizes that he is a werewolf (and is amazed that he radiates heat from his body - which is better than sparkling in the sunlight I suppose), hangs out with him despite all the dangers and even comes home to meet the ""pack"".<br/><br/>This redundancy is finally abated about an hour and a half into the movie when Alice finally shows up and says that Edward's going to commit suicide because he thinks Bella is dead. ""Oh my god!"" you say, ""It's just like Romeo and Juliet!"" Bingo. However, she saves him just in time, and we get introduced to the Volturi (basically the vampire mafia?). Somehow, they fail to come across as sinister, until the end when they slaughter an entire tour group (including children!!!!) off screen.<br/><br/>Anyway, Edward and Bella return home, Jacob gets jealous and Edward asks Bella to marry him. Curtains. It's about this point that the viewer realizes that they just wasted 2 hours of their time.<br/><br/>New Moon commits some major cardinal sins which utterly destroy it. First off is the already-mentioned redundancy - while the romantic angle is actually better done in New Moon, it's hard to ignore the fact that it's a re-skinning of a movie I already saw (and didn't like either). Second (and worst of all), New Moon is literally 2 hours of set-up. Nothing happens. At least Twilight had a story - New Moon neuters itself by setting things up for Eclipse (which, in itself, is mostly set-up for Breaking Dawn). So you are quite literally sitting through 2 boring hours, waiting for something to happen, and then being baffled when nothing does.<br/><br/>So in summary, even if you can ignore the terrible acting and plot, New Moon is brought down by redundancy and the fact that it is nothing but set-up. It's nothing but a gratuitous soft-core porno flick for chicks.<br/><br/>Anyway if you don't care about my opinion on New Moon then fine, whatever, go watch the movie. See if I care."

","""New Moon"" continues where ""Twilight"" left off. More sparkly vampires, more Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) being awkward and shy. But now, we have werewolves, too, and Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner_ becomes the most muscular teenager you've ever seen.<br/><br/>My colleague Erin Hietpas saw the film and reported: Dakota's ""character really doesn't give her a chance to show her acting skills but I think she does a perfect job a being Jane."" Kristen Stewart, however, ""does some terrible acting in this film. I didn't know you could mumble all your lines with a blank expression and still be paid so highly."" <br/><br/>If you drink every time Bella bites her lip, ""You'll be drunk before it's half over. If you can get past the lack of chemistry and acting from the main characters it's a good movie."" Billy Burke ""stole every scene he was in with"" Stewart. ""Of course, she didn't put up much of a fight."" Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson ""are very bland on screen. You go there expecting the best meal you ever had and you end up getting white bread and water. And your bread is stale."" I went to the film opening night with a large group of people and have since seen it twice more. I agree with pretty much everything Erin said. I wouldn't say I went there ""expecting the best meal"", but otherwise this sounds about right.<br/><br/>Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film a respectable two and half stars out of four, praised Kristen Stewart's performance in the film and wrote that the movie has ""melodrama that, at times, is enough to induce diabetes"". As I write this, IMDb has the film sitting at a putrid 4.4 out of 10, one of the lowest scores I've ever seen for a new release, especially one so popular. Perhaps the target audience doesn't use the Internet? <br/><br/>For those who went based on the preview, or want to, be warned: the trailer is grossly misleading. Pretty much all the action and suspense were fit into the trailer, meaning the bulk of the boring parts are left for you to discover on your own. There's too much romance and sap, which the girls will probably love (I would have cut at least five minutes of the ""I love you"" crap put), but there's also great humor and good references for the guys dragged along to this. The fictional film ""Face Punch"" had me almost falling out of the seat laughing. Horror fans!!!! There's a semi-subtle reference to ""Dawn of the Dead"" and its critique of consumerism. Very odd. And even ""Pontypool"", one of the year's best new horror films, gets a small cameo (look closely).<br/><br/>The budget was obviously bigger than the first film, and I'm happy to say the budget was better used. I didn't particularly like the special effects with the wolves I mean, if ""Jurassic Park"" looked more real in 1993 and ""The Thing"" in 1982 looked amazing why does CGI always seem to be little more than a cartoon these days? That's a mystery I want solved.<br/><br/>Writer Melissa Rosenberg saves the day again, adding depth to the story that Meyer lacked in the book, and director Chris Weitz made a nice balance of the romance and action scenes. Listening to Weitz's commentary on the DVD reveals that he is a very talented and knowledgeable director, with an eye for (Dutch) angles. I would like to think it's not his fault this film was weak, but rather that he had little to work with.<br/><br/>In the end, though I hate to admit it, I liked it. Not saying it's a good film — it's not — but a good time. Mark this one up as a guilty pleasure."
"east-emerald","6","5","9","23 March 2010"," Twilight: New Moon - a tale of shirtless boys and mopey girls
","Early in ""New Moon"", Edward, having decided to leave Forks with the Cullen clan in tow, tells Bella ""Don't do anything reckless"". I wondered if he remembered who he was talking to. This is Bella Swan, Forks' resident lady of infinite sorrows who exudes teen angst from her pores. Of course she goes off the deep end. After a reasonable period of music video like moping, she realizes that she can have visions of Edward if she is in danger. Don't worry, this is based on a Twilight book, so the self destructive behavior stays in reasonably safe teen territory - motorcycle riding and cliff diving. The visions themselves are a bit awkward. Done in an Obi- Wan sort of way, Edward delivers wooden lines that might as well be ""Fasten your seat belt"" or ""Don't play with matches"". Relief is on the way though. Bella develops a deep bond with friend Jacob Black ( Taylor Lautner). This relationship is soon on the rocks too when it appears that Jacob has dropped Bella to join a homo-erotic, Native American, Abercrombie & Fitch gang ( now that is a mouthful). It turns out his secret is a bit more mundane, at least for Forks. He is from a long line of werewolves who protect humans from vampires. Events conspire to bring Edward and Bella back together and we are all set up for her having to choose between the two.<br/><br/>This has been written with tongue firmly in cheek mainly because I recognize that I am not exactly the target audience for these movies. I can appreciate them in some ways but ultimately find the Lifetime movie teen melodrama a bit heavy. I have not read the books, so I may be wishing in vain but I do have a list of things I would like to see more of in the future movies:<br/><br/>(1) Let the adults come out and play more often. The scenes set in Italy featuring the ""vampire council"" were really good. I can never get enough Michael Sheen (""The Queen"", ""Frost/Nixon"", ""Underworld"", ""Alice in Wonderland"") who literally chews up the scenery as Aro.<br/><br/>(2) More vampires and more vampire action! Dakota Fanning as bloodthirsty psychopath = good thing (Yes that's her all evil and red-eyed in the above trailer). Victoria becoming an actual threat would be nice. Oh, and the tourist ""buffet"" was a great touch.<br/><br/>(3) Let Kristen Stewart have some range. Reviews of ""Twilight"" often take shots at Kristen Stewarts acting. I don't know how much of that is based on her mumbling, deep sighs acting style in Twilight but she has done much better. I would suggest checking out ""Speak"" (2004), ""The Cake Eaters"" ( 2007) and ""Adventureland"" ( 2009). OK I might be fooling myself because there is a Bella Swan in all of her roles.<br/><br/>(4) Get rid of Bella's almost invisible friends from school or use them more. They appear to be starring in ""Degrassi Jr. High"" while Bella is in a big teen blockbuster. Hello, producers you have an Oscar nominee in the cast now - Anna Kendrick. Certainly she can be used a bit more than a couple of scenes where her main role is to roll her eyes and look at Bella like, ""how did I end up with this freak as my friend"".<br/><br/>""Twilight: Eclipse"" is out later this summer; so let's see if this story can mature a bit along with the characters."
"ZenaeFilmZ","2","5","9","9 December 2009"," The Book Was better .... The Film was Choppy....
","Just a quick thought look at the screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg. Her history of scripts are all TELEVISION SERIES! To me this makes sense why the script is so bland. It does feel like either a bad teenage television series and the dialog writing seems to be for soap operas. I would truly love to read these scripts. A lot of people feel that Stewart and Pattinson were the only bad actors and that everyone else was fine? I think you should see the movie again to see that nearly every character's acting were dry, stiff, staged and felt like you were watching a very bad soap opera. Could it be the Writing, Directing, Acting or a little bit of all three combined?<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was one of the many looking forward to seeing this Novel transcend to a film. I remember while I was reading the book saying to myself ""oh wow I can't wait until they show this on Film. I think they can cut out a lot of the redundant scenes in order to make a seamless 2hr film."" Well I was wrong. The Book was by far better than this film.<br/><br/>The half of the film was decent in order of taking scene by scene from the book but the film truly went down hill once Bella finds out that Jacob is a wolf.<br/><br/>From that point the acting went dry, the film was rushed and all of the great scenes in the novel especially the ones that I was truly looking forward to see in the film were GONE.<br/><br/>To the viewers that haven't read the book and just jumped into the film I can understand why they would truly hate this movie. It makes no sense and you can careless as to why certain things are happening.<br/><br/>The whole entire sequence about Edward trying to die in Italy was very weak. All it was was a rushed sequence just slapped in there because it was written in the book. The acting was dry and typical for ""Vampire Dialogue"" I remember hearing Dakota Fanning say how Bella is for dessert. Aside from the red contacts, the Volturi were staged, written very poorly.<br/><br/>I definitely would recommend reading the books and if you are a fan of the saga sure see the film, buy the Bluray, DVD, Ipod video etc... But other than that, don't waste your time on this film. There are by far better movies out there.<br/><br/>Just a general thought: Where is the world headed with the young Teenage viewers? What are people doing to these kids? Look at the CW for instance...."
"biscuits090","5","5","9","8 December 2009"," Lacks in spirit
","How I felt...<br/><br/>First off: I liked the first movie quite a bit, so I was expecting a continuation of that... however... <br/><br/>My overview of New Moon<br/><br/>Setting: Very minimal, set in Forks and Italy. <br/><br/>Plot: Guy is here, goes away, Bella is heartbroken, a painfully long time-laps scene, new boy, old boy, new boy, old boy, movie's over. <br/><br/>Character development: painfully absent.<br/><br/>The first movie did a good job of building the characters, but the second one (minus Jacob) built nothing onto these characters. <br/><br/>It was hard to feel sympathy for anyone.<br/><br/>It was slooooooooooooow!!! I really felt they could have included more from the book. The movie covered six months, maybe a year, and if felt that long! I was praying for some action, or a commercial, or SOMETHING to give me a break from what I was watching. <br/><br/>I hate to say it, but the acting was poor. Unless you are going for the eye candy, it is very disappointing to watch the three main characters. The rest of the cast put in a great effort. <br/><br/>I'm just wondering how much the main cast actually cares about this movie anymore. It really feels like they phoned their lines in. <br/><br/>If your standards are not high, or you are just obsessed with Twilight, then you will like this movie. If you care about cinema, you won't. If you are going so you can make out with your partner, props to you!"
"programmer04","6","5","9","7 December 2009"," Made-For-TV on the Big Screen
","I have never read the books, so my rating is strictly based on the movie series so far.<br/><br/>First, I have to say that this series is not very appealing to me, so far. To me, it looks like something Aaron Spelling has been working on, if he were still alive. Imagine if Spelling were alive and was in charge of the HBO series, ""True Blood,"" and that's what the ""Twilight"" series appears to be, on screen. <br/><br/>I love ""True Blood."" It is an excellent drama, but it does not hide the fact that there is horror associated with vampires and other mystical/mythical creatures. Also, the show takes into account certain common physical laws associated with vampires, such as: silver burns and sunlight kills - not: silver accessorizes and sunlight sparkles. Twilight vampires don't even have fangs, the one thing that has defined vampires for so many years.<br/><br/>Twilight is a series that takes two of the horror genre's greatest monsters, vampires and werewolves, and presents them in the form of young 'pretty' people with emotional and social issues. It is about one vampire and one werewolf that fight for the love and protection of one human girl who ultimately falls for the vampire (because, hey, he sparkles) which threatens a long standing treaty between the two clans.<br/><br/>I gave the series 6 of 10 stars because it is mildly entertaining and the story is somewhat intriguing, though familiar, and my daughters love it (they're 9 and 12 years old). I just don't like the idea of paying theater prices for something that looks and feels like it should be on T.V., competing with ""The Vampire Diaries."""
"mazlie3","2","5","9","3 December 2009"," K.Stewart really needs acting classes
","Maybe it's me, but I think that K. Stewart needs acting classes.<br/><br/>I'm sure after that, she'll be a good actress... than just moving up and down her eyes brows and bite her lips... it's like her trademark, no good. No magic love between Bella and Edward and I found Taylor Lautner and all other actors much much better than Kristen. Because her parents are in the business (her dad is a TV producer and her mom is a script supervisor) don't make her automatically a great actress. She's young and beautiful, maybe in 2-3 years I'll be impressed. I read all the books and I didn't find anything resemblance in that movie. I hope the next Twilight Saga movie will be better."

","As many had expected this Movie New Moon to be as interesting as the first movie ""Twilight"", it was a disappointment to the much awaited audiences and the twilight fans. The expectations were high among the viewers and vivid fans but, as usual the second sequel always has not been able to live up the moment. Initially the movie is slow and gradually the movie picks up.But after half an hour into the film, the movie tends to move in a slow pace.In a way, the movie is dragged around friendship and Jacob's attraction towards Bella. 2/3rd of the movie is focused on Jacob, instead the main character Edward. With the limited appearance of Edward, the on screen love magic between Bella & Edward dint set the viewers heart on fire. The end was in a bit of confusion, not knowing exactly the reason, why they were allowed to leave. And the confrontation of Edward and Jacob, seems like Bella is confused, whom to love as she is in love with both of them at the same time... Interesting Hmmmmmm.<br/><br/>well if there is a another sequel to his movie, then i would suggest the fans not to expect for another Twilight Magic again.Keep your fingers crossed Friends."

The only thing i agree on with my sisters is that the actors are terrible Kristin Stewart throughout the film keeps talking about death and cold things and then Edward and i just wished her character had died in the movie because that probably would have cheered her up and Edward is even worse because he is as spaced out as a drug addict and his eyes are always wide as if he is shocked and the baseball scene in Twilight was horrible a lot of CGI and crap actors."

I take the books and the movies for what they are... an extremely overly hyped series with little literary or cinematic value and frankly, that's exactly what we got.<br/><br/>That is not to say that I do not enjoy them however. I think the actors are doing the best job they can with such utterly ridiculous material. I like them because they are wonderful break from reality and seriousness. They make feel like a teenager again when the world was this overly dramatic and people thought love like that existed. Lets face it, the men are hot and a little part of every girl wants to be in a love triangle with the such forbidden fruit. So everyone calm down and just be entertained. This movie was far superior to Twilight and I actually thought the actors did a nice job portraying these intense caricatures on film. Just have fun with it."

"JoelJames12","4","9","20","29 November 2009"," Thoroughly enjoyably and undeservedly criticised
","Reading the negative comments this film received has shocked me. I am a fan of the books and the first movie and can understand that some people may not enjoy this kind of movie. However a lot of the slating that it has got is either prejudice from people who refuse to broaden their minds around the story and look at the actual film and those who are to ignorant to see the massive amount of talent and hard work which has gone into the film.<br/><br/>The film stayed true to the book as much as it could and did not lose track of the story line, which it could very easily have done. The characters were very believable, partly thanks to the script - but mainly due the talent which the actors to possess. Characters such as Edward and Bella are incredibly hard to pull off because they are so complex and unordinary. I have read comments by other users criticising the acting of Kristen Stuart. This i think is very un justified as Bella's character is so hard to portray. She is obsessed with one person and is virtually un-aware of anything else. She is also described as not showing her emotions. If i was acting a character like that i would also use very few expressions.<br/><br/>The special effects of the film were phenomenal, the wolfs were designed around the actors playing them, how much more care and attention can you give to a film.<br/><br/>The relationships between the characters were all totally believable and there was an obvious chemistry between all the actors - partly due to the directing as well as the natural talent.<br/><br/>The only down points of the film were parts of the script and the last half hour of the film. The script seemed a bit unreal in a few places. Edward for example being over 100 years old should have a much bigger contrast in the way he speaks compared to Bella, a girl aged 17. I was also surprised that Edward was so severely beaten up as he is able to read peoples minds and as described in the books, when fighting he is able to see his opponents next move and react to it<br/><br/>The last half hour was all of a sudden very rushed as soon as Alice arrived at the house, the peak of the film seemed to fly by too quickly. If they had added an extra 20 minuets onto the film they could have added the same care and detail into the last part than into the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Overall however i enjoyed it immensely and would recommend to anyone to watch."

","Seriously... The book=amazing, This movie depicted how I imagined it or even better. Reason why most of you guys went to watch it was because your girl friends dragged you into the theatre to watch it with them (I know I dragged my bf). If you've read the series it is the saddest book but one of the best because you find out more about the characters. This movie does not send the wrong message to girls.. It was written by a female author. If you love someone you can't just forget them in an instant. Most of these guys are writing such horrible comments on this movie and it's because ""YOU ARE NOT OPEN MINDED"" I'm not obsessive about this movie but I think this movie deserves more than the ratings it's been given.. If you don't like the storyline, it was written by Stephanie Meyer and it could happen to anyone (minus the vampire part) BUT the directing of this movie, the effects, the acting was way better than Twilight and I can see much improvement with Chris Weitz as the director and i'm proud to say ""I've seen NEW MOON"" Girls go see it.."
"p_platero09","10","9","20","22 November 2009"," New Moon was amazing regardless of your snide and insignificant comments
","OK, the director of Twilight, Katherine Hardwick, did the worst she could have done with Twilight. I have never seen a movie so poorly directed and written. New Moon, stayed true to the material, it felt as if what I read and saw in my mind came to life on the big screen. The movie went in accordance with the book and it was so similar to New Moon's originality. The acting was great, all the new actors blended in really well, with the exception of Dakota Fanning and Cameron Bright being a little to old to play the roles of Jane and Alec (that is a personal opinion). The wolf pack was amazing, the phasing was amazing, and of course their bodies were amazing! New Moon was worth seeing, it was visually compelling, and packed a punch.<br/><br/>When reading these books, I think that you should keep in mind that it is fiction, fiction ladies, and for anyone who thinks that us Twi-hards do not know this, think again. Get off of your high horses and try to see how imaginative life is. We know that vampires and werewolves are not real, but it is the allure of wanting what we can not have and wanting what is non-existent. I really like the idea of having love so pure and knowing deep in your heart that you have found the one that you know is yours forever. That is the draw of these novels for me, Stephenie Meyer's writing is so amazing, having the imagination to bring to life something so huge as Twilight, is beyond belief.<br/><br/>So to all you Edward/Bella/Jacob/Stephenie Meyer hating people, keep hating this, it just makes this look so much better and you even more pathetic. Learn to use your imagination and open your eyes. Life would be so much less depressing for you and you might actually learn to be a bit happier and less hateful."

"long_mandy","4","6","12","25 November 2009"," Lost the unique style
","OK, so I absolutely love the books and know that in general the film is never as good. Although Twilight left a lot to be desired it did have a wonderful unique style to it which New Moon is very sadly lacking. New Moon as a standalone product is a very saleable and mass marketable production. However, compared to Twilight and especially the book series it's a laughable attempt. There are so many bad comments here about this film and I really didn't want to be another person with a bad thing to say but I simply had to put in to words my disappointment. New Moon says cheesy blockbuster all over it. Twilight had a delightful individualism to it that allowed me to overlook its flawed and pale comparison to the book. Everything was changed in New Moon, and not for the better. The colour temperature of the shot was all bright and Hollywoody! Isn't a whole part of the reason they're in 'Falks' supposed to be that it's rainy and dull all the time! The hair and makeup was way overdone, twilight was subtle. Audiences aren't stupid, you don't need to hit us in the face with the difference between humans and vampires, we did manage to pick up the more subtle effects in Twilight. I nearly burst out laughing the first look I got of Jasper. Bella's character seemed to have changed; I liked the rambled and stuttering Bella from Twilight, it feels like Kristen Stewart was directed to annunciate more so that the 'stupid audience' could understand her better. The score was very 'every other blockbuster' too, again Twilight was must more original and interesting and didn't use such a formulaic musical construct. To sum this film up, the director and a composer took the book of New Moon and slammed it into a blockbuster movie template. Its intensely unoriginal and pretty much ignores the fact that is after all a sequel to Twilight. Bring back the grittier, lower budget, more interesting, individual, emotional style of the first film please, PLEASE, PLEASE. The one saving grave is that I thought Michael Sheen was excellent as Aro. He played the character just how I imagined and I look forward to seeing more of him in the future films. I can try to console myself at least that Eclipse was in production before New Moon was out so hopefully Twilight was used as its guideline and not New Moon."

(the other half on makeup) I used to be a fan of soft light, but this just makes me sick. It would be nice if we could at least add a little depth to the frame. The special effects were terrible. The motion blur effect used when people are running around seems to be a cheap way to conceal bad special effects. The only way I would ever watch this movie again would be if someone paid me and handed me a blind fold. But... Hell! What do I know? I've never commented on a movie before. But after watching that terrible conundrum I was motivated to create a IMDb account to help get the word out. Don't waste your money.

Granted the special effects especially concerning the werewolves were well done, and I think that Stewart's acting (though very limited) was at it's best during this period of the film. But this saga is about the unlikely love between a human and a vampire and the climax of the book is where Edward convinces Bella how much he loves her and that he only left her for her own good. What should have been the film climax was a damp squib. Pattinson and Stewart have absolutely no chemistry and neither of them can show emotion. Stewart bites her lip and shakes her head throughout this film which also really annoyed me in the first film. Lautner as Jacob worked well. I would really like to see the Bella and Edward characters played by actors who could do the parts justice. I also hated the Cullen's wardrobe, in the books there is a several references to how well the Cullens dress, please get a good wardrobe person for Breaking Dawn. Also Alice looked most of the time like she was wearing a badly fitting wig, and I really can't even comment on what was going on with Jasper's hair!"

Many have an opinion before even viewing the movie, and this bias is difficult to shake.<br/><br/>Compared to the first ""Twilight"" film, though, I would argue that ""New Moon"" is definitely an improvement. The dialogue flows much more smoothly, and has funny moments (Jessica's rant being one of my favorites), which lightens the tone of the film and balances it nicely with the darker elements. I felt Kristen Stewart's performance improved in this film as well (very possibly due to the direction), and I was pleasantly surprised with Taylor Lautner's portrayal of Jacob, which I was initially skeptical about. The special effects were done quite well, and Chris Weitz's artful direction was evident. It was beautifully shot. The scenes in Italy are lush and interesting to watch.<br/><br/>I do agree, however, with others who felt the film moved a bit slowly at times. Sometimes the pace felt off. I think this may due to the effort in sticking with the book. The director had to balance making a great movie with pleasing the fans of the book, and I'm not sure those two things always mesh. Most crucial scenes from the book were included in the movie, though I can certainly see how someone not familiar with the book (or didn't like the book) might be bored.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a film that primarily females will like (the male eye candy--in a nice reversal from the usual female sexual objects in films--does play a part of that). However, appealing to a female audience doesn't make it inherently bad, as some seem to think. I recommend anyone going to see this movie to try and keep an open mind, especially if you're not a fan. (We all know fans will love it no matter what.) Let go of any pre-conceived notions you may have about Twilight, and enjoy ""New Moon"" for what it is--a moody, sometimes humorous, sometimes suspenseful romance, and try and enjoy the ride."
"lancelong777","2","7","15","20 November 2009"," Boring
","First off, let me begin by saying I enjoyed the book of the same name. Next, let me say that this movie was an extremely poor film rendition. That being said, let me get into the true problem of the film - the two main actors! They were both extremely boring in their attempts at acting. I believe that both of them would do well to take an acting lesson. His acting method is to look brooding and hers is to grimace at all possible moments. It was like watching my son and my daughter fighting. I think that these two people have it hard though as they have a lot of hype to live up to. They do not, however, live up to this imaginary line drawn on the screen. Shark Boy was okay but what was up with the fake Indian hair? If he is Indian, I am a shark. One word summarizes this waste of time - boring, money back, no acting, little action, slow plot development, terrible acting, and did I mention it was also boring? Don't waste your time going to see this second rate film that was nowhere near as good as Twilight."
"raiderb","2","8","18","23 November 2009"," In my opinion
","While you're probably sick of hearing about The Twilight Saga: New Moon, it is crucial that you read this letter. Permit me this forum to rant. The Twilight Saga: New Moon has refused to make a public apology for its atrabilious doctrines. It follows from this that it thinks that advertising is the most veridical form of human communication. However, my efforts to exercise all of our basic rights to the maximum lead it to pray for my effacement as fervently as I pray for its. I have to laugh when The Twilight Saga: New Moon says that it can change its purblind ways. Where in the world did it get that idea? Not only does that idea contain absolutely no substance whatsoever, but you'd think that someone would have done something by now to thwart its plans to abridge our basic civil liberties. Unfortunately, most people are quite happy to ""go along to get along"" and are rather reluctant to fight for what is right. It is imperative that we inform such people that there's a chance that The Twilight Saga: New Moon will fix blame for social stress, economic loss, or loss of political power on a target group whose constructed guilt provides a simplistic explanation quicker than you can double-check the spelling of ""elecroencephalographic"". Well, that's extremely speculative but it is clear today that The Twilight Saga: New Moon maintains that people don't mind having their communities turned into war zones. Perhaps it would be best for it to awaken from its delusional, narcoleptic fantasyland and observe that it doesn't want us to know about its plans to remake the world to suit its own puerile needs. Otherwise, we might do something about that.<br/><br/>The really interesting thing about all this is not that few things in life are as enjoyable as watching newly enlightened people expose all of The Twilight Saga: New Moon's filthy, subversive, and destructive activities. The interesting thing is that given the amount of misinformation that it is circulating, I must point out that there are lots of weepy, wimpy flower children out there who are always whining that I'm being too harsh in my criticisms of The Twilight Saga: New Moon. I wish such people would wake up and realize that The Twilight Saga: New Moon wants us to think of it as a do-gooder. Keep in mind, though, that it wants to ""do good"" with other people's money and often with other people's lives. If The Twilight Saga: New Moon really wanted to be a do-gooder, it could start by admitting that I don't know what bothers me most about it. Is it its specious arguments, its illogical reasoning, its obscurantist claims, its unreasonable speculations, or any of the many forms of pseudoscholarship we see in its arguments? In any case, The Twilight Saga: New Moon maintains that it is a champion of liberty and individual expression. This is hardly the case. Rather, there is growing evidence that says, to the contrary, that if I wanted to brainwash and manipulate a large segment of the population, I would convince them that ""the norm"" shouldn't have to worry about how the exceptions feel. In fact, that's exactly what The Twilight Saga: New Moon does as part of its quest to create a beachhead for organized nihilism.<br/><br/>You don't have to say anything specifically about The Twilight Saga: New Moon for it to start attacking you. All you have to do is dare to imply that we should guide the world into an age of peace, justice, and solidarity. If one believes statements like, ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon is a spokesman for God,"" one is, in effect, supporting the most discourteous kooks you'll ever see. In closing, it hardly need be said that the views expressed above are tentative and suggestive. You should now go off and perform a thorough study of your own. Of course, this will be an exercise in futility unless you accept the fundamental premise of this letter, namely that while I cannot judge The Twilight Saga: New Moon's intentions, its actions really appear spleeny."
"wmontoli","10","8","18","22 November 2009"," New Moon
","This movie is beautiful the problem is that they tried to cover the book 99% but that's impossible for a movie that is 2 hrs long. Besides that i think that they didn't cover enough Jacob's and Bella's relationship which was intense. Another thing is that some parts i could not understand what was Edward/Robert Pattison saying? In the other hand I think that it seemed cheap they way they were acting the should have acted better specially knowing that the world was waiting for an excellent movie due to the successful books that 90% of the fans have read . I hope that Eclipse will be a better movie and that this was cause to the short time that was given to the movie."
"PWNYCNY","8","9","21","27 November 2009"," Worth watching.
","Despite some cheesy acting, this movie offers a novel portrayal of good and evil. If you like werewolves, then this movie is definitely for you. This may be the first movie which portrays the werewolf in a positive manner. The vampires are also treated in a sympathetic manner, another unique feature of this movie. The special effects are excellent and add to the story. Taylor Lautner is a new star. The dialog is at times amusing and the story keeps the audience engaged as the the struggle between the werewolves and vampires unfolds. Especially interesting is the movie's unique take on the concept of the vampire. Here the vampire is almost human and not the sinister apparition familiar to movie audiences. It's not Shakespeare but it is entertaining and worth watching."
"flamingoes_woot","10","9","21","21 November 2009"," New Moon
","First things first, Twilight is the twenty-first century Romeo and Juliet. It was wonderful. New Moon was one hundred and fifty gazillion times better. I enjoyed seeing the changes in the characters (actors really) themselves from Twilight to New Moon. First, of course, Edward. his hair and makeup are much improved (THANK GOD!!) Although, for the record, I am a Team Edward fan, because Edward is Bella's fate/destiny, they belong together, but Taylor=self explanatory, etc.... I am also a Team TAYLOR fan as well, Bella looked prettier too, really all of them. except Mike... too fat and tan in my opinion. Billy Burke's(Charlie Swann) performance was exceptional. I love him on screen, he is hilarious, I cannot wait to see him in Eclipse. As lame as it sounds, I gotta mention the introduction. Not even the opening scene, the part at the VERY beginning where it just says New Moon and then it goes away... epic. props to the director, Chris Weitz. Then the opening scene. this entire movie takes your breath away. Jacob and Bella... Taylor and Kristen played their parts beautifully, this is how all of us who read the books imagined it happening (Thank you Kristen and Taylor)...(okay, anal retentive note: the motorcycles were red and black to my knowledge, these had silver parts and looked less beat-up...anyhow). Next, the scene in the garage where Jake's friends come in, I thought, Oh damn... they should have been hotter, I don't know... however later, I'm not sure, somehow their wolf shape-shifting made them hot or something... because damn those guys are attractive (props to Alex Meraz(Paul, my PERSONAL FAVORITE, I LOVE YOU), Tyson Houseman(Quil Ateara), Kiowa Gordon(Embry Call), Jared, Sam(I am so sorry I don't know your names, and Emily, good job too) and of course, Jacob(TAYLOR LAUTNER, Fan for LIFE). This reminds me when Bella comes into the kitchen, and Charlie and Harry Clearwater are prepping their fishing gear, and he like totally knows the wolf thing... it looks like he swallows his tongue or something his facial expression is comical:). This brings me to Laurent(Edi Gathegi) and of course Victoria(Rachelle)... brilliant. and also the Volturi: (btw this scene was amazing!!!! I absolutely loved it. it was so thrilling and intense) (Dakota great job) as well as I think it's Marcus? maybe.. (those who read the books, the bored one in Breaking Dawn, I believe- someone should really get his lines up here, they were hilarious, and delivered so well) Favorite scenes (not already mentioned, and in no particular order) cliff jumping woods- break up scene (btw, i am definitely a hopeless romantic, i cry at everything, when people fall in love, break up, or die... so i was crying throughout the movie) Emily's house the Volturi scene of course confrontation with Alice and Jake birthday scene... on and on my last favorite scene to comment on (though probably my favorite overall) is the proposal. i actually forgot where it was(located at), (in the woods i feel like??? maybe??) but it was supposed to be in her room!! that's the way it was written, but i don't have a problem. It was wonderful in its own way, though it was not as written. I love it. (and i must give a special shout-out to Rob Pattinson) -(can we get a belly wax for eclipse? come on, now).<br/><br/>The entire movie, I was listening for the music. It seemed like every other scene from twilight had some teen pop sensation song in it. Much too overwhelming. The music chosen for new moon fits the mood of the movie beautifully, and adds to it. This is a soundtrack I am actually going to buy.<br/><br/>Last few comments I loved how the trailer highlighted all the amazing scenes from the book, but tied them together such that it made you think the movie was sorta twisted around... After watching the actual movie, the trailer seemed like it had been through a blender or something... It gave you nearly everything in the movie, but since it was mixed around, you didn't know how the movie went. I have read the books, and I knew how it would end up, but I always feel that a movie is so much its own story that you have to live in the movie when you are watching it, and compare it to the book later on. Anyways, this added a new level of excitement, intensity, and anticipation to the movie. <br/><br/>Which also leads into how i loved how EXCITING New Moon was. (there was some unofficial trailer on Youtube, maybe still is, with Taylor Lautner basically narrating and talking-up New Moon.. it is a must-see (see link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__4nk303LXY&feature=related) everything that Taylor says in this trailer is true, i seriously just realized this, i wasn't even thinking about it during the actual movie, how easy it is to get caught up in it!!! Also, one more thing to add, Bella: ""Did you know, you're sort of beautiful"" Jacob:""how hard did you hit your head?"" and something i said, when they were walking along the beach, ""OMG its such a crime that he has a shirt on!!"" from Jacob trailer: ""Jacob has changed in many ways. his physicality, he's a lot bigger, he's 30 pounds bigger""--> i could quote that entire trailer, WATCH IT!!!). <br/><br/>It(New Moon, and the trailer) was a thrill to watch. Finally, in Taylor's own words, ""New Moon is exciting. It's always pushing to the next level."" I enjoyed every single moment, I am counting down until it is released on DVD and the premiere of ECLIPSE, it was truly fabulous, amazing, and spectacular, and I would like send a great big thank you and ""you all are wonderfully awesome and amazing"" to the entire cast and crew behind New Moon, and to Stephenie Meyer, from the fans. THANK YOU."
"jmurphyg","10","9","21","21 November 2009"," Amazing movie
","This movie exceeded my every expectation by leaps and bounds. The cinematography was amazing, the acting was better, and the direction and script could not have been better utilized. I went in with the disappointment that Twilight was stuck in my head so maybe my expectations were lower, but I was literally blown away.<br/><br/>Of course there were cheesy parts, it's a romance!!! However, I was hard pressed to find a line that was completely cheesy in the movie that Stephenie Meyer had not used herself in the book. It sounds cheesier because it's not you reading it, but in all actuality the ""cheesy"" parts were what most of us loved about the books: the absolute and total commitment to one another. <br/><br/>This wasn't the best acted movie or best directed movie of all time, you can't expect that from them, but this was the best possible New Moon anyone could have made. Ugh...and that includes Catherine Hardwick. Do not let that woman near any of the movies!"
"brunetteroisinxox","10","10","24","23 November 2009"," This Film Is Amazing!!
","don't listen to anyone who slags it off. its a bit different from the book but its amazing! if your a fan it makes it better but whoever said it was gushy does not know what they are talking about! New Moon is not all violent and vampires killing people. its a romance story and its got emotion to it. so don't listen to anyone who hasn't read the book. this film is brilliant! It has everything you want in a romance/drama film, with a little bit of comedy added in. Taylor Lautner does an amazing job at Jacob! You really get the feel of how he feels and his body is fit!! Edward also isn't in the whole film but thats what the book is about, this film is really Jacobs movie, telling his story. But also it has a mix of what vampire life is like. =]"
"slegree-588-998711","10","10","24","21 November 2009"," Can't wait to see it
","I haven't seen the movie yet, but I put 10 stars because so many people have just given a 1 and I wanted to balance it out. From the reviews I've read, it seems that the only people who didn't like the movie are those who really aren't fans of the series, or those who liked the first movie. Let's face it, Twilight was TERRIBLE! Slow, awkward, and painful to watch. Those who say they want Catherine Hardwicke back- are you nuts? She made a dreadful movie. I'm looking forward to seeing this movie because it seems like they gave it the time they deserved, kept to the plot, and overall made it much more entertaining. My only complaint is that I wish someone else would play Edward, Rob Pattinson isn't exactly a great actor, not the Edward I picture. Now Jacob, he's perfectly cast, I look forward to seeing a lot of Taylor Lautner in this one."
"iheartmelbourne","10","30","92","18 November 2009"," Weitz doesn't compromise post-feminist romance
","Chris Weitz's adaptation of New Moon is faithful to Stephenie Meyer's text while drawing out important themes in The Twilight Saga.<br/><br/>He understands the series as it exists within the tradition of, not vampire mythology, romance or horror, but the more ambiguous female Gothic. His directing is empathetic - and sensitive to - the novel's subliminal and transgressive gender politics.<br/><br/>The cinematography is lush and the color schemes evocative. The film never feels truncated - or, conversely, too long.<br/><br/>The acting by the three leads is stellar - and, ironically, overshadows the rest of an elite cast. Kristen Stewart has evolved into a tenacious, courageous actor. She's utterly convincing as a clinically depressed teenager (Bella Swan). Robert Pattinson as the demoralized vampire (Edward Cullen) has perhaps the most challenging role, but he understands subtlety - and is exquisitely understated when required. No cipher is he. Pattinson gives Cullen a poetic and moral depth that might have eluded other actors. Like Cate Blanchett, he possesses a striking, unusual and mutable beauty so you never tire of him on screen. And Taylor Lautner is a real revelation - showing an expansive emotional range while being mindful of Jacob Black's physicality.<br/><br/>New Moon is a beautifully realized film."
"JayaJaya","2","5","10","29 March 2010"," Painfully bad, even for romantic people !!!
","OK, so to start with the explanation WHY I was so disappointed. First of all, I really liked Twilight, it was slow romantic movie with vampires and a little mystic. And I was looking forward to New moon. Thank God i didn't see this movie in the cinema. Cause I would want my money back. I convinced my boyfriend to watch this movie together, because it had werewolves, and I heard it's a little more action than in the first movie.<br/><br/>OK ... I was wrong, after first half and hour I apoligized to my boyfriend, cause it was so so bad. We laughed through all heartbreaking scene, and all that I can't live without you, cause that is crap. And that is all that this movie stands on. We watched to the end, if it was my decision to make, we would stop this movie after first 15 minutes. This is the first time for me to say: Do not watch this movie! It is painfully bad."
"meadesvision","4","5","10","23 November 2009"," Kristen is a bad choice for Bella. Because She is narrator and keeps the story going on.
","I really don't understand why I never be satisfied with the movie though I am really obsessed with the books. Kristine is a bad choice for the character of Bella. Because I never get any feeling from her face expression. She is like face-expressionless. What a lack for an actress in this character. Rob and Tyler are really good but their performance should be supported by the narrator, Bella. But, in spite of an effective narrator, we are introduced with a plain and senseless narrator who never expresses her thoughts, feeling through her eyes and face. She is just standing there without doing anything. It is somehow interesting but when I look at her daily photos, I can see the same facial expression as in film. There is no performing quality in her presence in the film. Because ""SHE IS A NARRATOR"". Can you tell me? Who can continue to listen a bad story teller? you are bored. It is the same in the movie. I am bored of her story telling. But I prefer to read the book. By this way,I am able to shoot the best movie in my mind."
"happy_rock_angel2000","3","5","10","21 November 2009"," New Moon - nice title, poor content
","New Moon follows closely the line of the books, so for those who read the books it's totally predictable. I think it was a lame movie made after a weak book with very little substance, which appeals mostly to girls who deep down dream at princes on white horses. Leaving aside the subject of the story, the film itself was very long, slow and boring. It is a very light movie and the leading actress is not very good at expressing feelings. It's like the director took the book and threw it on screen without filtering it through his mind, without putting his own personal touch. So if you are looking for the experience of a great or impressive movie, this is not the one."
"swangurl_06","10","10","25","20 November 2009"," Don't know why so many people are giving it a 1
","It's crazy to me the amount of people that are giving this movie poor reviews. Everything about it was better than the first installment from the acting to the make-up to the special effects. I know there are people who are saying that they think the lines are too cheesy and make it almost comical, and I'll admit there were a few parts that did, but those people need to remember that these movies are based off of the books. They did an excellent job in New Moon of trying to keep it accurate with the book. Yes, some of the lines in the book can get a little cheesy but it is a love story and a very very emotional book so they did their best portraying that in the movie. I've been looking forward to seeing this movie for months and I was not disappointed at all with it. I really think that anyone who even somewhat enjoyed the first movie, and majority of the people that read the books will not be disappointed despite what other reviews may say. It may not deserve a full 10 but i'm giving it that because it definitely deserves more than the low scores other people are giving it."
"Kayzerino","10","9","22","23 November 2009"," Beautiful, True to the Book...I liked it
","I couldn't believe how many bad reviews I've read over this site. The film was actually quite good, maybe a little slow, but still good. For one the acting was SO much better this film, I was surprised, happily surprised. From a technical point of view it was fantastic...the shots were seamless, and the slow-motion was fantastic (and I'm not a huge fan of slow mo shots) The writing was true to the book and they kept in all the major aspects to set up the next books. I think people have just been expecting the same feel as Twilight...it's a different director this time naturally the tone of the film will be different, it's just how it is. I thought Weitz portrayed the book well, he kept that semi-detached feeling about it...it was interesting. Also the wolves looked absolutely fantastic, I was surpirsed how well the CGI was. Overall the film is entertaining and true to the novel and I'm excited to see where they go with it.<br/><br/>PLUS who couldn't love the ending??"
"charlotte-williams-1","10","9","22","22 November 2009"," Entertaining and beautiful
","New moon the movie was miles and miles better than the book , i have read the books and thought new moon was the worst , the book had a good plot but was very slow and it dragged.<br/><br/>However , the movie was far more entertaining. Victoria was not in new moon the book but was mentioned by Laurent while telling Bella that she is after her.Im glad she was actually in the film because it left cliffhangers and will make everyone prepared for eclipse. Plus, by he facial expressions in the film you can tell how much revenge she wants. And the idea of Bella seeing Edward, not just hearing him like in the books was also a fantastic idea because it would seem very odd and cheesy if some random voice was talking to her. The chemistry between Edward and Bella was great, people forget their only teenagers because their love is very strong and serious. The chemistry between Jacob and Bella was also very good. I thought Kristen Stewart did a good job , particularly with the screaming whens shes in pain or having nightmares , it was very realistic. Robert Pattinson played his character very well, believing he is a monster yet extremely sweet and generous. The volturi scene with action fitted very well, because you get a sense how evil and protective of their kind they really are. Michael Sheen is a fantastic actor playing Aro who seems nice but is very deadly. Charlie played by Billy was also very good not over the top and still the same person we see in Twilight. This film has tons more action , suspense and Engima. People should not judge the film because the vampires sparkle in the sun and don't have fangs - that is stereotypical conventions for a vampire , everyone wants something different and unique don't they? Well this is what the Twilight saga is all about. The love and heartbreak in this film is touching,the main three played their parts very well and all deserve some respect after their performances."

She starts to like Jacob but shes so in love with Edward so the part where she tells Jacob she could never love him like Edward is sad. but overall New Moon is great.

"thatfroggirl","9","6","13","23 November 2009"," Much Better Than Expected... Get a grip people!!
","I finally went to see New Moon this past Saturday. I went early in the day in an effort to avoid the rush and hopefully get a decent seat. For MONTHS I had been eagerly awaiting this movie. I have read through each of Stephanie Meyer's books a couple times and simply love the beauty and fantasy of this story. This is my first gripe.<br/><br/>Before going to see this film I read through several of the reviews. What is wrong with everyone??? One review was complaining about the effect this movie might have on young girls. Fine. If you feel that way, then don't let them see it. It saddens me that in this day and age people are trying to take the magic and fantasy out of everything! This movie was a huge improvement from the first. A few editing issues but otherwise beautifully written and performed. The acting has improved tremendously from the first film. There was a lot more passion and excitement in this movie. I loved the wolves. They did a MUCH better job than I expected. I was concerned they weren't going to live up to Stephanie's description and I think they did a pretty good job.<br/><br/>As long as you go into this movie understanding it is FANTASY I think you will come out loving it. I am an avid vampire story lover and admit there are a few things in these stories that don't live up to what I've studied over the years but why should that even matter? Why take a way from the beauty of the story with issues like that? If every movie was based on actual fact what would we escape to? OK. I'm done whining, I was just really struck by how many negative reviews this movie received when it really wasn't bad at all. If people stop walking in prepared to analyze every little detail I think as a whole we'd all enjoy movies in general a heck of a lot more.<br/><br/>I didn't want this movie to end. THAT'S how much better it was than the first. They hit on all the major aspects of the book with only minor changes to make it better for the viewers. If you truly love NEW MOON the book and you can get past expecting perfection then I think you will enjoy this movie. It is geared of course for a younger audience so EXPECT there to be young girls gasping and giggling in the theater. Don't roll your eyes and scowl at them. Think back to when you were their ages.<br/><br/>Emit, plays his role to perfection. Jasper, much better character development from the first. People were complaining about cheesy lines but I think the lines written for him told about who he is. Edward, very good. A lot more emotion in this film and of course beautiful. Jacob, flawless. Alice's character was also expanded on much more. I love this actress. She is perfect for the role. Bella, better but I'm hoping she continues to develop this character further for the next film.<br/><br/>Overall a very enjoyable film. I will be seeing it again"

","Having suffered serious disappointment from the nearly unwatchable ""Twilight"" (which seemed to me to get only the casting and the soundtrack right,) I went to ""New Moon"" with low expectations. I was delightfully surprised at how well this entire movie worked. Even the screenplay (by the same screenwriter who had IMHO botched the ""Twilight"" dialogue by substituting lame one-liners for the clever repartee in the book,) was coherent and true to the characters and plot. This book was particularly challenging to bring to the screen because a large portion dealt with Bella's internal conflicts and emotions. These challenges were cleverly dealt with. The photography, editing and overall directing were superb. The special effects (even the ""sparkle"") were superior. And the acting was very good and believable. I strongly recommend going to see it without preconceptions. It is very enjoyable!"

I am a very big fan of the twilight series and i have read every single one of the books and this movie just blew Twilight the movie out of the water. When i watched this movie, i felt like i was watching one of my favorite books being brought to life. I can see why some people didn't like it. But then again there are so many more reasons to like it then dislike it. This movie did rush the book some, but what are they suppose to do? They want to please the fans of the book which means staying true to it as much as possible, which is what they did. The twilight movie was absolutely horrible i think there might have been maybe one or two scenes that actually happened in the book but other than that it was that HORRIBLE Katherine Hardwickes movie. and i didn't spend lots of money to watch her movie, i spent it to watch my favorite book. And i wasted my money on twilight, but my money was well spent on new moon. The movie rushes it, but the director has to in order to put it in the time limit. If he made it a lot longer, then everyone of you stupid whiners would be saying ""its too long, wah wah wah"". I would have liked to see more taylor in it, and have edward...ow....get his head chopped off. Lol. Just kidding. Im a Team jacob so what are you gonna expect?

"ddoncila","8","8","19","20 November 2009"," Followed the book, but not very well
","Seeing this movie without having read the book would be a bad idea. For a fan of the books, this movie is perfect as it covers pretty much everything in the book in one way or another. Some details have been tweaked like Bella getting on the motorcycle in Port Angeles, but not enough so as to ruin the essence of the movie.<br/><br/>From an artistic standpoint, the movie had beautiful settings and the effects were well done like the appearance of the werewolves and the hallucinations Bella had. The atmosphere of the movie was well done, dark and mysterious, aided hugely in this by the music chosen.<br/><br/>Overall however, the effect of trying to follow everything in the book, and still adding enough action to satisfy (like the fight in the Volturi tower) made the movie a little disjointed, moving from scene to scene very quickly. It was a bit slow moving, which was perfect for the book, but for a movie adaptation, should maybe have been a little more fast-paced.<br/><br/>As a fan of the books, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie, as it was true to the book and the actors did a fairly OK job of portraying the characters, however if you are simply going for the movie experience, you may be left wanting more.<br/><br/>8/10"

","so yea, i may be seventeen i may be a senior in high school and i also might not have a degree (or want a degree) with anything to do with acting or movies or stuff, but i am a twilight fan. first of all, you women attacking the movie are probably, what, like forty? thirty maybe? second of all appreciate the movie for what it is. a movie. BASED on the book, not the direct freaking replica. thirdly, compared to twilight, i loved this one SO much more than it. why? well because it IS better, and i HATEHATEHATE new moon - breaking dawn is my favorite. seriously though people. it's a movie. based off the book. everyone has their own ideas of the book ( because you have to IMAGINE with the book, whereas the movie is um. there? ) the books were amazing. but there's also such a thing called first person. the books were in Bella's point of view. BELLA's. we only ""see"" the books through her eyes, and not so much everyone else's. for a book to be adapted to a movie takes a lot. i myself compared twilight to the book the first three times i saw the movie in theaters (out of five). moms, i'm sure you can agree, the world today is superficial. so yea, when i say i'm so excited for the shirtless and half naked werewolves in new moon, i'm sure you can understand why. granted, i'm not shallow, but it IS eye candy. it's also one of the biggest hits ever. so while the movie might not be as good as the book, it still is GOOD. not perfect, but good. next time you go see this movie, watch it without comparing it to the first person narrative that is the books. i assure you it will be worth it. Furthermore, just because you don't like it doesn't mean others wont as well. i myself loved it. it was everything i expected and more, the only thing was that Bella didn't seem as heartbroken in the movie as she was in the book. sure, women don't need men and all that garbage, but that's true freaking love there. she LOVES him, so yea, that's bound to leave a mark. next time you think about slamming this movie look at it from the it's NOT THE BOOK standpoint. and have a heart, believe in love.<br/><br/>nine out of ten. think on that, LADIES. :)"
"zoesmith05","10","7","16","23 November 2009"," Amazing Production of an Amazing Story
","Firstly I would like to say that if you honestly believe vampires must have to burst into flames and turn into bats then you shouldn't watch a film which requires more emotional imagination than a five year old...<br/><br/>The film is part of a saga, it is therefore pointless to watch without having watched the first to have got in touch with the relationships at play. The film followed the book as well as any twilight fan could have asked, staying true to the story which is the whole reason the film is in such high demand anyway. Twilight fans will be amazed at how well Chris Weitz and the actors manage to capture the emotional, physical and supernatural aspects of the film and tie it altogether to be a perfectly rounded portrayal of Stephanie Meyers story.<br/><br/>To say a film is rubbish without considering how difficult it is to capture such vivid emotion that is supposed to be so consuming none of us can imagine the feeling, is ridiculous! There are more to movies than the special effects. The film was based upon a love story, remember? The acting was miles better than the first film, the chemistry was realistic, so much so that the heartache felt personal, the action was thrilling with pumped up fight scenes and the end was a perfect lead into the next film.<br/><br/>All in all, if you like the books then you will love the film, it is a perfect vision of what new moon is trying to create. If however, you like blood, guts and gore and are oblivious enough to think this is that type of vampire film it will definitely not be one of your favourites.<br/><br/>Brilliant."

","I can see why many people get mad. I myself have read the books and love them. This movie does a much better job the the first, since I actually left the cinema when i watched it. New moon is more true to the book tho it still lacks huge chunks. I still wanna cut it some slack because the effects and make up was way better this time around. So the conclusion must be that it will never be as the books but this is a step closer and I would not, like others, recommend anyone to save their money. When it comes down to it the acting is also remarkable better and the problem is just that Bella is so stiff, as in the first. She has to show emotions and actually act."
"shellykpavon","8","7","16","20 November 2009"," Satisfied My Thirst!
","Well after feeling very disappointed when leaving the Twilight premiere last year, the film eventually grew on me. The books were beyond fantastic, I don't give a hoot and holler if the movies are not Oscar worthy I just want to see the characters come to life.<br/><br/>New Moon I was so excited being an obsessive fan thats not 16, I was looking forward to the expanded budget and better effects. New moon delivered me exactly what I was looking for. Although Ashely Greene sucks at acting she did a much better job than twilight. Hopefully it just goes uphill again for Ecilipse. Yes there were some awkward moments with the acting just like Twilight. I think as a collective whole these actors make that chemistry. I would have loved a few things to be different more drama and romance but overall it hit the nail on the head for me.<br/><br/>Kristen and Robs Chemistry still hits the bullseye for me, they delivered similar chemistry from twilight with slight new twist. With Rob in and out of New Moon my only wish is they made Edwards absence a little more dramatic. Lets be real a teen book made into a teen geared film I think they take it there. For a teen romance it still gets my blood pumping and OoOo's and Ahhh's coming out of my mouth.<br/><br/>Jacob and Bella's Chemistry was right on for me it road the fine line of friendship and desperation for a new lover, developing the friendly feelings between them two. So what it wasn't perfect it blew twilight out of the water.<br/><br/>Taylor, Kristen, and Rob have set themselves up for a good tug of war for Eclipse. Emotions will be teeter tottering between the two handsome men.<br/><br/>It stayed very true to the series better depiction than most book to movie films. I was on an emotional roller-coaster all 130 minutes. With high to lows, laughs, and cries, it hit the mark for me. Drop the over analytical B.S. and just enjoy the unrealistic love story u fell for the first time :)"
"roedyg","7","3","5","11 December 2014"," On Getting Dumped Without Explanation
","Disclaimer. I am a 66 year old gay male, not the intended target for this movie. I probably reacted to it in a different way than the average viewer will.<br/><br/>Twilight The Saga: New Moon is a much darker movie than Twilight I.<br/><br/>For many people, myself included, being dumped by a lover who you madly adored, unexpectedly, without explanation is by far the worst event of your life. This happens to Bella Swan. Usually, a movie would gloss over this bleakness in a few seconds of clichés. But Twilight sits on it for almost the whole movie, and explores the pain with some imagination. It also explores not wanting ever to be involved again, and forever holding back. It explores the way you hold onto the flimsiest shred of hope your true love will eventually come back and the imaginary conversations. It even tackles suicide. It may be a downer, but everyone who has been through this will identify.<br/><br/>Often on-screen are a number of similar-looking, rain-soaked, muscular, shirtless young men who have the annoying habit of transforming into CGI wolves, followed by stock footage of CGI wolves fighting. These scenes could just as well have been realistic animations of suburban dogfights over unspayed females for all their originality.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner, who plays Jacob Black, has an astounding body with an eye-popping perfection that reminded be of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator I, though not as bulky. Lautner has a heart-meltingly handsome face. He is as lovable as a puppy, but he is too wooden. When he recites his lines in his urban nasal voice, I think of some awkward kid in a school play. It is like he does not believe what he is saying. He is just reading the lines. Further, his character is a bit like L'il Abner compared with the tortured complex Edward Cullen, so he is intrinsically not anywhere near as interesting. Joseph's shtick is being considerate, kind and gentle one minute and a rageoholic the next, like the Incredible Hulk, a cautionary tale for those who are attracted to the type.<br/><br/>Bella often gets herself in trouble, but not with the nail-biting relentlessness of the first movie. The adrenalin level of this movie is much lower. It is more about heart-sickness than danger.<br/><br/>The most amusing line in the movie, is from vampire, Alice Cullen, played by Ashley Green, about Bella ""I have never met anyone so prone to life-threatening idiocy"", as aside to the audience acknowledging the rather strained plot to keep Bella in predicaments.<br/><br/>Like the original movie, it drifts back and forth between reality, magic realism and dream deliberately confusing you.<br/><br/>The happy ending is so cruel. It will deceive so many into thinking if they but put their life on hold yet another decade, their heart's desire will be fulfilled.<br/><br/>The most irritating feature of the movie: Bella drove me nuts with her juvenile concern with her relationship with Edward lasting forever and selfishly ignoring nurturing her relationships today."
"joben-525-633946","5","3","5","16 November 2012"," Twi-fright?
","'Twilight' was a decent teenage love/drama with the essence of an action/thriller in the midst. 'New Moon' - under the helm of new director Chris Weitz - is a much more worded affair. <br/><br/>Perhaps I'm being too generous - I'm not usually - however, 'Twilight: New Moon' carries with it some interesting moments and scenes which intrigued me as the audience into the plot. The idea that Taylor Launter's Jacob Black could be edging his rival Robert Pattinson's Edward out of the equation as he attempts to rekindle a life long crush on Kristen Stewart's Bella Swan. It's like an episode of Coronation St. with numerous nifty tricks in the bag as the duration pans out!<br/><br/>The first third of the film is appallingly bad as it feels like all of the cringe worthy 'happy Edward-Bella family relationship' on a loop. It's rather dreary and feels like an extension of it's predecessor rather than a sequel bursting full of fresh ideas. Give the film time and you will at least have some positives to reminisce over afterwards. <br/><br/>The second third follows Stewart and Launter's blossoming relationship with former lover Pattinson out of the picture. This is the greatest section of the film as I feel compelled into this relationship more than the previous one and it's intriguing to view it unfold. <br/><br/>The climax is a little late coming in the fact that the previous two thirds of the film have been rather worded and bloated. The action is well choreographed for a rather low budgeted flick and it gives us hindsight of hopefully what is to come in the future 'Twilight' instalments. <br/><br/>It's not awful, but by no means is it great. An average sequel to the popular 'Twilight' adaption in 2008 but its a watchable affair."
"jasleen_kaur","10","9","23","20 November 2009"," Chris Weitz is a Genius ... better than the book
","This is what we wanted. The book on the screen - Mr Weitz did not do that, Oh no, - he did BETTER.<br/><br/>As part of The Twilight Saga Obsession, Twilight left me spitting at the screen for its lack of content, dodgy dialogue and embarrassing acting from Stewart.<br/><br/>Chris Weitz just made a book which was three-quarters depression into one-whole adventure. The Jacob-Paul fight makes you cringe, Laurent's swift movements take you into shock-mode and you will find that Michael Sheen delivers the Aro that is straight from the book.<br/><br/>The script was (suprisingly) excellent - with dialogue taken out of the book and extra lines that make you think 'if only they said that in the book'. Some lines were so good, they added to the mood created by the scene.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is almost 90% there, in becoming Bella Swan. Taylor Lautner isn't Taylor Lautner - he IS Jacob Black: completely flawless performance. I'm so glad they gave Jackson Rathborne more Dialogue - he practically said nothing in Twilight. The Vote scene was excellent in introducing the different elements to each of the Cullens' personalities. The humour wasn't too much, but perfect to keep you engaged. LOVED Charlie Bewley's acting - his entrance, composure and first lines were so well done, it made you feel Demetri should be a much more important character in this series.<br/><br/>I love that at the end of the Birthday scene, even though in the book ALL the Vampires become ravenous after they see Bella's wound, (to cut costs it was obvious they couldn't do that) they still showed some hostility in the other vampires, with Alice admitting she couldn't be in the same room and apologising for the rest of them as well as feeling guilty the birthday party she planned became such a disaster.<br/><br/>Alice's entrance (Bella's House) makes you jump. Also, her first entrance into the movie will stun you, with her enthusiasm and flexibility. She probably held the most memorable quote for me. <br/><br/>The revealing of the title 'New Moon' at the beginning, using the phases of a real Moon was an excellent idea, I hope they do something like that for Eclipse, but instead use the red ribbon symbol rather than an actual Eclipse.<br/><br/>The werewolf fighting was ghastly! It really made you think THIS IS NOT A GAME! STOP! <br/><br/>I was so pleased, they showed Edward's reaction on the other end of the phone, which obviously Bella can't see in the book. However, I am a little irritated why to back himself up, Jacob did not say at least 'It sounded like Carlisle'.<br/><br/>There's a cool, subtle special effect where Bella throws a piece of Pizza to Jacob but the scene shifts to Jacob catching a spanner instead of a Pizza - very clever.<br/><br/>The music reminded me of the epic orchestrated pieces from Harry Potter, but obviously much more subtle and worked well in emphasising underlying moods of scenes.<br/><br/>Victoria's sequences were excellent and almost breathtaking.<br/><br/>Sam's cliff dive was the work of excellent cinematography.<br/><br/>CGI and Special Effects were not too overdone and crafted to create perfection amongst the audience's reaction and breathtakingly dramatic on-screen.<br/><br/>I thought the idea of a cliffhanger ending (although not like that in the book) - even though it required some re-sequencing of scenes at the end, was effective for the sake of the movie and keeping people on their toes for The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.<br/><br/>Now for the bad things: There is a REALLY cheesy scene near to the end of the movie, when Aro reads Alice's mind, portraying Bella as a Vampire - it looked like it came out of a Barbie movie - typical slow motion running and out-of-place music that made it seem like a comedy stunt. Jane's entrance was too stomp-like, she is described as a 'mini Alice' the way she glides swiftly across the floor. Her 'Pain' was done too effortlessly, it looked like she was bored and couldn't be asked to show it off. Here smile was extremely freaky though.<br/><br/>What was with the underground lift? That was not mentioned in the book and was utterly stupid to have it in the middle of Volterra, which looked pretty renaissance-like and medieval. Surely, if the Volturi Estate is underground - THERE WOULD BE NO WINDOWS WITH LIGHT COMING THROUGH THEM. Where exactly do you explain the light is coming from? <br/><br/>Overall, camera shots were much more imaginative, which added to making each scene so successful in keeping us engaged and constantly commending them throughout. It was only 10 minutes into the movie and I already thought it was better than the book. The ""bad things"" are so minute and more personal aspects for probably just me that were dis-likable, that I see it fit to rule them out. Another reason I give this movie full marks is because it didn't need you to rely too much on having watched Twilight first as they show you the clips you need from Twilight in this movie (something Harry Potter fails to do - as well as failing to pick out fundamental scenes that are self-explanatory for the audience to remain engaged in the movie).<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga: New Moon deserves a few Baftas here and there, but Oscars are still way out of its reach: it's not grand enough, yet (let us wait for the sequels).<br/><br/>It is evident that Chris Weitz is a dedicated, faithful and intricate director. Sometimes wanting every minute detail to be perfect can prove to bring a film down, but New Moon needed it.<br/><br/>All I can say is, if Chris Weitz is signed on for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - I have not a single doubt in my bones it will be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>10 / 10"

I'm a 31 year old male, and I've read all four books. I enjoyed the first film a great deal. New Moon sticks to the book quite well, and is an interesting story. There is very little action, which is all fine and good, I don't think most people go into the movie with the expectation that this is an action-filled movie. The movie is pretty much all characterization, which is fine. I would recommend this film to anyone NOT looking to watch an action movie. All the actors are good. I am really looking forwards to Eclipse, and the battle of wills between Edward and Jacob."

","New Moon is one of the best teenage book adaptations I've ever seen! It had improved greatly from Twilight, which in my opinion, was not good for Twilight's image- so i'm sure New Moon will turn some haters. The directing was amazing, the acting was much better than in the first and the storyline created a truly unique film.<br/><br/>However I think most adults who hate fantasy/vampire films (or even the vampire lovers who can't get over the fact that Edward sparkles -something I actually enjoyed in this movie-) will probably give this movie low ratings. <br/><br/>Jacob haters will also be slightly disappointed by the lack of Edward in the movie. But being a Jacob fan I preferred it<br/><br/>This movie is like Lord of the Rings; Some people will think its the best film ever made and some people will hate it.<br/><br/>I personally think New Moon is one of the best! <br/><br/>Its defiantly worth seeing on a big screen rather than seeing it on a DVD as you'd miss out on the beautiful visual impact this movie has."

","WARNING: I am a fan of the Twilight Saga. Don't be a tool and hate just because I enjoy a book series.<br/><br/>Hearing the bad reviews about this movie, I was a bit hesitant and worried. However, my qualms were not necessary.<br/><br/>To start: Please people, don't complain about how this is OBVIOUSLY a chick flick... you should already know that going in to see this movie, unless you've been living under a rock.<br/><br/>So, being a chick myself, I found the film surprisingly enjoyable. The flow is steady, the cinematography is amazing, and the acting is flawless. The first movie had such bad direction and special effects that it really distracted from how hard the actors actually worked to make it as good as they possibly could. But you can really see all of their effort in this film, and it makes them look spectacular for being so young and yet so passionate about their work. I also applaud Chris Weitz: what a fantastic job he has done!<br/><br/>Now it's true, the transitions were a little quick. But nonetheless, you don't really have a choice, what with the book having so much detail. With that being said, Melissa (the screenwriter) really encompasses everything in the book perfectly. Even though some transitions were snappy, the steadiness was present.<br/><br/>I hope you've taken everything I've said into mind and go to see New Moon. This movie is NOTHING like the first, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/><ul><li>Haley</li></ul>"
"cynkittie","7","4","8","21 November 2009"," A Review of New Moon by A Person Who Doesn't Hate Twilight and Is not a Teenager
","(Coming from a place where I read all the books, saw the first movie, and I'm not a teenage girl.)<br/><br/>Light Romance and Light action mixed with Better than Narnia graphics,Teenage Romance, Angst, and Hunky actors make a decent movie experience, worth a matinée or student price. <br/><br/>I did not like the first Twilight. New Moon was better, a lot better. The effects are better, the dialogue is better, the romance is better, the action is better. I think there are a lot of people who will give this a bad review just thinking about it from the hype, but that's not really what you have to do with this movie. It's pretty much like a lot of movies made for teenagers--but you expect more out of it because it's supposed to be a serious vampire film, and it's not one of those. It's never going to be Interview with a Vampire or Underworld. <br/><br/>You go in expecting melodrama with a little action, cheesy teenage romance, and a lot of twitchy moves from Kristen Stewart--that's what this movie is. It's not worth 9.75 to me, so that's why I saw the matinée. I think it is worth it for the graphics and effects to see it on the big screen. <br/><br/>My wish for Eclipse is that they use less camera movement between characters in really long dialogue scenes and tone down the symphony. I really didn't like that part and it gave me a headache to be constantly going back and forth--the scenes are already dramatic, let's not make it worse with wooshy camera moves and q.q violins. <br/><br/>Taylor was easily the best character. Peter is as good as people are saying he is. Kristen did better this time, and Robert is Robert, I didn't really think the makeup team did him justice or Mike either for some reason--they all looked really bad compared to Taylor."
"GirishGowda","10","6","14","3 April 2010"," I loved this..!!
","While I don't think this deserves a 10, the harsh rating of 4.7 on IMDb leaves me no choice.<br/><br/>I saw this movie last December itself, but writing a review now. Everybody knew that this movie would not win any Oscar awards or anything. So, before trashing this film, you should also know that. This was made for the fans & it sticks to the story in the book for most of the time. Let me make one thing clear, I loved the first movie & bought all the books immediately last year. The books are also pretty great. I loved Kristen's performance as Bella in this. My dream girl is Kristen Stewart. So, you have to know that I won't give one negative comment about her, because honestly, her performances are really good.<br/><br/>Moving on, this is the story of the film. Bella Swan is worried that when she gets old, Edward Cullen, the vampire of her dreams will not love her anymore. In Bella's birthday party, there's an incident & Edward is noble enough to leave her from endangering her further. She always didn't understand why he liked her. She was insanely ordinary. So, though she knew there wasn't any reason for him to love her, when he leaves her she is depressed. Almost suicidal depressed. That is first love for you. Then Jacob, Charlie's friend's son becomes her ""own personal sun"" & he turns out to be a werewolf. And he also loves her. Doesn't any normal guy get to love Bella? (Mike Newton is a pushover anyway). She still loves Edward & thinks that if Edward won't come back, couldn't she be with Jacob & make him happy instead of everybody being sad? She tries & then Alice Cullen comes into the scene to tell her that Edward thought she was dead & went to the Volturi to get himself killed. Bella immediately goes to Italy to save him. She doesn't want him to get himself killed over regret. (Well, she doesn't want him dead, period). All these are shown in the trailer & the final battle.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen, the man who was nominated for Oscars last year, took this project around that time. Dakota Fanning, the actress everybody seems to love also plays a part in this. So, you have to know that this movie isn't terrible. The only terrible part was the werewolves taking their shirts off for no reason. The franchise should have stayed with Catherine Hardwicke, director of the first movie. She brought within the actors, a certain charm which was missing in some parts here. The new director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass, American Pie), brings nothing to the table. He simply follows the book without any heart. Guaranteed box office hit will sometimes do that to some people.<br/><br/>It seems true, pure, unadulterated love is not finding many takers among the reviewers who have judged this harshly. I would definitely hope that I would get someone who loves me even half as much as Bella loves Edward. Coming to performances, Kristen did a great job in portraying her hopeless yearning for Edward. Robert Pattinson wasn't even in 70% of the movie, but he gave a good performance. Charlie Swan (Billie Burke) is very good in his portrayal as Bella's dad. The relationship between him & Bella was better this time around. The enemy vampire, Victoria wasn't given much of a chance to act. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) gives an average performance. I was blown away by Michael Sheen's, Aro. He really shone in that part. Dakota Fanning is really wasted. I thought I was looking at a 25-30 year old woman, instead of a 16 year old girl. Also, the director should have shown the anguish in Edward after hearing about Bella's death, how he thought about a hundred ways to infuriate the Volturi clan. The scene where Alice comes back to the scene where Bella & Edward gloriously re-unite should have been dragged out, because it felt really rushed.<br/><br/>The film doesn't deserve most of the hate coming towards it. Seriously, I think the reason why people hate the actors of Twilight & anything related to it (I'm talking about people who gave this a below 5 rating) is because the actors found overnight success & they became top stars in Hollywood. Ideally, this film would have a 8/10 rating from me, but because of the extremely low rating on IMDb, I give 10/10.<br/><br/>-Girish, 20"

It does not give a bad message to teenagers whatsoever so do not be put off by this.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone, particularly women because lets face it, it is a complete chick flick and I do not expect men to understand our obsession with both the books and the films.

","I am just coming back from the cinema... What should I mention first?<br/><br/>Well, I think the first twilight is way better than this one. Because the studio changed directors, the whole ""twilight-feel"" that Catherine Hardwicke is gone... That is really a shame.<br/><br/>Second, there is a lot of cliché dialogue. People in the room where laughing at some points where it wasn't meant to... Of course the storyline remains strong, but i guess that is obvious.<br/><br/>But there is some good stuff too. The scenes between Bella and Jacob are for the biggest part very romantic and sometimes even a bit erotic. <br/><br/>There is also some neat CGI. The wolves looks realistic and there is good interacting with real life environment.<br/><br/>For the fans of twilight this is definitely a must-see.

"daberaz","5","5","11","28 March 2010"," ""Twilight"" was decent... ""New Moon"" is worse.
","OK, so, I've never read the books, but I have to say Twilight was a decent movie (6/10). The cinematography was beautiful, the cold blue filter gave it a cool ""feel"" and the most important thing - the music was great. The story was easy but nice to watch.<br/><br/>Here, most of the pluses of the first one are gone, and most of the minuses of the first one are... even bigger. But from the beginning.<br/><br/>The story is not bad, but the screenplay, I have to say, it's AWFUL. It makes you feel like Rosenberg wrote it in a few days or even better just to get the paycheck. The dialogues are mostly terribly awkward, the storyline skips to fast making the story unbelievable etc.<br/><br/>The acting now. Robert Pattison is NOT better. Maybe he wanted to be like that, maybe he was supposed to be just acting a cold guy with one face expression, that doesn't actually act at all, but seems to be tired of being on the plan, because he has some smiles (2 maybe?) that may suggest so, but that's to little. Kirsten Stewart, whom I thought was a good actress (after Into The Wild), and who I though played well in Twilight, here... it's not bad at all either. Surprise. I really liked her.<br/><br/>The music. No ""Super Massive Black Hole"" in the songs from the movie, no ""Bella's Lullaby"", dramatic drums and Burwell's talent on the Score. Much more forgettable, but the main theme (Meadow) might be better than lots of music composed in the cinema in recent years. Beautiful. If only there was more...<br/><br/>As the cinematography goes, no more cold blue filter here, but still some nice shots. The best scene, I though, was a scene with ""Hearing Daamge"" song in the forest, hunting for Victoria. Very nicely shot and edited, working with the music well. Only hope the whole movie was that way...."

This film doesn't compare to ones that have won awards and have gotten high-star ratings...but give it a rest. <br/><br/>Reasons why this film is not as terrible as critics say:<br/><br/>1.) :It follows the book almost perfectly: I have heard from some critics that the first film didn't follow the film so much, but New Moon followed it even with the littlest details...and yet people are critiquing that this was a negative thing. It isn't. We all come to see the movies so we can see how close it comes with the novel, and usually the film cuts out large parts of the book and somehow makes it work out, which we sometimes detest. But this was actually the few films that follow the book very well. <br/><br/>2.) :It has something about it that makes you think: After seeing this with my three close friends, it left me thinking. It shows a true love triangle like none other, and some scenes made me really dream off into a world full of Ever-so-stunning Edwards and juicy Jacobs. Some scenes really live in the moment (E.G: When Bella jumps from the cliff and is in the water, and the illusion of Edward is swimming beside her) It makes you wonder. I like films that stick to your mind, and you need something to scrape it out of your brain. <br/><br/>3.) :There are some good-looking actors and actresses: In Twilight, there were some scenes where Kristen Stewart just didn't glow. Sure, she's no vampire that sparkles in the sunlight, but she needed some ""umph"". She looks stunning in New Moon. I especially adored her when she was in Italy. You should've also heard the girls squeal in delight once Taylor Lautner showed up on the screen or he took his shirt off. 8-packs do exist after all... And, of course, Carlisle looked amazing<br/><br/>4.) :Little touches of humor in between gives the film a push forward: There are some lines in the film that just make me laugh every time I hear it, and no, they are not ""cheesy lines"" either. It would be best if you heard some of the lines yourself rather me giving some examples, but even the most serious moments had a lift with a little giggle.<br/><br/>5.) :There's talent. You just need to look twice: People always say that Kristen Stewart's acting is not at its best in these films, but I disagree with them. She actually outshined a lot of actors in this film, more than the first film, and it really made me get into the film more. There were some parts where she could've done better, but all in all, I was impressed. Don't underestimate these actors, because if you think about it more and more, they weren't just ""randomly picked"". They were chosen for these roles, and whether you think another actress or actor could've done better as the role of someone, just think twice. The film could've changed...and in my opinion, it would've changed in a negative way.<br/><br/>I could go on with this, but hopefully this was enough to make you think about this. Just because it's popular doesn't mean it should be looked down upon. Don't forget that there are girls (even guys) everywhere that adore the novels AND the films. Maybe you'll realize that this film is not as bad as they say...give it a chance.<br/><br/>I give it a 7.5/10"

","Holy crap, it really wasn't that bad! This book was my absolute favorite and I thought they did fine on the movie. I love Hardwicke so much better, but this movie still doesn't deserve a 4.5 out of 10. You people get so obsessed with making sure every detail from the book is in the movie- it can't work that way! Plus most people hate this book too, so of course you are going to hate the movie- and you can't just leave it out of the film series; it's too important! I thought it was funny, cute and entertaining. I hate chick flicks, but I enjoyed this! Yeah, the acting was horrible, but it did not detract too much from the movie. It's no academy award winner, but I would see it again and buy it. I know the movie was already 2+ hours, but I would've enjoyed more!"

","I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 stars simply because I love the saga, and am lovingly devoted to Team Edward. My only beef is that Kristen Stewart (while being very lovely and easy to watch) needs to study some film noir to find out what beautiful women do when kissed by sexy men. They basically tip their head back, allowing themselves to be vulnerable. Kristen seems to let the guy do all the work. Does she REALLY want to be a vampire??? Then, why protect the neck? Looks very awkward. But that being said, I WAS entertained! The cinematography was lovely! CG wolves were 95% believable. Loved to see how Taylor Lautner bulked up for his role. The whole audience broke out into applause when he removed his shirt! But, moments that were intended to provide tension in the audience really fell flat, and elicited laughter instead! Where was the chemistry this time? I think that Catherine Hardwick did a much better job as director. Maybe she took the premise more seriously. The music didn't grab me like it did in Twilight. I wouldn't download any of these tunes. And, I hate to say it, but while R Patz is VERY beautiful to behold (Really Rob. You are. We're not all smokin' crack out here) I just didn't believe his declaration of love or his need for Bella. Where was the joy of their reunion? If it was there, it was totally obliterated by the awkwardness of Kristen's tucked chin. Loosen up girl!"

","First, lets agree, Twilight deviated from the book too much. Unfortunately, while holding ""more"" to the book, New Moon does a poor job of telling the story.<br/><br/>Too much time and effort is spent on the effects of the werewolves, and those are out of date by at least 4 years.<br/><br/>Not to mention the fact, that an inserted fight scene CoMpLeTeLY destroys Edwards advantage in a fight, how does a person that can tell what move your going to make before you do, get defeated so easily, and why would a person that can ""see"" what will happen from a decision choose to wait to stop a fight from occurring? As a whole, this movie has no heart. Sure there are plenty of ""romantic"" scenes, but either through poor acting, poor scripting, or lack of setup, every scene leaves you feeling...nothing. I mean really, you have a special effects director, directing new actors, in a Romance movie, does anyone else smell disaster? May I point out that I have read the entire published series several times, love the books, but am now entirely turned off of the movies. I will probably see Eclipse, just to see if another director can do anything better, but it probably wont be on opening day. Who knows, maybe I'll stay home and read the books again."

","I have read through the comments and am a little surprised. First of all - the movie was fantastic. If you are one of those people who what the Oscars - the stay out of this movie because you obviously don't like entertaining movies. You like broke-back mountain. Whatever - that is your thing but why bother commenting on a movie if its not your thing. If you are more the type to watch the MTV movies awards (which is about movies people actually SEE) then you will like this movie. I saw the first movie before reading the books and Catherine Hardewick did NOT do the story justice and changed a bunch of stuff that didn't need to be changed. They cut out parts of the book that allow for story telling and explanation (like about the wolves) but other than that the move was entertaining and more in line with the books than the first one. This movie was better than the 1st.... But both were good and as entertaining as I could have hoped. I have seen ALL the Vampire movies that have come out and have been reading Vampire books since I was 12. NewsFlash - EVERY single story is different - details of the vampires are different. That is what make them INTERESTING - its no fun if they were all the SAME.... God - stop knocking the sparkles! Take it for what it is - entertainment! I think Eclipse will be GREAT but I don't think they need to fight the details of the book so much. That would be my one complaint for BOTH movies - is that they try to stray too much from the books which is NOT good - there is a reason that the books are popular. But with everything popular you will have haters that want to hate it just to be apart from everyone else because they think its cool to be different. But - again - whatever. The movie was great - all the haters will STILL probably get the DVD. LOL."

I bow down to Chris Weitz! New Moon will more than live up to the hype! I was very concerned of how he would portray certain aspects of the book into the movie and I was blown away! What I imagined to be difficult challenges merging the story with the screenplay, Chris Weitz executed with perfection. I am beyond thrilled with the final product and look forward to discussing it with others come Friday morning! Congratulations cast and crew, GREAT JOB!"
"grad0011","6","12","35","18 November 2009"," Good but not great by any means
","I will say first that New Moon is just about my favourite book in the Twilight series ( just before Twilight) and so I suppose expectations can be high while waiting 11 months!! The biggest issues I had with this movie were that Kristin Stewart looks right for the role but she sucks just as bad in this as she did in Twilight. I thought (was hoping really) that maybe she would have been better in this. She really is a terrible actress. She still just blinks uncontrollably etc or doesn't seem to know what to do in any serious scene, i.e. those 'dream scenes' after edward leaves & she's screaming away in bed looking silly rather that in any serious emotional pain. It's so bad sometimes you just have to look away! The other thing that I hadn't seen anyone else mention are the Cullens eyes...wtf happened? They were more subtle and perfectly fine in Twilight but they really f@#ked with them till they just looked weird. Considering they are described so often in the books as being beautiful and perfect creatures it looked very wrong. OK so good things? The wolves didn't look too bad at all! While reading New Moon i remember wondering how they would pull of the transformation & fight between Jacob and Paul but it did really work. Taylor Lautner was great as Jacob but he seemed to be the only good actor in this movie (sorry i lie, i like Bella's Dad too). It could have been better but if you do really like the books maybe you can forgive it's flaws!"
"FlashCallahan","5","2","3","6 December 2012"," Why take your shirt off when someone falls off a bike?.
","The Cullens, especially Alice, decide to throw Bella a party for her eighteenth birthday.<br/><br/>Things go wrong when Bella slices her finger and thirst overcomes Jasper.<br/><br/>The Cullens decide to leave. At first Bella exempts herself from all social activities, until she realises she can coexist with childhood friend, Jacob.<br/><br/>As usual for Bella, things aren't what they seem. Something is happening to Jacob that he can't explain to Bella, and their friendship starts to deteriorate.<br/><br/>But when someone from Bella's past comes back to haunt her, everything will change again....<br/><br/>It's swings and round-a-bouts with the second movie.<br/><br/>It's the one where Bella shows that she is playing around with both men, she flirts with Jacob, when she knows Edward can see, and puts herself in danger many times, despite him depressingly appearing every now and again saying no.<br/><br/>It's also the one where Lautner shows his charms, and after a while, it grates and almost ruins the whole film. Bella spends the majority of the film looking moribund and gloomy, and thats the film, until Sheen appears and blows everyone out of the water.<br/><br/>Along with Sheen, the film has some standout scenes, the Victoria scene, accompanied by the Thom Yorke track is haunting, and the scene where we see Victoria approach Bella in the ocean, is pretty unnerving.<br/><br/>And in my opinion, it has the most shocking part in any of the saga, when we see the tourists being led to their death. That sums up the dark side of the saga.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's the one where Bella and Edward get depressed, and Jacob gets a haircut."

I guess Edward left for his beloved's own good so I guess I respect him a little. Maybe I'll see more of him in ""Eclipse"" if I ever watch it.<br/><br/>The only memorable characters in this are Bella (well, since you never DON'T see her and she's to some degree a cute girl) and Aro (the long lost brother of the Shade from ""Eragon"" who has all of his smoothly evil charms and horrible acting all in one).<br/><br/>So overall 4 out of 10."
"joshkej-84077","5","1","1","11 February 2018"," It's bad, but not as bad as people make it out
","Okay this movie is bad. The whole franchise is bad. The only good thing about the Twilight Saga is the music and the unintentional laughs, in fact the only reason I watch these movies is because they're hilariously stupid. New Moon is commonly made out to be the worst of the franchise (alongside Breaking Dawn Part 1) but I actually found it to be better than most of the others.<br/><br/> For starters, it's got a dope soundtrack, probably the best in the franchise. The action sequences were also the best in the series too, especially the chase sequence featuring Victoria (I don't know why the rest of the movies couldn't make the vampire chase scenes as good as this one, instead of the awful green screen and CGI ones that they normally use) Speaking of CGI, the wolves were actually really well made, and were more realistic than the ones from the rest of the franchise. I was impressed overall by the general aesthetics of the film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie is still terrible. Kristen Stewart still has that constant sickly face and voice that sounds like it's on the verge of vomiting, Robert Pattinson is as boring as ever and Taylor Lautner is pathetic. The romance and chemistry between the main characters is almost non-existent, and the dialogue is some of the most cringeworthy and embarrassing I've ever heard. This movie is really slow too, and so much time is frustratingly wasted on put-on conversations between the ""characters"" and swooping helicopter shots of the woods.<br/><br/>Overall The Twilight Saga is bad, and New Moon is no exception, but I personally think it's one of the better instalments in the franchise."
"sjd615","5","1","1","22 June 2010"," This series needs to actors except for the character of Jacob
","If i hadn't already seen the first one and hadn't bought into all the Twilight hype because i am in college i would have really hated this movie. I can see why people live and breath from this series of movies but it really is not that good. The acting is sub par, the romance is comical, there was absolutely no action in the first two movie. The only thing cool and a little bit of the CGI used in this series. People like Robert Pattison better than Twilight and as a college guy i personally think Jacobs character in the movie is a better actor, is more enticing to viewers and is not annoying like Edward is. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen the first one and know nothing about this series honestly you probably wont like the series and will not like this movie as it is a very teenage type drama that is actually very boring in many parts of the movie. Also, it may be better watching it with a girl since she may be able to help guide you through the movie."

The first film started off with a promising start, but then this film just completely ruined it. <br/><br/>I went with a few mates to see this and i was really looking forward to it, but how wrong i was. This film was dull, boring, lifeless, annoying, spiritless and uninteresting. The story line was one of the only good parts of the film, but it was acted out horribly and according to my mates the cut out all the good parts of the book.<br/><br/>The love scenes between Edward and Bella were more cringe worthy than watching your grandparents getting it on. Kristen Stewart's acting was just terrible and so was Robert Patterson. But on the other hand Nikki Reed's played Rosalie very well, even though the interesting characters like Rosalie were hardly in it.<br/><br/>Overall, this vampire- flick lacks real bite (sorry for the cliché).

But glittering vampires in sunlight and now wolves instead of werewolves... ugh. I like the whole idea of adding to vampire and werewolf legends, but this. Better is vampires creating vampire gorillas and day-walking tribesmen in the story 'Wolferain and the vampires of Congo'. There's many serious new takes on vampires in it. And none glitter. Instead of a cloudy town, they have the rainforest. Instead of playing baseball, they attack wildlife for fun. Anyway. Good luck on sequel 2."
"malcolm_van_dam","6","13","40","19 November 2009"," Don't judge a book by its cover, nor a film by its poster
","Living in New Zealand can be very aggravating as most of the time we get to see films such as Die Hard 4 and 3:10 toy Yuma come out months after they have been released in the UK & USA, so you hear reviews for a film you haven't seen and admit it or not you go in with some level of bias. But once every so often a huge worldwide release will be showen here first due to time zone differences, my point is in seeing this opening day having heard no feedback on the film i was rather open (even though i hated the first).<br/><br/>Chris Weitz I feel has done a good job on this adaptation of the terrible book as the in the first film the relationship between Bella and Edward felt very forced and fake which I blame on Cathrine Hardwicke to some extent. But Chris Weitz has had success in the past with teen relationships with his ""American Pie"" so he was able to make the relationship not only between Bella and Edward a lot more believable and interesting but also between Bella and Jacob and Bella and Her Dad. It was things like these that I felt the first film was lacking.<br/><br/>As for cinematography, and i do realise that nobody goes to see ""The Twlight Saga"" for cinematography but the use of light and framing was fantastic in New Moon, this was my main problem with the first film. Light is a very important that vampires evade it but it was used terribly for twilight but in ""New Moon"" it felt like it had a purpose and did effect the look of scenery and the general mood of the film.<br/><br/>Now for the bad bits and there are quiet a few. The screenplay was terrible, it dragged out areas that were unnecessary to drag out such as the Vampire family bit in Italy where Michael Sheen is talking about powers to Kristen Stweart this went on for a good ten minutes but the time spent between Bella and Jacob was not enough time to suggest a possibility between the two having a chance at a relationship. Dialouge is also a big problem but that is unavoidable in this sort of situation, That lead me to think ""Why was Cathrine Hardwicke blamed for all the problems for the first film? because they are the same ones in New Moon"". The culprit Melissa Rosenberg the screenwriter, she isn't talented and there are lots of people out there that would be willing and could do a better job than she is doing.<br/><br/>Another thing was acting wise, ""New Moon"" is the sort of movie where it suits movie stars such as Rob Pattinson and Taylor Lautner who are good at what they do selling a film, but in ""New Moon"" they had Michael Sheen and Dakota fanning who are more actors rather than movie stars and it is obvious that they are more talented at acting as they blow everyone (bar Kristen Stweart) Off the screen which shouldn't happen as this is not their movie.<br/><br/>But overall if you go in open to the new direction of the franchise you won't mind the unnecessarily hopelessness or idiotic screenplay or horrible soundtrack."

It is very easy to commiserate with the plot (my friend cried several times and I had goosebumps all over my body during some scenes). The actors seem to be more at ease, more sympathized with their characters, and the new ones are just perfect, especially the Volturi! The special effects are simply amazing, what makes the action scenes very pleasant to watch. I also loved the humor.

","Firstly, I'd like to say, 4.2? Are you kidding me? What's wrong with people these days? *Twilight* got a better review than that! Why is it that the ""life-changing"" boring movies receive 8s and 9s and get nominated for Oscars, and the actual entertaining ones get 4s and wouldn't even see the Oscars? If you have seen it and don't like it, that's one thing, but if this is concerning the sudden hatred of the Twilight craze, could the people who haven't even seen New Moon and decide, ""let's all get together and try to get New Moon's rating to one star!"", please grow up?<br/><br/>There, I let my anger out. Now, to my review.<br/><br/>As a fan of the Twilight Saga, I was very excited to see New Moon at midnight, before America might I add (I'm from Australia). I hoped that it would be better than Twilight (I didn't exactly ""hate"" the first movie, I was merely disappointed). I knew that Chris Weitz was a much better director than Catherine Hardwicke (meaning better special effects etc) and Taylor Lautner would be featured a whole lot more than Robert Pattinson (obviously I'm Team Jacob). Plus, New Moon is my favourite book out of the four in the saga. And I definitely wasn't disappointed with this movie. For starters, Taylor was so much more enjoyable to watch, even dismissing the fact that I favour him over Robert and that he displayed is 8 pack for half of the film. All I'm going to say is that I'm SO GLAD they didn't replace him :) I'm also really thankful that they didn't cut out any significant parts. Obviously they couldn't include *every* detail, the movie would go for 4 hours or something. The special effects were amazing! The wolves actually looked like wolves and the fight scene in Volterra was incredible! Thank Mr Chris Weitz for that. The humour was a nice touch, but it wasn't overwhelming, which is a good thing for New Moon. These are just some of the reasons why New Moon was so great, and might I add a lot more impressive than Twilight, so impressive that I can't even decide if I like the book or the film better (trust me, the movie must be pretty good to do that). Please ignore the critics who give New Moon bad reviews, I trust that you will be pleasantly surprised with this film."

The movie was excellently directed by Chris Weitz and the actors did a great job. The movie fully lives up to the expectations of the book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It saddens me to see people say such nasty things about the acting in the movie and I would like to see them try to do it. It isn't easy trying to make a sequel especially with a new director and I think they did brilliantly. I love the Twilight Saga and can't wait for the third one to come out;Eclipse. If you don't like the movies or the books then don't ruin it for everyone else. Do us all a favour and leave us TwiFans in the cinema alone; we don't need you cynical people ruining it for us!"

","I actually loved this movie more than Twilight! I thought that the acting was better. Rob and Kristen just had a better feel this time and it felt much more relaxed. I thought that the cinematography was better. Although I loved the Twilight movie as well, it had a very ""Beachcomber"" (sp?) feel. I didn't like how Twilight looked like there was a blue lens filming it. It felt colder. I didn't love the Jacob part in the book and practically skimmed it the first time I read it because I figured that Edward had to come back at some point. I thought Taylor Lautner did a very convincing Jacob and felt that he added much to the story. Alice is also one of my favourite characters in the book. I missed her spikey hair from the first movie but Ashley definitely embodies the character of Alice. I felt that the eyes in this movie were much creepier and took away from their ""beauty"". I think that they should go back to the other contacts. I thought Chris Weitz did a great job. The CGI was great. It had very much the same feel as The,Golden Compass. I loved the movie so much that I can't wait to see it again!! I am surprised that the reviews aren't better to be honest. I am looking forward to see what the next director does with Eclipse. I am disappointed that Rachel is not back for Victoria. She is exactly how I pictured Victoria in the book. I hope that Chris does come back for the next instalment- Breaking Dawn. I also hope that the rest of the cast remains the same for the remainder of the ""Twilight Saga""."
"Squiban","8","6","15","26 November 2009"," I frankly loved it!
","I don't honestly get why this film has received SUCH a poor rating. Yes I am a massive fan of the books, a fan who was seriously eager for round 2 (New Moon) to come out to due to the awful cinematic trauma that was Twilight...I'm not deluded, it was BAD! In a nut I felt the first Twilight book was butchered by a director who frankly didn't know what the hec she was doing. <br/><br/>Then it seems fortunes turned, Chris Weitz took it on, and I just have to send him a massive THANK YOU! Thank you for turning something out that was as close to the book as you could have possibly made it. The Twilight saga is after all no literary masterpiece to make an award winner of, so I think its only fair to say that you did as best you could with what you had and what you made was excellent, in my opinion, so much so that I wouldn't mind paying another visit to the cinema to watch it all over again.<br/><br/>My only criticism, albeit a minor one, was that it was a little long and there was that slow motion wood scene that just could have been, well, less laughable! But even Kirsten Stewart, who I generally find wooden and slightly irritating, managed to pull back my previous opinions a touch and 'act' enough for it to become an enjoyable experience (keep up the good work). Hats off to Taylor Lautner, who was a fantastic and believable Jacob Black in every sense, not to mention great eye candy that I have to admit had me feeling slightly wrong... being nearly 30 myself. Rob Pattinson again played a marvellous Edward, tortured, intense and in love seems to suit him, but I look forward to seeing him in other roles - Little Ashes btw is brilliant if you haven't seen it. Another kudos would be the fx and fight scenes, bravo! I for one found my heart beating with the soundtrack at various key moments, and my hands gripping the arm rest with some intensity during the wolf fight and Eds final show down with Felix... very entertaining.<br/><br/>So to sum up New Moon... well quite simply it was a good film, especially if you know and love the books. Reasonably well acted, and well, satisfying. Don't knock it before you try it as they say! <br/><br/>I look forward to Eclipse, and the final instalment, I just hope that Chris Weitz carries it through to the end so that no one gets the opportunity to make a hash of the rest after such a positive turnaround.<br/><br/>Well done!"
"shootingstars-4","9","6","15","21 November 2009"," people are too serious
","I definitely was hesitant to see ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon,"" because I was terrified it would shift my view on the book, much like the first movie did. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the genuine believability of this film. The dialogue was actually humorous, which instantly made all of the characters more likable (and made a more difficult situation for Bella). I have seen many negative comments about Bella's reaction to Edward leaving her, most negative. Her whole curl-up and be a soulless automaton seems to be a ""bad message,"" for girls who are dealing with a break-up (and show's girls being powerless in general). This attitude of Bella's was actually spot on with her reaction in the novel. The heart ache she felt may be over the top, and unrealistic, but Kristen Stewart's portrayal of it was not. Taylor Lautner made for a good, friendly (sometimes overly so, and a little volatile), teenage, werewolf, while Robert Pattinson's iconic vampire went through a rejuvenation. He seemed to really understand the motives behind Edward's actions, which made his departure almost more heartbreaking than in the book because the audience could see the pain he was in. I was pleased to find that much of the dialogue in pivotal moments in the novel was almost identical, or little changed. ""New Moon,"" got the vibe of the book ten times better than did Twilight and was an enjoyable film to see."

"schmakeupartist","9","5","12","2 December 2009"," Bad acting???
","I disagree with everyone that knocked Kristen and Robert for their performance in this movie. Jacob was at times overacting, but other than that, I was impressed. Bella's character is awkward and I feel that Kristen pulled it off beautifully! You actually felt her discomfort and insecurity with every painful word she breathed. And let's not forget that Edward finds it hard to even breathe in her presence because of his BARELY controllable urge to eat her! It makes sense that he doesn't even look her in the eye and barely whispers when he speaks to her! DUH! I haven't even read the books and even I know that! I enjoyed it VERY much and if you didn't, you're just a negative grouch that didn't give it a chance. It's almost impossible for any of our expectations to be met EVERY time...and in all fairness, everyone knows that the books version will always be way better. :)"
"ebonywand","7","5","12","26 November 2009"," Oh, come ON, you guys...
","First of all, anyone who posted a comment saying that Catherine Hardwicke should have directed New Moon needs to watch Twilight again and/or see any interview of her. She had ZERO personality. Weitz did a MUCH BETTER job directing. We all know that Stewart and Pattinson definitely need to work on their acting skills, and it's thanks to Weitz that their acting was passable enough to satisfy most fans for this movie.<br/><br/>Also, you have to understand that this movie was made FOR THE FANS. Contrary to what some people may believe, the movie actually followed the book very well, even better than it's predecessor, Twilight. For those of you complaining that the Cullens didn't make enough of an appearance, to change that would be a significant deviation from the book. Also, fans are going to like the books better, period. Meyer is no Rowling, but you can't deny that her books have provided entertainment for MILLIONS of people. That's saying something.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm a fan of the books. I'm not completely sold on Bella's obsessive personality, but the books were entertaining. So far, the movies have done a far better job at following their book counterparts, unlike other films released this year (i.e. My Sister's Keeper - a complete deviation from Picoult's heart-wrenching story).<br/><br/>But back to the film. The transitions were significantly better than in Twilight, which was choppy. The acting (mostly on Stewart and Pattinson's parts) was still not the best, but it was undeniably improved. Also, the casting was excellent (aside from Bella and Edward). The Cullens very much fit the part, as did the Volturi and the Quileutes. The score was richer, and the soundtrack was also excellent. The ending also set up well for Eclipse.<br/><br/>All I have to say is that I enjoyed the film. Of course it wasn't the best film ever, but neither did I expect it to be. It was made for fans, who on the most part enjoyed it. Give credit where credit is due, and don't let your opinion of this cultural phenomenon be affected by lofty comparisons that are out of place."
"riggsthecat1000","8","5","12","26 November 2009"," Liked it better then ""Twilight!""
","I have read the book and this is very close to it. The graphics are awesome! When Jacob and the others ""turn"" it's amazing. Some comments have been made about Rob's acting, well, I think he did an incredible job (after all he was a depressed, vampire is he supposed to smile? giggle?) Geesh! They did make him more creepy in this one though, I was a little disappointed. When they kiss he looked like he was in pain, that was exactly how he was supposed to appear, because remember her blood is very hard for him to resist! As for the very first comment about the message to teenage girls, Movies are ""FANTASY"" they aren't supposed to be ""real""! Who on earth wants to watch a movie that is about everyday, real life! A movie is to be enjoyed! It'd be a pretty depressing movie to watch if it showed how life, for the most part, really is! and why pay to see something like that, when you will or have lived it!<br/><br/>All in all, I liked it! Everyone was great in it, the filming was awesome! and it was very close to the book, which is great! <br/><br/>For the males who comment on this and give it a bad rating, IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FOR BOYS! This is geared for females! That's why you don't like it."
"doramk","9","5","12","25 November 2009"," What is it with you Twilight anti-fan people?
","Did many of you who have come up with bad critics really have such a bad time watching New Moon? Let's see things clearly: Twilight Series is a TEEN ROMANCE, with certain aspects for adults to understand, if they think beyond the script lines. I have read all 4 books and watched the 1st movie. So I had specific expectations about New Moon. It probably isn't a film going for the Oscars. The ACTORS are beginners (this is their second or third movie),so let's not criticize them as if Tom Hanks was Edward and Meg Ryan was Bella! It is also based in a book series written by a fresh writer, who - as she claims in her blog - thinks of herself as a progressively developing writer. SO: I knew what is all about and I enjoyed the film, as much as I enjoyed the first one, knowing that I had been less fond of New Moon than of the other 3 books, like most of the readers. I think that Twilight books have been fascinating to many people around the world (women and girls but not only...) mostly because of EDWARD'S CHARACTER. He is certainly NOT Mr.Perfect and YES we know that and we love him for that! We also know that he can exist! Not as a vampire of course, but - if you see the allegory beyond the story - as a MAN WHO DOMINATES HIS INSTINCTS AND PASSIONS FOR THE SAKE OF HIS LOVED ONE: he wants to suck all of her blood and tear her body into pieces to satisfy his needs and yet he spends all his time caring for her, watching her sleeping, protecting her and RESPECTING HER and HER HUMAN LIFE! We also know the reason why Edward does all that: ""he is kind of a reluctant vampire"", he thinks he has lost his soul, he has been ""living"" in a hundred-year midnight, until Bella appears in his life and gives him a strong new perspective for it. What's more in this? People seem to have been fed up with so much sex and violence that they really enjoy a romantic relationship not going further than a kiss! It isn't gay or in-orgasmic or Mormon-oriented as it has been written, but perhaps it is just doing things in a different way! (the right way to many people).<br/><br/>I think EDWARD'S CHARACTER IS NOT FULLY REVEALED IN ANY OF THE TWO FILMS BECAUSE OF THE SCREENPLAY! Pattinson did very well in Twilight, but his acting in New Moon is a little subdued and somehow awkward, as the director and the producers apparently wanted to show more off Jacob. Rob has got more potential - if you can see the sparkle behind... As for Bella, she is a vulnerable character progressively growing on stronger. Most people would disagree with many things she does and wants for herself and some of her choices. But as the writer herself indicates,we're talking about TRUE LOVE here, not just a high-school romance. And maybe it is difficult for her to deal with the fact that she - an ordinary and clumsy girl- is being involved with an extraordinary person, not human at all. Kristen is good but she should show more passion acting as Edward's beloved. <br/><br/>As for the film adaptation, here are some things that I liked: Alexander Desplat's music, also Bella's emails to Alice as a form of narration, Bella sitting in front of her window as months go by without Edward, the break-up scene (with Edward closing his eyes with pain as he kisses her goodbye), the short Edward come-back-on-screen scene in Rio, the Volturi scene (Aro was good!), also the finale scene: the end being abrupt, yet promising for the 3rd sequel.<br/><br/>There are also things I didn't very much like, such as: Essential dialogs in the book between Bella and Edward, Bella and Jacob, Bella and Carlisle, were omitted in Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay. THE FILM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR EVERYBODY, NOT ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE READ THE BOOKS! So most people who hadn't read the books, could not understand the presence of the wolf pack, why they became their wolf phase and also their convention with the Cullens. They also could not figure out many things about Carlisle and Edward - what they believe about being vampires, about their soul and their purpose of existence, about why trying to be good ones. They also did miss many deeply emotional words between Bella and Edward (especially when Edward explains the truth about leaving her...). THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE IN THE BOOKS than ""You don't belong in my world"" and "" Your breathing is my gift"". (The ""You are my life now, Bella"" in Twilight was so thrilling...)<br/><br/>So, when people are writing a screenplay out of a book, just make sure they get all the best parts of the book on screen! As for the scene where Bella and Edward are running in the woods I felt it was a little awkward... What I didn't like mostly was that all male stars had to have their shirts off to show their abs, for the teenage girls to scream all the time! It was unnecessary! Last but not least, they rushed 200 pages of the book in the last 5 minutes (readers know what I mean)! Well, it looks that as Twilight overcame all expectations, Summit had to try for something bigger in the 2nd one! So the director and the screenplay writer were very much focused on this, that they sometimes missed the point of giving the actual idea of the book and the romance.<br/><br/>To be fair, I think most twi-fans will spend 2 happy hours watching the film, hopefully waiting for an even better 3rd sequel... As for the rest of you who are not fans... Just give the young bright actors of the romance a chance and let yourselves enjoy the atmosphere..."
"CeilingofStars","8","5","12","23 November 2009"," Not groundbreaking, but enjoyable and moving
","Movies are not created for the same audiences, motivations, or aims. This film was not intended to win any Oscars or to shatter somebody's world view. If you read the books, you'll understand that there's really no way it could without fundamentally changing their tone or message.<br/><br/>Still, it serves its purpose delightfully. The scenery and cinematography is rich and colorful. The score and soundtrack are beautiful, as they were in the last film, and I found myself remarking on the sound effects because of how pleasantly surprised I was (the wolves' growls in particular); they added immensely to the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>For those that claim that this movie was only unintentionally entertaining, I doubt that they fully comprehend its intent. There were some seriously hilarious moments, both played straight (""You're 100 years older than me. That's gross."") and tongue-in-cheek (""Ow, paper cut!"").<br/><br/>The acting was perfect for its purpose: not overly realistic, no, but dramatic enough to tell such an emotional and indulgent story. Would normal people behave like the girl Kristen Stewart portrayed? No, probably not. But *Bella* would (and did in the novels), and she's a perfect complement for both the melodramatic Edward and the brooding, lovestruck Jacob.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're looking for something that makes a poignant comment on the state of the world, you won't find it here. If you're looking for an indulgent popcorn feature to make you giggle, cry, and pine after cute boys, you will likely be very pleasantly surprised. There's a reason it had the third-highest opening gross of all time: it offers people a pleasant escape from reality that many of us could use these days."
"sparselykate","8","5","12","22 November 2009"," Follows the Book
","I think this was a very solid adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's second novel. While the first ten or so minutes did start off a bit clunky - the dialog was clichéd (as it often is in the book) and the delivery was strained and soap-opera-ish, the film soon found its groove and I focused less on the unbelievability of it all and more on just great old fashioned escapism. <br/><br/>Rob Pattinson plays Edward heartbreakingly good. I had tears in a few of his scenes and thought all he needed was a good cuddle :) Kristen Stewart is intense and suitably gloomy (but how I wish she would smile more and make us see what Edward and Jacob find so irresistible?!) I think much of my gripes about the movie goes back to the constraints of Stephanie's writing. We never do really learn anything much about Bella and the whole 'I only live for HIM' can be cringe worthy for anyone over the age of about 17. Having said all of that - I enjoyed this film very much.<br/><br/>Loved the werewolf story...I think Jacob and Sam and Paul etc stole the show really. Certainly they had some pretty cool scenes and I wanted to spend more time hanging out at Emily's house listening to those guys!<br/><br/>Chris Weitz has done a fabulous job, the colors and atmosphere and the pace was for me, perfectly done. I walked out of the cinema feeling like I'd left my own little world for two hours and just spent it far away in a place called Forks.<br/><br/>I'd see it again for sure."
"LottyDawson","7","5","12","22 November 2009"," Slightly Disappointing
","As a huge fan of the books and the first Twilight film I waited with baited breath for the release of New Moon, only to be slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy the film but I personally felt that it lacked on the emotions side. I have a tendency to cry at everything and when I didn’t cry when Edward (the lush Robert Pattinson) left Bella (teen sensation Kristen Stewart) I thought something was wrong. Being such an emotionally written book, I was slightly confused at why the emotional side of things didn’t come over in the film. Then I realised, it’s because it was a male director who had the say. Typically as far as guys and films go, it’s all action and no emotion, everything just black and white, there’s no grey.<br/><br/>The director of New Moon, Chris Weitz- Who is mostly known for his long list of producing projects, which includes all the American Pie films, did (true to his word) stay close to the book. Despite the fact that he was the director for two films I really enjoyed (About a Boy and Golden Compass) I really do feel that he didn’t do the film side of the twilight saga justice. Like I’ve said already, I’m not slating him for anything really; I just think that some decisions could have been made better by a woman. And no, I wouldn’t class myself as a feminist in any sense of the word (not say feminist are bad in any way). So this idea that I bare is not because I’m ‘doing it for the girls’. My reasoning is this;<br/><br/>I truly believe that Catherine Hardwicke (the director of the first of the twilight saga) should have been the director for the entire saga, after all consistency is the key. I mean god look at Mission Impossible (all six million of them) it’s practically the same thing in every movie. Okay maybe consistency to that extent is a little excessive, but you get my point. The first film: Twilight sets a bar. A bar that pushed my expectations and everyone else’s real high. I suppose that’s what happens when a film ticks all the boxes. The music was fantastic, the acting superb and directing brilliant. Slightly Disappointing In light of all this I came to the conclusion that, although I’ve excitedly awaited New Moon like the rest of you crazy Twilighters, I feel slightly disappointed. The music for instance, did not leave a lot to be desired, unlike the first film. I’m going to give the music another go, to make sure I’m not just dismissing it. The lack of emotion really bugged me, again in comparison, the first film took us on Bella’s journey, we as an audience lived and felt what she felt. Whereas New Moon feels as though we are just watching and standing on the side lines. The only part of the film that made my heart race was the intense fight scene in Italy, and again I as a watcher didn’t feel Bella’s pain, I just felt as though I was watching an action movie.<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant and I loved the new cast members (little Dakota Fanning!!), and the film over all looked great."
"RobertCane","5","5","12","21 November 2009"," I think it is the only maybe, sort of decent one, in the series.
","The effects at least with respect to the wolves are good enough and you can see how much the direction improved since the last film as it focus less on making the ambiance have a certain overall look and more on it having an emotional look parallel to the characters mood which is a little better given that this series sole purpose are feelings.<br/><br/>Another bad thing about this film is that they jump to the next scene really fast and they do not let you enjoy moments just like in the ending where they cut it in half a second and that didn't let me think about it well enough.<br/><br/>As a good thing i must say that the music is spot on in each scene and that the way they portrait Bella's depression was very close to what some people have described to me as depression, although it is a little bit of an awkward scene.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie did nothing for me and didn't really gave me any further interest. 5/10 An honest pros and cons review By Robert Cane"
"kitten_703","6","5","12","20 November 2009"," This is what I was afraid of...
","I held New Moon to the utmost standard. I had very high hopes for the film and I put my trust into all of the professionals who produced it. Maybe all of this is the reason why I left the midnight show feeling disappointed. I saw Twilight without having any idea what it was about or what kind of affect it would have on me. I simply fell in love! I read all of the books in a matter of weeks, as well as drove through a snowstorm to pick up the third installment, and could not wait until the second movie was produced. However, considering the fact that the entire production seemed rushed, I worried it would not be all that I had hoped for. My nightmare came true...<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I am a true fan and will always remain loyal to the Twilight series, whatever the faults. Any other fan of the series, who is willing to look past the character swoon-factor, is also going to leave the theater feeling empty, incomplete, disappointed, etc. For my complaints: New Moon had segments so awkward it was embarrassing. The audience laughed when it was not meant to be funny. Specifically, an incredibly corny scene depicting Bella as a vampire. As another example, when Edward kisses Bella outside her house on her birthday (*cringe*) many people around me perceived Pattinson's display of emotion as a sexual ejaculation.<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on Pattinson's costume design and make-up. What happened to the Edward I fell in love with from Twilight? The breathtakingly beautiful creature who lit up the screen? I know he is supposed to look inconsolable and gutted throughout New Moon but he's lost something that used to make him sparkle (and not in the literal sense).<br/><br/>The break-up scene: when I read the book I was crushed when Edward left Bella. I cried through the entire chapter and even some following. Watching the film, all of the emotions I felt from reading the book were summed up to a mere lump in the throat. I don't know if it was the acting or the writing that spoiled it but I truly believe the music, or lack-thereof, had a real effect. In fact, the music throughout the entire film felt unsuitable. Nothing like it was from Twilight which was a perfect fit and made you feel connected to the dialogue and character emotions. I was unable to connect with anything from the New Moon soundtrack.<br/><br/>Lastly, the relationship between Jacob and Bella. If I hadn't read the book, I would have wondered where their sudden relationship came from. Producers compressed their months of bonding and flirting in Jacob's garage into a ten-minute time lapsing segment. From Twilight, Jacob's feelings toward Bella are implied but in New Moon, there are very few elusions to a romantic relationship until the movie scene.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the CGI and how they animated the wolf phasing. I am glad that it was accurate to the book in that it is a true phase rather than a morphing process which can be depicted as creepy and unpleasant. I also enjoyed the wolf pack, few lines as they had. I was very excited that Michael Sheen from Underworld was casted as a leading member of the Volturi. I felt that he brought a higher standard of acting to the film and made a perfect Aro. It was also a little ironic that after playing a Lycan/werewolf that is now a vampirego figure.<br/><br/>Thank the Lord they let up on the blue/green contrast from Twilight. New Moon also includes reds and yellows which are easy on the eyes. Speaking of eyes, the contacts, both red and gold, were a little overdone in New Moon. I enjoyed the subtle differences between a human and a vampire that were depicted in Twilight.<br/><br/>While I can't change the fact that Edward begins to rub me the wrong way in New Moon, that is due to the source, Stephanie Meyer. Overall, I thought the pace was good and I enjoyed the acting in such an indulging story. However, I feel that Weitz and Co. had so much potential to make the story something to swoon over. Regretfully, the swooning was nothing more than skin deep as the characters and dialogue lacked depth and heart. I am apprehensive to even see Eclipse, but maybe now that my expectations have been lowered, Weitz will be given another chance to make me fall in love again."
"sam_aj_01","8","5","12","20 November 2009"," I enjoyed it
","As a 17 year old boy, I knew this would be the sort of thing girls would talk about for the rest of the school year but I had to see it for myself as a really enjoyed Twilight and in my school its kind of compulsory to like this...<br/><br/>After 2 and a half hours, I left feeling satsified with this film, if not more. Since I haven't read the book there were parts when I didn't know what the hell was going on, but I usually just guessed what happened really as most of the time its pretty obvious.<br/><br/>I've never been so annoyed with a character in all my life, I wanted to slap Kirsten at some points of the film! I was really annoyed they chucked in way too much of Bella's depression, it was really boring but I guess it really paid off in the long run. Robert Pattison was a slight outcast in the film with the main story set on Bella and Jacobs relationship. we see ourselves forcing to choose sides between the Vampires and the Werewolves! (Werewolves for me, I find the Vampires are way too stiff and spend a lot of the time pouting).<br/><br/>Aside from some obvious make-up used in the film this really beats some of the Harry Potter films by miles...<br/><br/>Oh & what a treat to see Dakota Fanning!"
"alexandra-kozlyaninova","10","16","54","19 November 2009"," One of the few brilliant book-adaptation movies. Cinematically stunning
","I saw the movie last night at the midnight premiere, to be fair I must say that I am a fan, but I went with my boyfriend, who is not a fan and my friend who is sick of all the hype around it and is not a fan as well.<br/><br/>We all really liked it, especially my bf and my friend, since they weren't into the all the hype of anticipation and weren't expecting much. I had a lot of expectations, and came out with mixed feelings. Yes the movie is cinematographically gorgeous, the colors are very warm, the style is very inviting, the scenery is simply stunning. What most impressed me was vampire makeup, huge step up from Twilight. They all looked other worldly and beautiful, people tend to forget that it's a fantasy story so vampires are not supposed to look like people. CGI was very impressive, wolves looked better than I imagined. Chris Weitz did an amazing job.<br/><br/>Now to the acting, Kristen Stewart definitely stole the show, I have huge respect for her after seeing the movie Speak, and for me she was a better Bella than the book version. The material she had to work with was very hard to deliver without sounding cheesy, and she nailed it. I'm definitely team Bella. Robert Pattinson, was a perfect Edward, I wasn't sure about him in the first movie, he looked a little awkward and out of place, and in New Moon he definitely grasped Edwards tortured soul and pain with perfection. He was the Edward I imagined when reading the book, quiet tortured loyal and obsessed with Bella. Taylor Lautner was definitely the star and even though I've seen the trailers, the first time he takes of his shirt it takes your breath away, but what impressed me the most was his acting style, he brought Jacob to live and managed to carry out incredibly hard role of trying to feel a hole of Edwards absence. Overall, a great adaptation from the book and beautifully done movie with few minor things I didn't like. Firstly the scene with Bella as a vampire looked like a scene from Bamby, it was very cheesy. Secondly some scene jumps were a bit rough for a very elegant flow of the movie, eg. how they get home from Voltera. Anyway definitely worth watching for fans and non fans, there is something for everyone and it steps away from the chick flick genre to a family movie."
"alicia-11","7","4","9","1 December 2009"," Good campy horror - no need to take it so seriously
","Let's all stop taking New Moon so seriously and try to remember we are watching a movie that falls squarely into the horror genre all about vampires and werewolves. I thought the movie captured the spirit of an old-school werewolf movie quite perfectly - from the soundtrack to the spooky deserted streets and night time wilderness shots. This is B-movie gold. It wouldn't hold up well at all if it were meant to be a straight drama or a romance, but it really isn't. Thank God Chris Weitz realized this and made a horror movie instead of trying to milk it as a romance the way Twilight was. I thought New Moon was much better! Much more fun to watch, much more humorous in all the ways a B-horror should be. Great over-the-top dialogue and perfectly acted for this genre! The movie scene with Bella, Jacob, and Mike was classic camp and perfectly done. Overall very atmospheric and spooky. My only complaint is the extreme overuse of the dreaded montage sequence. It's fine to use this once in a movie, but there were three or four used in New Moon which definitely had a negative impact on the pace of the movie overall. So, as a horror, I give it 7 out of 10."

Don't let the numbers fool you; this movie will make tremendous money and will be watched by millions, but numbers are numbers, right? From an invidual who's read the entire Twilight series, I must say that the overall storyline does correspond with the book, but my gosh, I could of never imagined more worse acting in my years of film watching. I was stunned by the lack of anything in cast, especially Kristen. It seemed as if they were performing a high school drama play instead of a multi-million dollar production with so called ""professional actors."""

I did not like the part where Edward is beaten so much...its not that much in the book, made him look like a wuss :-) I am team Edward..don't believe that team Jacob should exist because if you read the books he imprints..so he is not meant for Bella. And for people that say ""real vampires don't sparkle"" just re-read your sentence and remember that there is no REAL vampires, so you can make them however you want and Stephanie made hers like this...take it or leave it...write your on vamp story :-)"

","7 out of 10 for changes from the book that were unnecessary. Obviously the story does need to condensed, but outright changes are really annoying. A few cheesy moments that make you chuckle, but this is a story about teens. Forget the vampire trappings. The immortality bit is just the icing on the cake. Who doesn't want to live forever and look nice while doing it? The reason this story appeals is because so many people want to find a ""soulmate."" If you have ever fallen irrationally in love, then you get it. It is an old story wrapped up in a supernatural package. She sees him, she wants him, he appears aloof, he actually is madly interested, and they crash together like a couple of meteors. Wow. Who wouldn't find that kind of attraction exciting? Come on. As a middle-aged adult that got lucky enough to marry the guy she derangedly fell for at the age of 20, I find this story very appealing. It is romance - with teeth. It is not rocket science. Like for what it is - stop hating it for what it isn't."

It must be only because people waited for it for such a long time and had such high expectations. Laughing at the people who waited for a movie which is rated a 4.3 on IMDb....<br/><br/>So if everybody would stop giving this movie absurd low grades, we can all give serious comments.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is a great actress in this movie, and also Alice is amazing. Robert is as you want Edward to be when you have read the books and Taylor is too cute to be true. (I'm not sure if it's legal to fantasize about a 17-year old :-)) Go watch it and ENJOY!"

I absolutely loved it and will definitely go and see it again. Though i loved Twilight i am not shamed to say that New Moon was much better in most aspects. As always Rob Pattinson gives a great performance as Edward Cullen even though he does not appear very often in this film and takes a back stage to Jacob Black. Kirsten's performance as Bella Swan again hits the nail on the head I'm not sure how everyone else would imagine from the book how Bella would be performed but i think Kirstin was great.

","Hey, i went to see new moon last night here in Belgium there was the premiere, i have been waiting to see the book filmed for almost a year, and i loved the trailers....BUT....i liked the first scene , its almost exactly as in the book, but then...everything changes, the way they speak to each other, they really dist cut off a lot of scenes much to soon, to much information is missing, and what really bothered me to the bone, is that, may in Twilight the effects were not so good, but i loved the back ground music in twilight, it suited the book very well, but in new moon....please....they put that soap opera music tones on every time Bella and Edward talk it is SO not like twilight, i hated the music!! not all of it...but what happened to music like super massive black hole, or all the rest, that really represented twilight and the author's taste, no in new moon, they really dd a big mistake by putting romantic corny movie music....may for someone who didn't read the book, its very good, but for someone like me, who loves all the books....it really is a big disappointment...i'm sorry for all those who still need to see it but...see for yourselves and if anyone agrees, let me know because the rest of the group that went with me loved the movie but none of them read the books, so maybe that's why...i don't know and i really really hope and bag that they put some good music into eclipse..."

","i have no idea what movie you guys saw but you must be blind the movie followed the book almost to the t, except for changing minor details and filling plot holes that the book left such as how harry Clearwater had a heart attack. i though the movie was awesome the acting can seem kind of cheesy at some times but its some what like that in the books. and also its a movie, not a book, you cant follow everything word for word because of time issues and boredom, because new moon was the most boring book of the series. all in all i think that it was the best movie that I've seen that was based off of a book and i loved the harry potter books and the movies as well. so if you want to see this movie don't listen to all of the haters out there."

","I don't know why there's a group of people out there that saw this on opening night and are now complaining about the sappiness, cheesiness etc. Did you not know what you were getting into? Haven't you seen Twilight or at least heard about what type of story it is? The Twilight books were written for a specific demographic. If you don't fit into that demographic or don't like the stories that are written for that demographic then don't waste your time and money watching these movies and then complain about them as if you were tricked or something.<br/><br/>Having said that, if you really liked Twilight or the book New Moon, you'll love this movie. It follows the book very faithfully, and the acting and special effects are better this time around. I am one of those that don't really get into Twilight series, saw this with my wife who loves the books and at least have the sense to know that although I didn't enjoy this movie, it did what it intended to do very well and there was a lot of ecstatic and emotional women in the theater who obviously loved it and can't wait for the next one."

","I read the books, they were tolerable. I found most of it trite and patronizing but at least it kept me turning pages to find out what happened next. This movie I felt like standing up and walking out of the theatre so many times because the majority of it moves so slow you'd feel like you are on a train trip through the desert. You just keep seeing the same stupid stuff over and over. Seriously, this movie is boring. When the action does pick up the pace gets so fast that you don't know what the heck is going on and then dumps you right back into the doldrums of ""why the hell am I seeing this movie""ville.<br/><br/>Don't see it. The first one was okay. The books were okay. THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE."
"peeske_de_smale","10","13","44","20 November 2009"," Excellent !
","I went to the Belgian premiere last night in Hasselt and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>I went in with a bad feeling, because of all the negative reviews I had been reading online and in the newspapers. It seemed as if everybody had their heart set on giving NEW Moon a bad review. <br/><br/>Stubborn that I am, I had to go see for myself.... and I am glad I did. I have read all the books and saw Twilight a couple of times. <br/><br/>One of the main difference between Twilight and New Moon is the budget increase. The special effects and camera work were so much better in the latter. A lot more attention has been paid to smaller details, such as the eyes of the Cullens. <br/><br/>Another nice change was the acting... I know and understand that most of the main characters are played by young and relatively inexperienced actors. Kristen Stewart did an OK job in Twilight as the insecure and clumsy Bella, but she did not really convince me. The main thing that irritated me was that she wasn't even able to finish a single sentence. The Bella she showed us in New Moon was much more mature. She was able to fully get into character and show her emotions (without having to bite her lip every 5 seconds). I think she did an excellent job and carried most of the film. Taylor Lautner (Jacob) played his part rather well. Considering the changes he had to go through (physically) to get the part, you cannot say that he did not try his best. The chemistry between Bella and Jake was nicely portrayed and laced with humour. Robert Pattinson did not play a big part, but he played Edward as convincingly as in Twilight. Even Billy Burke, who played Bella's father got more into character. Although I imagined the Volturi a bit different, Michael Sheen played a perfect Aaro. People are talking about the lack of acting in New Moon, but in my honest opinion it is far better than what I saw in Twilight. I admit, nobody will be nominated for an academy award, but still.. The only really bad acting is saw were the other werewolves and Dakota Fanning, who played Jane. <br/><br/>I think most of us can agree that the soundtrack of Twilight was perfect for the movie. The soundtrack of New Moon wasn't as great as its predecessor, but the music suited the movie and that's all there is to it. <br/><br/>The transition between scenes and underlying stories has improved a lot. The change of director was a welcome one. It all just looked more professional and more serious. <br/><br/>Of course, as in all movies based on books, some parts and details have been left out or have been changed. It is only natural since you have to tell the entire story in less than 130min. Some of you might argue that the director should have focused more on other aspects of the book or that he should have left another part out completely, but if you ask me... he did a great job. You can honestly see and notice that a lot more effort, time and thought has been put in this instalment, and I hope to see this evolution in Eclipse as well. <br/><br/>Conclusion: If you are a fan and if you're able to ignore all the bad things you've heard, go have a look for yourself and you'll be glad you did. If you're expecting an action-packed Vampire-Werewolf clash, stay home and rent Underworld. I give it a 10!!"
"KidmanFan05","10","10","32","20 November 2009"," New Moon: A reminder that adaptations work
","Before reviewing the latest film in the Twilight saga, I will admit to being a die-hard fan - this was apparent by the 'Team Edward' t-shirt I wore to the midnight showing.<br/><br/>New Moon was my favourite of the Twilight books. When I first read it, I was called down to dinner just after the point when Edward leaves Bella in the woods. I literally could not eat my meal until I knew what happened. I remained locked in my bedroom for the next 3 hours, reading without a break. Though not a classic masterpiece, the book is captivating. Which is exactly what the film is.<br/><br/>When I saw Twilight, I was so desperate for it to be good that I closed my eyes to all the things that sucked about it. Even now I pretend that Kristen Stewart's acting was good or that you couldn't see Robert Pattinson's make up lines. The film differed from the book so much, and in places where it wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>New Moon, on the other hand, differed from the books in places where it would have been impossible to do otherwise. True, you never see Victoria in the novel. But what kind of movie would it have been if there was no excitement in the middle 90minute stretch?<br/><br/>The acting, unlike the first one, was superb (mostly) and I was drawn in from the moment it started to the moment the movie theatre kicked us out. Kristen convinced us, with heartbreaking realism, that there really was a hole in Bella's life when Edward was gone. Rob showed us the heartbreak Edward felt every time he saw Bella and knew he was 'bad for her'. And Taylor Lautner effectively showed us that Jacob Black is a selfish, prejudiced butt head, who just happens to look spectacular without his shirt on.<br/><br/>The special effects were convincing enough and, frankly, who really cares? If I wanted to see astounding special effects I would go see Avatar or District 9. The movie is about love: unrequited, unabashed, unruly, indestructible and any other type you can think of. The effects are almost irrelevant. <br/><br/>And as for pace: Are we really to the point where we can't sit through 5minutes of dialogue and scenery. When did we become incapable of being patient and letting characters grow?<br/><br/>I am usually cold and emotionless when watching a film. This was not the case when viewing New Moon. I could not control my grief when Bella was screaming in heartbreak or when Edward was desperate to die. And I almost let out an audible scream of delight when Edward and Bella were reunited. (and, I might add, a giggle when Jacob got rejected)<br/><br/>All in all, I thought The Twilight Saga: New Moon is a force to be reckoned with. Hopelessly romantic, heart-breakingly harrowing and excessively exciting, it's a film any true romantic or Twi-hard won't want to miss."

","i live in south wales in the united kingdom and I was lucky enough tonight to watch new moon at 12 O'Clock at night on the day of release, actually i have just gotten back from the cinemas. And to be honest..i loved the film! i found it much better than twilight. i admit that Chris's ways in directing was different compared to Catherine's but thats what made it more interesting. <br/><br/>It stayed completely faithful to the book, there isn't one thing in the book that the movie missed out, as a twilight fan i appreciate that! Catherine seemed to miss out on some of the things use ""twilighters"" loved the most in the book! <br/><br/>Jacob black is immense in this film, i loved him. there is just something about him that shined through this film and the audience fell in love. <br/><br/>personally i believe that this film is under-credited and people don't actually see how good it is because 50% of the people i know that is going to see it haven't read the books (big mistake) you cant fully appreciate these films without knowing what they are about!<br/><br/>Thumbs up to this film :) bring on eclipse!"

","Like some people I had my doubts about watching this movie, it wasn't very appealing to me the first time I heard of it. All I thought was, ""Oh it just another boring vampire movie"". But as soon as I saw it I was completely shocked. It was absolutely one of the best movies I had ever seen. Some people can't see beyond all the sci-fi stuff and think that it is bogus, but you have to read between the lines, and see what the movies real message is. Simply its about a girl who falls in love with a guy and they cannot be together, so since she is threatened by his brother they have to leave so they won't hurt her anymore, so she tries all these crazy dangerous things to try to get him back,and so on. Its easy, I loved it, and Id recommend it to anyone who can relate to the movie (not to the vampires). : )"

"gran_taire","8","6","17","20 November 2009"," Why the hate?
","Going into the cinema, I was eagerly anticipating the next chapter of twilight. I'm a big fan of Kristen, and let me say that you won't be disappointed. Let me start of with the cinematography. The scenery and just about every scene looks very clear, detailed and colourful. Remember the forest scene in twilight when like everything looked blue? Thats gone, and it looks much better in my opinion. The acting wasn't bad. We knew this wouldn't be an Oscar winning film, and the acting is much better than needed for any movie. The story can be boring at times, but the extra amount of fighting scenes make up for it. A lot of people hate this film, some maybe only because it's twilight and the label it has. But i honestly don't know why, even if you aren't a fan, i don't see why you wouldn't find this entertaining. yeah okay, i don't see why they needed to take their tops off half the time, thats obviously for the girls, and if you say 'vampires are supposed to die in the light!' well thats obviously a different version of a vampire. Thats almost like saying for Charmed 'Theyre witches! They have to have big noses!' etc.<br/><br/>so, watch it if your looking for some entertainment or are a fan of the series, you should immensely enjoy it."

","Having read many reviews which all predominantly use the words garbage and terrible i find it hard to read on. For one, those of you who said the special effects were dire - that is complete nonsense. Throughout the film i was in awe of all the effects. The wolves and water sequence is brilliant cinematography.<br/><br/>OK, the acting wasn't an Oscar winning performance but they weren't so unbelievably bad as most users are saying. We weren't so harsh to the Harry Potter cast on their first two films in the series and they were much more 'awkward' and 'uncomfortable'.<br/><br/>Having never read the books (i understand that the books are most probably a thousand times better but what book/film combo isn't?) i urge everyone to follow the hype and go and watch it. The story is brilliant and it leaves me looking forward to the next two films."
"lunacy_wishes","9","4","10","3 December 2009"," I'm very surprised it has such a low rating.
","I say that I am surprised, but when I think of the stigma that has been attached to the film and its concept, I think twice.<br/><br/>First of all, I want to comment on Kritsten Stewarts acting. Yes, in the books she has a bit more of a personality but to say her acting is 'wooden' is, in my opinion, all wrong. She is supposed to be like that and in fact the one thing most professional critics agree on is that Kristen Stewarts acting in this film is brilliant.<br/><br/>Sparkly vampires? Who would have thought of such a thing! Well, it's been thought of for many centuries, so lets put that lame condescending argument to rest. Oh, and as for the 'ghastly' messages it promotes, well, I think that those hypocrites should look at films that instead desensitize and not this movie that just promotes a fantastical love story. All I can say is, get over it.<br/><br/>I think that most people rating this film are obviously not its target audience. I have read all of the books and that is one of the reasons I think the films have been so successful; you always want to see the film version. In my opinion, the casting is quite good. Robert Pattinson especially, and although I am no acting expert I don't think he deserves the stick he gets.<br/><br/>All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I had low expectations because I thought, as many others still DO think, that the film wouldn't need to be to a high standard as it is a guaranteed blockbuster already. This is not true. There is depth to the film and if parts confuse you, I recommend you read the books. The soundtrack is beautiful, a personal highlight for me.<br/><br/>I recommend you see the film and don't go already having this idea of what it's going to be like in your head. Make your own assumptions, and think of it as a film, not something that teenagers are obsessed with and therefore will never be good."
"qmotto","6","4","10","3 December 2009"," No disappointment
","I went to see the movie after reading quite a few of reviews from IMDb. And actually, I ended up not that much disappointed - I mean, the music worked great with the image, effects not bad, Lautner not that stiff and I didn't have the feeling that it's lame. I mean, this movie is a separate category and shouldn't be judged along with like classic horrors - it's about teenage love between vampires, werewolves and people for crying out loud. When people go to see it and come out extremely disappointed because well, it's no Interwiev with the Vampire, it's kind of pointless. Summing up, not that bad, actually for me better than the first one and finally, it has to be like the best thing to see on pot :)"
"jenny-george-597-508840","8","4","10","1 December 2009"," what you all on about!!
","Having read these comments previous to seeing the film tonight I was fully prepared to leave the cinema feeling angry and cheated. Thankfully not. I had to hide my grin for the first ten minutes of the movie because I thought it was such a successful beginning - indulgent to twilight fans, certainly, but isn't that what we were after? I thought the acting, from all the cast, was dramatically improved from the first film (Though charlie's tan was laughable). Same for the special effects - the wolves looked incredible (as men and animals!). The movie was well paced and action sequences were tense and exciting.<br/><br/>Though, obviously, a lot was edited from the book it contained enough of the important bits to get a good flavour of the story and the relationships. I absolutely cannot wait for Eclipse to come out. New director after twilight was definitely a good move. Though New moon retained Twilight's sense of place and managed to keep this fantasy story well grounded in a realistic setting, it was cinematically far more impressive and more emotionally charged. Having said this, if you do not already love the books it probably wouldn't do much for you. In my opinion, for a novel-based movie, it was beautiful. I almost waited around for the next showing."
"switch601","6","4","10","29 November 2009"," The most important scenes failed.
","I remember reading the book and thinking, I am OK if every other scene is a complete screw up, if only they get the cliff diving and the reunion scene down correctly. And when I watched the movie, I almost ripped my hair out! Not out of spite for the director or anything, but out of sadness and loss that they missed the essence and emotion of these two most fundamental scenes! <br/><br/>First the cliff diving scene.This is supposed to be a climactic scene and it did not feel like one. In the book, Bella is growing more desperate for another hallucination and you as a reader are inevitably going through the same emotions. Its like she's a heroin addict thinking, I need a fix,I need a fix, I need a fix, until she can't possibly take it anymore. Then finally she reaches to that point where she is willing to sacrifice her safety, her security, her body, for that tiny taste of Edward... and she lets it all go and plunges..<br/><br/>the problem was that it had no flow or connection to the story. I feel no desperation, no build up. It simply feels like I'm watching a chronological order of her daily activities.I'm supposed to feel some sort of urgency in her motivation. Which i did not. <br/><br/>Also the cinematography of the scene did not do much justice. It would of been more effective to see some close up shots that dispelled Bella's emotions, and the illusion ultimately sucked. In the book, the illusion is supposed to vibrant, clear, much more emotionally impacting and different from all other hallucinations. and you feel like its worth jumping for. Watching the scene on screen just makes you think, Why the heck are you jumping off a cliff? If you want to see your illusion, just ride the motorcycle again! you know? Its like this scene was randomly thrown in there without and relevance to the story. And on the contrary, this scene is supposed to the ultimate representation of Bella's incompleteness and desperation.. <br/><br/>And as for the reunion scene. When Bella finally pushes him (or attempts to push) him behind closed doors, they instantly jump into the Why's and the How's. Edward tells her that he didn't do it out of guilt but out of love, blah blah. You might as well end the movie there! This makes the rest of the movie just feels blah. The build and emotional urgency ends, Sure the Volturi seem kind of threatening but I feel content and complacent and there's no tension really because Edward and Bella's relationship is mended. But in my opinion, that is what makes the Volturi scene so damn tense, is that Bella and Edward might die here while they still have unresolved issues!<br/><br/>As for the other scenes, they were great, the characters themselves, like Laurent, Victoria, the wolves LOOKED amazing. The aesthetics were just remarkable, the best i have ever scene. But I guess that's what they focused on, the picture, not the story. which is tragic. Jacobs voice just bugs the heck out of me."
"Rosjuice","8","4","10","25 November 2009"," Pretty Good.
","I swear I'm the only person that actually liked this movie.<br/><br/>I've read all the books multiple times and I know every single one of them inside out. I feel familiar with the characters and I understand them. This movie did not disappoint like Twilight did. Twilight felt like an adaptation where as New Moon felt like the book.<br/><br/>I agree with those that say the dialog was a little stiff. But, A LOT of it was verbatim from the book... not meant to be read out loud. I don't think it was so much the acting that didn't pull through, it was more the writing itself. I personally think that Rob and Kristen did a MUCH better job this time around. They seemed more intense, and Rob DEFINITELY got better at looking pained. Overall, the movie stayed VERY true to the book. The things that were cut should have been and the things that were added made it more interesting. The CGI was pretty darn good, the music was SPECTACULAR, and Oh my goodness, that 4-month sequence got to me.<br/><br/>So basically, if you really like New Moon the book, and you really like the characters and you want to see a very good visual version of the story, New Moon will certainly satisfy."
"kellilohr","6","4","10","24 November 2009"," Great graphics...overall good rendition..
","I thought the director did a good job of compressing the main meat of the story into a 2 hour flick...<br/><br/>One thing I have to say though about the actors. Kristen Stewart is very limited in her range of acting ability. The two main guys, Robert P. and Taylor L. did a MUCH better job of conveying emotion than she did! Hell, R.P. had tears in his eyes when they broke up in the beginning of the story...I was waiting for Kristen to show some heartfelt emotion...or at least act like she had some....waiting...waiting...blink blink blink...bite lip, breathe heavy...that's about all she did!!! lol No tears..no real anguish...just the same ""safe"" zone that is characteristic of her acting...facial tics, heavy breathing, lip biting, blinking excessively...Aigh...Lautner was much more genuine than her also! Oh well...I guess at least the rest of the actors did a good job. Kristen demonstrates what many other actors have said about the biz...the good roles SHOULD go to much better actors, but yet they end up going to mediocre actors sometimes merely for ratings. lol Otherwise, it was a decent film..the gratuitous kissing scenes made me roll my eyes, but gotta put that in for ratings I guess. I'm too old for the mushy, teenage angst stuff, but I get it. lol The fight scenes with the wolves were cool!! :-D"
"Gibraltariana","8","4","10","25 November 2009"," Review From a Someone Who Grudgingly Calls Herself A Twi Mom
","For the most part, I found Twilight:New Moon enjoyable. While I thought Kristen Stewart was pretty much phoning in her performance in Twilight, I guess she figured out that this was a REAL movie for her resume and actually acted this time - something she can do well and she does. Robert Pattinson is hardly in it, but I found him enjoyable during his scenes. Is the guy Sir Laurence Olivier? No, but he is a good actor with potential to get better. As far as Taylor Lautner, he was okay, but I do agree with the person who said his acting was a bit like a soap opera actor's. Overdone. It didn't effect my view of the character, since from the books I found the character of Jacob to be over the top and a bit much, but it did get a bit annoying in scenes.<br/><br/>The special effects were good, especially the fight scene in the Chamber at Volterra. Also, the make-up is better this time around. At times in Twilight, the make-up was pretty distracting. This time the makeup did not distract from the emotional scenes. When Edward looked devastated by Bella's ""death"", I could actually focus on it without thinking to myself he would make a good drag queen.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film. It won't change your life, but as someone who was a fan of the books this was a good movie adaptation. However, the best commendation could be given by my husband. As a man who snored his way through Twilight, I can say this - HE STAYED AWAKE AND ENJOYED IT! And there ya go!"
"pipersmommy","6","4","10","23 November 2009"," Good visual adaptation of the book.
","After seeing Twillight, I purchased and read the series. New Moon jumps right into the book, and to me felt rushed slightly in the beginning at times and drawn out at others. I felt the transitions could be stronger and that movie failed to examine Bella and Jacobs relationship in depth. Other scenes could have been shortened or omitted to allow for their relationship to blossom. I felt the search for the meadow should have been similar to the book, or at least hinted that it was something Jacob and Bella did together. I will give props that it was dynamic how they depicted Harry's heart attack. That seemed to flow better visually but the ending felt rushed to get to Edward. It seemed over edited at the end for time reasons. I read a lot of overly harsh comments, even one saying it was a bad example for girls. Some, not all, of the negative reviews are a attack on the series and the ideas not a review really for what it is. Was it over-hyped, probably. Are Twillight fans obsessed? Well, yeah. However there are a lot worse examples and messages for young ladies then a girl who falls for a boy, experiences heartbreak, finds relief, and is abstinent until marriage. Read the books, it is about discovery as much as a relationship. There are always various messages underneath a literary work and different opinions. Form your own opinion, and appreciate New Moon the MOVIE for what it is an adaptation!"
"jamnsmit-540-250491","5","4","10","22 November 2009"," New Moon is a Step in the Right Direction
","Almost a year to the day after Twilight hit theaters, it's sequel New Moon has teens--well women in general--flocking to the theater.<br/><br/>New Moon is by far the most internal book of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight Saga. Books that take place almost entirely inside of the protagonist's head are difficult to translate to the screen--see the labored adaption of Twilight. This and a thousand other reason had me worried when I entered the theater to see New Moon. The book centers on the Bella Swan's internal journey towards the light and away from Edward. The quiet transformation that Bella undergoes under the warm and watchful encouragement of Jacob is what has so many...I want to say teens but sitting in the theater this afternoon with more middle age women than screaming teens makes me say women hopping on Team Jacob. The movie was bound by the constraints of time, already running at just over 2 hours, the movie does not quite do justice to the tender affection that develops so slowly between Jacob and Bella, but I think that this has more to do with lack to time than a lack of reverence for the relationship. Weitz, the director, and Rosenburg, the screenwriter, are incredibly faithful to the book on the whole. There will be no cries for scenes from the book that didn't make it into the movie like there were after Twilight, and furthermore Weitz and Rosenburg try to added just enough to the story to give the viewer something to care about, something to strive for--though this hook never quite sinks into the viewer. On the whole, Weitz's directing style is far less distracting than was Catherine Hardwicke's direction in Twilight. There were definitely moments that the camera movement detracted from the story rather added to it, but these moments occur far less often with Weitz at the helm. Furthermore, Weitz's camera direction kept the camera out of the faces of the actors and often allows several actors and even some of the background into the shot.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is at least on par with the acting in the first film. Kristen Stewart definitely has the ability to portray broken-souled mopey-ness in spades. Her portrayal of Bella is a dark and broken exterior overlaying a stubborn will to live and a will to hold on that is at the best of times captivating and at the worst of times annoyingly pathetic to point of forcing the viewer to wonder why either Edward or Jacob would want her. When Bella is left by Edward in the woods with the promise that she'll never see him again, it's heartbreaking. When the directorial effort to keep the story moving gets out of her way, Stewart definitely will pull tears from even some of the hardest viewers. Stewart's performance is imminently watchable even if not her best. Stewart managed to be less...blinky than she was in her first portrayal of Bella and, mercifully, keep the lower lip biting to a minimum. Robert Pattinson is largely absent from this adaptation except during the opening and closing of the film. When he does appear, Pattinson's acting is a bit labored but the hoards of ""Twihards"" wont mind because Pattinson still manages to throw heart-melting looks at Stewart. Pattinson's American accent is much better and much less like a bad imitation of a New York gang movie. On the plus side, Pattinson's Edward is enjoyable during the confrontation scene at the end of the movie. The problem with Edward is that he is gone from the screen so often that even the strong chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson seems to slip from the viewers mind. Then there is Taylor Lautner. Lautner is the most charming of the three principles in this film. Lautner and Stewart's relationship building scenes at the beginning of the film are sweet and enjoyable but the romantic chemistry between the pair is never quite where it should be. Overall Lautner's performance is strong and it should promise good things for Eclipse when the real Jacob, Edward, Bella triangle comes to a head.<br/><br/>On the whole, the film, though quieter than the first, is a better than Twilight. The movie is, as is the book, merely a transition from Twilight to Eclipse. In the end, the movie will be loved by Twilight lovers and hated by Twilight haters.

","God,I had to edit this comment because it's just too funny.well, I still think my comments is fair.I gave a ""8""..well, probably too much but I just think about each movie is made for a group of audience.Twilight is made for females.I have been around the world lately and from I have seen..well, I got to say.. Robert pattinson is making a lot females go crazy..lol ..well, not me..because I just gave the movie a fair judgement from my part.Hey all the guys out there..well,what can I say..I am certainly surprised that a lot females are going so crazy for Robert Pattinson but oh well..for all the guys that hates the movie or your girl want you to take her to see it..just please please DO NOT COME BACK ALL MAD.THE BEST WAY IS NOT TO GO WITH YOUR GIRL BUT THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA..SO, JUST SLEEP YOUR WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE..IF YOU CAN..LOL... I don't want to be rude but it's not really fair to judge the movie because you took your girlfriend to see the movie and then got mad at the movie because you can't stand your girlfriend screaming..AT LAST,THE REASON WHY I EDIT THIS COMMENT IS BECAUSE I FORGOT ONE THING..ONE MORE REASON WHY THAT ""NEW MOON"" GAVE ME A BIG PUNCH OF DISAPPOINTMENT was STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT FUNNY..BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK IT'S FUNNY..WHAT'S UP WITH THE ""REALLY BIG WOLVES..""????????? oh well, let's hope the next one will be better and for all the guys,just sleep through it..for all the female..well, nothing to say..I think the movie is made for female group of audience..well, I guess I am the weird one here..I do not really care about Robert Pattinson's look.Just hope that he will be a skilled actor in future but as I said not bad for a starter..HERE IS MY OLD COMMENT.. First,I did not watch this movie for the actor because I think a movie should not be based on how good the actor/actress's face.I understand looks matters a lot for some movies.I know all people around the world is currently crazy about this movie because Robert Pattinson.I noticed most females are the ones going crazy.I have also seen some really bad comments on this movie too.I think the comments are too harsh on this movie.Here are some my comments for this movie. 1, I admit I do not think ""New moon"" is better than the first one. 2, I do think the acting was not great but almost all the new actors starts from the face and slowly works on their acting skills.We can not always want to watch the old actor/actress forever! It's always better to have the older and skilled ones and new faces. 3, All the movies are made for a group of audience,so there is nothing wrong with this kind of movie. 4,Some people commented on this movie too harsh. I do not think a movie will make an bad influence on teenagers.If you think it's bad for teenagers,that means you probably don't understand your children much.. 5, Here is my good comment on this movie. I think the movie's success is based on Robert Pattinson.He is not bad for a starter. 6, Here is the bad comment.. well, honestly, I thought with a different director..The new moon should been better than the twilight but actually the disappointment for me was because I expected more on the this one.After all, Any movie that's based on ""vampires""..should have more actions..and since most people want to see the leading actor,I think he should show up more in this movie to make the audience happy. After all, I think the movie was OK!"
"jordell5","8","4","10","22 November 2009"," A positive review from a male perspective
","After seeing an average ratio of 4.5 the immediate thought that came to my head was- what is wrong with people!? Even if people found it dull and disliked it, it deserves at least a 4/10. I'm still undecided as to whether its bests its prequel, but as it was a new, refreshing experience i'll probably be biased and say it was indeed better than Twilight. In terms of half of the mediocre films coming out lately, I think New Moon far outshines many movies in its originality and special effects alone.<br/><br/>Yes it IS a romance, but not the typical American chick-flick that is often associated with this genre. I believe this film has great appeal for male viewers as well as female (though with topless and over-make-uped men it obviously is slanted more towards women). I will agree that the actor of Bella, Kristen Stewart is not a very good actress- she's pretty and looks the part, but I don't think she does her character in the books justice. Aside from her though, I thought the acting was fine- the actors of Jake, Emmett, Alice and Rosalie were great in my eyes. Moreover, the actors chosen for the Volunturi looked pretty much how I imagined them to be in my mind when I read New Moon, which was pleasant to see.<br/><br/>The bizarre choice of music that was chosen in Twilight is present in New Moon and fits the scenarios and moods very aptly- often giving the atmosphere a very every one. Special effects were fantastic and definitely dropped my jaw several times. The little extra dialogue and scenes that were added I felt, were added for good purpose and reason too- a scene that comes to mind is when Victoria *spoiler* attacks Harry in the woods *end of spoiler* whereas in the book, you only hear he dies of a heart attack. Furthermore, I found the film stook fairly closely to the book and converted it very well, without omitting any crucial plot twists or story (Harry Potter comes to mind).<br/><br/>In essence, I thought it was a great film, and the film did it's job- it entertained me. It seems the harsh reviews are coming from men- perhaps they are jealous of the good-looking male actors, and perhaps many don't have a soul and don't appreciate a story about love and infatuation. Who knows.Who cares if they sparkle in sunlight when traditionally they're hurt by it? Does it insult people that Stephanie Meyers decided to be controversial rather than re-using the mythical stereotype!? Overall it was a great movie- not perfect, and probably won't win many, if any Oscars, but it was impressive, and met my expectations."
"sweet_cutie31","8","4","10","22 November 2009"," Some of the harsh comments toward this movie are not legit
","First of all, New moon movie is exceedingly better than Twilight, in that New Moon had much better directing and special effects. It may have been boring in some parts but Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson shocked me with their acting. I thought they would fail at their acting skills like in Twilight, but they amazed me in New Moon. Though, I still hate it when Kirsten flutters her eyes rapidly, it's too dramatic for me. Also, in regards to a previous comment, this movie is based on Stephenie Meyer's series, therefore the vampires are NOT your typical ones. They are ones made up from Stephenie's imagination.. so the harsh comment made on the fact that they don't burn in sunlight is completely absurd."

","i don't get what is wrong with the critics but this movie was absolutely BRILLIANT! The way Kristen portrayed Bella had the emotions that she goes through was perfect and the way Edward appears to her was cleverly done. Taylor Lautner's acting skills were incredible and he did a fantastic job of bringing Jacob Black to the big screen. though the movie doesn't have the most climactic finish in the world, the music and the way Bella had to run through all the people in red robes was perfect!<br/><br/>the critics are all crazy, i plan to see this movie at least 3 more times! it's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time, certainly i like it better then twilight (though that may be because i'm a team Jacob girl) ;)"

","Anyone who see's this movie and who has read the book actually needs to bow down and appreciate their is so little skipped over it is amazing and anyone who says theirs no chemistry between Rob and Kirsten must be blind. I've now watched this movie 3 times and every time it roots me in place and I just had to stay until the end no matter how much I wanted the toilet or needed a drink. Everyone who I've spoken to loves it so I don't understand how anyone can hate it so much its ridiculous. The film is so smooth running and enjoyable even for me a man that I must admit its broken through the GIRLS film with the right mix of action, emotions, and romance it is just unbelievable. For anyone with a spare 2 and a half hours this is a must see film whether you're old, young, male, or female this is one film you've got to take the time out to see."
"lucky_star_1","5","3","7","23 November 2009"," A visually stunning, yet careless adaptation of the book
","I'll start by pointing out the obvious: The choice to hire Melissa Rosenberg for screenwriter of this saga was total fail. She bears no true sense of style when attempting to capture key moments between Edward and Bella. She doesn't seem to understand the true depth of their relationship. Her handling of their scenes is SO incredibly weak that it ultimately means the actors - Rob and Kristen - are left up to the task of re-establishing the connection between the characters. Moreover, she doesn't seem much interested in the Cullen family as a whole. Where was the airport scene that reunited them towards the end? Its absence made the voting scene seem like a major WTF? moment. Why was The Truth chapter scanned over as if it meant nothing? Edward's decision to leave and his suffering without Bella made total and complete sense at this point in the book, whereas in the movie, it's barely touched upon. Honestly, why did Melissa choose to tackle this story if she completely takes it for granted??? <br/><br/>People are going to great lengths to cheer on Jacob Black after watching the movie. Ironic, given that more than half the fanbase previously stated their HATRED for New Moon and their complete boredom of it, especially with the middle part where you learn more about the werewolf aspect of the story. Let me guess ... Taylor Lautner's buffed-up body have anything to do with this newfound love you have for the guy? Oh please, save yourself time and just own up to it. The first shirtless scene he had included most of the back of the theatre getting all hot for him. Made me wanna shout out ""HOW GROSS! HE'S UNDER-AGE, REMEMBER?"" but why bother when apparently, a character's strength is determined by how he looks. Too bad, given that the character I'm familiar with in the books is immature/temperamental/self-serving (etc) but Melissa conveniently chose to give him more depth and show his innocent/loyal side. Why?? Oh yeah *eyeroll* - <br/><br/>The Love Triangle. Or more to the point - THE LOVE TRIANGLE THAT WASN'T IN THE BOOK BUT APPARENTLY EXISTS IN THE MOVIE FOR THE SAKE OF APPEALING TO A WIDER AUDIENCE AND GIVING TAYLOR A REASON TO JUSTIFY HIS CONSTANT HALF-NAKEDNESS. Anyone who knows anything about these books will recall New Moon being a Romeo and Juliet-based story, focusing on Bella's depression over her true love's departure and months later having her spirits lifted by 16 year-old Jacob who becomes her best friend. Does he want more? He's a teenage guy, of course he does. Does she? No, she wants Edward. Take note: Melissa's the one who invented this whole ""dreamcatcher"" thing. It WASN'T in the book. She created it to get you invested in the idea of a possible J/B romance. She went above and beyond to develop Jacob and Bella's bond in this movie when she did no such thing for Edward and Bella in the first movie. Shouldn't time be better spent on including moments that remind the audience why they should be MISSING EDWARD like they did whilst reading the book?? Sad considering Robert Pattinson is by far the superior actor of the 2 guys, playing Edward with deep intensity and subtle charm.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner only shines in the earlier scenes. When his character is forced to transform beyond the boyish stage into a vicious werewolf, his amateur acting skills fail him. This guy can't pull off a look or line of intensity without making you cringe for him. And to top it off, JACOB IS A CARBON-COPY OF EDWARD. Read between the lines to see how much he reflects him: Sees girl, spends time with girl, wants girl, can't have girl, struggling with inner demons around girl, can't lose control with girl... Catch my drift??? There's nothing original about Jacob Black. Sure, he's more easy-going and carefree. But he hasn't had to live through what Edward has. He hasn't found his soulmate in Bella like Edward has.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart gives a fair performance, particularly shining in the depression-related scenes. You actually feel her yearning for Edward through the way Kristen sells the character. This is her I'm crediting, not Melissa. You completely buy into her still loving Edward during Jacob's many advances, again thanks to Kristen's telling performance. Her and Robert together just sell it, plainly and simply. Yes, they have chemistry. (Still.) Yes, you should still be feeling that Bella belongs with Edward when you walk out of the movie. If not, then why bother watching the rest of the movies? <br/><br/>On the plus side, I'll give props to Michael Sheen, Edi Gathegi and Michael Welch as charismatic supporting actors. Sorry to say, the guys playing wolves with the exception of Chaske Spencer are one-dimensional and at one point, sit around a table doing nothing except being shirtless. They serve no real purpose when not in wolf form. The journey to Volterra fills you with the exhilaration that you just didn't feel throughout the rest of the movie. Also, the references to the Meadow are beautifully constructed, with a romantic score to fulfil that sense of longing for Edward and Bella to be united again.<br/><br/>The movie's biggest weaknesses? Script doesn't serve justice to the book. ~ Perhaps more voiceovers would have helped this, who knows. And from a marketing point of view, allowing the story to be a simple overkill of ""will teen girl end up with vampire or werewolf?"" makes it seem cheap and takes away from what made Twilight a hit in the first place."
"llneyman","8","3","7","22 November 2009"," Why can't anyone just have fun?
","I think it's safe to say that ""New Moon"", as a book, is not the most enjoyable out of the series. Did everyone forget this going into the theater? I certainly did not forget. From the material they had to work with, I think that Melissa and Chris did what they could with the script and the rest of the movie. I really don't understand what everyone is so upset about. It was fun, and for the most part, gave every fan exactly what they wanted! I mean, what did people really expect? From what I can tell, if they had gone a totally different direction with the movie to impress critics, the fans would be mad. But now, some fans are upset because there wasn't enough action in it. Let's recap: ""New Moon"" is not an action book. There's not much in it until the end when they go to the Volturi, and even then there really isn't an action sequence. The purpose of the book is to build up the relationship with Jacob and Bella and to bring in the wolf dilemma. All it is is moping and pondering. The fact that Chris did, in fact, show more action than was in the book should be commended. If he hadn't done that, then the movie would've definitely moved slower. And let me bring up the Catherine/Chris argument. I recall most fans fussing about Catherine when Twilight came out last year. Now, everyone is fussing about Chris and praising Catherine. Come on, people! Will anything make you happy? These movies are not being made to cater to the Oscar crowd, and I feel like the critics went a little overboard with their reviews. It's like they went in wanting the movie to be bad. When you know that a movie is being made for a particular fan-base, that should at least be mentioned in the review. For the most part, it wasn't. In conclusion, if you want to see the movie, go see it. If not, don't. Don't ruin it for people who've waited months to watch this play out on screen. It's fun, and that's all that matters."
"CoraJack","7","3","7","20 November 2009"," Review from a Twi-Hard who will not sugar-coat! Holes abound!
","Holes. Period.<br/><br/>The guy in front of me kept asking, ""Why don't those werewolves ever wear shirts?"" Good question since they never show clothes ripping off of them when they morph.<br/><br/>I know an entire book can't be put in a movie, but how about the ""most interesting"" part--Volturi--being cut down to about 15 minutes at most? More Jane please. On the way out I kept hearing comments such as, ""I wonder what special powers those other guys in the chairs had?"" (speaking of Volturi). This is all omitted! The director must write for people who have not read the books! There were so many more holes that I noticed as well, but I don't want to just write about holes.<br/><br/>There was something about Edward that was different but I just couldn't put my finger on it. Something about the way he looked. I know the eyes were different but something else. However, seeing him almost naked (just another inch down on the pants please)was thrilling (sorry guys, but to some of us girls (women)he is a golden God of a man. Michelangelo would have made a statue using HIM as the model! Finally we get a good special-effects ""sparkling"" scene--thank goodness! That was fantastic! I didn't like the way Alice changed in this film. She was too brash to me. I liked the kind, giddy Alice from Twilight. OK get serious but don't get rude.<br/><br/>The ""visions"" of Edward were just plain dumb! Shoddy, stupid, and almost bordering on ridiculous. This is not a TV movie, something more could have been done with them to make them seem more ""real"".<br/><br/>Best parts/performances--Rathbone--he has almost no screen time but he is such a pleasure. Burke--he really shined in this one. I'm glad he got some more screen time and witty lines. Fanning--not much screen time but perfect. Sorry KStew fans but nothing has changed here. She is not and will never be ""Bella"" to me. Emotionless. Boring. Period.<br/><br/>And the ending--why veer from the book? OK you want to leave it a cliffhanger? Fine, do that....but everyone who read the books knows what happens at the end of New Moon. Why didn't you give the non-book reading fans more information throughout the movie if you were so intent on leaving the cliffhanger for the non-readers? I bought my tickets over 2 months ago. I stood in line tonight for over 2 hours. I talked about this for 11 months....I AM still Alice right now (in costume) and I have to say, Hardwicke where did you go? Eclipse? Trust me, I'm not fighting crowds on opening day for this one."
"dsweetsoccergirl","9","7","23","20 November 2009"," I was not disappointed!!!!
","I'm not one of those crazy fanatics, but I have read the series a few times, and yes, I was at the midnight showing last night. I wanted to see it and get my own opinion before all these bogus reviews came out.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was a huge improvement from Twilight (although I did enjoy Twilight) because it was easy to see what the larger budget allowed them to do. The special effects were great. The wolves looked so much better than in the first preview that was aired.<br/><br/>People seem so surprised that Edward was not in it that much...If you read the books, you know that this book is more about Jacob and Bella's relationship anyway so stop complaining.<br/><br/>As far as the ending is concerned, I love that this movie stuck to the book in almost every way, and it left it at the same place the book does. There is nothing wrong with the end...it's called a cliff hanger! The only thing I worried about was if I had not read the books...would the movie have made sense. I felt like the bits and pieces they cut out left small holes in the story line...especially with everything dealing with the ""Royal"" family.<br/><br/>I did LOVE how they used ""Dear Alice"" e-mails to explain Bella's feelings as she went from zombie to almost happy with Jacob. It was a great way to show how she was changing emotionally.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed it. And by the way...I am not a teenage girl...and I will have to see this movie again because I missed some of the conversations due to little girls screaming over Jacob with his shirt off. But yes, he does look good!"
"dramaqueen4405","9","6","19","20 November 2009"," Far better than the fist..
","I have more positive than negatives for this movie. I'm a book fan so therefore I'm biased but in general I thought this movie was well done. The dialog was better, the graphics were better and the god awful lighting that diluted the first installment was done better.<br/><br/>Just like any other movie, it's not for everyone. If you're not a book fan chances are you won't like the movie as much. Even if you are a book fan you may have some complaints but well, hey, that's the thing about book to movie translation. They're never going to mirror each other perfectly.<br/><br/>I loved almost everything about this movie. Kristen Stewart is a mediocre actress at best and I was disappointed with her lack of depth. I expected to go into that movie and sob over her loss but through her ""zombie"" phase she looked more bored than emotionally destroyed. Taylor Lautner was amazing except for a few scenes where I was scratching my head from lack of transitional dialog. Unfortunately I still find the Bella/Edward chemistry a little awkward. <br/><br/>I did think the vampires looked WAY better in this installment. The wolf pack and the Volturi fight scenes were done extremely well.<br/><br/>All in all I thought this movie was way better, just a few minor complaints. For those who expect a cinematic masterpiece, and go to the theater judging it as such, you're going to be disappointed. I don't think this series was ever meant to venture into Oscar worthy territory, but entertaining nonetheless."
"abudura","10","5","15","29 November 2009"," I loved this movie....
","I loved the books, and I expected exactly what happened in the movie. I was lucky to not be in a theater full of people laughing. My theater was into the film and everyone stood and clapped at the end!!!! Im not sure why fans who ""love the story"" are so upset with the cheesy one liners in the film. That's what the book is stuffed full of and Im sure you were excited when you read it. I thought the film was shot very well and I think the actors did a fantastic job portraying the characters exactly how I pictured them in the books. New Moon is overall everyones least favorite of the 4 because its sad and Edward is missing. I think if you're going to go to the theater to see your favorite book on screen you need to prepare yourself to see something different from what you read. People are overly critical. I loved New Moon and I am so excited for the release of Eclipse in June. Hopefully they will make Breaking Dawn - however, with all you nerdy negative fans I doubt its going to happen."
"neighborlee","10","5","15","28 November 2009"," Good movies don't have to always be about unending violence
","I find it not only disturbing , utterly fascinating ( in a very bad way) and completely without logic that someone would complain , - and often with little or no indication of education based on use of grammar and foul language, that they didn't like a movie regardless of its thoughtfulness and amazing set direction, lighting , mood , great characters/acting, stunning action sequences, special effects and amazing storyline and set locations just because they are jealous that a romantic romp through the lives of two torn individuals manages to triumph in the end through seeming unachievable challenges somehow messes with their preset ideologies that movies must be only about gratuitous unending pulse-pounding violence and similarly shallow plots.<br/><br/>The rest of us loved the movie because it showed commitment to another person, the better part of ourselves doing something we may not like, but that its the right thing to do and is the encapsulation of love in all its glory. The heroine understood the consequences, but accepted the reality of it based on faith in love and her ability , - with love in tow to rise above the murky dark facade that for a time alluded the struggle for happiness. No one in their right mind would suggest this is appropriate under all circumstances ( this could be very dangerous to try at home HM ) and we surely accept that along with our agility to sail through life with lessons learned under our belts and the better person we become for it, that some of us will grab a certain gusto of life possibly wrought with some degree of peril, not because our brains are hardwired for high risk at any cost, but because we are hardwired to want to love and be loved. <br/><br/>This is not just a movie for teenage girls as some have provocatively and incorrectly suggested, but for any couple or any person yearning to see something clean and viscerally elegant because it speaks to our heart.<br/><br/>If you don't get that then maybe you should consider some introspection, and look at the man(or woman) in the mirror, because the rest of us appreciate and admire a broad sweeping emotional love story because it just feels good when love triumphs in the face of possible adversity or learns some valuable lesson ; - our sail truly then set for success, running ( slight pun , slightly unintentional ) as a solid framework for the rest of our lives."
"Laecy","7","4","11","29 November 2009"," Went in expecting a guilty pleasure; it was better than I anticipated.
","I'm one of those Twilight fans that I think are more common than people guess. I enjoy the books for the emotional melodrama and the popcorn action and the humor (intentional or otherwise), but I don't usually admit to it in public. The extremes on both ends of the spectrum probably wouldn't want anything to do with me.<br/><br/>I loved the first movie, flaws notwithstanding. I went into this one expecting to laugh and cry and cringe a little at the cheesier moments. I got everything I was hoping for, and ended up cringing much less than I anticipated.<br/><br/>The humor of the humans in Bella's life is pitch-perfect. Her father and school friends have always been very well done. Bella and Edward both seem to have relaxed into the roles a little, and their dialog (while still very very teen-angsty) at least conveys an undertone of self-awareness. The vampires are better made up and articulated than in the first movie, and the wolves are great. The fight scenes were *much* improved.<br/><br/>And I have to say Michael Sheen's Aro is FANTASTIC. In my imagination, I saw him as physically weak looking, a little too perky, and scary just because of his context. But Sheen makes him truly truly creepy. When he's looking at Bella and wanting to see if he can read her, I kept wanting to stand up and back away. He doesn't do the emo-stare most of the vampires succumb to, and he doesn't do a parody of the affably evil Big Bad. I really believed him. Very impressive.<br/><br/>All in all - not exactly film as high art, but better than I thought it would be, and a good time. I'll probably see it again."
"rivertam26","10","9","33","20 November 2009"," New Moon has real bite
","As most of you know I am a Twilight fan. A TwiHard if you will even though I refuse to address myself as that because it's on a different level of dorkdum than I'd like to be apart of. I throughly enjoyed the books after they were forced upon me. They actually reinspired me to start reading and working on my writing again. As the first film approached I eagerly awaited it. But upon seeing it for the first time I was extremely disappointed the film felt amateur and so much of the stuff I had loved in the first book didn't seem to be there. Stewart was good but her performance seemed a little off and Hardwicke's direction was mediocre at best. The best thing about that film was smokin hot Robert Pattinson and the electric chemistry he had with Stewart. But being the fan I was I decided to revisit the film and started to like it. I started to like it a lot. It was easy to admit it wasn't a great film by any means but there was a certain charm to it. A real guilty pleasure I grew to love. After that I reread the books (a few times) and found myself eagerly awaiting the sequel. But despite the hype and incredible trailers for it. New Moon was the least favorite book of my series and Deep down I thought okay get ready to hate it but it will grow on me after a few viewings. Well I just got home from it. And it was freaking AMAZING!!!!!!! The film is not only a close adaptation of the book but it really nails the formula. The film feels larger and more epic than its predecessor and maybe thats because it's supposed to be. But it also feels professionally executed with a real style to the proceedings. Sure Rob Pattinson is good, And Taylor Lautner's abs do well enough but this is Stewart's movie. And she is amazing. The unbelievable amount of heartbreak she manages to convey in her compelling performance is tear jerking and award worthy. On a technical level the cinematography is breathtaking. The film is filled with a lush atmosphere and eye catching explosions of color and surrealistic depth. The underwater sequence in particular is award worthy and I would be surprised if any film came remotely near it this year. The score makes the film feel so large and dramatic and the film's soundtrack is cleverly added in. The screenplay is good enough but it's the direction that really makes this film soar. Weitz responsible for the horrifically bad Golden Compass seems to be in his element film the film never drags, moving at a wondorous pace. It's romantic and the weirdness of its concept and the actual book is perfectly captured on feel making for a truly creative and thought provoking film. It's that good. The film is also really funny. Weitz adds some much needed humor into the film so that you find yourself laughing through tears at time. It's that good. If I could change anything I only wish that sam and his pack were given a little more screen time I found them to be a charming and talented group of guys. Now I went in as being all about Eward in fact I can't even contemplate why there is a Team Jacob but after seeing the film although I'm still all about edward I find myself sympathizing with his character and even liking him a little. Now I may be a bit biased in this review or just really overexcited. Only time will tell if my opinion of the film goes a little downward or possibly gets better . But for now let's just Twilight Saga new Moon is one of the best films I've seen ever."

Kristen acted her part well playing the depressed mopey mess that Bella was in this sequel but the top actor in this movie was Taylor with a very well understood character and an outstanding performance in my opinion. didn't like the fact that they made him take his shirt off at every possible moment but that's a teenage based romance for you.<br/><br/>the directing was the down point to this movie. concentrating mostly on the effects and not the actual storyline. one of the secondary characters die in this movie yet in the book the way he died was different. also there were some pretty corny scenes chucked in as well which kind of ruined the mood. Bella in a white dressed running along side Edward both glittering in the sun while at the same time Bella is in a very tense situation. timing needed to be better.<br/><br/>overall its a good film definitely worth the money but i still wonder whether it was a good idea having a new director bought in because in my opinion the first movie with such a low budget was excellent focused only on the acting and the storyline this movie is playing on effects and cheap comedy chucked in there at different times."

","Let me first say that I have not read any of the books so I don't know how close it follows the source material. This film is certainly a chick flick but I got it for free from the library and I saw the first one so I figured how bad could it be right. After watching it I can see why many critics and audiences didn't like this sequel. I for one thought New Moon was okay but not the greatest from director Chris Weitz who does a decent job of making this movie but there are many flaws that weigh it down which I'll get into later. Kristen Stewart is okay as the lead Bella despite the films problems. This may not be her best performance but she's still somewhat believable as the character. I wish she could have shown more emotion of what Bella is supposed to be going through instead of just blank stares and blinking her eyes. Robert Pattinson is all right as Bella's brooding vampire love Edward in his very limited screen time. Pattinson fans will probably be disappointed because don't expect him in it that much. He shows up early on and then his character disappears for most of the movie only to reappear before the climax. Pattinson doesn't have much to do this time around but he does what his role requires I guess. Taylor Lautner is impressive as Jacob Black whose part is much larger in New Moon than the first one. Launter and Stewart felt more like the leads in this sequel than her and Pattinson in Twilight. Taylor does a convincing job as Jacob and makes the best of his larger role in the film. I did feel they had him take his shirt off a bit too much which felt unnecessary except to make teenage girls go crazy over his six-pack abs but Lautner improved on his performance from the previous one none the less. The rest of the cast including the Cullen family, Bella's father Charlie, and the werewolf shape shifters are okay despite only having a few minutes of screen time. Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning have what amounts to cameo appearances as dangerous vampires who feed on humans. Sheen and Fanning are decent in their villain roles but lack screen time and development considering they don't even show up until late into the third act. Sheen does make an appearance near the beginning of the movie but his character along with Dakota's Jane aren't in it long enough to leave an impression and don't have a lot to do either. The same can go for Edi Gathegi as the vampire Laurent who returns from the first one for a brief appearance before apparently biting the dust and Rachelle Lefevre as the revenge driven Victoria. Lafevre turns in an okay performance even with no dialog and only a few minutes of screen time. Pattinson and Stewart had nice chemistry together just as she did with Lautner. The special effects including the CGI werewolves were pretty good and the few action/fight sequences the film did have are well executed but aren't anything memorable. With the good things out of the way now I'll get into what I thought could've been better. The movie seemed to be juggling way too many characters with most of them (Sheen, Fanning, and the other members of the Volutri to name a few) getting the short end of the stick and the dialog was a bit cheesy at times. New Moon was a little slow at times making it drag which weighed the movie down a bit for me. Also Bella's ""reckless"" attitude that put her in danger got a bit old at times because I mean how many times does she need to be rescued in one film. With it's flaws aside though, New Moon isn't that bad it just could've been better. It'll probably please almost any die hard fan of the book series. Overall Twilight New Moon has some action, a little suspense, and good performances from the cast for the most part but this wasn't the best movie I've seen. Granted I honestly didn't expect much since New Moon got mixed reviews but if director Chris Weitz improved the flaws somehow this sequel could've been much better."

","It is better than the first movie. Bella has more expressions and actions. The dynamics between her, Jacob and Edward is developed. It has better actions, conflict, and warmths. The music is perfect for the movie. Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan, Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen, Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Billy Burke as Charlie Swan, Michael Sheen as Aro, and Dakota Fanning as Jane did good job. The visual effects and special effects are okay.<br/><br/>The movie is too long with so many scenes where the characters just stare at something or Bella thinking/crying, or just pure silence and the camera moves around. The motivation of Edward for loving Bella is still not clearly developed, unlike the relationship between Jacob and Bella.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1) How could Jacob save Bella on time when she jumped into the water? He was far away, how would he know about the location and that it was Bella?
2) Jacob did not know how to perform the chest compression. How could Bella be so lucky to survive? She was drowning for quite a while.
3) Why was no one look at Edward when he was revealing himself?"

","TAKE WHAT MASTERED YOU!AND MASTER IT.<br/><br/>A trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic admiration which causes a person to want to improve themselves and copy the model.<br/><br/>The 'Twilight' SAGA includes 'Twilight (2008),' 'New Moon (2009),' 'Eclipse (2010),' 'Breaking Dawn - pt. 1 (2011),' and 'Breaking Dawn - pt. 2 (2012).' Therefore, this review will place the most attention on the original film which I believe is the strongest representation of the character strength. So without further ado, the 'Twilight' SAGE can be seen as an exemplar for teaching an alternative way of living for resisting any kind of temptation.<br/><br/>For instance, self-sacrificial adjustments that is show through Edward and his family are ""good"" vampires who only feed off animals as a replacement for taking human blood.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, developing an alternative lifestyle with the character strengths exhibited of self-regulation, bravery, prudence, perseverance, and love as they have learn how to control their impulses.<br/><br/>This shows significant self-control and inner discipline in managing impulses and emotions, turning tendencies into creativity. While the themes that the 'Twilight' SAGA has presented throughout the film are: choices, love, good vs. evil, fear, isolation, language, communication, appearances, mortality, the supernatural, strength, skill, family, hate, sacrifice, man and the natural world, memory, and past.<br/><br/>The 'Twilight' SAGA trailers are edgy with this atmospheric quality in the audio and visual design that makes you feel like you're apart of the character's world.<br/><br/>The trailer show performances that are full of confidence as the actors enjoy and believe in what they're doing. Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart, and Taylor Lautner were all compelling, truthful in the moment, and emotionally connected as they fully transformed into their characters.<br/><br/>Not to mention the other actors were believable in their characters as they stood true to the original characters of Stephenie Meyer's popular novel that's of the same name.<br/><br/>In effect, the trailer pulls you brings you into the world of this Forks town. Where ""High-school student Bella Swan, always a bit of a misfit, doesn't expect life to change much when she moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Washington state. Then she meets Edward Cullen, a handsome but mysterious teen whose eyes seem to peer directly into her soul. Edward is a vampire whose family does not drink blood, and Bella, far from being frightened, enters into a dangerous romance with her immortal soulmate"" (ref. Google).<br/><br/>As the special effects really enhance the movie; both audio and visual, giving it this dark and soulful style.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the cinematography was creative, along with an amusing production quality that had a dark feeling ethereal film score.<br/><br/>Overall, the 'Twilight' trailers are an astonishing work of art
that create suspense within you to see the movie."

","This review is for the entire saga.<br/><br/>From first glance, I fell in love with Twilight.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart's eyes are so expressive, it was like she was mesmerized, in a trance, and lost to Edward...forever. I am amazed at the quality of her acting though, at times, I thought the dialogue was laughable. In the beginning she does come across as a whiny, selfish brat, but because I know the ending, the whole triangle thing was explained in a mind blowing way. Her lip sucking and soft snorting could be annoying, but, like anything I fall in love with, I am easily able to get past it. For her age, she comes across as brave, intuitive, and able to handle whatever comes her way, never wavering.<br/><br/>The music is amazing and emotional.I laughed and I cried. I would get lost in it and it invoked so many emotions I would be overcome with...a warmth that is all encompassing, a sit up and pay attention moment when the danger rises to a fever pitch, or a clash between Edward and Jake is on the horizon. Like Calgon, I just wanted to close my eyes and let it take me away...deeper into the fantasy.<br/><br/>They did an amazing job with the special effects. The more I watch it, the more I marvel at them. We do have the cheesy moments and I do cringe, but they are few and brief.<br/><br/>Twilight has made everything vampire so much better for me. It allows me to visualize the action, such as fighting, death, turning...<br/><br/>Three outstanding peripheral characters stand out and I feel deserve a special mention. Blondie, for being there, Bella's savior til the end. Seth, what a sweet boy, that believes in doing the right thing, loyal and trustworthy. AND a very special shout out to Leah. When she makes that move in front of the Cullin's house...doesn't get much better than that.<br/><br/>To vamp or not to vamp, that is the question. I first got into vamps with Angel reruns, then Charmed and Supernatural reruns. I caught a few Buffy episodes, but missed out on most of it.<br/><br/>I do love my vamps mean and ugly, but, now, I also love them soft and vegetarian. Cheesy and hot. It's so bad I can't look away. I watch whatever pops up on cable over and over. binging on Hulu. Poor constipated Edward and lip sucking, soft snorting Bella. a whiny selfish brat...and a hottie, Jacob. Sometimes Edward's facial expressions are so very creepy. To pick my favorite character is really hard, because as I learn more about each one, they all have their special touch added to the whole.<br/><br/>Two other cringe worthy moments are when Riley is standing over Charlie...I can feel his breath on my face, and when Bella's knees hit the floor. I cringe every single time!<br/><br/>My favorite quote:<br/><br/>""So the lion fell in love with the lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a stupid lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a sick masochistic lion.""<br/><br/>Everything about Twilight has made my enjoyment of the supernatural world of werewolves and vampires so much more enjoyable. I am able to visualize the action and know more of the history of the fabulous fictional characters.<br/><br/>BLEW MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I rarely buy books or DVDs, but this was a must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..and I bought the set of books too, so be on the lookout for those reviews."

","This film is definitely aimed at teens. If you're not a teen, you probably will think it's lame and fingers-down-your-throat bad. I was a teenager when I first watched this, and I loved it to bits, I would have given it 10/10 stars at that age! But now, I'd give it a lot less. But, to give an accurate review, I thought I'd better put a rating that was in the middle ground between my two opinions.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is mediocre. Occasionally, there's the odd time where you think ""that was actually convincing acting!"" but at others you kind of cringe and think ""oh that was baaad!"" This is one of the reasons that I think it is aimed at teens, because it wouldn't seem as cheesy to a young mind, particularly if they're seduced by Robert Patterson!<br/><br/>The script is kind of lame, and I don't know whether this is because the books were lame or not, because I've never read the books, but either way the script needs a serious rewrite if it will ever impress mature viewers."

","I could chew the first Twilight but the New Moon was far worse. Slow and boring... No connection between the characters, very artificial relationships, too much cold colors, sorrow, sadness.

"hahnpaul-63454","4","0","0","18 February 2019"," New Moon doesn't improve from its predecessor.
","The movie builds on the story that Twilight set up. Bella and Edward are together but they break up soon because Edward doesn't want to hurt her and he feels like he cannot do it being a vampire and her being a human, but he doesn't want to turn her into a vampire either. So he leaves Washington and also her behind. Because of sadness she turns to someone to fill the gap Edward left behind.<br/><br/>New Moon makes story wise the same mistakes Twilight made. It is incredibly slow, very little happens in the first 90 minutes of the movie. The final in Italy is good but it can't save what everything else did wrong. Another problem are the extremely slow dialogues - again: just like in Twilight. Bella stutters so often, that's probably true to her character, but still it isn't entertaining to watch. And what makes the dialogues even harder to watch is that they are long and both Edward and Jacob need a lot of time to respond as well as Bella. Adding to that: The two actors didn't make me believe that they really are in love. I didn't believe Edward and I didn't believe Bella. There was just not enough chemistry between them and even the dialogues didn't make a good job showing their love. Lastly, the way the final was set up: I'm sorry but it just doesn't make sense it all and they could have made a much better job doing it.<br/><br/>Even worse and slower than the first movie but the final act saves New Moon at least a bit."

Bella gets heartbroken and of course becomes close with Jacob. So who will Bella choose in the end Edward or Jacob. I think we all know who she ends up being with in the end.<br/><br/>
Overall this is such a boring franchise. I don't know why I'm on a binge watching every Twilight film from 2008 to 2012 but I wanted to see what each one is like and compare them.<br/><br/>
Kirsten Stewart is so so bland. I don't know what it is about her but she's just not likeable. I can take Emma Watson any day as she has a likeabilty(unlike Stewart who has just one blooming expression and that's just staring lifeless).
Robert Pattinson isn't a bad actor. I loved him in Water For Elephants with Reese Witherspoon and he was great as Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire but by god his chemistry with Kirsten was boring. They are no compatable at all and they were dating until the Twilight Saga ended. To me this was pretty obvious a PR stunt just so people would go and watch this crap.<br/><br/>

"tiago_lima011","Null","0","0","25 December 2017"," A visually stunning, yet careless adaptation of the book
","I'll start by pointing out the obvious: The choice to hire Melissa Rosenberg for screenwriter of this saga was total fail. She bears no true sense of style when attempting to capture key moments between Edward and Bella. She doesn't seem to understand the true depth of their relationship. Her handling of their scenes is SO incredibly weak that it ultimately means the actors - Rob and Kristen - are left up to the task of re-establishing the connection between the characters. Moreover, she doesn't seem much interested in the Cullen family as a whole. Where was the airport scene that reunited them towards the end? Its absence made the voting scene seem like a major WTF? moment. Why was The Truth chapter scanned over as if it meant nothing? Edward's decision to leave and his suffering without Bella made total and complete sense at this point in the book, whereas in the movie, it's barely touched upon. Honestly, why did Melissa choose to tackle this story if she completely takes it for granted???<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner only shines in the earlier scenes. When his character is forced to transform beyond the boyish stage into a vicious werewolf, his amateur acting skills fail him. This guy can't pull off a look or line of intensity without making you cringe for him. And to top it off, JACOB IS A CARBON-COPY OF EDWARD. Read between the lines to see how much he reflects him: Sees girl, spends time with girl, wants girl, can't have girl, struggling with inner demons around girl, can't lose control with girl... Catch my drift??? There's nothing original about Jacob Black. Sure, he's more easy-going and carefree. But he hasn't had to live through what Edward has. He hasn't found his soulmate in Bella like Edward has.<br/><br/>The movie's biggest weaknesses? Script doesn't serve justice to the book. ~ Perhaps more voiceovers would have helped this, who knows. And from a marketing point of view, allowing the story to be a simple overkill of ""will teen girl end up with vampire or werewolf?"" makes it seem cheap and takes away from what made Twilight a hit in the first place."

To a certain extent I even like how the idea of vampires and werewolves is transferred to a more modern surrounding. Unfortunately, the film is drowned in a bulldozer-load of kitsch that sometimes threatens to turn the scenes into something funny because you can't take them serious anymore. Nonetheless there is a coherent plot that is interesting enough to carry the movie until the end. I'm not so hooked that i have a feeling of immediately watching the third part but I think that a lot of reviews here are written more in a sense of simply hating than as a serious critique.<br/><br/>All in all you should only watch this if you can cope with a very teen-aged ideal of love and romance.

"mistoppi","3","0","0","3 October 2016"," I hate this
","Twilight movies are painful to watch. Not because of the dramatic and heart-breaking love stories, but because everyone is expressionless. Everyone always complains about Kristen Stewart, but everyone is just as bad as she is - except none of these actors are bad. I've seen Kristen Stewart in other movies, and she's an excellent actress. Same goes for almost everyone, yet everyone is so horrible in these movies. What also makes these movies painful is how everything is stupidly cheesy and dramatic, and every scene is unnecessary long. You could've easily made this an 1,5 hour film instead of two hours - just cut every useless part out. Thank you.<br/><br/>The story is annoying. Edward breaks up with Bella to protect her and she gets depressed. But her depression is so severe I honestly cannot believe that is a result of a healthy relationship ending. If you delete the supernatural element and change the beginning, it honestly feels like Bella just got out of an abusive relationship and is therefore a little broken and all that. Yeah, Bella is not an extremely three-dimensional character, but I almost want to protect her from Edward. <br/><br/>I hate Edward Cullen. Sure, there aren't many likable characters in these movie, but Edward is the worst. He's manipulative and controlling. It's like you start dating someone, but after a while you realise they tell you what to do and you don't dare to defy them. That's the kind of character Edward is. <br/><br/>Special effects are so stupid. Nothing looks real. All vampires' eyes are so fake, like no one in real life could look a Cullen in the eyes and be like ""yep, those are very normal eyes"". The wolves were even faker. They looked like they came from a children's animation, and while that's understandable, they looked so incredibly unrealistic it ruined every scene with the wolves in it. <br/><br/>One thing makes this movie better than the first one: there is less of Edward and more of Jacob. Or is that two things? I still dislike them both, but before we know what Jacob is he's so lovely. Everyone else is just so grim and blah."

As someone who hated the first movie, I was surprised. It's still awful, but sometimes it was so bad that it was funny. How poorly written and sudden some things were. I even recall rewinding the movie to rewatch some scenes. <br/><br/>The pacing was vastly improved from the first movie, despite this one being longer. Maybe I'm used to the structure of these movies now, or maybe this was actually just better. <br/><br/>Other than the bad writing, the characters are worse than before. Every single one is incredibly stupid. And not realistically stupid, they're just stupid. Honestly Bella has done so much stupid stuff that I'm starting to actually believe her as a character. She's so consistent, it's weird. <br/><br/>And of course, the acting has only gotten worse. Kristen Stewart sucks even more, Taylor Lautner is almost laughably awful. And Robert Pattinson sucks, just not as much as everyone else. <br/><br/>Overall Twilight: New Moon is a steaming pile of poop, only this time there's a bit of ice cream in there.

This is the second installment to the popular series that many claim ruined the image of vampires and werewolves. In order to protect Bella Swan, vampire Edward Cullen departs from her. She descends into depression until she learns that reckless behavior can summons images of him. Eventually she gets close to Jacob Black whom later reveals himself to be a werewolf. Director Chris Weitz is backed by tremendous images. Weitz previously directed The Golden Compass as well as the teen comedy American Pie. Kristen Stewart shines as Bella although one wonders whether her concluding decision is a wise one. Robert Pattinson nearly makes a horrendous sacrifice after leaving Bella in fear of her safety. He is close by and she discovers methods of bringing him out. Taylor Lautner steals scenes as Jacob whom assists Bella when Edward disappears but he refuses to share her with Edward. Ashley Greene plays Alice Cullen, Edward's sister who contacts Bella and leads to Italy where he is set to be vanquished. Billy Burke plays Bella's concern father who is involved in these grisly crimes as a cop. Pointless visual extravaganza that will work better for fans of the books as oppose to horror fans.

There were gasps, laughs, sighs and applause. The imagery throughout the movie was wonderful - I'm looking forward to a second viewing to catch what I may have missed the first time around. Terrific writing job, incorporating important facets of the novel that would have been missed if left out.

","I can't believe this movie has such low reviews! I'm gonna help it out a little, because there is NO FREAKING WAY I'm going to let Twilight have a higher rating because this movie improved on the first one A lot! I also can't believe that almost nobody will say it's their favorite book just because Edward isn't in it. I mean, this book adds soooo many more dimensions and drama to the story! The introduction of the Volturi, the werewolves, another love interest for Bella, a deepening connection between Edward and Bella now that they know they can't go back to normal lives without each other, believable reasons why Edward won't change Bella, a prelude to the next book in which they must finally fight Victoria...what the heck people!! Okay, so the dialogue was still pretty cheesy in some parts, mainly the parts between Edward and Bella. I don't really get why anyone is pro Edward/Bella if they haven't read the book, because they have ZERO chemistry on screen. They are INTENSELY AWKWARD. Where the hell is the charismatic and charming Edward I read in the book? Rob looks like he's constipated when he mushes his lips all over her face in a ""passionate"" kiss. I get that he doesn't want to kill her. But I don't get why he has to look like he's taking a rough dump. It made me laugh when I'm sure the director intended for me to start ""Awwww!""-ing. And it doesn't help much that Rob Pattinson just doesn't know how to act, even in less intense scenes; I liked him better as Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter series. Maybe he'd have been less awkward if he could've kept his British accent...not that it would've made him better looking, cough cough, ahem... But aside from the Bella/Edward awkwardness...the movie was GREAT! Taylor Lautner's acting was surprisingly good despite a few cheesy awkward lines he had to say. I have to say that I am very happy with his portrayal of the Jacob that I read in the book, it was spot on. He even looked like I pictured him. He was hardly awkward with Bella at all, and it looked and felt more natural when they interacted. Yep, I'm definitely Pro-Jacob, even though I read the books and know what happens anyway...sigh. Lastly, but not leastly, the director was a TEN FOLD improvement over Catherine Hardwicke. The fight scene looked a lot more legit in this movie than the one in the last movie did. And when Jacob did supernatural stuff, like climb up Bella's house to her window, it looked fairly believable. None of that ""spidermonkey"" crap. The music was less mainstream and gave the movie a more original and personal feel to it, so kudos for that. The scene where Edward leaves Bella is so heart wrenching I cried, despite the cheesiness. It was the good directing, the camera angles and the music and the feel of the scene that helped with that a lot. The pacing was also really good, it felt like it lasted just long enough and all the scenes were drawn out to just the right extent. It was also very on key with the book. So yes, I definitely will give this movie an 8/10. I am overall very happy with this adaptation from my FAVORITE book in this series. (:"

","I really don't get the critics reviews, the movie was totally cool!! Well yeah it's not a massive budget CGI film but it was totally worth getting into! The opening scene was brill, loved the colour scheme, staying true to Stephenie Meyer's overall tone of the book. The acting has vastly improved over Twilight. Emotions in Twilight being a bit disconnected and emotionally detached.<br/><br/>I loved R Pattz's portrayal of Edward... very convincing. I don't get how some reviewers slam him for being broody and looking as though he wanted to cry in most scenes... hello that is how it's supposed to be. I mean come on, did they even read the book?<br/><br/>K Stew's Bella was much better. Her acting improved a lot over Twilight which was a little wooden and disconnected. I actually felt her love and loss. Her heartache and joy. Unlike in Twilight, I actually felt that she actually loved Edward and cared for him.<br/><br/>Jacob... well what can I say about Jacob? Well I absolutely loathe him in the books. Whereas Taylor Lautner makes Jacob actually tolerable. More than tolerable even... likable. Taylor's Jacob is witty and not too protective, the complete opposite of Edward and that is what makes him likable to me.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were brilliant. I loved Peter Facinelli... he's so cool and breathes life into his role as Carlisle.<br/><br/>The only reason why I gave it an 8 and not a 9 is because of the cliffhanger at the end... so unfair leaving it off like that.<br/><br/>Overall a decent movie which I will be going back to see tomorrow!!<br/><br/>P.S. - To all those people who gave this movie a bad review... you're the ones who actually spent the money to go and see the movie and then gave it a bad review. That still doesn't stop it from making the millions... who stinks now?"

","New Moon is the first movie I ever watched in a theater and I loved it! I really enjoyed it. <br/><br/>(NEW MOON AND TWILIGHT ARE JUST A MADE UP STORIES. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY! NOT ALL MOVIES HAVE A MESSAGE.) This one is about love. <br/><br/>I have never read the book of New Moon or the other 1's in the Twilight Saga, but the story is good. I'm not a fan of the books but I'm fan of the movies and the lead actors (Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner, and Robert Pattinson). The reason why I loved the movie was because of the actors. They were just so good, all of them. The way they made the movie and the way the actors acted was wonderful and it felt as if they were reading the book too me. I know there were parts in the book that was not in the movie, they do that to most movies that were books anyway.<br/><br/>People had been saying that Kristen Stewart can't act. Hmmmmm. (Thinks) I wonder how she got the part of Bella? I think Kristen did well as Bella. I was wowed by her performance in New Moon and Twilight. I didn't think she could act like that, because she, in real life is different then Bella. She's a really good actress.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson was also good. I can't think of any one who could take his place as Edward. Taylor Lautner did really Well as Jacob. By Taylor's performance I felt Jacob's pain, but I wasn't wowed by it. It was fine. <br/><br/>Out of all the good characters in the Twilight Saga my favorite one is Alice! She's just so sweet and nice. She's a very good friend to Bella. Ashley Greene did well at playing her. The way they ended it, I expected it to happen like that because how else could they end it? I wasn't disappointed, even though my mom told me how it was supposed to end. Just like how Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest ended I felt happy that it was going to be another one. I don't mind waiting. <br/><br/>New Moon was good as Twilight but a just little bit better.^^ But both movies, I think are awesome!"

","Saw this movie last night and was completely disappointed. 1000 times worse than the book was I feel like i should ask the theater for my money back or at least a transaction for a decent/sub-par movie. Nothing in the movie shocked me or vaguely interested me. just a movie for some prepubescent girls, pretty much no different than vampire version of the Jonas brothers. I'm not like everyone else and gonna think that a movie is epic because a bunch of hive-mind people get all hyped up due to social networking sites. Acting was terrible, story line was terrible and obviously expected. Let down It should have been a made for TV movie that way I wouldn't have had to waste 8 bucks for something, Hell I could have had a damn good meal for that. Basically biggest letdown of the year, don't waste your money."

","Bravo Bravo Bravo Just one word: Unbelievable Congratulations to Stephanie Meyer and to the wonderful direction of Chris Weitz. I finished reading the book today at 3:30 p.m. and it met every expectation, the lines were perfect, the acting was superb, Taylor was hottt Oops did I say that!!! From the script to the acting to the beautiful scenery of Forks, Washington to the beautiful city of Italy. Everything was just amazingly accurate and breathtaking. This movie really brings out the best in Rob, Kristen and Taylor, they let their emotions fly and they were just phenomenal. I could not be a proud Twilight Fan and a true at that if someone had not encouraged me to read Twilight in the first place. I am now hooked beyond measure. I can't wait to see what Chris can do with the 3rd installment - Eclipse. This may not be a professional review, but it is a personal one. I thoroughly enjoyed myself tonight as I was captivated and kept on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to get this movie on DVD to add to my Twilight Saga collection. Again, this is a must see for anyone who believes in love and that love prevails against all odds."
"Robert_duder","7","3","8","15 January 2012"," It gets better but mostly because Pattinson is graciously absent
","After the drivel that was Twilight, I forced myself to continue to the next instalment and thank goodness it was actually better. The biggest change between this and Twilight is the action is ramped up and the special effects are so much better (though some of the CGI was just barely passable.) I honestly think that the thing that made New Moon better than the first was that this sequel focuses more on Bella and Jacob and Edward is practically gone the entire film and what a relief that is. His creepy obsessive love was never entertaining and the chemistry is far better between Stewart and Lautner than her and Pattinson.<br/><br/>Once again despite what many fans and reviewers say I don't mind Kristen Stewart in this role. I don't think the role is anything great to sink her teeth into but I think her depression of Edward leaving and her performance is decent and watchable and shows a lot of emotion. It is immature and childish but so is the entire series so that means she fits it perfectly. Taylor Lautner gets to stop up his starring role and he does okay. He's definitely better than Pattinson's performance. He still overacts and his melodramatics are annoying but he still does okay and has better chemistry with Stewart. Ashley Greene comes through in a stronger and better role than most as Alice Cullen. Robert Pattinson returns in the exact same fashion as the last film...horrible. He over acts, his melodramatics are 500 times that is necessary, and I insist he was instructed to just act terrible.<br/><br/>Director Chris Weitz takes over for directing and there is no doubt he is a much better director than Hardwicke was from the original. I think he does try and tone down the campy feel from the original but that train has already been set in motion. But more action and more scenery and even a trip to Italy to visit the Vampires makes this superior to the original and actually worth looking at. Unfortunately you have to sit through the crap that was Twilight to follow into this one. 7/10"
"kdnor2011","6","3","8","16 December 2010"," Way better than the first, but still not very good.
","I really don't see why so many people seem to think that this movie is worse than the first one. The first one was sooooo boring. Nothing happened, the characters were bland, and it was way to dramatic. Now personally, I don't care if vampires sparkle or don't eat humans, I really don't care, but couldn't you give them personality.<br/><br/>Unfortunatlly they don't give the characters much more personality in this film, but I can definitely say I liked it more. Maybe it was because I watched the first two back to back and it was just coming off on how boring the first one was, but I have to admit, I didn't hate this film. Is it good, no, but it's passable.<br/><br/>There's actually some fighting, it lightens up a little bit, and there is actually some conflict. I like the three leads in other roles they played, but they just need better direction.<br/><br/>Overall, not recommended, but if you had a choice between the first two, pick this one, at the very least you'll have fun mocking it."
"rima_d193","Null","3","8","1 December 2009"," What did u expect??!?
","I do not understand the bad comments about this movie... there was nothing to expect. I didn't read the books so i don't now what fatal misshapes did the do in this version but the movie was something like this: Our popular charming vampire realizes the danger he placed Bella in so breaks up with her. Heart-broken and miserable, she finds comfort in Jacob, who we later find out is a werewolf. Here comes the problem.. who's it gonna be?!? This movie became a tormenting yo-yo; back and forth .. back and forth. <br/><br/>The biggest set back in this movie was that it was LONG... torturing LONG so prepare yourselves!! They were stretching it so much the you can actually lose the purpose of this movie.<br/><br/>Kristan Stewart was very good, as usual, and handled the role very well. I never liked Robert as Edward and i am sure never will. If the only excuse your gonna give is that he is so handsome, dark and charming then thats pathetic because hes not. His acting is mediocre and dependent. Jacob makes you wish first if he can just cut his hair.. but when he does you will wonder if he is ever going to put a shirt on. i really wanted to see more of the Cullen family was but was disappointed. <br/><br/>We come to Micheal Sheen. He was the reason I wanted to watch this movie, just to see him as a vampire. He was WONDERFUL and very funny. and if he does not come back it would be a disaster!!<br/><br/>This movie was not a horrible downfall for me.. and I actually admire Chris Weitz and think that he although many parts were creatively done in other parts he limited or was forced to limit this creativity into something more simple.<br/><br/>I am not going to blame anyone because this movie was weak in many parts especially the soundtrack.. it was really horrible.<br/><br/>If your an adult i don't advise you to go watch it. If a teenager, don't expect anything and just watch it out of curiosity."
"djtoby","5","3","8","28 November 2009"," Fair review
","In my opinion, this movie was not well worth the wait. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie but these types of movies I refer to as ones I'd rather wait to rent it and watch it at home. To me, the movie was too jumpy on plots and you ended up losing focus on what the main focus was. After the loss of Eduard, Bella begins to have feelings for Jacob. The same time, Victoria returns to take revenge on Bella but you never get a resolution to this. Then it jumps to the return of Eduard and him trying to make the attempt to have him killed by exposing himself in public. I would say that the movie had great digital effects but lacked a storyline that really grabbed my attention. It was as if just when the romance was set to kick in It dropped right back down; there really wasn't that much action and the Collens weren't a big role in this saga. I'm hoping that the next Installment makes up for this one."
"ILuvPrincessDiaries2","4","3","8","26 November 2009"," Wish Cathrine Hardwicke had done it instead
","I knew when I went to the movie that it would NEVER be a good as the book, even though that particular book of the series was not my favorite. The first bit dragged a little and some important scenes (or what I thought important) were not there. The last half where I thought they would spend the majority of the movie, in Volterra was rushed. They sped through, not in keeping with the book as Edward never fought the volturi.I understand when transferring a book to a movie some things you have to change to make the movie move a little faster and such. But somethings were just odd how they worded and did them. Unnecessarily changing some scenes that kinda ruin some bits for the next movie. Like in that one scene near the end when Jacob came over to remind Edward of the treaty, in the book Bella tells him it's none of his business. So at the point in time he doesn't realize that she is going to become a vampire. In the next book when he comes to find out, it sets some things in motion.<br/><br/>The music score for this movie disappointed me. Cause I actually don't even remember there being any. In the first movie music plays a big part I think, to get the right setting. <br/><br/>Also the person who helped the cast with acting should be drug out into the streets and shot. Most of the lines were said just as if they had read them for the first time and had no time to put any emotion or feeling into their words. Robert Pattinson did a not too bad job, but Taylor Lautner (whom i love do not get me wrong), when he was trying to be all mad and stuff, it didn't sound right at all. And Kristen Stewart never had any emotion. Bella isn't nearly as dead in the books as she is in the movie. <br/><br/>My conclusion? Chris Weitz did a shoddy job with this production, and I'm glad he's not doing the next one. Because it's one of my favorite's and if he ruined it too, I would probably do something very bad to him"
"kirstylee2503","5","3","8","23 November 2009"," Better than Twilight, but still not great!
","I have read all the Twilight books and fell in love with the characters and the town of Forks! I watched Twilight on DVD just last week and was disappointed overall with the acting and the storyline itself! Having seen the trailer for New Moon, my hopes went up as it looked much more entertaining than Twilight. It was. The movie itself is overall much better than Twilight. However, the acting of the two main characters has not improved and the storyline was again cropped and many significant lines and scenes were not included. The first half of the film plods along relatively similar to the book except for the whole class watching Romeo and Juliet, and Edward and Bella discussing The Volturri during this at a volume I've seen few get away with in a classroom especially since half the class could have heard what they were talking about. We miss the grand entrance to Bella's birthday party at the Cullens with the pink flowers etc and I thought Robert Pattinson failed to act with the passion I expected Edward to have during the scene where Bella cuts here finger. Also I've yet to see in either film the firm friendship between Alice and Bella that we have come to expect from the stories. As we go along in the movie after Edward has left Bella, we follow Jacob and Bella's building relationship as we would in the book. The acting again was not excellent but was believable; however, I felt they included far too much of this in order to cut scenes from the last half of the film. It was the last half of the film that disappointed me the most. There were several important scenes from the book left out or cut to such a point where they became insignificant. The scene where Alice arrives back, again lacked the firm friendship and Bella's relief describe in the book. This scene is shortened dramatically from the book, with Alice arriving and Bella living with Alice to save Edward in the space of five minutes. No overnight, no Charlie leaving for the funeral, and no pretense of Jacob believing Carlisle was calling, instead of Edward. Alice never calls Rosalie to find out she has told Edward 'Bella died' which, if you hadn't read the book, would leave you wondering how Edward knew Bella had 'died'. The best line of the movie is included here when Alice tells Bella she will return 'when you've put the dog out'. From here though, we lose the book almost altogether and scenes I considered important in the book are left out or changed altogether. The Volturri live in a very flash looking Castle and we do not get the 'dungeon' feel, walking under the streets from the book. Bella and Edward discuss their love when she stops him in a scene I did not really believe. The fight scene with the Edward and Demetri was not written in the book, and I'm not sure why the changed this for the movie instead of following the book. When Aro listens to Alice's thoughts, I was again disappointed with this scene. From there we are rushed back to Bella in her bed in Forks. We lose them flying back, Rosalie asking for forgiveness, Charlie yelling at Edward, and Bella waking up and talking to Edward. I believed this was an important part of the book, but we are not shown this in the movie. For some reason the director has chosen to leave out or shorten valuable moments from the book and therefore the second half of the film is rushed. In the movie when Bella wakes up, Edward is sitting at the end of the bed. He is not lying next to her and the scene in her bedroom in the movie doesn't convey the need for forgiveness and love from the book. The scene that follows at the Cullen's house where they vote to keep Bella does not echo the sincerity and love the Cullens feel for Bella when they vote in the book. And the final scene is terrible, putting the scene in Bella's room after the vote and the Epilogue of the book together to create a loss of important moments and a scene of terrible acting. The proposal from Edward to Bella after seeing Jacob does not ring true and the lack of passion is what we have come to expect from the lead actors in the movie. I think this is what I miss most from the books. The acting between Rob and Kristin is awkward. He rarely looks at Bella when talking to her and I get the feeling he would rather be anywhere else, instead of the fact he is suppose to love her more than anything in the world. We do not see the scenes in Bella's bedroom where they lie together in her bed and I never feel the overwhelming love and need for each other than we feel through reading the books, and the lack of discussion about Bella becoming a vampire leads one to wonder if it will ever really happen. The acting of Emmett and Jessica has to be the best, and most true to the book, in the whole movie. They have been cast perfectly. I can't help but wonder if this film would be better if there were other actors playing the lead roles, perhaps Ashley Greene should have been cast as Bella to give her the chance to express the acting talent she briefly shows. As a fan of the Twilight books, I would love to see the lead actors portraying the love we have all grown to love and believe in, and I am always left disappointed."
"Queen_oogabooga","8","3","8","22 November 2009"," Pleasantly Surprised.
","I'd like to begin by saying, I am by no means a rabid Twilight fan. I felt that the first film, while somewhat entertaining, wasn't terribly good, mostly due to the Directorial style of Catherine Hardwick. However when I entered the theatre for New Moon, I tried to keep an open mind.<br/><br/>I was blown away by how different this film was as compared to the first. While the first movie was choppy, shot almost exclusively in blue tones, and had a painfully odd and out-of-place soundtrack, I felt that New Moon flowed smoothly, and was pleasing to the eye with it's gold tones. A more Indie-rock based soundtrack, and more tasteful score left me hungering to buy the soundtrack.<br/><br/>I also found better acting, where instead of swallowing there lines and over acting the teen angst (as was in Twilight) they took a more playful and classic approach to the script. And I found myself laughing through the whole film, at the much more humorous approach to the story.<br/><br/>I felt that without the Twilight name on it, this film still would have held it's own in the box office simply because it was an entertaining and well made film. Sure it was corny, silly, occasionally showing the fact that it was made from a plot-hole-laced, under-developed, badly characterized novel. But, on the whole, I quite enjoyed it. And I plan to recommend it to all of my friends.<br/><br/>8 out of ten stars is entirely warranted, I think."
"jshaw3-589-568310","9","3","8","22 November 2009"," Were we all expecting an Oscar worthy performance? Really?
","I'm really disappointed that SO many people are upset with this movie because of the acting or the movie elements. I mean come on people, this is a book series about teenagers in love (vampires or not) and how many movies exist out there about teenagers in love that have given Oscar worthy performances on huge budgets with outstanding movie elements like special effects? I loved the movie, because it was true to the book. I don't care what you all think, I just hope that the production company doesn't decide to give up and not make the rest of the movies because of the way you all are reacting. The actors did a great job of being awkward because that's how the book portrayed them!! They were supposed to be awkward! Stephanie Meyer wrote over and over how awkward Bella was and how awkward she felt around the Cullens because they were so beautiful and graceful. So if you all who claim to have read the books actually read them you would know that. Kristen and Rob aren't the best actors in the world, but they did a great job of being awkward, and Rob did a much better job in this movie of showing us how hard it was for Edward to be close to Bella out of fear of hurting her (oh, but you would know that too if you'd really read the books). I don't think the intent of making the books into movies was to have Oscar worthy acting and cinematics, I think it was to put the story on screen for those of us that really enjoyed and missed the characters from the books. So let it be what it is, a chance to see on screen what we so loved on the page."
"manderjean90","7","3","8","22 November 2009"," New Moon Movie > Twilight Movie
","As an avid reader of young adult literature, I have read and reread the Twilight Series numerous times. I can accurately recount the books with their canon and plot-minded intentions while letting the minor details slip away. The Twilight movie disregarded many major plots elements and was capped off with 'craptastic' acting. I believe that Robert Pattison's horrible American accent imitation distracted me from paying attention, Kristin Stewart once again proved her dismal ability to act and overall the extremest ideals placed on how much each actor looks like their book description was a slight to the book. However my un-enthusiasm upon seeing the New Moon movie was forgotten as the film began. New Moon took me and my misconceptions about the ability to reproduce literature on the big screen by surprise. Without a doubt, New Moon is ten times better than Twilight and that doesn't even scratch the surface of the comparable aspects between the two films. Firstly I felt that the New Moon movie retained the intention of the book. I felt that I was retold the story with feasible expectations because of the time limit standardized by most popular cinema. The sub-par acting was less noticeable. The extra effects used in the actions scenes were done with canon-esquire attention to detail. In my opinion the New Moon movie made up for the disaster of the Twilight movie in ten fold. Chris Weitz did a splendid job, Sorry Catherine Hardwicke, you've been outdone."

Now if you feel the same about the first movie, if you felt it an alright movie or an enjoyable movie like I did then go see this movie, New Moon is better then Twilight in every way. The action scenes are beautiful, and the love shown in the movie made me kind of jealous (Yes I'm a straight male, but still.. ha) Anyway I'll just leave it at that, if you found Twilight enjoyable or interesting go see it, if you hated Twilight then don't bother :]"

I don't conform to the mainstream, but I still thought this movie was really entertaining. I mean sure, the acting was bad at times, but that was mainly just Robert Patinson. The story was fast paced and was very interesting. Plus the action was pretty cool with the wolves and vampires. It also had some very funny scenes. But it also has it's share of corny and awkward scenes. (Jacob taking his shirt off to wipe Bella's forehead) The only thing I really didn't like was the fact hat the theater was filled with hundreds of screaming<br/><br/>girls age 11-13.But it's definitely worth seeing.

"Wanda40","9","3","8","21 November 2009"," New Moon .... the better Twilight movie
","I went to this movie having read the books multiple times and having been less than satisfied by the first film. Chris Weitz and Melissa Rosenberg have done a wonderful job bringing this new chapter of the Twilight Saga to the cinematic screen. This movie was more the interpretation of the book that many of us were looking for the first time around. I'm not saying there weren't new things added. In fact, the elements that were incorporated gave insight to things you may have been wondering about or thought might have gone differently in the novel. I didn't find any of it negative. <br/><br/>The actors have also become more of their characters. The awkwardness the reader sensed in the books is brought to the screen and is indicative of the roles they portray. I was glad to see so much growth from all of the players.<br/><br/>My one issue with the film was the pop music. These songs were often distracting and reminded me of heavy metal Sesame Street. On the flip side, the instrumental score by Alexandre Desplat was one of the most positive changes between the first two films. The themes were tender, well written and complimented the scenes well.<br/><br/>In short, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good interpretation of the book. You will not be disappointed."

","Want a quick summary. Don't go wasting money on this sh?t-Bomb. Don't even think about it. Go and see Zombieland when that comes out, something that is actually entertaining.<br/><br/>Now for the review Don't get me wrong, I read the books (seems mandatory to say that in a review for this abomination), I saw the first movie and enjoyed it but this is just terrible. This movie does not commit to telling a good story at all its just about having Taylor/Jacob running around looking like a male stripper, half naked throughout most of the movie. This movie is ONLY made for girls. Older women who are getting attracted to Taylor, seriously the guy is 16 you are pathetic.<br/><br/>I know I have talked about Jacob a lot now but seriously that is all this movie has going for it. The convincing and enjoyable love story between Edward and Bella from the first movie is completing absent here and instead feels fake and annoying. There was a scene (SPOILER) where Alice shows Arro Bella's vampire future. The scene shows Edward and Bella wearing while cloths running through a forest together, leaping I could say....WHAT THE HELL. This scene was stupid and felt more funny then serious. This entire movie tries so hard to be serious be with scenes like this, anybody could be forgiven for thinking it was pure comedy, but it wasn't.<br/><br/>Most reviews on IMDb at the moment which are positive are from young women and yes this movie was made FOR THEM ONLY so I can understand why they are so happy with it. For all those people who read the books and saw the first movie, stick to the book for the real and most powerful New Moon experience and avoid the movie you will be happier in the long run."

You're going to enjoy it, I'm sure of it.""<br/><br/>God, did I laugh.<br/><br/>However, they were being serious with this little outing, which means I have to grade this as though it were an actual film. Sadly, with a shoddy plot, crappy dialogue, unbelievably silly message, and HORRIBLE, stilted acting, I can't do anything but give this a 2/10.<br/><br/>It gets that extra bonus star because Robert Pattinson actually really doesn't like the Twilight books, and in fact thinks the whole story is teenage schlick-flick drivel. Every time he looked directly at the camera and delivered a wooden, dragged-out ""I couldn't live without you, Bella,"" I felt like he was really telling me, ""Greg, people really paid me money for this.

","I call this a review from the middle because i am neither one of the legions of twi-hards or one of the people who hate the series without reason. Yes i have read the novels but i actually found Stephanie Meyer to lack writing ability, although i still found the books enjoyable Personally for me this movie was better than Twilight, which i gave 6/10. Of the actors in the film i feel Kristen Stewart does very well in playing Bella in the darkest part of her life where she is abandoned by Edward, and Robert Pattinson also does well despite his lack of screen time. I also feel Ashley Greene is fantastically cast as Alice.<br/><br/>My only problems with this movie really are Taylor Lautner as Jacob and the lack of fangs on the vampires. Firstly Lautner may be a very attractive guy, but his acting ability is almost non-existent, I hadn't noticed in the first film as his screen time was minimal but once he takes centre stage it becomes clear he is out of his depth here. The lack of fangs on vampires annoys me as this is the most famous feature of a vampire, right back to Bram Stoker's Dracula, and in having them missing to me we are just watching sparkly people, not real Vampires.<br/><br/>Overall however i thought the movie was entertaining, but expect Eclipse to be the peak of the series.<br/><br/>7/10"
"khae1031","10","8","33","20 November 2009"," fit the book
","Chris Weitz did a great job especially with the effects, this film was so much closer to the book then twilight was which made a huge difference for me. i thought it was well worth it to pay to go see it even with a few screaming girls. the wolves looked a lot better in the movie then they did in the previews and honestly they looked great for what they're supposed to be if you read the books. there were of course a few things added into the movie to make it more interesting to people who haven't read the books but overall i don't think they hurt the movie at all. some scenes were changed but you have to expect that, they cannot make it exactly like the novel, if you read the books you have to realize it would take a lot of money and be quite difficult to make these movies identical to them. overall i thought the emotion conveyed was perfect, i felt the same emotions that i did while reading the book which is pretty much what you'd want to happen while watching a visual representation of a book you love. for anyone who loves the books, you should love the movie."
"mornamsnt","5","8","33","20 November 2009"," Better than Twilight
","I really didn't like the second book because of all the drama and depressing thoughts and all that. But the movie was quite good actually. The acting was much better than in Twilight. Especially Kirsten did a better job (I really didn't like her acting in Twilight :)). The movie spent only a little on Bella's pain, but more on Jacob. Also, there was more action. I can't recall Harry being caught by Victoria, but it did look good in the movie. The Volturi-part could've been better. The fight was not only unnecessary, but it also completely ruins the image of the Volturi as peace loving and of Aro wanting Bella & Alice for himself because of their talents. Which is quiet important with regard to Breaking Dawn. About those not-sticking-to-the-book parts some of the people complain about: it's a movie. It's not the same as the book. It's based on the book. There's a difference between those two things. Yeah, some things were changed, but it did make the movie better. Also about the cliffhanger: I loved it. It's a much better ending for a movie than the talk between Jacob and Edward in the book. The only thing is it's too bad Jacob didn't give Charlie Bella's bike because it does play a part in the third book. Overall: a movie very much worth watching. It's not a masterpiece, which to my opinion a fantasy movie rarely is, but the fans should be more than content."
"kathiasousa","10","4","13","28 November 2009"," Step Aside, Harry Potter!
",".. And that's saying something cos i'm a huge Potter fan (before the last disaster). New Moon was definitely a huge improvement on Twilight, which I had to fight to stay awake for the second time around. The acting is a whole lot better than the series of awkward ""ummms"" and ""err""s we had to endure through Twilight and even Edward seems like he's getting a little closer to being the deep, 100 year old man he's supposed to be. All the Cullens look more believable with the new contact lenses and the scene with Bella looking up to 5 Ravenous vampires at the beginning completely brought that line from the book to life. In fact, David Yates could learn a few things from Chris about how to bring out the best of book! The Wolves were fantastic, and Jacob's part was heart wrenching cos there was finally some real emotion in the series. Bella could do with expanding on her limited expressions though. The Volturi's were excellent and the fight scene took the movie up several notches! The vision Alice shares of Edward and Bella running through the woods is extremely lame, but Aro, Marcus, Caius, and Jane are perfectly cast. I cant wait to see them in action again! Overall, this movie actually took a dull book and turned it into an exciting story and for that Chris deserves a lot of credit!"

","Loved it, loved it, loved it! I'm TE all the way, but I have to say that Jacob did a fantastic job in his role. He appeared young, then older and furious and then gentle and sad. Bella had some work done on her make-up and hair this time around. She looked much more alive; maybe it was the smiles because of Jacob. Edward, ah poor Edward...he was so sad and then so protective. Loved it! I didn't care for the upgraded hazel eyes for the Cullens, but I did like the more natural look of Rosalie and Esme. Didn't care much for Jasper's hair..sorta scary.<br/><br/>They did a great job following the book and syncing it all together - kudos!

","New Moon. So different to twilight.Loved the music, the camera angles, EVERYTHING. If you're not doing anything interesting now... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! Go ahead an buy your tickets NOW! There are so many things that aren't show in the book, so many scenes that I'm sure would give you lots of satisfaction. New Moon...more than five times better than twilight. If the first one disappointed you, THIS WILL BRING YOU BACK. 100% Recomendated. New Moon its definitely a great movie...the most interesting part is the ending...i loved it and cant wait till eclipse! New Moon has lots of action, its so much better than twilight, one of the scenes i most-liked was the time that Bella is upset because of Edward. Totally recommended. Watch it NOW!"
"vegasmom28","9","5","18","20 November 2009"," I loved it.
","I cannot believe all the negative reviews. They must be all from men. I would not expect most men to like this movie. Twilight is NOT your typical vampire movie and that is exactly why I like it. It's ""outside the box"". It doesn't follow the traditional vampire rules. It's unique. But it's not for everyone.If you do not like romance you will not like this movie, because it is primarily a love story. DUH! I'm not sure why you would bother to go and see a romance if you hate that sort of thing! I was extremely happy with New Moon. It was 10 times better than Twilight. I thought it made twilight look like a very low budget film. The action was better, the cinematography was better, everyone had more personality, there was lot of humor and they stuck to the story. I was very pleased. The wolves were amazing! If you are a true fan you will not be disappointed."
"mackinley735","10","3","9","29 March 2010"," Big improvement!
","I was so pleased with this movie, I was crying with satisfaction. Literally. It followed the book very well and had beautiful music and was just great. EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!! The only flaw in this very amazing movie is the actors. Edward improved, but I still don't see the burning passion in his eyes when he sees Bella under the clock tower or when he asks her to marry him. Kristen is just bad. I expected this. She's not as terrible as she was in the first one though.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner. Taylor, Taylor, Taylor. I'll admit, I'm a sucker for his rock hard abs. I squealed along with everyone else when he had his shirt off. But the boy cannot act to save his life. It's like a paper bag trying to act! He cannot get out of that paper bag! He's trying, but he's DEFINITELY not succeeding.<br/><br/>CGI did an alright job with the wolves. They weren't jaw-dropping amazing, but they were okay. Chris Weitz was fabulous as always. I just wish there was more chemistry between the characters. And Dakota Fanning was a dull character. I know that's how Jane is, but it still bugs me. She's like a robot.<br/><br/>All in all, it was amazing and I am excited for Eclipse to come out. I would highly recommend this to Twilight fans as well as non-Twilighters. It was a wonderful adaption of the book and exceeded my expectations by infinity! Two thumbs up!"
"anveshloke-1","5","3","9","22 November 2009"," Movie - Below Average ! [ Pros and Cons ]
","Just watched this highly anticipated movie. Here I would like to give a few pros and cons for the movie.<br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/>1 > Ashley Greene [ Alice ] looks stunning and is the only good thing which I honestly liked in the movie.<br/><br/>2 > Michael Sheen also acted pretty well . Too bad he was just included in the last 20 minutes of the movie. <br/><br/>Cons : 1 > Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart - Well I honestly didn't find any chemistry between them in this movie. They were poorly characterized and made the movie boring. <br/><br/>2 > Taylor Lautner - Well he has got many scenes in this movie - And all the scenes he was without his T Shirt [ For Girls ]. First of all he looked like some gay model instead of an actor . The way he acted - well he was poor but he was better than the lead pair. <br/><br/>3 > Direction : Well to be honest , he is the main person responsible in making the movie dull . No innovation - nothing !Some very poorly directed scenes with not so good actors <br/><br/>4 > Script - I know the story is based on a novel. But the script and its execution was very very poor . I mean the writers get paid right - Even a 15 year old Twilight Series fan would write a better script than the one in the movie. <br/><br/>So in all I have rated the movie a 5 - Thanks to the great story by Stephenie Meyer.<br/><br/>PS : Would request the fans to think before they vote - The movie does not deserve a big 0 nor does it deserve a 10 ~"
"bloodlust68","8","3","9","22 November 2009"," For those who read the book it can not be bad, so WTF so bad rating...
","First of all i am a male , in middle age , definitely not gay , and love all what have to do with vampire and werewolves.I read first two books , and i don't know why so much so bad reviews about New moon.It follows the book precisely , all actors were very good especially Taylor.CGI was Top , Wolves are eye candy , so was make up , especially Rob's that explained why he looked so down at Voltury.He didn't feed for days , he left himself go , he wanted to die - so...It was all in the book.I recommend all haters to read the book before they post so devastating votes and reviews.I enjoy the Saga , i enjoyed both films and surely i shell see New moon several times again.Congratuations to all involved in this movie.Just keep the quality at that level , no matter what haters might write or how they vote.Thank you very much for such bright film experience."
"the_hype01","5","3","9","21 November 2009"," What a Marshmallow! Uhhh....I'm coming......I don't want you to come....
","Are just some of the corny lines that are delivered in this second masterpiece installment of the Twilight Saga. I think it's fair to say that it's okay to like this movie, everyone has their opinions, but here's mine. I didn't mind this movie at all, in fact I thought it was very unintentionally funny! But the difference between myself and others like me verses some die-hard ignore quality people, is that I enjoyed this movie, but still know that the production quality lacked, the dialog was horrible and overall, it was pretty sh*t....<br/><br/>Wanna she Kristen Stewart act? You won't find it here. Maybe it's the source material she had to work with. Go watch her in 'Speak' or 'The Cake Eaters' she is a phenomenal actress (I've been a fan of hers ever since I saw her in 'Cold Creek Manor' back in the day, I always knew that little tomboy would be hot one day!). As for Rob, Taylor, Ashley and the others they know their part was just to stand there and look pretty. I'm sure, they do have talent, but it won't be shown here, rather their beauty did most of the work. Even esteemed actors Michael Sheen (the 'Lycan' in 'Underworld', and his Oscar nominated role in Frost/Nixon) and Dakota Fanning couldn't display their acting chops, probably again because of the source material.<br/><br/>There's no reason for the dialog to come off that cheesy, unless of course it was intentional. Now I know why Catherine Hardwicke wanted to spend more time going over the script, instead of being hushed to make this. That's probably why she was replaced. Can you imagine the executives at Summit rushing out is sh*t-tackler film, what the next one is gonna be like? Not only was the script probably done in less time, but the fact that it's already done filming. Hopefully, the third will be better, but I didn't think the second was better than the first.........<br/><br/>Production wise, I feel like a little more money should be spent to touching up the special effects. Summit knows it's gonna make a ton of money, either way. Why not put a little more into it? For the sake of the film as art.<br/><br/>These films could be much better I believe, if a little more time was spend on QA control (revisions/time spent on the script, special effects etc.).....<br/><br/>But nonetheless, it was fun to laugh and enjoy the film for the wrong reasons. No, this is not the worst movie I've seen this year.......that honor goes to 'The Fourth Kind'.....Now that pasty face (supposed real life Dr. Abigail Tyler) is more frightening then any vampire or werewolf in this film!"
"maganedinger","5","3","9","21 November 2009"," Not Worth the Wait
","Throughout this movie I felt like I was at a strip club. Every time Edward or Jakob appeared on screen all of the girls would scream. It was apparent that they were there because the guys are hot, not for their acting ability. I have been a fan of vampire films all of my life. I also love romantic movies. The film shows very little vampire related content and the romances are awkward. It is very slow moving and the acting seems awkward and not developed in parts. The best part of the movie for me was the last half hour or so. The wolves were cool. I spent most of this movie hoping it was almost over. From the start it dragged. I was hoping to see more of the Volturi and Dakota Fanning. I wish I just would of waited for it to come out on DVD."
"rits_rasmus","5","2","5","11 December 2009"," Agreed It Was Bad...
","Well,a lot of things that have been posted above are ""supposedly"" true...lack of acting skills,dialogue delivery,poor expressions etc.etc... Bella can't act, even after doing a few movies.(read:few seconds in ""Jumper and a movie called Messengers and so on."").Her expressions ARE lame.etc etc. DUDE! give her a break..I can bet if she looked as good as Megan Fox no one wud give a damn about how she acted...n there'd be more guys watching twilight than girls.I mean..most actresses can't really pull off a Julia Roberts or a Meryl Streep!(Well,they re my favorites!).N thats besides the point.Shes young,smart and tries he best to act....she just landed a role which required more depth and subtlety than what she could deliver.Is she a poor actress? time will tell.It's too early to say she s a bad actress.As far as I'm concerned.Yes,it was'not up to the mark(her acting)..but we all have put her into Bella's character by now and she's all we've got for the next two movies.I hope she learns...and will learn and try her best to smash her critics in the next one. I think she's got style and a lot of time on her hands to mature..like the transition from converses to designer gowns.I guess she'll hang around for a while..maybe it's just wishful thinking,but then,I like her somehow.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson.I must say,if he wasn't there...the twilight saga could'not have gone on.I mean it was because of him that legions of fans all over the world started adoring twilight , went on to new moon ..and so on. He's incredibly hot and I would use a million other adjectives but they wouldn't fit here.Am I smitten? Well fans all across the world are.and Twilight was definitely riding on his good looks (like New Moon is on Taylor Lautner's defined 6 pecs!)as there was nothing else to offer besides bad acting,poor dialogue delivery etc .etc...Once I got over the whole ""Oh hes so handsome"" phobia I realized he couldn't act that well , had weird expressions n it was a very average movie (new moon was way better).But I heard in an interview that hes ""Learning to act on the job""..well people..don't u think if millions of fans have noticed their poor acting,then they definitely have and obviously don't want to be cast away so soon so they must be doing something about it?? Well I really found him hot ever since Harry Potter..I hope he hangs in there for a few years thanks to his good looks and then goes on to become a better actor and lands better roles (Hopefully in Rom-Coms or something!)<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner. Wow . what a body!! people kept saying its fake.But thats just to console themselves that their girlfriends won't run away from them.He looks hot too, and wow with the whole team jacob team edward thing,I guess mortal guys are having a hard time.Well I hated Jacob Black*(the character) for some odd reason..I guess I always thought he was the guy who was confusing Bella n ruining the eternal love story.Well I kinda liked him in the movie.Cute,Warm and Adorable.Acting?? he didn't have many dialogs..but i thought he was better than the other two.<br/><br/>All in all.I'd like to tell people not to give up on this Saga so easily.Another thing is that in all Book Adaptations I've always noticed that the book is way better(LOTR ,HP) ..so stop comparing and talking about missing plots..everyone in the movie hall with u has already read it...so much for holes!<br/><br/>Well I'd like to give it 5 stars."

I'm sticking up for all of the ladies out there that just like to enjoy a movie not whether Bella has filled out her FAFSA or not. Jeez. I don't think that half the girls that are going to see this movie are even thinking about college at the moment. Cant someone go to the movies, a completely fake huge fiction movie at that, and just enjoy it without their parents saying ""oh don't be like Bella she wasn't thinking about the future when she almost gave her life for Edward."" it's a story lady. come on."
"whatever_123","4","4","14","30 November 2009"," An improvement??
","I'm thinking that the ratings were a little harsh for this movie. It wasn't great, but at least it improved from Twilight. But still, much of this movie was completely illogical, and it screwed up (less than Twilight, but still screwed up) some of the scenes in the book.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart STILL can't seem to express any type of emotion even if her life depended on it. Robert Pattinson's acting was also a bit questionable, but I could see a small improvement from the first movie.<br/><br/>One of the scenes between Edward and Bella still bothers me to this day. This is the scene when Edward dumps Bella, because apparently, even though he is COMPLETELY IN LOVE with her, he still thinks he is ""unhealthy"" for her and says he has to leave. While Edward talks in a harsher tone than I imagined when I read the book, Bella acts ""devestated,"" or rather starts breathing heavily and asks him why he is leaving. What really bothered me was the heavy breathing. What, was she smoking?? I suppose Kristen Stewart thought that when a normal person is actually experiencing an intense feeling of loss, they stand around awkwardly and breathe heavily.<br/><br/>The only good actor in this movie was Taylor Lautner. He really is amazing, he gets into his character, and you can feel his sadness, and his pain. He outshines Kristin Stewart's acting by a THOUSAND times. The scenes with just him and her are awkward, in the way that he is so much better at having feelings than her, and the times where they almost kiss were just plain weird. Like Edward, Jacob is this amazing guy (who happens to be a werewolf, ANOTHER mythical character) and he just falls for Bella for no reason. Again, Bella has NO PERSONALITY. What right does she have to get these guys, when she has nothing to offer them in return? It doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>While the special effects were improved from the last movie, the fight scenes were mildly exciting, but were not memorable. What were the fight scenes again? Oh yeah, the meadow with Laurent, the werewolves chasing Vicotria, and the pointless fight between Edward and one of the Volturi. What was that about? <br/><br/>One last scene that made me think ""what the..."" was when Aro, the Volturi leader asks Alice what she saw in Bella's future. The screen then shows Bella and Edward running (more like frolicking) through the forest, the sun sparkly on their skin. Bottom line, it was a very gay scene.<br/><br/>Like the last movie, this movie had very few redeeming qualities. The only ones were Taylor Lautner's acting and the scenes when his shirt was off. Other than that, it was kind of not great."

","This movie, as with the first, encourages women to be promiscuous. This is a terrible movie, and you are a terrible person if you enjoy it. If you like vampire movies or werewolf movies, there are plenty of better ones out there. If you like romance movies, I'm sure there are plenty of betters ones out there as well. To put it bluntly, Bella is a whore. The sad thing is that little girls will watch this movie, and think that this is normal behavior and they will behave this way as well when they grow up. If you let your kids watch this, you are a terrible parent. This movie, is nothing but porn for women. Don't be mad next time you see a man using you as nothing more than a sex object, because stupid movies like this encourage that type of behavior."

Twilight: New Moon, so I'm there right now at a 00:05am premier on Thursday morning and the opening credits are starting to roll, it looks like it's going to be a great sequel, I shall continue. We have the gorgeous Kristen Stewart playing the lovely Bella Swan and Robert Pattinson playing the quiet Edward Cullen but then finally let's not forget Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black. So I'm going to watch the rest of the film but will continue my review when I leave the screening room. So the film just finished and I just have to say the acting in this film compared to the acting in the first film was great, the story drags you in and makes you wonder what's going to happen next but in all it lives up to the expectations of the books. The visual effects in the film are amazing and to add to that the music has considerably been tweaked and now resembles that of a great soundtrack, some familiar songs you may just recognise. To finish this review I'm going to leave you with a simple line from Edward Cullen, oh no. only joking I can't do that because then I'd spoil the film for you but trust me the ending will leave you wanting more!"

The scenes with the vampires were cool. The scenes with the wolves were also cool. And the scenery of the film locale was breathtaking, just like the first movie. The characters were more complex, just like in the book, and it made you want to know more. I highly recommend that everyone read the books first. But even if you don't, go see the movie.

"BBallDude1780","8","3","10","20 November 2009"," Could it be?!? A moderate Twilight fan...?
","I'll let you be the judge. I just felt like an opinion somewhere in the middle needed to be shown for the people curious about the movie, but without strong feelings either way.<br/><br/>The people sick of twilight will hate it, the fangirls will love it.<br/><br/>For the independents: A decent teen romance with a supernatural aspect. Is the dialogue cheesy at times? No question. Like the previous movie, are many scenes composed entirely of silent eye contact? For certain. Can the melodrama be overpowering at times? Wouldn't be Twilight if it wasn't.<br/><br/>I am a 21 year old male, whose girlfriends roommate made me curious enough to read the books. I hadn't read a fantasy series in a while, and it was refreshing to get lost in a world of sparkly vampires and teenage werewolves. A nice break from my engineering homework. I was interested to see how they would translate to film. The first was very mediocre, with goofy writing and sometimes bad delivery, but I felt they got the setting right.<br/><br/>As for New Moon: I gave it an 8 purely on the basis that it was faithful to the book, through and through. The new characters (Volturi, wolves, etc) were perfectly cast and fit right in. Fans of the book, you can stop reading now, in my opinion you will like the movie. It was truly a movie for the fans, as many small details from the book were included. The main departure, Bella seeing visions of Edward instead of merely hearing his voice, made perfect cinematic sense. The soundtrack is a bit jarring at first, as many of the songs in the background are very distinct, and it almost feels like a montage should be happening for much of the movie. But as the movie progressed, the song choice grew on me. I have read some complaints about the CGI, but for me they proved to be unfounded. The wolves were fine, and the vampire fights/effects were much improved from the first movie.<br/><br/>As for dialogue and acting. I like Kristen, especially liked her in Adventureland, so I'm biased there. Pattinson was a bit too monotone for me at times, but as he's playing a vampire, it makes sense he would error in the lack-of-emotions direction. Lautner of course had a very larger role in New Moon, and for the most part he rose to the occasion. As stated before all new characters played their parts well. The only complaint I really had is that at a few key points, mainly the climax in Italy, the plot is moved along very quickly. When Bella decides to go, there is a shot of the plane, an exterior shot of the yellow Porsche, and they arrive. I would have liked to see a little more dialogue/background info to move the plot along.<br/><br/>All in all I got what I went to see, that is, a very accurate portrayal of New Moon the book. From a purely cinematic perspective, there were not any major flaws that would kill the movie for a casual viewer. Either you like the characters and storyline or you do not."
"lisalamy1","8","5","21","20 November 2009"," I don't know what everyone is complaining about - LOVED IT
","I came to this site this morning to see what other people thought of this movie. I am 34 years old and must admit that I am a Twilight lover. I am not a tween in love with the vampire or the werewolves but rather a grown up in love with the story. I saw the first Twilight before reading the books and then read the whole series, twice. New Moon was not my favorite of the books but I thought the movie was great. In my opinion it was better than the first. It surely looked like it had a better budget, the special effects were much better. The fight seems were more real and the transformation of the wolves was very well done. Some commented on the eyes of the Cullen's being distracting in this movie; well, if you read the books, they eyes are meant to be distracting. They awe people with their eyes in the book. I thought that feature was much better. The vampires did stand out more in this movie, they were paler, the eyes more vivid but again, the book always stated that they stood out and looked obviously different. In the first movie they did not look that way to me.<br/><br/>As for the story with Jacob; I was always a ""team Edward"" individual based on the book. I was often bored with the Jacob parts when reading BUT the movie changed my opinion on that. I was actually wanting them to kiss. When I read the book I wanted her to slap him. The movies stayed serious and true to the book but also added little one-liners that made you chuckle and enjoy the film.<br/><br/>When people complain about the acting, well I guess I can agree that they will probably not win Academy Awards but I thought they all did a great job. This is not Romeo and Juliet or some classic novel brought to film. It was an enjoyable, easy read, teen focused series brought to film. To me, Twilight was an escape from the everyday. An enjoyable love story and mindless entertainment. It just makes you feel good while entertaining at the same time. For those looking for classic, award winning quality kind of a movie, I guess this is not it. For the Twilight fan or someone just looking for a moment to escape and enjoy some entertainment, the movie was great.<br/><br/>It did a good job filling in some of the gaps that might not of been relayed in the book like how Harry Clearwater dies from his heart attack. It also shows some good behind the reading scenes like those of Victoria searching for Bella or when Edward thinks Bella is dead. Those were not really scripted in the book because they were beyond Bella's knowledge of conscious. I have read the book multiple times so I was able to follow some of the quick movements from one scene to the other. I do not know how it would be for someone who did not know the story. I guess I will see. I plan on taking my husband and he has not read the books but enjoyed the first Twilight.<br/><br/>I give it 8 stars. They have two more books/movies to get through to perfect the film depiction of the story. The second was better than the first and I have high expectations that it will continue to improve with each one, as the characters fall into themselves more and become more experienced and comfortable with the roles. The acting is good, not great... some room for improvement. The flow was a little choppy but they did an excellent job of covering most of the important points and staying true to the book.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved it. I plan on seeing it again with my children and husband while it is still in the theater and will be waiting in line to purchase it on DVD."
"queenbee1326","9","4","16","20 November 2009"," Definitely better than Twilight!
","I personally loved this movie. I thought it was 10 times better than Twilight. I told myself I would never be one of ""those Twilight girls"" but I totally am and I'm not ashamed to say it. :) Granted, there were a few scenes that were a little silly but they didn't take away from the movie itself. I loved the music but wished that ""Satellite Heart"" was played more than just the one scene. The emotions were really flowing in this sequel... The women next to me were actually sobbing! Granted, I didn't shed any tears but this movie tugged on the heart strings a little more than Twilight with the whole Bella/Jacob thing. I thought this movie was great and I can't wait to see what's in store for Eclipse and Breaking Dawn."

","In my honest first impression, I think Twilight Saga: New Moon, is far better than the first installment in this series. The script have been improve from being weak and boring to more articulate and memorable. <br/><br/>Actually, I don't have any high hopes on this sequel, at first, but with involvement of more great actors, from Volturi to Wolfpack, all giving me some encouragement to go see it.<br/><br/>Worth watching second, third or maybe forth times in my opinion, and surely could wins more award this times around.<br/><br/>But why with the low rating? It beyond anybody control by the way. Everybody is free to give rating. But for me it 5/10."
"blogandsqualor","8","3","11","20 December 2009"," Just Have Fun
","Let's establish some things first. I have Twilight cred. I have read all of the books, and totally loved and appreciated the first one, and mostly enjoyed the remaining three with some reservations that we aren't going to start fighting about here. I also thought that the first movie, or Twilight, was absolute crap and an embarrassment to the resume of all involved, especially director Catherine Hardwicke, regardless of how it fit in with the books. Thankfully, she was fired.<br/><br/>New Moon, the much anticipated, sparklely and shirtless sequel, is not only fun to watch due to the multiple young men with six pack abs, but is also beautifully photographed, has great action, and captures the Gothic/romantic spirit of the books that launched a billion Hot Topic tee shirt sales.<br/><br/>After an incident that reveals Bella's (Kristen Stewart) fragility, vampire boyfriend and true love Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson, in case you didn't already know) vanishes from her life to protect her from future harm. Enter slightly more grown up, buffer, and Native American werewolf (the movie leaves out the more convoluted rules about shape shifting) Jacob Black (youngster Taylor Lautner), who saves the day. Bella, still reeling from the vampire drama, slips slowly into a puppy love that ends up being unrequited after Cullen returns, leaving little Jake alone in the woods with his pack, just as Edward left Bella.<br/><br/>It's Lautner that ends up stealing the show. The man who fought to keep his part shows off his hard work both physically and emotionally, and plays Black with perfect, sincere sweetness and frustration. More importantly, Lautner holds the sexual tension. Forget the Bella/Edward love affair; Stewart and Lautner show incredible chemistry that saturates the film. It keeps the pressure between the Edward/Bella/Jacob love triangle high, playing off of the driving force that makes the books so attractive and page turning.<br/><br/>The other actors also seem to have gotten a boost from new director Chris Weitz. The previously wooden Pattinson and Stewart actually show real emotion and facial expressions, something that seemed out of their grasp in the first film. Most exciting for a fan of the books is the change in Ashley Greene's Alice, who is transformed from boring and quiet to her proper place as perky and electric. Perhaps, its because Weitz is able to capture the introspective nature of the books, which are mostly narrated by Bella, a place where Hardwicke failed horribly. Mastering that perspective is the key to keeping the film interesting, maintaining the flow, and giving the actors a stake in the film. The film isn't just dramatic, it's also funny with a well written script, allowing the actors a little breathing room.<br/><br/>To top it off, Weitz captures the haunting backdrop of the books by bringing in rich color, and lush surroundings, making the film pop off the screen; a huge change from Hardwicke's homage to bad, melodramatic monster movies. The scene in which Bella leaps from a cliff and ends up in the water with an imagined Edward and killer red headed vampire on her heels is absolutely stunning. The vampires finally look simultaneously more normal (remember the horrible wigs and strange hair we witnessed in the first one?) and more exotic. The CGI werewolves are a bit shocking at first, but begin to fit more seamlessly as the film goes along. Weitz also took the fight scenes multiple notches above Hardwicke's film and it's clear why the ability to make a decent one became an issue in her firing.<br/><br/>New Moon is not the greatest film ever made, but it's certainly a decent one. It's fun for girls and guys, Twilighters and non-Twilighers alike, and has enough to feed the romantic souls of Team Jacob members and Team Edward members for generations to come. If there is fault here, it's not in the moving making, but in the original source material."

","I saw this movie twice on opening day, it was that good! I thought it was so much better than the first movie. Some of the acting was still a little stiff, but overall there was 100% improvement from the first movie. They even went over some things in this movie that should have been in the first movie! New Moon keeps you on the edge of your seat, and keeps you laughing. Whereas, the first movie was kind of dull and had moment where you just wanted it to get over with. New Moon also followed the book a little bit better than Twilight did.<br/><br/>So, overall this movie was great! I'm probably going to go see it again!"
"moviewizguy","6","3","11","22 November 2009"," The Next Chapter Begins
","After Bella recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life, she looks to celebrate her birthday with Edward and his family. However, a minor accident during the festivities results in Bella's blood being shed, a sight that proves too intense for the Cullens, who decide to leave the town of Forks, Washington for Bella and Edward's sake. Initially heartbroken, Bella finds a form of comfort in reckless living, as well as an even-closer friendship with Jacob Black. Danger in different forms awaits.<br/><br/>I have to admit it. I enjoyed the first film, TWILIGHT, very much so. I'm a sentimental guy so I was swept away easily by the romance between Edward and Bella. To make it clear for anyone of you out there, the TWILIGHT series are not vampire movies. Instead, think of them as a ROMEO AND JULIET story WITH vampires. Some people like these kinds of things. Others don't. I'll try to refrain from saying only teenage girls would love this movie because when I went to see this movie, there were people between the ages of 2 months and 65 years old, half split with males and females. I guess the stereotype wasn't true after all.<br/><br/>You can automatically feel a huge difference between this and the first film. This film is definitely much more slower paced. While never boring, it's quite a drag since it's over two hours long. Although it starts off slow, the ball does get rolling after Edward leaves Bella by herself. Unfortunately, it's also much more moodier, but I guess teen relationships are like that, aren't they? On top of that, the story isn't really all that interesting. After all, it's mostly about Bella being depressed when Edward leaves her. The finale seemed a bit rushed too with little payoff.<br/><br/>However, all is not bad. Director Chris Weitz does a much better job in here than Catherine Hardwicke, giving the film a distinctive look in the title sequence alone. If you may remember, I complained that the first film had too low of a budget to make it look like a blockbuster like it is. However, the problem is quickly fixed since the budget is twice as large as the first, which helped make the film look less like a CW TV show than before. The special effects are put to good use here, especially for the werewolves, an addition that makes the story much more interesting. The score by Alexandre Desplat is really fantastic. See how much a bigger budget can help a movie?<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart does a great job in here as always. I think she grounds the movie to reality. Although Robert Pattinson is underused here, along with most of the case, he's good with the small amount of screen time he has. Taylor Lautner gets a much bigger role in here, which is fortunate not only for the Twihards out there but for everyone else too, because he makes the movie more interesting. As stated before, many of the cast members are underused. Remember Rachelle Lefevre, playing Victoria, the villain, who was part of the cliffhanger ending in the first film? Well, we see her for brief moments in here, totaling up her screen time for only seconds.<br/><br/>The story is much more moodier and less interesting in here, in my opinion, compared to the first. The characters are in here mostly to mope and be depressed because of a such complicated relationship. However, the technicality is much improved, from the cinematography to the score. Director Chris Weitz does his best here, along with the rest of the cast. It's a decent sequel to a good movie but it could have been much better. Maybe the screenwriter should cut out some unnecessary bits from the novels to make it more interesting. A little action wouldn't hurt, would it? Don't you just hate it when someone you love turns out to be a vampire? I think Bella needs a break."
"maetorum-1","1","3","11","21 November 2009"," Twilight knows nothing about vampires
","Twilight and all it's incarnations knows nothing about vampires. Vampires don't care about sex or anything except one thing: blood. Everything is blood. All the associations that ""labeled"" you in the world before are meaningless once you become a vampire. Mother, brother, sister, father. All meaningless.<br/><br/>Read Anne Rice if you really want to understand vampires. She now writes Christian fiction which is a real shame.<br/><br/>Due to the high level of nudity and sex related scenes I won't let my children, who are all under 18, go see this film. I recommend all parents refrain from allowing their children to be exposed to this.<br/><br/>If my children want to see young males without any shirts on I suggest they go down to the beach during the summer or any other summer related activity. <br/><br/>I was particularly appaulled during the scene when Bella stuck her nose up Edward's anus. Talk about a brown noser."
"me-ga-sa","5","2","6","7 November 2010"," This part is my favorite
","While I don't really like this Saga, New Moon is my favorite among the 3 parts that were released. Bella has finally got some skin color because in the first part she was looking like a vampire herself. In this part we see some intense feelings and more action. While in the first part everything seemed artificial, dark and pale, here there are more colors which is more pleasant to watch. Scenes are made in a more attractive way, Bella seems more beautiful. However I still have problems with Kirsten's portrayed Bella, I can't decide if she is acting bad or is Bella supposed to be so emotionless?.. She really can't express feelings well which doesn't let me to dive into the story. It leaves me indifferent. Her father also seems pretty emotionless. My favorite part is the ending where the whole beauty starts, I really love the color red so visually for me it is really pleasant to watch! This part is really something compared to the empty first part of Twilight Saga where I couldn't feel the love that was born between Bella and Edward at all."
"n-audenaert","5","2","6","16 July 2010"," Only for Twilight lovers
","New Moon being the second in the series, it doesn't have the ""new"" feeling to it anymore. Which doesn't matter too much as most of the viewers are probably Twilight readers anyways. I liked the first movie better, and preferred the third one in the sense that this second movie is a lot less ""normal"" visually. All of a sudden Bella wears a lot more refined make-up for example, Jasper's and Rosalie's wigs are just too ridiculous for words and the red eyes of the ""non vegetarians"" are much too red. But again as a big fan of the books and a super-romantic chick, one can't but love this movie. As for the others who are expecting to watch GOOD cinema, try something else, only that way you won't be disappointed."
"funfemme","5","2","6","28 November 2009"," Not as bad as everyone is saying, but undeniable room for improvement.
","To fans of the Twilight series: This is definitely NOT as bad a film as the reviewers and others are saying! You shouldn't let their negative comments stop you from seeing this movie. That being said...There is absolutely room for improvement! <br/><br/>I think the problems really start with the trailer. It makes people who watch it (who have not read the books) think that this is another Vampire action fantasy with some romance, when in actuality it's neither. The film is, like the novel, mainly and angst ridden story about a teenage girl dealing with loss. There is some romance and some action and of course fantasy, but 80% of the film is angsty dialogue. <br/><br/>Another big problem carries over from the first film.... line delivery. It is possible that some of the actors are too inexperienced to play rolls that are so dependent on portraying extreme emotions, mainly inner turmoil. But either way, I do think that these are incredibly difficult characters to portray, and pretty much impossible to pull of successfully with this script and short amount of time given. Also, there's absolutely an issue with character development, especially in this installment. <br/><br/>And, that brings me to chemistry; Stewart and Pattinson have none! I know what the tabloids say, but give me a break! I feel as though Stewart has much better chemistry with Lautner in New Moon than she's ever had with Pattinson, which is one of the reasons I liked this installment! In this film, as in Twilight, I just kept wondering... ""Why do you like him (Edward) so much?"". It just seems so awkward between the two of them. Never romantic, or sexy, but tense and uncomfortable. And, that's bad! There are awkward moments in the novels, but it's more an ""I want to be with you, but can't because I might kill you, but still love you more than anything."" awkwardness, rather than an ""I can't touch you, or look at you, or smile at you because I'm concentrating on blinking."" awkwardness. <br/><br/>All that being said, there are some great moments in this film. From the relationship development between Bella and Jacob, to the introduction of new and exciting characters, to the general sticking to the actual plot... again, it's definitely worth seeing!<br/><br/>A general caution: If you have not read the books or seen the first movie, you will be completely lost and most likely hate this film! At least read the cliff notes!"

They could've done better. Maybe the two main characters need more acting classes. Kristen's facial acting was fine but her voice acting was horrible. Robert needs to take some more acting classes in my opinion. Too serious. He needs to show more love to Bella. Don't be afraid to go closer. LOL. As a fan of the series, I feel i got my money's worth watching the movie. But we still need more Robert and Kristen chemistry. I think I'm only going to watch this movie twice. It's not really very replayable. XD"
"freaky_dave","7","2","6","23 November 2009"," Not as bad as some say ( Mild Spoilers only if you haven't read the books)
","New Moon is the second in a series based on four books by Stephanie Meyer. For the most part, the fan base is teenage girls because that is who Stephanie Meyer was really writing for. Now I will agree that some of things that Bella does would be a bad influence, but lets realize that this is all a work of fiction and that normal girls wouldn't do such things knowing this is fiction. After all, vampires and werewolves do not exist. This review is based on what I read of the books and how the movies themselves are bringing this story together on the screen. I have seen both Twilight and New Moon, and found that the movie New Moon worked much better than the movie Twilight if you go by the books. Now I will explain why.<br/><br/>As in the first film, this film had some hokey dialoque, but when I compare it to the Twilight movie, I found it wasn't as bad. Maybe it's because the actors have gotten a little more experience and can show more emotion. It just didn't come off as awkward.<br/><br/>Now involving the chemistry between the actors, i still believe there is room for improvement, but once again it came off much better in New Moon. Maybe it's because of the new director, I'm not sure, or maybe its the experience issue again. Whatever it might be, it didn't have me wanting to throw up like in Twilight. Taylor Lautner, who plays the werewolf Jacob, had a lot more to do this time, and he pulled it off better than I though he would. THere was still some clumsiness between Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart, but they also improved as the movie went on. And was it me or did they use some kind of special effect to make Lautner taller. He really looked over six foot tall even though he is only about 5'10 or 5'11 in real life. But I guess, packing on muscle like he did for this part would make anybody seem physically bigger.<br/><br/>Putting dialoque and chemistry aside, the biggest improvement however was in the action and special effects. The wolves looked pretty good, and by bringing the Quilette tribe into the story, that helped with the pacing and made this second more interesting. Even the effects for the Vampires were much better, probably because they had more of a budget this time. I still think there could've been more action, but I think will get a lot more in Eclipse. THe other good thing about this movie was the VOlturi, they seemed threatening enough and those actors pulled their parts off well enough.<br/><br/>I've come to realize that the Twilight Series, which was targeted towards younger teen aged girls when first written, should be looked at as a group of movies in much the same way. I've seen better and I've seen worse, but this movie isn't half as bad as some people think. It is not an academy award winner in anyway, but it does what it set out to do, and for that it gets a pass from me."
"greasergirl04","7","2","6","23 November 2009"," Not What Expected
","I've read all four of the books, and enjoyed them. When I saw the first film I was a little bit disappointed; it didn't follow the book as closely as I hoped it would, and it didn't do as much as it could've. The potential was there, however, and I prayed that they would tap on that potential in the second film, New Moon. Despite my wishes, New Moon was a bit of a let down. Granted, the story was followed a little more closely, but my friends and myself felt they left out a lot of important points while adding some unnecessary features. The details added to Jacob Black's character were very helpful and brought more to the story line, but it took away from other characters. I with they'd chosen more appropriate actors the parts of the wolves and the parts of the Volturi, some of the actors simply did not fit their characters. (such as Dakota Fanning for Jane) So, while Twilight: New Moon was a success in the box office, and while I'm sure I'll own the film when it comes out, they could've done better over all, and I pray they tap on all the potential they have hidden for Eclipse, the third installment of the saga."
"conor_ds9","7","2","6","22 November 2009"," Decent and entertaining
","enjoyable and entertaining although it drags at times. the actors do well with the parts, the volturi are played very well and quite different then how i imagined them myself, the relationship between jacob and bella is expanded nicely, the fx are done well, nice scene with victoria, the aparitions are done well, some scenes are too long and should have been cut or shortened and other scenes such as the fight near the end should have been given more screen time and the volturi could have been developed more, the break up scene wasn't as emotional as i think i could/should have been although the nightmare scenes were done very well and were disturbing, nice bit of comedy too which was a pleasant relief from all the drama. Some scenes, such as when taylor takes his shirt of for the first time seemed to be more for a swoon effect rather than adding to the story and the scene of alice's vision of bella in the future was quite cringe worthy. all in all an entertaining adaptation with flaws, but these flaws were probably emphasised way beyond their actual significance due to the overwhelming hype and anticipation there has been over the last year."
"laurenslo-589-854681","6","2","6","22 November 2009"," Definitely better than Twilight
","As a fan of the books, I truly enjoyed this adaptation. I might even go as far as saying this is one of the best film adaptations of a novel I have seen. It is almost scary how close this movie stays to the book. It was far superior to Twilight.<br/><br/>The scenes that were changed did not conflict with the story. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, the explanation for Harry's heart attack, was not even in the books. Being a bit of a purist, I normally hate added scenes, but this scene fit so beautifully into Stephenie's original story, I couldn't help but love it.<br/><br/>I also loved the fact that this movie was not tinged in blue. It was wonderful to actually see the colors of Forks and it's inhabitants.<br/><br/>I would love to give this movie a much higher rating, but the acting was still cringe-worthy. I really like Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, I just don't like them in this movie. The acting is way too over the top, which really takes away from the story. I am truly sad that Catherine Hardwicke got to cast these movies."
"wgalway","8","2","6","22 November 2009"," Loved the movie. Much better than Twilight.
","The actors looked much better in this movie than in Twilight. In Twilight, I thought the actors did not live up to the beauty of the vampires the way Stephanie Myers described them. Somehow they even managed to make beautiful Ashley Green look plain in Twilight. In New Moon the makeup was much, much better and the actors looked closer to my expectations of the Cullens. The Volturi was amazing as were the wolves. All in all, a great improvement over Twilight. I really, really loved this movie. Kristen Stewart did a much better job playing Bella than she did in Twilight. Taylor Lautner was amazing in New Moon. The Wolf Pack was great and the Volturi was convincingly creepy. I can't wait for Eclipse!"
"swood19","5","2","6","21 November 2009"," I gave film saga a second chance and I just about approved
","OK so Twilight for me was bad....I hadn't read the books which was probably why I completely hated it, it didn't make sense so I went home and read the books and although i still don't like the film, I can see why people like it. I enjoyed the books, the ending was a bit predictable but overall it made me think about giving the films a second chance.<br/><br/>So there i was at the midnight screening, in a packed room of teen girls, middle aged women, over excited guys and the clearly bored looking boyfriends who had been dragged along against their will. The title came on and people cheered, and every time Edward or Jacob appeared there was whooping.<br/><br/>But i ignored it all, actually decided to watch the film, the first half hour dragged, and I mean dragged, there is only so much lack of acting from Edward and Bella you can take before you feel like shooting yourself in the face. The scenes were directed well but those two managed to ruin it, i don't see how they were cast for these films as they both struggle to show any emotion, instead keeping the same faces from start to finish.<br/><br/>But its gets better, Jacob is better not brilliant but he at least looks like he's trying, luckily the support cast make up for the lack of effort from the main characters.<br/><br/>The special effects were good, much improvement on the first (you can see the budget difference), the script was better but sometimes I did cringe as the actors delivered them badly and some lines should of been left out all together.<br/><br/>The film picks up pace and the end is pretty good. I did enjoy it, it wasn't great but it kept me entertained enough that I didn't feel like I had wasted my money.<br/><br/>But not everyone will enjoy this film, you have to overlook a lot of downsides to enjoy such as the main character being unable to deliver a line while showing actual feeling. Im not going to complain about the topless guys (as many men reviewing this film have), although sometimes utterly pointless, I have seen enough films where girls walk around with it all hanging out for it be about time I can enjoy watching topless men for a change It doesn't do the books justice but its not that bad that you feel like demanding your money back, just try to overlook the fact that Edward and Bella have the acting ability of a rock."
"penelope_zach","3","2","6","21 November 2009"," A huge drop in quality compared to the first movie
","I don't understand all this complaining that vampires are supposed to be ugly and not sparkle. Vampires may ride on rainbow unicorns as far as I am concerned, they are not real and it's not like the existing mythology on them is not without its contradictions. The vampires in I Am Legend where fugly, and it still didn't make for a good film (which wrecked a fantastic novel). If you go to watch a supernatural romance film geared towards young women, you can't complain that well, what you watched was a supernatural romance geared at young women, and not Nosferatu. But you can complain if it's a terrible one! I'm not well acquainted with the books (have skimmed through the first one quickly, but it really wasn't my cup of tea and never finished it), but I saw the first movie on DVD a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised, it was neither particularly original or well acted, but it was a good portrayal of teenage emotions and longing, well paced, well shot, some gorgeous cinematography and an excellent soundtrack, a director who understood the teenage psyche.<br/><br/>So sitting yesterday in a cinema packed with overexcited women and their grumbling other halves, I was fairly optimistic. I was not exactly expecting Citizen Kane or Rashomon here, but I didn't expect the subtle brooding moodiness of the first film to be replaced with such cringe-worthy and over the top ridiculousness. Either Meyer's writing took a nosedive in the second book, or the first director managed to pluck the best elements out of the first novel, while Weitz chose the worst ones from the second one. Having watched his Golden Compass film, where he managed to suck all life out of that brilliant Pullman novel, I'm inclined to blame him.<br/><br/>Where can I even start? Horrible pacing, rushing through action and then slowing down to a snail's pace (I almost nodded off halfway through), picking up again crazily, without any rhyme or reason. Some godawful dialogue that had me squirming in my seat with embarrassment for being there, a by-the-numbers soundtrack of cheesy violins, and some huge misfires, the slow-motion running hand in hand through the woods had the entire audience laughing like hyenas. The Volturi looked and talked like something Anne Rice would have concocted during a bad acid trip. Awful, robotic CGI. Everything that was subtle and implied in the first film, was hammered on our heads again and again on the second one. Lack of chemistry, lack even of logic at times.<br/><br/>A film built around shirtless scenes and marriage proposals, instead of atmosphere, feeling and plot, and a director that seemed to neither understand nor have a shred of respect for his audience."

It doesn't feel rushed like the first movie of the saga; it's dynamic and yet, it accomplishes more than the prequel.<br/><br/>I loved shooting sites. The cinematography and the accompanying vivid ambiance, combined with the absolutely brilliant soundtrack choice made it really worth my while to see the movie. I recommend it :)"
"silvertab79","5","2","6","20 November 2009"," Not horrible...
","I saw Twilight before reading the series and I thought it was well done. After reading the book, I still agreed with my original thought, it held true to the book and cut out only what wasn't extremely important to the story. Now, of course, I read the books before seeing New Moon. The thing that bothered me the most about the movie is what always bothers me about sequels... the characters, while the same, looked different; and on my way home, I figured out it was the eyes. While it seems like such a trivial piece of the movie, the gold tones, as opposed to the blue tint, worked for everything except the eyes. the vampires in this series are supposed to be friendly, safe, and as harmless and one-of-us as possible. This made them look very freakish which was not the case in the first movie.<br/><br/>Other than the screaming teenagers that I wanted to smack that were ga-ga over Jacob, I thought it was decent. They cut out parts of the book that weren't completely relevant to the film and it worked well without, but because I knew what happened I easily followed the undertones and inferences left in the film. I went with a friend who had not read the books and she enjoyed it as well and didn't think it was hard to follow without knowing more details.<br/><br/>Overall, it was good. Some minor bad, clichÃ©, acting points, but forgivable with their charm and love for the story. Only time will tell if I continue to like it after seeing it again when I can really dig deeper into the script."
"3xHCCH","7","5","23","20 November 2009"," The Movie Fulfills the Cinematic Promise of the Book
","Just came home from watching probably the most hyped and anticipated movie of the year. It had an unwieldy title ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" for those who lived under a rock and did not know that this was the sequel to ""Twilight."" <br/><br/>I have read the book before, and expected this to be a better movie than ""Twilight."" ""New Moon"" the book had the best cinematic promise of the first three books, and the movie fulfills that promise very well. The parts about the wolves, the cliff jumping and of course, the Volturi in Italy were as exciting as I imagined them. The quality of the special effects during the wolf scenes and the fight scenes with Volturi were excellent.<br/><br/>After the movie, my wife was on Team Jacob. The character of Jacob Black is the best written main character in the Twilight Saga books, and it reflects here also in the movie. It is easiest to empathize with Jacob's situation, than with the distantly cold Edward or the confusingly conflicted Bella. The young teenage actor Taylor Lautner portrayed him very well, both physically and emotionally. A loud collective gasp was heard when Taylor removed his t-shirt (gratuitously) to reveal his body for the first time(among many). I found that hilarious. <br/><br/>Of course, this could not be the Twilight Saga without the classically cheesy scenes and lines, especially those that involved Edward. The ultimate in cheese would be that laughable ""Edward and Bella running in the woods"" scene. It was so awkward I do not know why Robert Pattinson allowed it to appear on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, ""New Moon"" is a better movie than the first ""Twilight"" film. I am not really looking forward to the next one (due out in the summer of 2010) because I found ""Eclipse"" to be the worst of the three books I had read. But I'm sure we will also be watching it. The ending scene and final line is probably one of the best cliffhangers in recent memory."

Bella and edward broke up, which we all have seen coming. This scene seemed so never ending?! Kristen always exhales very loud instead of forming sentences and also in the 2nd movie refuses to look someone in the eyes while talking.
It was such a childish fake depression I mean common how long have the been together? 3 or 4 months? They only kissed like two times. Her first boyfriend and his .. surely he must have had lots of girls in his hundred years of living.
Anyway Bella filled her hole in the heart with, of course, some other creature. What is it with this town that two rivaling folks live there and Bella falls in love with the youngest of both.
To me, Bella got some real borderline issues.
So we get to see lots of young men half naked in short jeans. Always.. also in Italy when edward is about to glitter on the market place: he's got his pants so low I am sure he had to shave his pubic hair to wear jeans like that. Had to look away.
The scene that really made me belief this is a parody: when the sister looks into the future and Bella and Edward run slowmo through the forest. No way someone gave his OK to put the scene into the movie!"

"davispittman","6","1","2","9 April 2017"," Not as good as the first or third
","The Twilight Saga: New Moon is probably the the third best in the series. It's not as good or entertaining as the first or eclipse in my opinion. The cast and acting is pretty much all the exact same, it's a little cheesy at times but overall it's fair. The script is average, it's really what you would expect from this type of film. This movie explores Bella's relationship with Jacob (Taylor Lautner). After Edward leaves her because of an attack that nearly kills her, she copes some by her friendship with Jacob. I liked seeing her relationship with Jacob play out and what all that meant, and I think that Kristen Stewart handled this movie well. This installment is less entertaining though than the other ones because there are moments in the movie, long stretches of time where it's pretty dull, nothing much of any importance goes on. And that is why I'm not rating it as high as twilight or eclipse. The movie just becomes boring in places, and I wish they would've done more to make it more interesting in those places. The visual effects are done pretty well, miles better than breaking dawn. Overall, of you're a twilight saga fan, you'll probably like it. I liked it alright, I thought it was fair, but not to the caliber of the first or third, but better than the breaking dawns. 6/10"

The dialogue that everyone says is cheesy is no more cheesy than most of the films in this genre. The performances were all fine believe me I've seen some truly bad films with terrible acting and dialogue and this is a masterpiece compared to them. I'm starting to really mistrust the ratings as I'm just a likely to enjoy a film rated really low as not enjoy one that's rated high."
"maryasia-723-289929","5","1","2","26 April 2010"," This film is worth the money spent but ...
","I'd put 5 out of 10. I liked it after re-watching and re-reading. In the movie theater I thought that I missed my time and come to the different movie.<br/><br/>First, I liked Twilight a lot. I haven't read any of the Twilight books before watching. My sister drag me to the sofa and made me watch it. I recognized Robert Pattinson, of course, I'm a Harry Potter fan, too. And he made such a great Cedric.<br/><br/>Well, sometime after watching I read the whole set of Twilight books, including the Midnight Sun.<br/><br/>But it's not why I like the Twilight. It's the atmosphere. The film is so close to the spirit of the book. The spirit of the unreality of the woods and everything.<br/><br/>Unlike the New Moon. New Moon looks like any other action movie, and feels the same. I don't know may be I looked for the same atmosphere as in the Twilight. But I know that I'm wrong here. Just as the books, the movies SHOULD be different. All in all they're about different things. <br/><br/>But more about details. Firstly, I thought that Robert had ruined Edward's part, but then I re-read the book. Actually, I can say that I like his Edward more than the one in the book. The one in the book I don't like. And here I really should mention that his make-up was horrible. Yes, Edward was pale, yes, Rob has really bushy brows, but too much of the white and that horrible lipstick, and those bushy brows. They definitely didn't do him any good speaking of the Edward's unnatural beauty. Though he did look unnatural :) And the hair. I clearly remember that in the book it was mentioned that the hair was the most alive part of Edward, so why his hear looks like a really battered wig? Well, just like the hair of rest of the cast.<br/><br/>But anyway. The wolves are GREAT. And I mean both visual effects and actors. I really enjoyed that part of the film.<br/><br/>And Jacob, yes, that was surely something. All the way down to the end. Taylor Lautner is great in this role. Though I absolutely agree with one of the comments that he surely knows that he looks great without T-shirt :) But still his acting was also interesting.<br/><br/>As to the Bella, even in Twilight I thought that there's something wrong with her. And it's not because of Kristen Stewart, Bella in the books IS strange. The only thing in Kristen as Bella that I thought wrong is non-clumsiness. Though she tripped sometimes it looked just like any other well-coordinated person may from time to time do, but not like the world's clumsiest person, as Bella was.<br/><br/>And the score. Please, please, return to Carter Burwell. That was so much like it should be. I agree that Alexandre Desplat did a great job, but it sounds like nothing compared to the Twilight score. Though I really like soundtracks. Some of them fit really nicely.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a mystery for me: why now I like both movies? And I really look for the third one."

","""New Moon"" is the second constellation of Twilight Saga which is written by Stephenie Meyer. The movie is still played by the regular Actors from the prequel such as Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart. Plus brand new Cast members like Taylor Lautner and Michael Sheen. Pattison plays as a charismatic vampire named Edward who falls in love with a girl named Bella (Stewart). We have seen Pattison few years ago in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (2005) as Harry's competitor. The former Director of ""Twilight"" (2008), Catherine Hardwicke is now replaced by Paul Weitz. Hardwicke's version of ""Twilight"" was filled with more romantic atmospheres. She was undoubtedly success to build the chemistry between two main characters. On the contrary, Weitz doesn't get into the right track to create such emotions. At the beginning, I think whoever the Director of thiz second movie should have more chance to create attractive plots, considering the conflicts will become intense based on original contents. The other weakness of thiz movie is on the action sequences. The actions sequences may be supported by more Special Effects but the actions are clearly too brief in most of the times and it surely doesn't create even a single memorable thrill. We remember the first ""Twilight"", the scene when Edward came to save Bella from a bunch of bad guys or the fight scene in a baseball field. The only scene that I like on thiz movie is when Bella has a dream about her grandmother in a beautiful forest. In that scene, suddenly Edward appears and Bella realizes later, that is not her grandmother but it is herself getting older in Edwards's arms. It's a good metaphor to reflect the problem that they are facing.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
"mr_congenialityng","6","1","2","21 December 2009"," Love it or hate it, New Moon is a movie with some really good stuff, but also really bad stuff
","Let's face it, Twilight is an irresistible pop culture phenomenon. It has a great looking cast, great looking backdrop, and great looking protagonists. It's a teenage girl's fantasy, and I know how crazy that sounds. A tale of a vampire who love a human instead of eating her is quite coy. But that was the first movie, this is just a movie where the guys show off their sculpted and sexy bodies.<br/><br/>That's not to say though that I didn't enjoy the film, in some prospects. ""New Moon"" starts off fast and ends fast, but it drags too long in the middle, and for a 2 hour movie, that's somewhat sad.<br/><br/>Some of it is ridiculous, for example, Kristen Stewart who plays Bella is quite annoying at times. When Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, leaves Bella, she becomes too hysterical, and it's more whining and moaning than crying or sobbing. I like her better in the original Twilight film, and in other movies, but she is quite bothersome here. Maybe it's because she wasn't directed well enough, but whatever it is, she plays like she's in a daytime soap.<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson is really underused here, and it's a shame, because even though he's not completely physically dreamy, he is quite charming and alluring. The movie tries to make up for it by dangling ripped and toned jailbait in front of our eyes (and now because of it we have several adult females turning into pedophiles), which some people who are more oriented to appearance will appreciate. However, I am not oriented in that manner, and found that the character had way too much of a negative personality.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, however, is quite nice. So is the romance between Edward and Bella, which isn't shown on-screen much of this sequel, is enough to hold the film above water. It's undeniable, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have some wonderful chemistry. It's what made the original Twilight so good and what makes this one a bit too mediocre.<br/><br/>But being someone who actually really enjoyed the first movie, I have a hard time not recommending this to people who are fans of the book, or the first movie. People who have not seen/read or did not enjoy the books or the first movie however, should steer clear of New Moon, because they will certainly not like it.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, New Moon is a movie with some really good stuff, but also really bad stuff. Maybe if the production had more time, they could of done more with it? But we'll never know that now, will we?"

In reality I would settle for probably around a 6/10.<br/><br/>But anyway. The review. Firstly, the directing was much better. Thank God. It wasn't fantastic, but definitely better than Hardwicke's version. The acting has improved also. Still some laughable scenes (as to how bad they were done) but not as many as the first time around. And Special Effects were less, um, abysmal than the first so that was a plus. I definitely would say that I went in with little to no expectations because of how sucky the first was, but this definitely took me by surprise.

"dirtracing53","9","5","26","20 November 2009"," Norton's Review Of Twilight New Moon
","This should be a helpful insight to this movie, seeing as i'm the farthest thing from a fan you can be. From seeing the first film and the quality of the film and the story and seeing teenage girls go wild and scream for a movie that's quality was direct to DVD i walked into New moon slouched in my chair wanting to fall asleep. Then the movie started right away within ten minutes you can tell that this film is much different, the first one was so horrible the characters 2d but in this one we actually get to know the characters, the greatest addition was actually getting to here the other Cullen's talk besides Edward and Alice. The First half, being after Edward leaves is a little slow but the film picks up and even though you know whats going to happen, you find yourself captivated by ""whats going to happen"" the biggest being Jacob even though we know he doesn't get Bella everybody and the audience at Midnight screening hollered and yelped when he appeared on screen which was almost always shirtless and wet. I think that people will have a hard time with this series simply because the first was so bad and rushed together, heres the differences. Special Effects, a big thing people have complained about is the lack of good special effects in New /moon the Effects Aren't Aamzing But good enough, we gotta remember these movies are shot in released within 6 months so they cant be perfect but i think thats a good thing If anything this movie relies on the story more than the visuals. Another thing i liked was the absent of Edward, in the book he's gone and not seen till the end, i figured with the popularity and the way Hollywood is that the script would be changed and we would see more of him but i think in him being absent the viewer starts to like Jacob a little better than Edward and in the end this movie might be one of the greatest love stories. Its unbelievable to say but go into this movie not thinking of the first the movie. This is great, its more than just sparkly no shirt guys. I'm a fan of this movie or story and cant wait to see where it goes, i would go see this again, give it a chance. Their will be critics out their that base their reviews on the popularity and the heap that the first movie is. New Moon is a well made adaption and film that pulls you and leaves you hanging for Eclipse. Rating: 9/10"
"kaslesinthesky","8","5","26","20 November 2009"," Oh my gosh...so amazing!!!
","I went and saw the movie last night at midnight and I was not disappointed. In fact, all these bad reviews I'm reading are kind of making me nauseous. I think this movie deserves so much more praise then it's been getting, and I want everyone to see it. <br/><br/>I've read all the books, and am a huge fan (obviously) and New Moon is my favorite book. That being said, I can't find one thing that I was disappointed in, except that it could have been longer so it could have had more detail, so obviously I didn't feel it was too long, or slow. I loved twilight...in a ""this is so horrible it's ridiculous kind of way,"" but I still love it...just because it's twilight. As for New Moon, I can genuinely say I love this movie because it's good. Of course it still has its cheesy moments, but that can be expected (i mean just read the books) but it's nothing compared to twilight. The writing is so much better, the acting, the fact that this movie has color, the score, pretty much everything is 100% better. I'm amazed that people actually want the old crew back. it's so obvious to me now that catherine had way too much control over twilight...because people who are normally good actors, weren't, and composers who normally write brilliant music, wrote cheesy 80s electric guitar music. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie is still a ""twilight"" movie, and I'm not suggesting it should be up for an Oscar. But compared to twilight it's just so much better. Go see it, and see it with an open mind. It really is good, and if you've already seen it and were disappointed...maybe you should go see it again. Maybe it was the late hour, or maybe it was the fact that you were frozen from standing outside in a line for an hour and a half (as was my case) but something was obviously wrong. I don't know how anyone could not like this movie 100 times more than twilight. <br/><br/>... I think I just realized why I liked the movie so much. I went expecting it to be just as cheesy as twilight, and was pleasantly surprised. all the parts in the trailers that my friends and i made fun of, weren't as cheesy in the actual movie. We were constantly leaning over to each other saying, ""oh...that wasn't half as bad as they made it sound in the trailer."" but apparently people actually thought twilight was a well-made, non-hoaky movie...so maybe this tactic won't work for everyone..."

","I can't give New Moon a perfect 10 - while the director did a wonderful job of displaying the assets of Pattinson and Lautner, I felt once again the film didn't do the book justice. It seemed there were a lot of details from the book were left out. I would have much rather watched a 3 hour film and felt more substance, than the 130 minute portrayal that just felt a bit rushed. However, with all that said, I LOVED New Moon, and greatly anticipate the premier of Eclipse! I still feel like all those cast are perfect in filling the roles that author Meyer laid out for them, and can't wait to see on screen what my imagination has already come up with. I give New Moon 2 thumps up, and a high five."

"ajwin05","8","2","7","19 January 2012"," Cool Vampire Love story
","I've seen New Moon about 8 times and I consider it a good movie. It is not as good as Twilight or Breaking Dawn part 1. I thought Robert Pattinson and Kristen stewart did a good job but Robert was better in Twilight. I like New Moon but the middle drags a little and I did not like when Edward left Bella. I like the opening scenes with Bella afraid to turn 18 and getting presents from her Dad Charlie and Edward's family. I liked the scene where Edward recites dialogue from Romeo and Juliet. I found the scene when Edward Left Bella to be sad and dramatic. I liked the middle scenes but Bella's depression got on my nerves. I felt bad for her but it just got to be too much. Jacob Black Bella's other love interest is not my favorite character but I thought it was cool when he turned into a wolf. I liked when Bella met the wolf pack and the scene where she confronted Laurent was creepy as hell. The ending scenes were great and I thought it was bad when Edward thought Bella had killed herself. I did like the scene where he found out about her supposed death and crushed his cell phone. That was a cool scene. I liked the Italy scenes where Edward went to the volturi. The Volturi leader Aro was super creepy and I consider him the Italian Dracula. He was a bit perverted but a great movie villain. Michael Sheen did a great job playing him and he is one of my favorite actors. I also liked Dakota Fanning as the vampire vixen Jane. New Moon is a good film and has great performances from Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner, Michael Sheen, Dakota Fanning, Ashley Greene, Graham Greene, and my personal favorite Billy Burke as Bella's Dad. New Moon is funny, intense, sad, and romantic. The only bad parts is when bella is depressed and that Edward is gone for most of the film. Everyone should give New Moon a chance."

The cinematography and directing is well done, it is well paced, their is more action, and it goes more in depth with the characters than the first movie did. Everything a sequel is supposed to do.

"eric262003","8","2","7","23 August 2010"," Sticks Close to The Novel Most of the Time
","Okay, after reading the ""Twilight Sagas"", I came the theaters last year expecting the outcome and I didn't care very much if they didn't feature everything that the book contained. But when you think about it, Stephen King adaptations don't incorporate every scene in his novels or J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter adaptations for that matter. It's not really necessary to nitpick every detail from the book and classify it as a terrible movie. You just have to take it for what it's worth, a movie that will keep you on your seat for the next two hours so enjoy the movie first, then draw your own conclusions later.<br/><br/>""New Moon"" wasn't the best story of the saga, but it wasn't the lowest of the lot. The rivalry between Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) over the love for Bella (Kristen Stewart) brings a closer bonding between the two. That's how see ""New Moon"" a way that segues into the rather mundane sequel ""Eclipse"".<br/><br/>Storywise, ""New Moon"" follows the novel quite accurately. Granted some scenes were neglected which will not sit well for die-hard ""Twilight"" fanatics, but the scenes omitted were not very important. There were plenty of dramatic scenarios, and the slow-motion scenes give it that full effect even where Bella was running through a water fountain. <br/><br/>The acting was kind of weak in some areas. Overall, Stewart and Pattinson played out their respected roles that were given to them, and even turned their performances have improved a bit higher here than in the previous Twilight movie. There was no act of absurdity this time around between the two and the chemistry seems more relaxed as they seem more at ease in their roles this time around. But Taylor Lautner as Jacob, well that's another story. I guess his more airtime this time around may have overwhelmed him a bit. The over-drama element in the story was the cause of his letdown. I guess he was just on for the ladies to drool on so he can show off his shirtless body which is featured in most of his scenes. Dakota Fanning who wasn't on for a long period of time, out-acted Lautner. In the acting, Lautner was the Achilles heel.<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie was a staggering improvement than the previous Twilight. It shows that the budget has gotten bigger thanks to that ballistic fan base it has gotten over the years. Edward's skin didn't glitter as much when exposed to light, and we see what gives the vampire Cullen family a fist glance at how they operate. The wolves were pretty cool. Still very CGI, but since they couldn't use real wolves, CGI will have to do. The change from wolf to human looked a little rushed and no need for him strip every time he transforms, but I won't lose any sleep from this.<br/><br/>In general, this sequel was ten times better than the original ""Twilight"". Sure it's over two hours long, but never once did it wears out his welcome. It was slow at the beginning, but gradually, the pace began to pick up, it just had to clear a few things out of the way. The acting was pretty good. Lautner needs more acting skills and to ease off on the body exposure. There was something that totally irked me, which may not be important to others. But three parts of the of the credits were edited out. I'm not trying to be on the anti-Lautner bandwagon, I'm sure with more roles in the future he might get better through time, like a fine wine. I'm not on Edward's side or Jacob's side. I'm going to play it in the middle and root for Bella all the way. This is the best of the series. I hope you all enjoyed it."
"Hannah_Winter","8","2","7","26 November 2009"," This is pretty basic, people
","It's pretty simple: you either like this, or you don't. If you hated the books and the first film, you won't like this one, so there's no use in going around, saying ""God, this movie sucked. It was even worse than Twilight. I hated the books, too."" If you want a fan's opinion, this movie was great. And no, I'm not saying this because of the dreamy vampires that are portrayed in it. Yes, I find Robert Pattinson attractive, and I think that Kristen Stewart looks beautiful. That's not my point.<br/><br/>New Moon has a completely different feel from Twilight. The cold, blue filter is gone, the colors are more vibrant and warm, which suits the storyline with the werewolves (you'll know what I'm talking about if you've read the books). Weitz has a great way of directing: everything is more fluid, there are almost no static scenes. The soundtrack, which is great, is present in the movie, but not in an overpowering way as it sometimes was in Twilight.<br/><br/>They've also done a good job in, in anticipation of Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, giving a bigger share of the story to characters like Charlie, Jasper... It would be weird if they have nothing to say in New Moon, and are suddenly principal characters in the next few films.<br/><br/>Additionally, there's more humor in this film too. This is a good break from the sad scenes with Bella sans Edward. I don't find the ""depressing"" scenes annoying, it's like that in the book.<br/><br/>So if you liked Twilight or the books, go see this movie, you'll love it. If you didn't like either Twilight or the books, there's no need to bash the movies and give it a low rating. Yes, I'm biased, I liked the books AND the movies, but in this case: no one is right, you're a fan, or you're not."

I didn't expect much more from New Moon (aside from having a decent budget this time) especially when I heard Chris Weitz was directing it (The Golden Compass? SERIOUSLY?) But I was actually almost pleasantly surprised. Aside from Edward always having some cheesy line, I'd say every single actor improved. Kristen wasn't a babbling mess, Jackson didn't look *as* pained all the time, and Mike Newton stole every scene he was in.<br/><br/>I also liked how Bella sent emails to Alice instead of thinking Edward Edward Edward all the time, showing that she missed more than just him.<br/><br/>And also a definite plus was that, unlike Twilight, they didn't have so many added in improv scenes saying dumb ass things like ""These kind of things don't exist"", and the action came in before 80% of the movie was over. I loved the little rumbles.<br/><br/>Now...for the fun part...<br/><br/>There were like 10 minute intervals between questions and answers. I was literally almost to the point of yelling to the screen ""SAY IT ALREADY!""

Sure, every girl from 12-16 will go see this film like a gazillion times over, but that doesn't constitute the quality of the picture. <br/><br/>There is no chemistry at all between any of the characters, be it Bella and Edward or Bella and Jake. The plot just jumped around all over the place. As one review pointed out, it seemed like the director was just shooting random scenes that would get a squeal of delight from the teen girls and to hell with continuity. <br/><br/>The werewolves looked OK, but the insta-change they did was a slap in the face of werewolf lore. Considering they already blew it with the vampires (no - REAL vamps don't sparkle in sunlight!!) And was it me or do you not one time in the entire film see ANY vampire fangs?

"RCWjr","6","2","7","21 November 2009"," Enjoyed this, but with a sense of emptiness
","I enjoyed the first film. Never having read the books, I do not have any foreknowledge of events, other than what persons who have read told me, and that is very little. So strictly cinematically the first film was enjoyable. I thought Pattinson and Stewart had great chemistry, the entire Cullen clan was fantastic as well as the other supporting actors.<br/><br/>This time around, I didn't come out of the theater with as much of a sense of satisfaction. The 1st act and last half of the 3rd act are strong,but most of the 2nd act and beginning of the 3rd left me looking at my watch and for the most part, made this film a less enjoyable experience. Once Jacob ""changes"", the 2nd act drags to a halt and looses momentum. The main reason is the blossoming relationship between he and Bella feels forced. The film jumps around a lot in this section of the film and ultimately it hurts the chemistry between Lautner and Stewart, which doesn't have any kind of the emotional spark that Stewart and Pattison created in Twilight. I understand, from Bella's point of view, the relationship is more brother/sister. Still, there just seemed to be a lack of a focus in creating more of that tension here. Lautner and Stewart acting wise are good, but Weisz fails to create the relationship between the two that Hardwicke built so wonderfully in Twilight. Even the scenes between Stewart and Pattinson are not as intense as in Twilight. I don't want to play the gender card here, but I think this is a movie series that requires a keen sensibility of a young girl/boy relationship and Weisz, a talented director, was not up to the task of focusing on that like Hardwicke did.<br/><br/>The music this go around (score) was done by a different person and I have to say also disappointed. I really loved the evocative score from the first film's music by Carter Burwell. But this go around, Desplat, to me, creates a more generic score that just wasn't as emotional.<br/><br/>The vampire counsel, which I had looked forward to seeing is all of 7 or 8 minutes of the film. We get a hint of the powers they have, but that is about it. They are so much a part of the trailers yet a tiny part of the film.<br/><br/>Most of my complaints I know are not entirely the fault of the movie, it is, from what I understand, a very faithful adaptation of the book. But perhaps a little deviation would have given it more access to those of us that are not informed through the books.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, but can find too much I didn't like that it is a minor disappointment. It hasn't lessoned by enjoyment of the series, but as a stand-alone element, it is definitely a far inferior effort, for me, to Twlight. Eclipse looks to be the movie I was hoping for in this film, I am looking forward to seeing it in June of next year."
"hyperalwayz92","Null","2","7","21 November 2009"," Calm down it's a movie..
","I think that's completely stupid of the person from Brazil who said what kind of a message it sends to girls, I haven't watched the movie yet, but I've read the books. Everyone understands the movies/books aren't real. Stop trying to read so much into it. Yes I'm aware how idiotic it would be to act like that in real life, but it's a movie. Get over it. It's supposed to be entertaining. Also with all of the action movies or horror films, why aren't you complaining about them influencing serial killers or gangs? Oh could it be that those could possibly be movies entertaining to you? Hmm... Bottom line is, even though you may think teenage girls are complete and total idiots, I'm confident enough to say that if anyone were to act like that, it has nothing to do with Twilight or New Moon. They obviously have other problems making them act like that."
"kayleigh0804","10","2","7","21 November 2009"," SO much better than the first one, brilliant
","I must have been watching a completely different film to everyone else commenting on this film! Bear in mind that the New Moon book itself was slow to pick up the pace, the action tended to happen towards the end, and was the weakest of the saga.<br/><br/>While Twilight was boring, strayed away from the book too much, had dull, lifeless acting (particularly from Kristen Stewart who plays Bella), New Moon is a complete revelation, with more life and emotion in the characters. Kristen must have seen the criticism she got for her lack of emotion that Bella has in the books, and stepped it up a notch. Although she isn't quite there, her performance in this film was a lot lot better than what it was in the first film. Rob Pattinson again was a lot better, I have never seen a vampire look so ill and so broken, great acting yet again. The one that shone the most was Taylor Lautner, who plays Jacob. Such a brilliant actor and has worked hard to live up to the role of Jacob.<br/><br/>The effects were so much better in this film, more guy friendly! Congrats to the director, who is obviously much better than the director who did Twilight.<br/><br/>If you have read the book, I don't think you'll be disappointed by this film. It's true to the story, apart from one fight scene added in at the Volturi, but to be honest, myself and my friend who are big fans of the books both thought that it gave an interesting flair to the movie. The ending was brilliant, it was gripping, enticing, and I loved absolutely every second of it (although it STILL doesn't live up to the book, but none of them ever will)."
"bkoganbing","7","3","13","23 December 2009"," Some Interesting Taste In Men
","After seeing the first Twilight movie all I can say is that Kristen Stewart's character Bella has some real weird tastes in men. First a vampire and now a werewolf, YEEGADS.<br/><br/>This series of books has become most popular with the current young generation and I can see why. Bella is certainly breaking traditions and questioning certain mores and norms of society to say the least. But the films wouldn't work if you didn't have beautiful and attractive people in the leads who also can be romantic on screen.<br/><br/>That she has in her vampire lover Robert Pattinson. Pattinson and Stewart really do click on screen and their performances make you believe in both Twilight and New Moon.<br/><br/>In the previous film, a third character, a young American Indian kid played by Taylor Lautner is seen and he first clues Stewart in that her inamorata isn't quite human. He likes Stewart also, but from a distance.<br/><br/>But when Pattinson leaves her because he feels the romance can't be, Lautner moves on in. But he's got a big old secret himself. He's got a werewolf gene in him and it's these werewolves that have protected his tribe from the vampire clan that Pattinson belongs to.<br/><br/>I really did admire the special effects, especially those that turned Lautner and his friends into some really convincing large wolves. They do take care of business quite expeditiously. <br/><br/>New Moon does its best in the special effects and the romance department. Those who've read the books know what's coming next, we filmmakers can only anticipate."
"bassrourke","6","4","20","17 November 2009"," If I was female I would have loved it
","It's OK, yes OK. However I am a guy so my outlook on it may be very different to all females. It is a series of books which has been also been translated to the screen with the intended audience in mind, female. There's a bit to like though. The special effects have been ramped up with a bigger budget and there's less Edward, yay. OK, alright, he's OK too, he's just not in it too much. The relationship / friendship between Bella and Jacob is the focus mostly. That is of course the race to Italy is on. Vampire royalty of Italy is about to be shaken up by a Cullen and a Swan. The story isn't bad, some liberties have been taken to change the book, but it won't matter to those who haven't yet. Is there anybody? Robert Pattinson will have the audience swooning, as will the werewolf boys, after they have changed back into topless human form that is. I know everyone will see this regardless what I say, however I just hope 'Eclipse' is superior."
"Zaphryn","7","3","14","5 December 2009"," When the Cullens are forced to leave town Bella develops a warm friendship with Jacob Black while struggling with a depression.
","Looking over the reviews of this movie it was easy to figure this is where the haters of this movie go, not the fans. So I wanted to comment on this movie as a FAN, not a person who have read all four books and watched both of the movies solely to join the basher's club.<br/><br/>New Moon was a LOT better than the first movie, Twilight. People complained that it was long drawn but I felt that it was necessary in order for the movie to captivate Bella's depression and the many months that pass by as it was portrayed in the book. As a fan you are bound to fear the animated adaptations of the books because you know they will most likely have to cut off a tremendous load to keep it as a movie. That said I think Chris Weitz did a really good job on pleasing the fans, keeping everything as original as possible.<br/><br/>I remember that from the first movie the acting seemed off; it was as if they couldn't quite captivate their characters' personalities, especially in the beginning of the movie the actors didn't seem to belong. Now in New Moon it really felt as if the actors had had time to properly adjust, to read the books and get to know their characters and now know how to act exactly like them. Kristen Stewart's acting had definitely improved for the better, there were less pauses and less blinking and she came off so much more natural. I was also really pleased to see that Taylor Lautner did not only commit physically to his character but really seemed to know how to act like him.<br/><br/>It saddens me to think that this movie is mainly getting so many bad user reviews solely because of its fan base - teen girls. It seems that in the US they have an obsessive and crazy fan girl base that whine and moan about the male actors. But if you did not expect that from this kind of genre you must be truly naive. There will always be obsessed fans related to anything you ever watch or read, it's unavoidable. And it seems that along with a crazy fan base follows a much obsessed anti-fan base, and it really surprises me how much time some people choose to use on the Twilight saga to find every flaw about this film and not to mention the books, because I have seen worse movies out there and so it confuses me. Bella is supposedly a bad role model, yes, she does many reckless things, but there are so many more bad role models out there who get a lot less attention - and who are not fictive characters. I assume no one ever called Dracula abusive when he and Mina wanted to be together in the movie, because it simply wasn't aimed for teens. You don't see many complaints about Romeo & Juliet either because of course, the ancient writers are protected. And though it was not aimed for teens I am sure you won't find a teen who didn't know how that story went. You'll never see anyone bash a macho movie with gore and blood as much as you will see them bash a teen series where the main plot is love. Personally, I never thought the books were aimed for people below age 16, I simply don't think they can comprehend the feelings involved.<br/><br/>But to get back to the movie, I must be one of the only fans left who can see it regardless of the many haters and crazy obsessive fan girls pulling it down and actually just like it for what it is. I rated it 10 because it succeeded to captivate me throughout the entire thing, the battle scenes were a lot greater than I had expected from watching the trailers, the CGI was well done and it had great character development and the actors pulled it off professionally. I'd vote for Chris Weitz any day over Catherine Hardwicke. And I fully agree to the fact that there was actually chemistry between the characters now - not so much in the first movie.<br/><br/>One more thing - I just want to mention Dragon Ball Evolution as the most horrible movie adaption ever made and compared to that New Moon is a really great adaption to a book with more than 5-600 pages and it really deserves a lot more credit without considering its crazy fan girl base and the haters that try and bash the movies solely to kick it out of the mainstream. I'm sure that if it wasn't because of the Twilight hype going on it would go a lot more unnoticed as any other movie and just be appreciated as another romance movie. New Moon even does a good job on adding extra action sequences than there were in the books and though it's a tricky and dangerous thing to add more than there originally was Weitz really pulls it off.<br/><br/>But one thing I've got to say - I was very disappointed there was no Charlie in the end of the movie yelling ""BELLAA!!"" Anyone who read the book would know what I mean. But all in all, 10!"
"karishma-5","9","3","14","24 November 2009"," Great direction and acting given the material.
","Before I launch into a review of the movie, I need to specify that while I love Stephanie Meyer's writing style, I'm not particularly crazy about the Twilight series for the following reasons: 1) Bella is one of the weakest characters I have ever seen and no matter how much Stephanie Meyer claims that she is strong, I disagree. 2) Edward is unreal in every way possible. 3) The only real characters don't get nearly enough attention, these being Jasper and Jacob. 4) I have a basic aversion to obsessive romances.<br/><br/>Now, having said all that, there is something about the story that caught me when I watched the first movie (Ihad never even heard of the books at the time).<br/><br/>The first movie was good (not truly great), but to be perfectly honest, I prefer the second one, and I think the credit goes mainly to the director. Chris Weitz's graphics work is amazing as usual and though there were weak points in the film (which I will not mention as I don't wish to prejudice anyone), I thought that the manner in which he managed to pull out emotions from all the actors in this installment was much better than the first movie. Additionally, I much prefer the colors in this second installment as opposed to Hardwick's version (the blue overlay was too much for me, too fake spooky when it needed to feel more real.)<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart's acting in this installment, I personally feel, is better than what she did in the first one. She wasn't as wooden for one and I really felt her pain this time.<br/><br/>Robert, unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations of him. But then,I've never been team Edward so that might have been part of the problem(although I am definitely Team Robert, and will definitely go check out Remember Me, which looks really good based on the trailer.)<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner carried this movie from beginning to end in my opinion. Since I happen to know that they used his facial expressions for the wolf, I am even more impressed because the wolf was amazing!!! Taylor is maturing quite quickly and as such I understand why his facial expression remained a certain way for most of the time and anyone who doesn't get it, is basically missing out on the tone of the entire series.<br/><br/>I do, however, feel like Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning were wasted in this movie owing to their small roles (which they performed to perfection). They have me anticipating the Breaking Dawn movie with baited breath.<br/><br/>Everybody else did as well as can be expected.<br/><br/>The weakest point though was the script. I definitely think Mellisa Rosenberg needs to be fired. No offence to her, but she is just not doing a good enough job to improve one Stephanie's work, which is much needed.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I really enjoyed the movie and when it ended, my reaction was like What???? It's over??? Already??? <br/><br/>And to me, that's a good thing."
"wheeleran","10","2","8","30 April 2013"," Beautiful and soulful - arguably the best of the Twilight saga movies
","I saw this movie several times in the cinemas when it was released and again before I saw Eclipse for the first time. It is a beautifully filmed and soulful movie. The emotion is very authentic and everyone really steps it up a notch in the acting department.I love all the Twilight saga movies but this is arguably the best. These movies and this one in particular got me through a very painful time in my life so a big thank you to all who made this movie happen especially S Meyer & Rob & Kristen & Taylor. Everything about this movie works - I like how each character gets to show their personality. The relatively unknown actors shine in their small but special roles - the wolf pack have a great vibe as do the bad vampires. It's obvious when you watch it that it was a complete team effort with love at its heart - good one C W :)"
"ppapas_7","7","2","8","21 April 2010"," KNOW what you are expecting to see and then it's a pretty nice movie!
","I hate all this reviews that says this movie is bad or this movie is fantastic! Let's get one thing clear.<br/><br/>Every movie is destined for a certain audience, for a certain type of audience and offer a certain type of entertainment. Before you go see a movie it's critical to know WHAT TO EXPECT! Why are you going to see it and what kind of entertainment you expect from it.<br/><br/>So if you saw Twilight and didn't like it don't bother watching this one. But if you liked it or you won't be bothered to see the sequel well then I recommend it. It has a well played script that gives exactly the character of the book and the essence of New moon for things that will follow. Directing is actually pretty good so why not watch it? <br/><br/>So I disagree with those that says it's a bad movie. It's bad if you don't know why you are watching it. It's not a masterpiece either not is a movie that I would recommend to anyone without caution. But if you want to see this kind of movie the Yeah it's pretty good one and two hours well spend."
"wisherc13","6","2","8","22 March 2010"," Grossly Underrated
","No, this is not the greatest movie ever made. Yes, some of the lead actors do horrible jobs (I shan't name names, you can figure that one out for yourself)- though I blame the original director more for that for poor casting in Twilight. The editing and mise-en-scene are a bit obvious at times as well and they take full advantage of marketing Lautner's new body.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I believe it's also grossly underrated. Based on other posts on this site I was actually dreading watching it- I thought it was going to be another ""Twilight"". But based on the script and some of the young actors he was given, Chris Weitz did an amazing job; far, far, faaaar better than the former director.<br/><br/>The cinematography is improved (much warmer and simply more pleasant to look at overall as opposed to the grey, cold colors from the first film), he elicited better performances from all the actors, even the bad performances were markedly improved, and he seems to have put more thought into filming the movie overall (as opposed to Hardwick who seemed to only want to get across the cheesiest, clichÃ©, chick-flicky aspects of the series...).<br/><br/>Even the script is improved- it covers more of the book and gives the actors better material to work with.<br/><br/>As formerly stated, this is not a fantastic film, but it's not sub-par either, and it's doesn't deserved below a 5 or 6/10 rating overall in my honest opinion. It's an average, albeit very engaging film- worth seeing if only to develop your own opinions on it."
"callanvass","8","2","8","18 January 2010"," I don't care if I get bashed for praising this film, but New Moon entertained me heavily, and that's all there is to it for me.
","Now I'm not apart of the crazed female population, who go nuts over Twilight, nor am I a professional critic, or an expert . I'm a simple male who happens to actually enjoy Twilight related stuff. New Moon is a film that seemingly gets never-ending bashing, from movie critics and people alike. While everyone has a right to their opinion, I also have a right to mine. It's because of the ridiculous bashing that I decided to watch this online, rather than pay for money at the theater. All I had heard was, how wooden the acting was, and how the story is so incoherent. I don't look for constant flaws in a movie, nor do I really care, I know all about New Moon's flaws. All I care about is a movie entertaining me, and putting me in another world to distract me from my own problems, in life. New Moon is much darker than Twilight. Bella is much more fragile, she's suicidal and even dangerous to herself. I think it made for a much more interesting storyline this time around, because it develops the strong friendship, and even more from Bella and Jacob. I thought Taylor Lautner had the proper intensity, needed to play Jacob, dude was fit as hell too. The developing relationship between him and Bella, was a treat to watch.<br/><br/>The last 40 minutes or so, are absolutely suspense filled, and loaded with surprises. I liked how the movie ended just suddenly like that, to make us wait for Eclipse. It also had some decent humor bits too, from Bella herself. I would laugh when Edward appeared briefly in a blur, telling her no, and she would constantly disobey him, it added some much-needed humor. I thought the budding relationship of Bella and Jacob, was more interesting than the one that was going on with Edward&Bella, which is one of the reasons I'm looking forward to Eclipse, to see what happens there, since I haven't read the books. The slow motion effect of Bella running to Edward, was pretty cool in my opinion. It had a lot of suspense to it.<br/><br/>Performances. Kristen Stewart is more rounded this time around. I have heard nothing but criticism from her performance. Well I honestly felt, she was more matured this time around. She had a sense of humor this time, and had more to play with. She gave Bella her all, and looked amazingly hot to boot!. Robert Pattinson did OK, but his part isn't as required, until the finale. Taylor Lautner is actually pretty good as Jacob. He Doesn't have much to do in the 1st, while here the movie relies on his character heavily. He responded to the pressure more than adequately, and I give him plenty of props, for making me care about his character. I see big things for the lad. Billy Burke is solid as Charlie, but he isn't quite as important as he was in Twilight. Ashley Greene does OK as Alice, but does not have a lot to do this time around. Michael Sheen is a bit too hammy for my liking, as Aro, and was dwarfed by all the makeup he was wearing. Anna Kendrick has just become more self-centered here as Jessica.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. New Moon entertained me just as much as Twilight, and I don't really care what people think about that. It's not perfect, it has many plausible moments, but when all was said and done, I had a good time!. a 4. 5 rating, really? There are movies that are rated higher on here, that I felt deserve that rating, more then this one. Make up your own mind on this one, you might enjoy it like I did, but if you hate it like a lot of the others, that's okay too. But don't let the bad reviews stop you from watching it.<br/><br/>8/10"

"guess_wh0","7","2","8","2 December 2009"," Underrated and Misunderstood film
","I have taken my time(s) at the cinema to observe this movie. I am no movie critic, but I think I can make a point. People must have been very preconceived to rate this movie with 1 or 2 out of 10, seriously. I will try to explain why.<br/><br/>I read some of the reviews and was surprised that people compared this film to Jack Nicholson movies or other phenomenal movies... I cannot relate it in any way. There can't be comparison between so different things. If you need to compare K. Stewart's ""unnatural"" acting, then compare it to Emma Watson's (from the Harry Potter films) - was she a lot better at what she was doing? If you need to compare Pattinson with someone, pick Daniel Radcliffe. Was he any better overall? I could get into details about silly expressions and clenching teeth but I won't. Just think about it and tell me, what is all this ""bad acting"" fuss about? I've seen better than them and way worse than them. In my opinion, the movie was good overall. Better than 4.6 (current rating). Want some more comparison? Why is Jude Law's ""Please!!Don't do this!"" (in Closer) considered any less ""ridiculous"" than Stewart's line in the film? Probably because she hasn't yet had his experience and acknowledgement. But as a person she deserves some respect. I am not saying she is brilliant, of course not. But I am sure she tried harder than you think. She can't be responsible for some exaggerated camera angles that made her lines seem ridiculous. I find her very expressive, like Keira Knightley for example, and she just needs to control it better. Pattinson too, he isn't responsible for the choice of make-up, contact lens colour and hairstyling. He also isn't responsible for the fans that made him a sex symbol, which annoys some people who then become prejudiced against the whole ""teen"" movie... I think you get my point here. A lot is dependent on the production, and this was a low-budget production, based on a novel. It's not supposed to go for an Oscar. It is supposed to make some money for Summit so they can later produce better quality movies. This was for people who hated the movie before even watching it.<br/><br/>Another thing... I am reading this is a ""horrible message for girls"". What is that supposed to mean? It isn't telling girls to get depressed. It is describing a situation. If you have never been in deep love you won't be able to understand. Is it that in-sane for someone to love the other more than herself? I would think not. That person became the meaning of her life and when the meaning is taken away, you cannot just ""move on"". This was even funnier to read... ""Bella shows no interest in a career path"". It is a romantic film, if that isn't clear yet. Bella herself, is not supposed to be shallow. She seeks more to life than career, it subconsciously troubles her. Maybe that is why she is depressive. People who worry are depressive, true artists can be depressive. It is a human trait that cannot be rejected. Not surprisingly, all those comments come from men. Men don't always realize the need of a woman to be unconditionally loved. This is why we say the movie and books have a target group (women, yes).<br/><br/>If every film were to give a message, then the art of film making would have to be restricted. But we've seen many many horrible films with horrible ""messages"". And love has to be glorified, yes. It is better to die for love than die for money, or out of other shallow emotions like sheer craziness -like it happens in action or horror movies. What is the message of the movie ""Saw"", if it has one? What is the message of Sex and the City to girls - that shopping is the best hobby? Romeo and Juliet was some amazing poetry, but many would doubt Shakespeare's brilliance -if only they could- because he portrays a similar situation... people who think of love as the highest emotion to be experienced. People who would give their life for someone, those are the kindest and nicest people. If everyone were able to love, the world would be a better place. Not everyone is a romantic so it's understandable if you get bored by all the emotional features but don't be so harsh. There has been worse. This can't be 4/10.<br/><br/>So I first would blame the make up artists for the awful wrinkles and lipstick on Edward's face, then the director for some exaggerated shots. The soundtrack didn't bother me too much but could have been used better. The second time I watched the movie, I felt quite used to it whatsoever. Then I'd blame some moments of the script (the scene where Alice sees Bella and Edward as vampires could have been different and better than that). And THEN, maybe I would blame the acting, because it can't always be perfect. And we see that a lot... even with great actors. But just because they are considered great, we don't feel like judging them."
"neysa59","5","2","8","1 December 2009"," Not as good as the first
","I read all the books already and then watched the first one. I enjoyed the first one was done very well and stayed with the book pretty good. I was actually amazed because I didn't think it would be done well. So now I watched New Moon. Hmmmm. Well I honestly didn't expect it to be all that good because of basically Dakota Fanning playing the part of Jane. Well guess I was wrong on one part. It wasn't her that ruined it for me. I honestly don't think this movie was done well at all. And looking at all the ratings I wouldn't be surprised that the other two won't even be made now. It just seemed like to me that the parts that shouldn't have been rushed were rushed and then there were so many parts that seemed to drag out forever never should have been done. I can see why a lot of people didn't like this one at all. The last half hour was so rushed it was pathetic and took away from the big climax of what happened. It seemed like they though oh darn, we only have a half hour left and we haven't done this part yet. The acting yeah isn't the greatest but they did pull it off in the first one well enough. This one showed how bad the acting was I think because they dragged out parts they shouldn't of. Oh and don't get me started on the music. I don't think hardly any of it was any good in this movie. I don't know if because they had a different director or what was why this one wasn't as good but it wasn't. If they do end up making the next two I hope they learned from their mistakes on this one and at least do the other two some justice. I will grant you at least they did stick to the book pretty well, they just over emphasized a lot of parts they never should have. I basically would say don't bother seeing it in theatres, wait til it comes out on DVD."
"jlarssen-1","9","2","8","29 November 2009"," Let's Be Fair
","Obviously there are lovers and haters of this movie. I'm rating not as a stand alone movie based on it's own script but as a movie that is meant to portray the existing book. I have read all the books, and New Moon was my least favorite of the 4, but this movie portrays the book very well. So good job everyone, mission accomplished, but if this was a stand alone movie it wouldn't fly.<br/><br/>I think where we lose some people is in the ""unfathomable"" idea of soulmates and the illogical passion and decisions etc that go along with that. Obviously Jake is better for Bella, but she's already in love with Edward. The one big thing this series on film is missing is the pure chemistry between Edward and Bella, and more insight into ""Edward the tortured vampire"". The latter was better with this film. As others have mentioned, the chemistry between Bella and Jake was better in this one. But most complaints on the movie I've read are because the film was too close to the book... can't help it if Stephenie Meyer wrote it that way. If you don't like the books why are you seeing the movie? All in all, much better than the first one. I think it suffers just because the setup of the first movie wasn't as strong as it should have been (everyone should be strongly Team Edward with book 1)."
"pvafonso","6","2","8","27 November 2009"," Not as bad as many believe!
","I was never into vampire films or anything of the sort, such as strange animals, monsters or creepy figures! But just like I gave a break to the Harry Potter films (I know it cannot be compared!) and got involved, I decided to give a chance to this saga as well. This kind of films are made to appeal to teenagers and for sure the leading actors get tangled in the 'fans paranoia'. It's inevitable, it is how society works! For that reason alone it's a success! If you break the film, this one, into pieces and analyse it like a film critic (which I am not!) you will see many faults - disconnected dialogs, unrealistic details (I know it's a vampire film) and non-connection between some actors at parts on the film... Expectations!? What can you expect for a film like this? It's a film made for the fans and for that it has lived up to the expectations. Even though Robert's reduced presence might have broken some hearts, on the final part (If you have not read the book which is my case) you really start wiggling in your chair. The special effects also got its moments, the fight scene on the 'church' was impressive! And even if at points with low heat, the emotions are well portrayed. Bella's diary keeps you posted and you sense her discomfort. And then and after all its a film which gives you hope. And that's what films are also about - apart from educating and entertaining, they are also a wing into fantasy and magic!"
"jhazelett72","8","2","8","25 November 2009"," Better than I expected, and way better than others are saying!
","I'm having a significant amount of difficulty figuring out why New Moon is getting such a harsh reaction on IMDb. People on here have voted Children of Men, one of the most depressing, horrible films I have ever seen, an average of 8.1 stars. And yet, this film is at 4.5?! Now, I am an average guy. I like some sports movies, I love action, and I really don't like romantic comedies. I really enjoyed New Moon. Sure, the whole ""sparkly"" vampire thing is a little weird. However, it is done better here than in the first film. And the action is very cool.<br/><br/>My wife has read all 4 books multiple times, and she read the 2nd one again just before we went to see it in the theater. She said that some things did not happen the same way as in the book, and some things were left out or added here and there. People, it is a movie! This is what happens when books are made into movies. And for those of you who say it sends a bad message to girls, that is rubbish. Wake up, people! New Moon is a movie about vampires and werewolves, and one somewhat-normal girl who falls in love with a vampire. To imagine that a complete fiction such as this would be a life-lesson for anyone is ridiculous.<br/><br/>If you don't like the books, hated the first film, or have no interest in either, don't go see New Moon...you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. If you like the books, or even remotely enjoyed Twilight, then you should be happy with New Moon. In my opinion, it is an improvement on the series, and a very entertaining film."

","I'm not a stupid fan girl. I am a member of the general public who just so happens to have read Meyer's series, and enjoyed it despite it's ups and downs. I just so happen to be a teenage girl.<br/><br/>Anyways, this film was pure ecstasy if you liked the book. Now, I can't judge how it was for the non-book-reading audience, but I am almost certain that most fans will find their good old Twilight refuge in this movie.<br/><br/>A faithful adaptation to say the least, I honestly believe that it may just have bottled the essence of New Moon, something the Twilight film has failed to do to the book on which it was based.<br/><br/>Jacob was SMACK ON, along with all the Quileute material. As was Edward! So much more Edwardy than in Twilight! The vampires' makeup was exponentially better that in it's predecessor; even in the production photos, posters and such. I mean, Victoria's hair was... wow!<br/><br/>People will bash this. Call it awkward, hail Bella as a Mary Sue, do whatever the hell they want. But this film is in my ""Hearts-Hearts"" vault. Because it's so much like the book; it brings the excitement to life. Bravo, Summit. You've reawakened the pain surrounding the love triangle I felt while reading the books. :D"

For this type of a movie, it does its job very well. <br/><br/>You get exactly what you expect from all of the leads.

"elektrikmistress","6","2","8","23 November 2009"," See it if you like (and read) the books..
","First off, can I just say here that if you're going to write a movie review, PLEASE use spell check and have a basic grasp of grammar. It's hard for me to take your review seriously when you cannot differentiate between 'hole' and 'whole' or 'they're/their/there'.<br/><br/>Everyone is going off on what message this (story) sends to girls, etc. And I do agree - to a point. But I would hope that parents would speak to their daughters about realistic expectations and I would also hope that people realize this is *fantasy*. There are no sparkly vampires out there; unless we're talking about an emotional 'vampire' that uses body glitter.<br/><br/>Take the movie for what it is - a companion piece to the book. For that alone, it is a decent movie. However, I can't praise the film beyond 'mediocre'. Here's why: 1) Kristen Stewart. She has one facial expression. Really. Bella had more personality in the books, she actually smiled and cracked jokes.<br/><br/>2) The film was choppy. You weren't necessarily sure why things were happening, some major plot points and key dialogue were missing.<br/><br/>3) Wardrobe. Who dressed Alice in painter's smocks and grandma's housecoat? This girl is supposed to love couture, sky high heels and the latest in fashion. This was not translated well. At all.<br/><br/>4) Getting big name actors - and giving them one line. I don't think I need to expand on that.<br/><br/>5) Whatever they did to Jasper's hair. Yeah, that's sort of a personal ""Why?"" thing, but still, horrid!! I still enjoyed the movie, though. It is interesting to see how someone else interprets the visuals of the book(s) in comparison to how you imagined them. Many of the locations were just as I pictured them when reading the books, so it was like seeing parts of the book brought to life.<br/><br/>And let's be honest - it is amazingly nice to look at Rob. Perhaps the ""goth"" in me is dying hard, because seeing him all pale and vampire-ish made him even hotter, if possible.<br/><br/>I really don't recommend the film if you haven't read the books. From an outsider's POV, the films are too disorganized and key plot points are missing. But, if you already know what's going on - and what's going to happen - it is fun to see it brought to life on the big screen. Plus, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner and company do bring some drool-worthy eye-candy to the party.<br/><br/>As a stand-alone film, it sucks. I'm sorry to the ""twi-hards"" out there, but it's true. The books themselves were a study in mediocrity, how you expect the films to become anything better is setting yourself up for disappointment."
"xjuteveux","7","2","8","22 November 2009"," The haters hate this movie
","I've been really looking forward to seeing this movie because Twilight was really horrible,and I love the books so dearly. As soon as I heard there would be a different director I had some hope for new moon. The first thing I did when this movie went nationwide was check this site for the rating it got. I was really disappointed to see that it had gotten a 4/10! I was still planning on seeing it, but went into this thinking it was going to be terrible.<br/><br/>Guess what? It wasn't terrible! It certainly doesn't deserve a 4/10. The acting overall was better, although still in need of improvement. The story line made sense, and it was way more true to the book than the first movie. The special effects were cool too. My boyfriend went with me and he has never read the books, but he saw the first one with me and hated it, and after seeing this one he said ""the movie wasn't that bad.""(and he's a pretty harsh critic) But it's true! I was really pleasantly surprised. I mean obviously there are some corny scenes, but again, not deserving of a 4 rating.<br/><br/>I think one of the problems was that the first movie didn't really set up the relationship between Bella and Edward properly. They have an all consuming, soul mate, can't live without each other love. This was not really established in the first movie.<br/><br/>So why does this movie have such a low rating?I think some people out there just love to hate the twilight series. I mean the first movie made it embarrassing for anyone over the age of 15 to admit they like the books. It was really butchered, and I think New Moon really was an improvement.<br/><br/>Give it a chance, have low expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised too."

","Wow... I really don't know where to start with this one so I'll just get straight to the point – This movie was a steaming pile of crap. Nothing about it worked. Nothing at all.I didn't want to see this film because the previous one was lacking in... well... everything. But girlfriend wanted to see it. I went in and was instantly surprised to see the demographic had widened past 12-16 year old girls who instantly swoon at any even remotely hot guy so that was interesting. i loathed.It had horrible acting, and cringe-worthy dialogue. so i was extremely disappointedI cut them some slack with Twilight, but not with this one. To say the book was butchered is an understatement. I was fully prepared to take a long, depressing ride with Bella into the depths of h**l, but instead took a trip down comedy lane. What was the point of all those ridiculous one-liners?That being said, I thought this movie was a massive failure. The entire movie was very slow, long, and awkward.The actors were terrible; there was no chemistry between them at all. The dialogue was clumsy and clichéd. The special effects were just awful. However, the biggest crime that New Moon commits is that it was boring. Very very boring."
"Cherkay","7","2","8","21 November 2009"," I really enjoyed it and thought it was much better than Twilight.
","I've never written a movie review before but thought I would give my thoughts on this one. I'm 34 and read all the Twilight books about a year and a half ago and loved them. I didn't really care for the Twilight movie but I have to say I really enjoyed New Moon. Personally I thought it flowed so much better than Twilight and had a brighter feel to it. Twilight made me want to go to sleep. The acting definitely improved. I still don't think Kristen Stewart and James Pattinson are great actors but Kristen irritates me a lot less in this one. I think Taylor Lautner did a great job as Jacob. Almost too good, though. In my opinion he overshadows Edward in the movie because he looks better and acts better. Overall though I really enjoyed the movie. It was funny in parts and not nearly as depressing as the book was. I didn't find it to be boring at all like many of the other reviewers. I also thought they did a good job of following the book. Although it probably helped that I hadn't read it recently so I didn't remember all the details. Some of the scenes were exactly as I had pictured them in my head during the book. I am surprised at the negative reviews. I went with ten other women (30, 40 and 50 year olds) and we all liked it better than Twilight. I think we have to remember that this is a book series written for teenagers so of course the movies are going to try to appeal to them. If you keep that in mind and overlook some of the flaws the movie is very entertaining. The teenage girls in our packed theater seemed very happy when they left so I think they accomplished what they were looking for."
"sean-gtrrz","6","2","8","21 November 2009"," New Moon. Some bad things, but mostly good things.
","Okay so as we all know, The Twilight Saga has become one of the biggest hit franchises of the 21st century. I won't deny that I really do love the series, I think that Stephenie Meyer had a vision that was so perfectly mapped out into four books, which I think were very well written. But here's the main issue, the movies aren't going to be just like the books, I can respect that, but I really think the director, crew, and actors could have done a much better job on reinventing Stephenie Meyer's wonderful creation. Now, there were some very good things about this movie which I will comment on. When it comes to CGI and visual effects, I give New Moon a big pat on the back, after watching the futile attempt at good CGI work in Twilight, it was actually nice to watch a Twilight movie with good effects in it. If that was what was stopping you from seeing New Moon, go right ahead and watch it, you won't be disappointed. Aside from that, the acting in this movie was noticeably better than that of the first. You can tell that the actors grew a closer relationship with each other and this made them more comfortable when acting in intimate scenes. I think Bella and Jacob's relationship is very precise when it comes to translating it from the book. Taylor Launtner did an excellent job at acting as Bella's main love interest. As for Bella and Edward's relationship, I could feel a closer connection towards the end of the movie. I believe that in time this connection and the actor's connection will continue to grow and with that the movies will only get better and better. Well, in all, this movie was good. I really thought it was much better than the first. If your a fan of the books, definitely go and see it. For me, it was definitely worth the price of a movie ticket. I give The Twilight Saga: New Moon 6 out of 10 stars, but that's just my opinion, go and see for yourself how this matches up to your expectations."
"pepps_1908","7","2","8","21 November 2009"," A thrill to watch, Thanks Chris Weitz!
","May I just say that when I watched Twilight, I found it extremely boring, and dull. At first I blamed the director and the cast, but thinking back to it, the reason I found it so monotonous was because of the non-stop TV spoilers, and exclusive clips they fed us fans. they showed us all the exciting clips, leading us to think: oh! this movie's going to be FANTASTIC! So when the time came to watch the movie, all the exciting clips were already seen, which left all the 'not-so-exciting' bits of the movie left to see. so this year, at a last attempt to keep my adoration for the books, I avoided all exclusive clips, and photos from the movie. I just came back from watching the movie, and needless to say, I thought it was TERRIFIC! sure, the acting wasn't top notch, but it had charm, wit, and made me laugh a few times (In some sad bits a little tear appeared). It may not be Oscar worthy, but better compared to Twilight. It is still unfair to compare the two, because of the circumstances last year to this year that differ so greatly, but any-who, I found the movie enjoyable and fun to watch. On an end note, I am a fan of the series, being fourteen and into romance books. but if you really don't want to be let down with Eclipse, please, please, do not watch the spoilers or exclusive clips. you don't have to do this, but it really helps."
"kristinfairy","5","2","8","21 November 2009"," I am totally confused - my review may contain some spoilers
","I am a die-hard fan of the series. I have read all the books of the twilight saga and I have watched Twilight too. I went to see New Moon on the opening night in Greece and although I can say that the movie was true to the book I can't say that I liked it or maybe it is best to say that I only liked some parts of the movie. <br/><br/>First of all, I think that the movie was just a sum of the scenes that the die-hard fans wanted to see, like we were all following a check list or something and I thought there wasn't any true cohesion between them.<br/><br/>Secondly in my opinion the chemistry that there was between Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in the first movie of the series, was somehow gone and replaced by awkwardness and stupid looks. In the first movie, I really loved the way Robert was playing the character of Edward, I don't know what happened to him in New Moon, his playing was just bad. <br/><br/>Also Kristen Stewart just SUCKS in this movie. I really liked this girl, in the previous film, I though she had her own way of getting in the role of the character but in New Moon she was terrible. She was doing all the time this stupid eye blinking thing, which I didn't understood at all. I thought that she couldn't portray at all, Bella's feelings. <br/><br/>I think this movie belongs to Jacob and the actor portraying him. (Taylor Lautner). I really believe this kid has done an excellent job. He really got into the role and although I am not a fan of his, in this particular movie I really really liked him. He was the only actor that was actually playing, while the others were just sharing stupid moments of silence and awkwardness. Congrats Taylor!!!<br/><br/>Finally I hated the make up they used on actors. Especially the colors they used for Edward. OMG it was terrible. They made his skin look somehow gray and not white as it should be and his lips were kind of strange, like they were smudged with a brown lipstick or something. Totally, totally bad!!! Also what happened to Edward's hair? In all the four books and in Twilight too, Edward is supposed to have bronze messy hair. Maybe that sounds like a tiny detail but for this character this detail was his trademark. So where is it??? The vampire eyes were kind of strange too. I preferred the Twilight version. <br/><br/>Finally, the wolves were bad. They seemed fake to me. Like the wolves of a video game or something. I was waiting for so long for this movie to come out and unfortunately I was disappointed."
"Chris Knipp","6","2","8","20 November 2009"," Trading monsters
","'The Twilight Saga' refers to four books, soon to be five, in the teen cult series by Stephanie Meyers about vampires in the Pacific Northwest and a young woman named Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart, on screen) who falls in love with one of them. You'd have to never go through a supermarket checkout stand not to know that Robert Pattinson, who plays Bella's pale undead beloved, Edward Cullen, is the number one heartthrob du jour. Pattinson's chiseled face, gypsy moth eyebrows and blood red lips peer out from every tabloid. 'Twilight' debuted a year ago in the first of what is anticipated as a franchise. Now the second film has come out.<br/><br/>And for the squealing teenage girls who're the main (but by no means only) fans of the series, the titillation goes on. Essential to it, apparently, is the fact that the love of Bella and Edward is never consummated. These Washington State vampires, the Cullens, live like sedate, well-off middle-class folks, who can occupy a posh modern glass house because there's so little bright sunlight in that part of the country. They're so well-mannered they have adopted a different lifestyle, avoiding the consumption of human blood. Edward Cullen refuses to ""turn"" Bella by taking a little bite into her veins, despite her repeatedly begging him to bring her into the vampire world. Though he adores her, he believes it better for her to remain a human, so he practices several kinds of abstinence. Noble fellow, this Edward. And he can fly through the air and lift an SUV when he wants as well. One never knew that vampires could have ""lifestyle choices,"" while remaining ageless, super-powerful, and immortal.<br/><br/>All this was interesting and fun when it was new to the neophyte in the first 'Twilight' movie. Unfortunately things slow down considerably in 'Twilight' 2, partly, perhaps, due to the more well-ordered direction of 'About a Boy's' Chris Weitz. Maybe Catherine Hardwicke (of 'Thirteen' and 'Lords of Dogtown') was unpredictable and difficult during the first 'Twilight' filming as rumors go, but her segment had spark (and, whatever the criticisms of its dialog and acting, was wildly successful at the box office). This one has less novelty -- and puts Edward in the background as he and his family, worried that the temptation of Bella's blood might become too great, depart from Forks, WA. Things plod leadenly from then on. The bloom is looking to be off the franchise already; it doesn't look like we've got another 'Harry Potter' on our hands.<br/><br/>Bella finds solace by hanging out with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and helping him rebuild a couple of motorcycles. Jake is a total contrast to Edward -- a bronzed hunk, and recently rebuilt himself. Lautner boasted in promo trailers that he had put on 30 pounds of muscle between 'Twilights' 1 and 2. And when he first whips off his shirt the girls in the audience ooh and ah loudly. But he's not suave and witty like Edward, just sincere and warm and sort of healthy, in short, everything a self-respecting vampire is not. He's sweet and, well, buff and all, but not very magical. There isn't a lot more to say till it turns out Jacob and his Native American clan are werewolves -- but again of an updated sort, since they mainly run around shirtless in cutoffs and only turn into giant wolves when absolutely necessary to fend off vampires -- or if they get really, really mad. (Obviously Jake and Edward have got some negotiating to do.) The moon doesn't seem to have much to do with it. These giant werewolf leaps are the only major forays into CGI this time, and they're more repetitious and less fanciful than the ones in 'Twilight' 1.<br/><br/>Edward's several lies when he quits Bella include the claim that she'll never lay eyes on him again. In fact he constantly reappears (in restrained CGI) to warn her against Jake and his pals and anything likely to bring on an adrenalin rush. Jake's just a ""friend"" to Bella, though he's smitten. This time the relationship is not only sexless: they don't even kiss. The stories must satisfy an adolescent girl's fears and ambivalence about boys. Both Edward and Jake are utterly desirable, but also dangerous monsters. But while the danger turns into some explosive CGI from time to time, it never lastingly scars the heroine.<br/><br/>One of the pleasures for me this time last year was the opportunity to see the glossy, Hollywood-fake 'Twilight' 1 story in the same week as Tomas Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In,' a remarkable and memorable Swedish film that, amazingly enough, also concerns teenagers in love, one a vampire, but treats the subject in a way that's truly arresting and strange, yet far more real than Ms. Meyers' conceptions. 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' isn't as much fun to watch without a better movie about the same subject to compare it with.<br/><br/>And what to make of the finale of 'Twilight 2' -- the return of the Cullens to Forks (after a tedious Italian episode even more boring and lame than anything in the Tom Hanks Dan Brown movies), and Edward's asking Bella to marry him? The appearances of Dakota Fanning and Michael Sheen as Volturi in Italy (don't ask) add nothing. But, anyway, with all the threats of vaporizing vampires and vampirizing the heroine are dropped, a marriage proposal as the climax? When things get this retro, you begin to see the logic of Edward's having been born in the year 1900."

","First off, let me say that I am not a tween girl who has never seen a topless man, and that I was still very pleased with New Moon. The movie was much truer to the book than the Twilight film was. It included more of the little details, from the dream at the beginning of the movie to the movie theater with Jacob and Mike with ""hands positioned identically, palms facing up, on the armrests"", to the werewolves running around in their shorts because wearing more clothing makes for a heavier burden for them to carry in their wolf form. Sure, there was some director creativity in some of the scenes: more action with the Volturi and the confrontation with the wolves, for example. But overall, the reaching themes of the book were portrayed on the screen. It began like the book, portrayed the emotions of the book, and ended like the book. To top it off, Kristen Stewart FINALLY showed some acting ability and portrayed the character of Bella better. Not perfectly, but definitely better than she did in Twilight. The special effects were commendable, the acting was much improved, the music suited the story, and the parallels to the book were drawn well."
"grosie922","8","4","24","20 November 2009"," Loved it
","I thought the movie was surprisingly good. I saw the first Twilight movie and was really disappointed, this was definitely a few steps up from the first one. The lighting and the scenery was better. I think the acting was even better, although I can't yet decide if I love or hate Edward and Bella's acting in the movie. I like them because they don't do such a typical oh i'm so in love with you deal, but then again something is just not right between them, they are missing something and I can't figure out what it is. Another con would be that the movie kind of drags a little in the middle, I guess they were just trying to follow the book since the book is mostly all about Jacob (and Bella of course), but for someone that is not a fan of the books I think it might get a little on the boring side for them. Overall, I thought the movie was really good, but then again I am a huge fan of the books so I'm not sure if an outsider will like it as much as me. I loved Jacob here, and it doesn't hurt that he shows off his hot bod in about 90% of the movie."

","I know it wasn't the best or most brilliant movie in existence. It wasn't identical to the book. But I really enjoyed it. I think if you go in with the expectation that it will be exactly like the book you will be disappointed, but if you realize that it has to be adapted to make it more visually pleasing and appealing to a larger audience, you will enjoy it. Taylor Lautner is such a great Jacob--I'm so glad he wasn't replaced. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are both adequate for their roles--I think their performances have improved from the first movie, in fact. Michael Sheen was incredible as Aro, and the Volturi set was great. There were lots of high points to this movie. Stop worrying that it's not EXACTLY what you think it should be and enjoy it for what it is-a good, entertaining movie that was basically just as faithful to its book as most other movie adaptations are."

Of course, as I am a huge Twilight film, I loved this film and have read the book countless times. I would definitely recommend it to my friends, they've seen it and they love it as much as I do. I thought the film was great and it was awesome, and I cannot wait for Eclipse coming out in July. <br/><br/>I thought that the acting was great for the actors, and I don't understand why everybody is picking on Kristen Stewart's acting. She does a great job of acting and I don't know why people pick on her.<br/><br/>The storyline was just like the book. Yeah, they might have missed a few things out, but it was still good for me."

The score of the movie is outstanding and the soundtrack is very good too. However what I was most impressed by was Kristen Stewart. She was amazing! I wasn't expecting to like her so much but she brought Bella to life. People who are not fans of the book may not completely understand this movie.

"lsurefirel","8","2","9","8 December 2009"," An appropriate balance of idyllic and thrilling moments.
","Based on all the dissatisfaction expressed about the movie, from professional journalists to the masses, I was expecting a lackluster, possibly sleep inducing movie. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by it. Well, I am an adult fan of the book series, so many people would probably disregard my view. Enough digressing on my part. What is redeeming about New Moon is that the movie manages to cover all the significant milestones in the story smoothly, adequately and yet, at the same time, allow for character development. To put it simply, it was entertaining for the right reasons. I did not feel bored in spite of knowing what was to come and there was a fair share of romance, friendship, devotion and excitement to keep me intrigued. To add to that, I actually found how vulnerable (emotions wise) the 2 protagonists were endearing. That was what made Edward's and Bella's feelings more relatable. The background music was very fitting too. Finally, Bella's somberness over her companion's absence seems appropriate given that she is supposed to be an introvert who is despairing over the loss of her significant other as opposed to some perky, gregarious girl who might heal faster or find other activities to occupy her time. So twihearts, don't despair over all the flak generated. What is the most important is that you yourself enjoy the movie and don't feel that you have wasted your money on it. :)"

","Taylor Lautner is amazing! His beautiful combination of abs, pecs, biceps, and charm. It may sound like I'm biased because of him, but even beyond the wonderful casting (with the exception of Kristen Stuart) the movie was well made. For all those who say sequels are almost always disappointing, you've just found another exception.<br/><br/>Yeah, there were the trademark cheesy Twilight dialogue and yeah, the movie is geared towards teeny boppers, but it was still hilariously moving. The romance between Bella and Edward however seems underdeveloped. I still do not see how they love each other so deeply (is it just because of her blood!?). All in all, great movie!"

","This may not be the best movie out there but you have to agree that this movie is much better than the first one. I've read all the books and in the beginning when the first movie came out, I didn't really want to watch Twllight because the trailer looked very boring and not interesting at all. But my friends kept telling me to watch it and so I did. I saw a bit of the movie and realized that it was crap! I turned off the TV after 10 minutes. The gray and dark colors in the movie kinda ruined it and so did the acting. <br/><br/>But New Moon is different and I kind of liked it. It's not my favorite movie but I think that Taylor Lautner really did an amazing job in here and so did the others. They found the right people to play the characters. Some of the acting was a bit too overreacted. But there is one thing I want to say about Kristens acting, she can't scream, I'm truly sorry but when she screamed in this movie I couldn't stop laughing, it sounded like a pig in pain.<br/><br/>If your fan of the books you should watch this movie, it's worth it."

The overall was much better than the first one, it was a better mirror of the book than I expected. The Volturi part was partly disappointing. I expected something more...grand.

"elisabetra","6","2","9","28 November 2009"," Not nearly as bad as the first movie
","This movie was so much better than the first piece of garbage, that I have to give it a relatively decent rating. I went in with low expectations, partly from the bad reviews I've been reading, and also just knowing how weak the second book's plot line is compared with the rest of the series. I was pleasantly surprised with this film.<br/><br/>The makeup and special effects were better, there was more humor and more action, lots of sex appeal. The musical score was also better. All in all, this director did a great job with a poor source material. He turned that junky 2nd book into something relatively amusing, that didn't feel torturous or like a total waste of time.<br/><br/>I was thoroughly entertained for about 1.5 hours out of the 2 hours. Unfortunately the movie jumps from really high action to suddenly slow (and unnecessary) dialogue sequences which just plod along. The movie is incredibly faithful to the book, including all major and minor characters and same plot outline. I don't recommend it unless you are a fan of the series or have low expectations as I did."

"junkstuff-12","8","2","9","26 November 2009"," new moon Cleary good, but Summit Entertainment has to take responsibility for it's shortcomings.
","I knew it and had written about it a couple of times. If these movies were not done exactly right, then the treasure contained within the book series would be lost. As I stated here before, people were talking about the twilight series as being the next Harry Potter. Well, what did that mean exactly. It meant that the Author had given the movie studio, production crew, screen writer(s) and director(s) had a plethora of well written fictitious treasure to work with. The books were huge and are still very high in top rankings. This meant that there is a certain responsibility the movie studio inherits, to deliver the quality product that the fans want. Do that and you have a blockbuster, a series of successful movies that everyone will enjoy. Do it not and you get what Summit pictures and their leader has unfortunately given us. Insufficient funding, rushed (Impossible.) schedule and zero lack of understanding of what it was they had.<br/><br/>The book series of what I like to think of as 'Fine Art Literature' would easily sell itself as a potential blockbuster movie, producing resources for the Studio, but not the movie series they are throwing out there. People are used to seeing faced paced, quick action, short flicks with little depth. Monster flicks with lots of good graphic violence in them, where Blade, or Van Helsing saves the day. Run time: 90 minutes, good for television, bad for movie art.<br/><br/>The series of books were obviously very good. Bella was written as a serious, responsible, literate and smart teenage girl. Edwards and his family of Vampires, have chosen a family life and not to be monsters. Vampires that actually contribute to society, instead of prey upon it. Edward, who has lived 100 years, had learned the rarity and the value of love. Edward knew full well that love meant putting the other's feelings, wants, desires and needs before his own. Edward loves Bella completely and utterly without restraint. So much so, that he leaves her to give her the best chance at a great life without his interference, or hurting her. That's a damn deep subject and by the way, it's also what makes life worth living. Even us regular mortals, with our regular lives oftentimes have difficulties with subjects like these. That's the whole point really. What is it you chose to be and what will you contribute to this life?<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart, Taylor Laughtner, Ahsley Green and Robbert Pattinson were perfect, in my humble opinion. I am proud of them all. Most of the others were also very good. I was proud of all the actors, given the ridiculously short schedule and lack of funding this movie received. It might have been better to have these actors in a play and skip the movie part, because that's really what we got. The actual screenplay was better than the first twilight movie. Of the two movies so far, this movie is the closest to the book. If Kristen Stewart actually did try and intercede in behalf of Katherine Hardwick and Stephanie Meyers, then she did great! I was very pleased to see the movie stuck so closely to the book. Now the wolves were not perfect, but very good. The rest of the movie was rushed together, the editing was not so good and harsh even. The music scores were not so good and not nearly as moving as twilight. Clearly Summit Entertainment failed, while those who worked the movie, tried to accomplish the impossible. Look beyond this as being a typical vampire movie and you will be rewarded with a great, fun, love story. new moon is funny, has profound sadness in it, good writing and is different from your run of the mill Vampire story. I'm 51 years old, I read the books and I look forward to the next. :)"

The Cullens throw her a party but Jasper gets overwhelmed by her blood. Edward refuses to turn her and the Cullens leave town. Mike tries to woo Bella. She starts to spend time with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and discovers that some of his tribe turn into werewolves. In despair, she starts risking her life for glimpses of Edward. After a particularly dangerous stunt, Jacob tells Edward that Bella is dead. Edward decides to end it all with the help of the Volturi, a powerful vampire coven in Italy, led by Aro (Michael Sheen). Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene) brings Bella to rescue Edward. The Volturi discovers that Bella is immune to their powers and Alice saves them by promising to converted her.<br/><br/>The dialogue is horrible. Every line is like something written by a high school kid. Bella is unrelentingly depressed from the very beginning. It's a continuation for the franchise which will be fine for fans. For everybody else, it's a slow slide into irrelevance. There is minor interest in Jacob versus Edward. However it's not done that well. Taylor Lautner's acting abilities resides mainly with his chest. It's not a good movie but it'll do for fans."
"Priskitteh","7","1","3","20 December 2009"," I don't understand
","Honestly, I don't really understand what people are discussing here. The movie is definitely not a very good one, definitely has a lot to improve to be considered good even, but people here are just insulting it for all the wrong reasons. I would say that they are using every excuse to call it trash. I think the major down sides of this movie were definitely the huge plot holes all along it. For somebody who hasn't read the book its nearly impossible to enjoy it. I can't believe the writer would allow such cutting, but apparently she didn't mind it. The direction isn't extraordinary but I wouldn't consider it horrible, the special effects are nicer than in the previous movie and I enjoyed the wolf parts. The fact that people keep on complaining about guys having no shirt is ridiculous, there are several explanations in the book about that and so they just followed the source, for once. I do not consider the guys attractive as they are shirtless, so I doubt I'm being biased. The criticism about the acting is out of place, if you ask me. The acting is nearly the best thing in this movie and I disagree with those who say the actors have always the same expression and such. I found that the actors are quite good at expressing the tension that characterizes most parts of the book. I do agree that the humor parts have been nearly completely left out, which was a tragic mistake if you ask me. To all those who are arguing whether or not Bella represents a good model for girls, your complaint goes to the saga, not to the movie. If you didn't like the books and their messages, you might as well have not gone watch it. I think everybody is trying to read more than there is to it. I very much agree with somebody who said if you don't like this kind of stories, don't go to the cinema to watch them and then whine about them. I consider the movie a rather mediocre one, it could have been SO much better, with little effort. If they had just grabbed the damn book and put the content in the movie, for starters. I realize time is a limit, but I prefer a movie that is very long or two separate movies to represent the story, than a bad movie with everything cut around and not-understandable. All in all, I would give this movie a 5/10, for the acting that I appreciated, the soundtrack that was quite appropriate in my opinion, and the special effects. <br/><br/>However, I would NOT recommend the movie to people who haven't read the book and/or do not enjoy romance and fantasy."

","When you have friends who have all the Stephenie Meyer's books at least once, and before the release of the movie the race is to finish the book once more. This is time you get dragged into watching Twilight Series - Second edition - New Moon. Even though you know, you are not going to be spooked, scared or traumatized by blood sucking vampires or bad smelly mutts werewolves. If it was true, i would not be watching scary movies in dark theatres.<br/><br/>Jacob who is running after shirtless and gets converted into super awesome werewolf, this is the only time i love the this movie, when i see werewolves, but after sometime, it reminds me of Remus Lupin from Harry Potter series. The story very complicated (pun intended) it is a choice between a werewolf and a vampire for the poor always dreamy looking and dreaming (Isa)Bella. The werewolf fight sequences have a nice CG effects being used, but then this is not an action movie, it a romantic movie of forbidden love.<br/><br/>On Edward, the vampire boyfriend, his appearance on the screen, i was always standing there, but you just notice my presence with the expressionless (read as stylish) look. On Bella, why is she so serious, she just doesn't smile in the movie, she can sit hours while a guy is fixing a motorcycle, months brooding or thinking over lost forbidden love. Whne the next comes along she has am awesome rebound relationship erupting only to realise that he is also not a normal human being. At the same time, you may be able to relate the feelings, but never the situations in your real life. At that very moment i was enjoying my caramel popcorn.<br/><br/>If you want to impress your girlfriend, then take her for this movie, there is something about this movie, story, novel that makes them start thinking and if you make them watch this movie, they will be yours in the forbidden love. But remember, this is not a children's movie no more, the audience have widened to even grandmothers. The violins in the soundtrack does spook you, but then they are there to bring in more dramatics in already abrupt jumping of scenes and countries, the soundtrack is pretty well done and and supports the cinematography."

","I am sick of reading all the horrible reviews this movies is getting from people who obviously have no taste and no idea of what good acting is! Have you ever seen a depressed person in your life? Have you ever been depressed yourself? I assume that you haven't because Kristen portrayed depression so well! So well that I was taken back to my depression and had a slight relapse and through that relapse I understood some things that I hadn't at that time of my life (and that is partly from seeing this movie) I have also seen so many people who have been depressed, and it was just like she showed! And the screaming in from her nightmares...so good! Edward did an excellent job as well! When he calls and finds out about the funeral, he just plays that so well and then when he goes to the Volturi....wow! Amazingly well done! And those people saying they have no chemistry...uh hello...there is total chemistry there. From the first moment that she sees Edward at the school lot, you can see the chemistry! Maybe you don't know what chemistry is....you probably need to find yourself a boy mate! I thought all the movie was well acted and well done! It followed the book well. Yeah it skipped some, but you can't get an entire book in a 2 hour movie -k- Get a clue people! The screenplay was excellent! You know, if you read the movie companion, Stephenie Meyer was involved in this entire movie! They called her for everything, and I say if it's good enough for the author of the book,then it's good enough for me! Granted the first time I saw the movie I wasn't sure if I liked it as well as Twilight. Of course I was at a bad angle, so everyone looked like they were Picaso's who had been to the dentist, but I saw it again and loved it! I have already seen it many more times and have plans to see it again this weekend! Keep up the good work guys! I'm anxious to see Eclipse and Breaking Dawn!

"evan_harvey","9","2","10","28 November 2009"," It's Twilight. Number 2
","It's Twilight. Number 2. I am not sure why people are so derisive about this film. You had to know what it was going to be like. If your girlfriend dragged you to it, then suck it up and enjoy the brownie points. If you saw it under your own stream and didn't like it, then as the sating goes, 'Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me'. Stop going to see films you obviously won't like. Sheesh!<br/><br/>**Possible spoilers***<br/><br/>After seeing the first one and quite liking it, I was waiting in line today with all the kiddies to see this one. New Moon was my favourite of the series, and I was thinking that maybe they wouldn't be able to pull it off, considering that Edward isn't in it for the most part. However, Melissa Rosenberg has done another outstanding job in translating the book to film again. It's well paced and captures it pretty well. The film looks good, but doesn't have the moodiness of the first film. It works well as a sequel and is a good follow-up to the first Twilight.<br/><br/>The downside is that the film's score is terrible. Twilight had quite a haunting score (by Carter Burwell), but New Moon is all badly placed pop songs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I think that the director sucked. The film should have been a lot darker than it was, and more like Twilight in it's feel (It IS the same series, after all). The director said he wanted it to be a 'romantic epic', but the fact is that book ISN'T. What a dofus.<br/><br/>Also, Kristen Stewart isn't a particularly good actress, but she is smoking hot. This film should have had far more emotional depth (yes, I am aware it's a kiddie movie). It wasn't terribly done, but not great either.<br/><br/>Team Jacob has definitely ascended."
"zeedunn","5","2","10","20 November 2009"," New Moon Has Some Good: Jacob, the Soundtrack
","I have a dirty little secret. I am 32 years old, and I have read the Twilight book series (all of them) and watched the movies. Now, I have a semi-excuse. I am a young adult librarian and service to teens is my first priority. This means I am supposed to know what teens enjoy so that I can use that knowledge to develop programs for them at the library. However, while this explains why I might have read a couple of the books, it doesn't explain why I chose to go see the New Moon movie at midnight this morning.<br/><br/>It was a last minute decision. I didn't have to work today so I thought, why not? Usually the big midnight releases are on Tuesday nights and I have to work in the morning. Plus I happen to live right down the street from a really cool community movie theater. It is quieter than the big cineplexes. I had no trouble getting a ticket at the last minute or finding a seat. They serve freshly popped popcorn, which yes, is a anomaly in the movie theater business.<br/><br/>So here's my reaction to the movie, and I'll attempt to do this without spoilers. Of course, it's pretty hard to spoil this movie when everyone knows the story for the most part.<br/><br/>The Good: The best parts of this movie are when Bella is alone or with Jacob. Their chemistry is real. And why wouldn't it be? Have you seen those abs? Little Jacob looks GOOD in this movie. The man-boy has a temperature of 140 degrees, and I am always cold. And when Bella is Edward-less, Kristen Stewart gives a fragile and sincere performance. I felt the wall she built around herself, and I felt it tumble as Jacob's warmth melts it away. I am on Team Jacob, but no one can deny that Bella and Jacob had a better connection in this movie. Maybe it's because Edward hardly shows up, but it's pretty obvious.<br/><br/>Okay, yes, there are some very cheesy parts in Taylor Lautner's Jacob performance. Couldn't they get him a better wig? But he did what this part required, he looked good (I read today that he had given up ice cream, poor guy) and he had a good combination of anger and brokenness to pull Jacob off. And he loses the wig halfway through.<br/><br/>I also have to say the soundtrack is outstanding. Some great songs, and maybe without the songs I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie so much. The right song can cover up many flaws in a film. I found links to the songs on youtube that were especially good. Hearing Damage by Thom Yorke played over a chase scene, and gave the moment an ethereal quality. The next one was Possibility by Lykke Li, which plays during a rather sad moment in the film. This singer reminds me so much of Julee Cruise (turn this one up, it has a great dance to it, too) who sang many of the tracks off of the Twin Peaks TV series soundtrack. Maybe not the exact sound or timbre, but just the feeling of despair you feel when listening to the songs.<br/><br/>The Bad: The vampires all look TERRIBLE in this movie. At the beginning scenes, Edward looks all right. But the vampires do not look good. I think in general, they have done a horrible job making these vampires look good. Most of the actors are attractive, but the makeup is so bad. They are all pale and frigid looking. The vampires are supposed to be alluring, but it didn't work out that way. When we first see Edward after a long absence, we are comparing him in our minds with the muscular, tan, warm person of Jacob. And Edward and Bella together have no chemistry. They had some in the first movie, but it's gone. Bella doesn't even seem to like Edward's company. And Edward looks constipated the whole time.<br/><br/>Go Team Jacob! I would say if you are a fan of these books and this concept, you should see the movie. If you have no interest in this series, the movies are not for you. What I want to know is, will it get better or worse? As a Jacob fan, I know I am going to hate the last movie, but the third one could be the best."

","OK, so it had good stuff, and bad stuff. Let's get to the juicy: the bad stuff.<br/><br/>So we meet some of the same problems the last one had. Starting with the performances. Robert. God, damn it. I don't wanna go where others. He's not a pathetic, awful actor. He just doesn't know drama. If u notice, the scenes where he's supposed to be funny he actually is! And knows how to put a face! But when he's being melodramatic his lines are like dull, and if it got a sigh from ur part (just like me) it's because of what it says, not how it says it. I'm feeling kinda guilty because I actually enjoyed the fight at the end when he got all of his ass kicked. I just couldn't stop thinking ""PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE!"" and say ""yes"" when it happened. That should made it. Kristen. Since the beginning I knew she IS a great actress, guiding me with her previous movies. In twilight she sucked. But in this one it is INCREDIBLE how u get to notice the bad directing with the good one. Her screams (which I always intended to love) made me goose bumps every time, and the only lines that made me bored are the ones when u can see she was a little bit stocked with the first one. Well, u can't expect them to change everything into perfect in just one movie. I'm not even mentioning Taylor (which acting was amazing, let's face it, the shirtless thing is not his fault), the wolves, the Cullens (specially Ashley and Peter), the Volturi, or the humans because their acting was really well made. <br/><br/>Next, we have the story. Well, we can't deny Melissa got better, but it still had some things that left u with a WTF face. I heard one of the girls in the theater that said the part when Bella gets injured and Jacob takes off his shirt is in the book so they made good by letting it in, but FOR GOD SAKE, at least make some more blood on her face! I mean, she literally had just ONE tiny cut and, in my opinion, it was only an excuse for Taylor shirtless. Although, I cannot complain ;) Another thing I didn't like is that, although we can see Bella is feeling REALLY bad 4 Edward's leaving, we didn't actually feel it. It just happens so fast you didn't quite notice. <br/><br/>Now I have to say this. When the Volturi kicked some ass from Edward (hehe) I could totally see Robert's cable!!! HHAHAHHAHAHAH I totally LMAO in that part. And the Volturi's faces. OMG! I cracked my ass there, too. It looked like they put some flour on their faces (not even their necks) and said: next one! AHAHAH Oh, and it seemed pretty obvious that all the guys LOVED to be shirtless. Ugh. Now the good stuff. -They kept a lot of dialogs from the book, which I loved. -The ending was just FANTASTIC. -Vampires' eyes got BETTER. -Action sequels were absolutely adrenalinic. -The scene with the cliff (including the whole Charlie-Victoria-Harry part). -Jasper's acting. Admit it, it got better. -Alice's outfits. -The relationship you can now REALLY see between the Cullens. -A lot of CGI effects. -The sets. -MUSIC! I loved it, the only thing it got bad is that it's like the same rhythm through the whole movie, but WTH! haha -The score. It was amazing. -Bella's screams :D<br/><br/>I have to make clear that I'm 15 years old and you have to understand that we like to make a big deal of everything, so if u get sick by hearing a bunch of girls scream when everyone's shirtless don't go on the premier, for god sake. Although even I got sick with everybody else because a bunch of girls where almost crying. Can u believe it? Anyway. Go see the movie. Don't get high expectations. Just enjoy it :)"

","i spent 90 bucks to see this film. Let me say - it WORTH IT. yes, there is not much Edward, but it is even less of him in book. Its a bit different story. About Bella hurt, about Jacob changing. Have you ever been in love and then your heart got broken?! try to remember what emotions you had (thats to the comments that Bella is non-emotions), i remember when i broke my heart i was numb. Wolves were relay well maid. But i do have to admit that if i did not read the book i might understand less, however, it is not a movie, cannot fitt all of it in it. I wish though they talked about Volturies a bit more. Loved the music. Waiting for the next movie. p.s. please remember, than the first Twilight weте out it was a new concept, just like Matrix...there for we want and expect the same soul reaping experience again, but it is not possible."
"silversnake_jj","9","2","11","28 November 2009"," A love story that captures the imagination
","Afer having read only negative comments on IMDb and youtube, I thought it was going to be a horrible film. I also haven't read any of the books, so I don't know how they compare to the movie. In general I rate movies on the basis if they make you FEEL certain emotions (anger,sadness,love).<br/><br/>At the start of the movie I told my girlfriend this was ""probably going to be horrible"". And I was prepared to watch something ridiculously awful. I was VERY surprised to find out that I enjoyed watching it! I REALLY felt what the characters in the movies were going through. And it was a very imaginative storyline. I also thought the love story was realistic, people want to be with the person they love no matter what. And they think about them all the time, even if they are not present. Also any decent boyfriend who truly loves their girl, would have done what happened in this movie. The action scenes also, were very nicely done. Watching them thrilled me.<br/><br/>I think the reason so many people think it is a bad movie is because they don't understand why the main character acts like she does. Well, I understood, she simply goes through the ups and downs of a relationship with the person she really loves. <br/><br/>I think everyone in the cinema was BLOWN away by the awesomeness of this film. In my book it's up there next to ""The Titanic"".<br/><br/>Go and watch it, you might like it as much as I did!"

","I have to say that i am a big twilight fan, i prefer the books but the movies allow me to picture the characters better. Anyways... In my opinion new moon was way better then twilight. Sure the acting wasn't perfect and the script wasn't good at all. But it had me from the moment it started. I thought the CGI was okay, i wasn't really expecting it to be perfect its not like i was going to the movie to see that. I went to see the epic love story and the introduction of Jacob Black to the love triangle. Which is what i saw. (I thought Taylor did and excellent job.) The ending was a good cliff hanger, and the movie stayed really close to the book. It was a little disappointing for some parts not to have been in the finale cut.<br/><br/>Overall i think the movie was good. Not award worthy but it was still good."

","OMG you guys, don't be such a hater! The movie wasn't that bad! it was definitely a step up from the first movie. Thank goodness they changed Catherine Hardwicke, no offense. I mean i was glad twilight was made into a movie but they really needed a new director which finally came down to Chris Weitz! I thought the werewolves were good even the Volturi. I thought they did a good job playing their part and wow Taylor, aka, Jacob, definitely looked the part! Umm the fighting scenes were also amazing but not the cliff diving part. It looked so unrealistic! But the soundtrack is awesome! I mean it really went along with the movie this time. I never thought i would ever like indie songs but twilight kinda opened my eyes and now i like them! And of course, Muse you can't go wrong with them! I luv the band and their music is just so unique! So glad Stephanie Meyer introduced them in Twilight!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were still some downside to the movie. I know Kristen still can't act, but eh what r u gonna do! Kristen is Kristen but @ least she improved a little from the first movie. Melissa Rosenberg, ummm, ya you might want to work on the script a little! i mean its not horrible but it could really use an upgrade. DON'T MAKE IT SOUND CHEESY! <br/><br/>Hopefully, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn would be as good as New Moon or better. Crossing finger! I can't wait!! omg I'm really hoping they'll make Breaking Dawn into two movies like Harry Potter! That would be amazing! :)"

"aharmas","9","2","12","27 November 2009"," Beauty and The Beasts
","""New Moon"" is the type of film that would appear immune to reviews and close scrutiny; however this adaptation is probably one of the best tributes to its original source, and the sources that might have inspired by Meyer. It holds up pretty well, with the story of the tragic and romantic liaison between the seemingly broody, but otherwise normal Bella, a girl who just won't quit in her quest to be with the love of her life, even if that means breaking a few hearts as she gets there. She is intriguing, intelligent, impulsive, and a bit reckless, the perfect character to appeal to young people. Then there is Edward, the lovesick vampire who doesn't know how to fix the various threats to their relationship.<br/><br/>They do have a few problems, a vengeful and powerful female vampire, the possibility of an all-out war with some impressive werewolves, one of which has a personal score to settle, and then there are those Italian beings, one of which appears to find Bella mystifying enough to keep her alive.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed the couple of unexpected twists, the way the sequels have been set up, and most of all the emotional shading Weitz has brought to the tale. When the change of directors was announced, I thought the formula had been ruined, but just like the Potters' latest entries, this has been a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Much credit should be given to the three leads who bring each character to life, showing nuances missing from the characters' development in the story. Stewart broods with enough conviction to make us belief her emotional involvement is quite special, and Pattinson embodies angst and hopelessness like very few actors, and the most welcome surprise is Lautner's tortured and broken-hearted werewolf, a worthy opponent and contender for Bella's heart.<br/><br/>The film is quite good and very enjoyable."
"joshuadrake-91275","6","1","4","23 September 2015"," An okay sequel!
","The film follows Bella Swan as Edward Cullen leaves Forks, Washington with his family after a conflict with his brother Jasper Cullen trying to kill Bella on her 18th birthday. Bella starts being depressed for months after her unexpected breakup with Edward. However, her dad decides to send her back to her mom until she starts spending time with her friends and develops a strong relationship with Jacob Black.<br/><br/>That is just the main premise of the story, but there is more to this movie's confusing and incoherent plot.<br/><br/>I'm not going to cry like a little girl over this film but I hate this movie. It's a sequel based on a book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer and I thought it would interest me but after watching this film with my sister LeeAnn, I just walked out my room in disgust and a lot of angry.<br/><br/>The plot is confusing as heck because it's really dumb and not a good idea. A lot of critics put down this movie which I am glad they did because this movie does not deserve to have universal critical acclaim and it's not really good at all. The plot is slowly paced and it's very long -- being at 130 freaking minutes long -- I will not watch The Twilight Saga: NEW MOON ever again in my life. I read the book and it's okay. I loved the book version, but once I watched the movie, I just found myself saying, ""What in the heck did I just watch?"". That is exactly how much I hate this movie.<br/><br/>The one part of ""NEW MOON"" that really got me mad is when Kristen Stewart's character, Bella Swan, is screaming in her sleep after Edward leaves (because she misses him) throughout the whole darn movie. That is just stupid and what an outrageous idea. By the time she finally stopped screaming, I was really ready for this movie to end quickly, but i had to see more of this slow-paced movie. Her screaming, it definitely drove me crazy.<br/><br/>They spent a cheap worth of money on this movie and this movie succeeds at the box office? The film cost $50 million dollars to make. Man, that is crazy. If i have to say anything nice about this movie, I will bring up the acting and the music. The music is by far, really good by Alexandre Desplat, who would later go on to compose the final two films in the Harry Potter film franchise, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"" and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2"".<br/><br/>The acting, from my point of view, falls flat. But I will give credit to Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and also Dakota Fanning, who plays Jane, while Stewart and Pattinson are playing Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, for a second time. Michael Sheen plays the role of Volturi leader Aro and he is really good and he played the werewolf character, Lucian in ""Underworld"", ""Underworld: Evolution"" and ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"". He played that part wonderfully and to see him in a TWILIGHT film is spectacular.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner plays the role of Jacob Black once again and he does a good job, too, but even then, it's incredibly over the top and he tries way too hard to make Kristen Stewart's character, Bella, like him. I do love the CGI werewolf version of Jacob, but the rest of the CGI is terrible. Some of the dialogue is horrible, but some of it is also really good. The pacing and editing is slow and awkward.<br/><br/>So, overall, I love and hate NEW MOON! I know it has it's fan base and THE TWILIGHT SAGA films does have it's fan base, so if you like this movie, that's fine, because we all have our own opinions."
"tieman64","Null","1","4","16 September 2014"," Animal Instincts
","Like all films in its franchise, ""Twilight: New Moon"" is about sex, celibacy and the art of respectfully losing your virginity....to vampires and werewolves. In this instalment we have Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a young woman on the cusp of adulthood, bleeding in front of a group of vampires. Overwhelmed by a desire to consume, these vampires lustfully lunge at Bella. They're stopped by Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a gentlemanly alpha-vamp who orders all vampires to stay well clear of Bella. Edward leaves as well.<br/><br/>As a girl must deliberate before she consummates, passion must wait. Bella thus spends ""Moon's"" second half in a state of depression, missing the men, vampires and outright rapists who once pined for her tantalising body. Pretty soon she's channelling her pent up sexual energy into various thrill seeking activities, hanging around dangerous locations and topless bad boys. They want her, she wants them, but are they right for her? Who to choose? With so many penises in the world, poor Bella faces an existential crisis! <br/><br/>Also facing an existential crisis is Edward. When false news that Bella has died reaches him, Edward resolves to commit suicide, a gesture which speaks to his all consuming love for her. Of course when news of Edward's faithfulness reaches back to Bella, she ends her philandering. She knows, finally, which man is right for her. ""I want to protect you,"" Edward says, wrapping the petite Bella in his gigantic shoulders, ""you're the reason I stay alive"". Bella melts. The couple propose and plan a wedding.<br/><br/>It's easy to laugh at the Twilight saga's themes of courtly love and its attempts at rekindling the chaste, romantic fantasies of yesteryear. But in an age when the sweetest thing you can tell a girl is ""I haven't needed pornography since I met you"", the puritanism of the Twilight Saga is almost endearing.<br/><br/>7/10 – See Stewart in the underrated ""The Yellow Handkerchief"" (2008)."

OK, first of all the music i excellent and it should get 3 out of 10 for that part only, acting is.., well if we could call that an acting cause scenario and script lines are plain awful, if someone take few weeks and change scenario for most of parts this would be a good movie, however chemistry between actors is nice, effects are well if it weren't for wolves there wouldn't be any, lets say good and there is a few enjoyable moments, but thats just not enough to fulfill giant gap between poorly executed script and mind dumbing serious sf/drama story which is needless to say one of the funniest ever in movie industry.<br/><br/>Shame, cause with little more mind at work at scenario, more intelligence between the lines, and better finalization this could be 7-10 but now its just poor shake 5 where 3 is for music only, and thats lowest you can go with A production and that kind of budget!

"NinjaGirl132905","6","1","4","25 November 2009"," Wow....there are no words
","I am a teenage girl in high school, probably the target audience for the movie series and even I have to say this movie was terrible at times. Just like the book the movie was a little slow with it's transition from one scene to the next, I actually got bored after the first thirty minutes of the movie which never happens. I think that Robert Pattison makes a decent Edward but they need to lay off of the amount of make up they put on him because it hides his emotions and expressions so he just looks mad all the time. Kristin Stewart...she pretty much ruined the whole movie and movie series period. Don't get me wrong she is a good actress in previous movies but she just doesn't have a good grip on the character of Bella. Her and Robert Pattison have no chemistry what so ever! The only reason why I am giving this movie a rating of 6 out of 10 is because all the other characters saved this movie. Taylor Laurtner is a very good actor and makes the perfect Jacob Black. At times he does seem a little overly dramatic but not too much. The actors that play the Cullen family were excellent but I was upset that they got little screen time. I would say that the only people who will like this movie will probably be die-hard Twilight fans who have read the books millions of times. I have read the book series but I am not obsessed but I will see the next movie just because I have read the books and hope that maybe just maybe the next movies in the saga will be better."

Did this happen to you; in some scenes, that intended to be acted romantic, made very funny impression in the cinema, and some people were laughing. And the end, this really sucked, what an idiot idea was to finish the movie with those words. It's waste of time and waste of money. The only person who did well acting was Taylor.

I reckon the next movie will be great as it will have more action scenes in it with wolves fighting vampires and so forth.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't so great. The person who played Jacob did a pretty good job, the person who played Laurent did a fairly good job and the person who played Bella did better than last time and was pretty good in this movie. However, the person who played Alice wasn't very spectacular and I don't think they played her character well and as usual I think Robert Pattison can't act.<br/><br/>Other than that I loved the movie.

"km_hibbert","10","2","13","7 December 2009"," New Moon was simply amazing!!
","""New Moon"" was a great movie, whether you are a fan or not. It DOES NOT consist of Bella trying to chose between Jacob and Edward at all. If you knew anything about the saga, you would realize that. Edward and Bella only kiss/""attempt to kiss"" a handful of times, not the whole time. And besides it's a LOVE STORY.. what do you expect. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys love stories with a small amount of action/adventure. It gets better the more times you see it. People who go in to seeing the movie with a bad attitude, of course, are not going to enjoy this movie, or any movie for that matter. So before you just decide ""I'm not going to like it because everyone does and I don't want to be like a crazy Twilight fan"".. maybe you should go watch it with an open mind and stop being mean on IMDb.com!!

I don't want to say a lot because if you haven't seen it I don't wan to spoil it for you. I highly recommend it.

","OK i am 22 yrs old male and a huge fan of twilight books and the first movie (as evident by my id) I honestly never had high hopes from New Moon because i didn't liked the book much, but New Moon is a surprisingly good movie > Of course its not as good as twilight but it still isn't as awful as i thought it might be > and that is a pleasant surprise, also the movie is technically very well-made. The cinematography is great (though i missed the cold blue tints of twilight) The new look is a good thing and despite the different color-hue, the over-all effect still managed to resemble twilight's look (the lengthy chase scene in particular is awesome and reminded SO much of twilight). Also the CGI is amazing (frankly i wasn't expecting the CGI to be so good, its probably the best thing about the movie). The action scenes were amazing. And are a LOT better than twilight. The Volturi scene is clearly a great example of the best this movie has to offer. Make-up, CGI, Set Design, Fight Choreography and Costumes were extremely well done and Volterra looked visually stunning (with the red robed festival attenders).<br/><br/>Twilight had MUCH better music, New moon soundtrack is pretty ordinary and probably the biggest disappointment i have from this movie (which aren't much) Now for acting > Taylor Lautner is great. I've always been in team Edward and frankly never understood why would people pick Taylor over Robert as according to me Robert Pattinson is much better > But after watching the movie i am beginning to see Taylor's appeal, He is quite handsome, looked a real bad-ass wolf boy and is also a surprisingly decent actor with of course a very nice torso. Robert is just like he was in twilight and that means almost perfect as Edward > Kristen enacts her part really well and handles emotional scenes very expertly, her voice overs were also pretty emotional and not monotonous (which i thought they might be). Ashley Greene, Billy Burke, Edi Gathegi and Rachelle were perfect as their characters. The rest of the Cullens didn't get much scope but looked much better than twilight except for Jackson as Jasper. The Wolf guys looked exactly as how i pictured them while reading the book and the CGI wolves are extremely realistic. The Volturi cast was great, Michael Sheen as Aro is mind-blowing and Dakota Fanning as Jane is Perfect Overall i give this movie a 6/10"
"katya_gatt","8","2","14","5 December 2009"," For all those who hated it, give it a second glance
","I write my opinions because I feel that the film has been receiving a lot of undeserved negative comments, and i did expect all this negativity. Then again most, and I say most not all, were written by people who dislike the saga and all the storyline and went into the theatre saying this is going to be a bad movie. How can someone who hates the story and saga go to watch the movie and expect to enjoy himself/herself? It is quite pointless that people in this case give their opinion because there was never any chance that it was going to be a positive one. As always, i am not saying that this applies to everyone, but to a large majority based on the reviews i read on this site.<br/><br/>Yes, I am a girl, yes i am a teenager, yes I am a fan of the Twilight saga. I am also not a person who bases my life and choices on fictitious characters and who screamed at the sight of robert pattinson and taylor lautner. The books are about two very different people who fall in love, even though they cannot explain it. Because of certain circumstances their relationship might not always be ideal. Edward knows that his world and him can be dangerous for Bella, so out of selfless love and sacrifice he leaves her. She is forced into a state of depression because she feels that he was such a big part of her life that she cannot live without him. Is this really so far off from everyday cases of reality? OK, granted, maybe the suicidal wishes of these people an be a little extreme, but it cannot be denied that it has ever happened in reality. And as for Bella being a bad role model because of her obsession over Edward, is anyone to tell me that no one has ever found it hard to let go of someone they loved dearly? So genuinely cannot understand where all the hating is coming from. There are so many worse behaviours and role models in books, films and real life that it seems quite foolish to me that this is what people are judging this film on.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the second film was much better than the first. New moon is my least favourite book in the saga, but the film was loyal to it. I feel that the acting was very genuine, and the cinematography miles better than that of the first film.<br/><br/>I can assure you, judging buy the positive reactions of the people in my cinema, that the film was enjoyed for the same reason the book was enjoyed, as being a story about people who find selfless love, of losing it and finding it again. I am sure that most people who have been in a similar situation in their life, and i refuse to believe that most haven't, will understand where the characters are coming from"
"everyluffsme","9","2","15","20 November 2009"," go see it
","First off, I've been reading the reviews on here saying how bad this movie sucks, and I have to completely disagree!!!! I have read all 4 books, and definitely thought the New Moon movie was better than the Twilight movie (which I also liked despite poor acting). Let's all face it.. all of the actors in these movies are not very experienced being only in their teens and early 20's. The special effects in this movie were SOOOO much better and more realistic than in Twilight. There were a few moments in the movie that did not follow the book, but I did not expect it to be a mirror image of the book. If you were expecting it to be exactly like the book, then I can see where you might be disappointed. If New Moon were to include everything from the book which we love, It would have been probably 5 hours long. The one part of the movie I did NOT like was the Volturi fight scene. For those of us who have read the book, we know that Edward has amazing fighting skills being that he can see what the person's move will be before they make it. I think the appearance of the vampires in New Moon was much better than in Twilight. I understand that the movie skipped around a bit trying to fit everything in, but like I said, if they were to fit everything in, the movie would be 5 hours long. I think that Kristen, Rob, and Taylor truly did the characters justice on an emotional level. I was especially blown away by Taylor's performance (I'm not a ""team Jacob"" fan). I would definitely recommend this movie! I was not disappointed, and I am excited for Eclipse to come out in the summer! -Downside to seeing New Moon at midnight... large crowds of teen girls who screamed at the actors' first appearances on scream and when Jacob took his shirt off. I have to say I was definitely impressed with Taylor's body though :o)"
"willcundallreview","4","1","5","15 March 2015"," Over long movie that still holds heart
","Rating-4/10<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga: New Moon is the second in the Twilight franchise and a movie that although steps it up a notch, comes up worse than the first go. With it's slow pace and rather melodramatic remarks and scenes and of course new digital effects, this can seem boring and if not a big fan of the series then also stale. For fans of the book it seems it is a good representation from what I have heard and although people less in tune with Twilight may be sorely disappointed, hardcore fans should be pleased.<br/><br/>Our second outing takes places in the same place, with nearly the same pace that we saw at the beginning of the first one. Of course no film stays happy forever and as we see(without spoiling it) ,Bella goes through some things and people come in and out of her life in a flash, its all very easy to feel sorry for her, if only just a little. This really did make me think that to truly connect then you have to be a hopeless romantic or madly in love because this one truly is for the lovers and wannabe lovers as it has so many scenes directed in that direction. I did feel this one lacked fighting, now not all movies require action of course but this one really does, but the thing is when it comes around it seems cheesy and yet again over dramatic, poor showing on the adrenaline side(this in a film where Bella is trying to get adrenaline rushes).<br/><br/>Chris Weitz takes the helm and does an OK job, I mean for a movie like this it is a hard job to make it good so I can't destroy him that much, well maybe not yet. Melissa Rosenberg comes back to create the adapted screenplay and although I guess for some of the horrible script problems you have to blame Meyer, maybe a few changes here and there would have spruced things up and made it better to listen too also. Now I mentioned effects and with the addition of a new supernatural being like a werewolf you expect quite good ones with such a big budget, this is not the case and even if you can look past it, the over dramatic directing and filming comes in and severely damages the respect this movie still has.<br/><br/>Now Kristen Stewart, is she a good actor here, well make your own mind up but for me although not going the mile to act well, still bears the entire movie upon her shoulders and manages the more difficult scenes well. Taylor Lautner has his time to shine in this one and he does well but not well enough for me to say good, he bounds around the place like he is lost but still manages I guess to bring some emotion and that angst we always see with Twilight. Robert Pattinson is not as good here as before, too quiet and subdued and really doesn't bring any of the at least slight charm he could conjure on Bella in the first instalment. The rest of the cast are pretty solid but by the end they all manage to be sucked in to the bad script and kind of poor directing, or maybe that's just them.<br/><br/>So yes Twilight New Moon is a movie failing to improve upon it's average predecessor and although making strides in the romance department, lacks in enough action and thrills to justify it's 130 minute running time. And again yes it is a bit too long for a film, as I said before and have many, this it one for the fans but for those who don't really like the series or just can't be bothered reading then be ready to be let down at a very high grossing film. It is Poor there is not doubt in my mind but be prepared to give it a go, it can be enjoyed in small parts."

","What are the chances that in your life time you not only meet a vampire, but also werewolves, and both are coveting you ? Twilight saga continues with Bella's life changing with Edward moving away, and a new boy in her life. This movie is not a stand alone piece, and other Twilight sagas should be seen before seeing this movie.<br/><br/>Edward has second thoughts about his relation with Bella, and he decides to move away. But other ""non vegetarian"" vampires are not so easy to let go, and decides to eat Bella. Who comes to rescue but a pack of giant werewolves. Jacob, who she's dating turns out to be a werewolf, and wouldn't want vampires to touch her. There's a vampire's version of what looks like Vatican in Italy. Thinking Bella is dead, Edward goes there to end his own life. Bella chases after Edward to save his life. She does, but the stipulation is that Bella becomes one of them.<br/><br/>The story moves along slowly, but there's excellent story telling in each chapter of this movie. Since they've already made their mind up to make at least a trilogy, they can take time to expand on the story. The plot is good, and unusualness of the setting of each of the sub- plot, makes this movie entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Krsiten Stewart is perfect in her leading role, and so are the other co-stars. This is one semi- low budget movie that blows away other higher budget productions. Definitely a movie worth seeing."

","I just went to watch New Moon this afternoon. Overall, i think it's an OK movie. The movie's plot did not deviate far from the book. Sure they change and add a few scenes but hey you can't expect the movie to completely follow the book. Personally, i felt that New Moon is the most boring book in the series esp. the middle part of the book after Edward left Bella. I was like come on, girl get over him. True, he's a vampire and all but your happiness doesn't depend on him alone. So, i was curious how they made out the movie. The movie doesn't disappoint me unlike the sixth installment of Harry Potter (they made Harry Potter a coward, yeesh..). I'd read some of the users comments on Kirsten Stewart acting. I think she portrayed Bella convincingly. In the book, Bella is the kind of person who repressed her emotions. So, she won't show her true feelings to the people around her. It is perfectly reasonable for Kirsten Stewart to show just a couple of facial expression since this is who Bella is. I don't really care for Robert Pattinson acting. I'd watched the movies he acted in ie. Little Ashes and How to be. He didn't strike me as a particularly good actor. His acting is mediocre at best. Taylor Lautner did a good job as Jacob. All the other actors complement the movie well. The cinematography is quite good. Boring soundtrack. Not one song stand out unlike in Twilight ( Supermassive Black Hole by Muse and Bella's lullaby by Carter Burwell). All in all, the movie lived up to my expectations."

","I saw this movie today after reading a large majority of the novel, comparing both I'd say Directer Chris Weitz portrayed his vision the way the book was intended also full respect to Taylor Lautner (Jacob Black) and the visual effects provided. Unlike Twilight Director, Catherine Hardwick, Chris Weitz gave the film a lot more character packed with more action and darker themes which will keep your eyes glued to the screen.<br/><br/>New Moon is a massive achievement kick starting a turning point to the Twilight Saga, I promise those who weren't fond of the first film will get more than what they bargained for."
"megsbarrow","Null","1","5","23 November 2009"," Awesomest Movie Ever: MakesTwilight seem like GARBAGE!
","I, personally, think this is the best movie ever made. I've read all of the books (New Moon I admit, wasn't my favorite of the 4) and I've seen Twilight (which was NOTHING compared to New Moon). Great special effects, awesome fight scenes, and good acting. I liked seeing the few months where Bellas mind is blank on the screen and the camera orbiting around her like that was so amazing. I want to say that, that part was my favorite but I have too many other favorites. Seeing Bella as a vampire and running in slow motion was sweet but kinda of sappy. I LOVED seeing more Alice, Ashley Greene is Definitely a great actress. I have to say the ""Dear Alice"" moments were kind of cheesy, because, people that have read the books know that she will never answer. Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner definitely have good chemistry on screen, and the parts when Edward was there, her and Robert Pattinson had great chemistry. Another thing that I did like: Kristen portrays Bellas depression VERY well. Volturi fight scenes were good, I already knew they would be... Seeing Jane, Edward, Bella, Alice, Felix, and Demetri in the elevator was HILARIOUS! I don't really know why it was so funny, maybe, it was the awkwardness of the moment. And now, we come to the PROPOSAL. Ah, the proposal. It was definitely another one of my favorite parts. But I HATE/LOVE the cliffhanger.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend to anyone that 'New Moon' is a 'must-see'. It exceeded my expectations by 1,000. I for one, will definitely be rushing to the theaters to see Eclipse. = )"

","New Moon was definitely MUCH better than twilight in terms of direction. Because I read the book, I guess to me it seemed like the first part moved too fast. But I think Chris weitz did a good job trying to fit everything in.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book....it'll be weird to you. The acting was not bad as many people think. It's the script...the storyline thats so cheesy that they have to sound like that. I don't blame the actors honestly. And poor Rob...his accent always gets in his way! His acting was wayyyyyyyy better in this one too. I thought it would be a bore when he left but it actually wasn't...maybe because he always appeared! Liked the special effects...the way it looked. HUGE improvement from twilight....thank god they fired catherine!"
"turgut-7","1","1","5","21 November 2009"," Terrible!
","This was clearly the worst movie I have ever paid money to watch. If it was on TV, I might have suffered the first ten minutes and see the lack of acting, the constantly revolving camera around a depressed girl (who remains so throughout the movie), the lifeless dialog and the lack of continuity.<br/><br/>The only highlights of the movie were the scenes shot in Italy, which I thought that was better made than the rest of the movie. It actually had dialog and fluidity.<br/><br/>Only watch the movie if you are a girl between 12 to 15, even that's stretching it, and wish to see half-naked boys."
"LolaQ","Null","1","5","21 November 2009"," Worthy of Any Fan's Money, But Don't Expect Perfection
","As a fan of the books, New Moon was entirely enjoyable to watch--albeit, much like its predecessor, Twilight, it had its issues. One should note that the overall tone of the film seems to possess a different feel from the original. This difficult-to-describe-in-words tone, which one will recognize once he or she watches, produces an unflattering tawdry effect.<br/><br/>Unlike Twilight, New Moon does not make introductions (in so much that as far as the main cast is concerned, Bella and the Cullens) and the problem rests here. The film's obviousness in assuming its audience is well-acquainted with the characters results in line of cheap jokes (which I will not disclose so as not to spoil any part for any fan, like me). However, just because the film wants to cater to the already loyal fan base of the saga, does not mean that it must make that catering so noticeableâ€” there are plenty of other ways (just being loyal to the books for instance) to appease and delight the fans, who for the most part will enjoy anything about the series.<br/><br/>The special effects, which one might rightfully assume should be better since this films budget should be more substantial than the last, are just fine. However, there was a noticeable change in the eye colors of the vampires, which seems to be significantly brighter than in the first. The red eyes are more like rubies and with the brightness of the topaz, all the Cullens' eyes seem like huge, inhuman, bug eyes. In other words, while this may or may not be a more expensive effect, it does nothing but take from the film. Aside from just looking wrong (the Cullens look so alien that it is absurd the audience is expected to believe any residents of Forks have fallen for their charade as humans who are just exceptional beautiful)<br/><br/>That being said, the rest of the Film has definitely improved upon the last. The make-up and hair is better: there are no more lines where we can easily find the pale make-up ends, a problem Twilight did not bother to fix.<br/><br/>While the acting has improved (though I personally didn't find a real problem in the first), there are inescapable scenes from the book that would be hard to make look respectable on screen. Note that this is not a knock on Meyer's writing, just a reminder that some things work better in books than they do in movies. Any other improvements I might mention would spoil the film, but there are more the audience will definitely appreciate<br/><br/>All problems aside, New Moon is a delight for any fan and well worth that over-priced ticket."
"jmackenzie11","6","1","5","20 November 2009"," New Moon was okay, but there was too much humor
","Okay, so I saw the trailers, and I was so excited! Then i went to the theater, and the beginning was okay. As Jacob came in, I didn't see a lot of chemistry, action, or anything. Taylor is a good actor, but the script had too much humor in it. It messed up the mood, and Taylor was a little bugged about it. The humor overload altered it, and I know he can act better. There were way too many laughing moments. The book has a little comedy in it, I should say, but it's more of a love triangle romantic movie, not a comedy. Chris Weitz sucked, and he ruined it. The cast would have done better without him, they'd do better with Catherine! They better stick to the book for thew next movies!"
"bitola","5","1","5","20 November 2009"," review from a late twenties fan
","First of all let me tell you this...i saw Twilight just 2 months ago and became a really big fan afterwards (read all the books and saw all the Rpatz interviews on you tube) There were two reasons - Catherine Hardwicke and Robert Pattinson. I came back from the cinema few hours ago and what I can say is all the magic from the first Twilight movie I watched like 1000 times is gone, forgotten and spat at. The chemistry,intimacy and the teenage feel magic that you can relate too at whatever age is gone. What is left is Edward looking at least 10 years older than 17 (and I love Robert, but he really looked old), Bellas depression for me was not depressing enough. Bellas visions of Edward felt like a Mexican soap opera.<br/><br/>The Voulturi were great - too bad they didn't have mroe lines, and of course the best part for last - the wolves. I was totally in love with Edward, still am, but the wolves - they were just amazing....it's not the director however, whoever worked on the special effects's done a really really great work to say the least.<br/><br/>All I can say is that I really am looking forward to Eclipse...no director can do worse than this, really. BTW Catherine Hardwicke you and your lovely Nikki Reed...can't wait to see your next movies. Thank you for Twilight.<br/><br/>Summit - you suck for letting her go away."
"Philattio","5","1","5","20 November 2009"," Average Film with Good Parts
","The Novel for New Moon is really good. Much better than Twilight. <br/><br/>When I watched this I was really quite disappointed during the important scenes (mostly love scenes). These scenes were not reinforced with touching music, in fact all the songs are really bad. I wasn't ""touched"" at all when Edward broke with Bella. I gave it a chance and paid attention, and yet I felt nothing. <br/><br/>The fighting scene at the Volturi was outstanding. I sat there in the theater with my eyes wide open and my heart beating fast. The movement would go from fast to slow motion ending up with a ""Matrix"" type of scene. This was the best part of the film.<br/><br/>A lot of parts in this film were so bad that I laughed. The reintroduction of Edward, Jacob and Alice were so corny and cheesy. Also at one point Edward kisses Bella, and they let out little moans which sounds so weird cos they had only hooked up for a couple of seconds. <br/><br/>The movie was based really close to the book. However it was done in an unpleasing way. I really really wished that Catherine Hardwick directed this one and maintained her contemporary style of filming with another great soundtrack that Twilight had. <br/><br/>This movie IS worth watching. Give it a chance and keep in mind that it DOES have good parts separated between those disappointing scenes."
"RedConverse09","7","2","17","20 November 2009"," Better Than 'Twilight'...
","I saw this film last night at a Midnight showing and had to say it was better than I expected. Taylor delivered as Jacob showing his friendliness, his loyalty, and finally, his love. He commands your attention when he steps onto the screen. This boy is going places. Kristen was very good at portraying the heart-broken teenager, but her skills lack in some places. I couldn't believe her every time she tried to be serious. Plus, her screaming at night was awful. Rob wasn't in much of the film, but didn't do very well in the places he was in. Every time Bella and Edward were together, I kept waiting for someone to bust in and say ""Just Kidding Guys!"" so everyone could laugh. It was so horrendously over-dramatic. The visual was good and the score was amazing.<br/><br/>See if you're a fan, Rent if you're not.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5."
"smcclimon","8","2","18","20 November 2009"," Not that bad
","I was actually pleasantly surprised by a lot of the movie. Chris Weitz improved much on the Twilight series. The dialog was much improved compared to Twilight. I was impressed with the first hour or so, it flows, covered much of the important points from the book, and could be easily understood if you hadn't read the book. The second half of the movie though I found disjointed. It really didn't flow and left out some key explanations. I think if the movie was just 5 or 10 minutes longer it would've been a much better movie.<br/><br/>I gave this an 8 out of 10 because to me it is a far better movie than Twilight and has got the possibility of being viewed a second time by me."

So unfortunately we don't get to see Robert Pattion until the end when he takes his shirt off and starts to kiss Bella (sexy) but i feel sad for Jacob because he loves Bella.<br/><br/>I think you should see this film if you like romantic stuff.<br/><br/>I hope you liked my review!"

It's a good thing to get caught up in and escape from the dull boredom of reality. I wish I had a forbidden love that could put some excitement in my life.<br/><br/>I did like that they brought the story to a location outside of Forks, as it made for a more epic and collaborative story and it made for better adventure.

","The reviews for this movie are highly biased. I thought the first movie was terrible and by the score it's been given here, i thought the second movie would be even more awful. This movie definitely does not deserve a 4, and not a 10 either, but these reviews simply show people's inclination to discredit anything that is popular.(and guy's immediate aversive response to anything girls worship)<br/><br/>It was much better than the first film. Firstly, it didn't make me cringe, which is a huge improvement. Yes, the characters are a bit immature, the plot is a little foolish, but i think that was the point of the movie. The characters connected, it didn't feel contrived; the atmosphere was well created; i had a little problem with edward, who seemed to overact a bit, but again, I suppose that was the point.<br/><br/>This is, by any criteria, an OK movie. Maybe a 6. But I will rate it higher just because it annoys me when movies like this one are only seen in black and white. It's not the first cheesy romantic movie and certainly 'cheesy' doesn't mean boys should rate it 1 and girls 10. Scary movie 4 has a higher score for gods sake."
"songstress82","8","1","6","23 November 2009"," Better than I expected
","When I saw Twilight, I was somewhat disappointed, especially with Bella and her apathetic attitude for most of the movie. It just felt awkward throughout and the dialogue was predictable and cheesy. Edward made Twilight bearable, though, and I have enjoyed the books, so I decided that I would give the second movie a go. I realize that I am in the minority here in actually enjoying this second film, but I went in with low expectations. I expected to see Bella as even more ""dead"" on screen because of the nature of the book, but was surprised at how much more life-like she was in this movie. I thought the little bit of humor thrown in here and there was appropriate and the movie stayed extremely faithful to the book.<br/><br/>There were only a few things I didn't like. The music seemed a little off in the beginning, perhaps because I still thought the initial theme from Twilight would be used or modified to keep continuity. It fit better toward the end with the Volturi, though. Also, I didn't like Edward as much in this movie, regardless of the limited screen time. He seemed more depressed and apathetic in this one, ironically as Bella seemed to be in the last movie. The reunion between them at the end was not completely what it needed to be in order for the viewer to understand that they both love and forgive each other. Oh, and the scene that Alice shows to Aro is completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>Still, this is far above Twilight and hopefully it will continue to get better with each movie. After seeing this show, I actually wanted to view it again at some point. That, in my book, is what makes it a decent movie. Good job to the cast and crew."

Bella and Edward didn't have the kind of connection that they had in the first one. The only reason I gave the movie a 6 is because I love the twilight series and I am ready for the 3rd movie.

","There has been a great deal of criticism of the New Moon movie. Many have valid points, but we MUST look at the material the director had to work with. It was a book from the TWILIGHT SERIES OF NOVELS, therefore: the characters were not developed, the heroine is a co-dependent flake, there is no actual relationship between Edward and Bella apart from ""Wow you're a vampire and can do vampire things"" and ""Wow, I want to suck your blood because your blood in particular sings to me""... etc - pretty hard to start with crap and make it wonderful, so let's not be too hard on the film makers. (Although admittedly, thoroughly addictive crap - I read the whole series in 5 days).<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film. Liked how it stayed closely to the book, but did away with useless sections. It was brighter visually. The wolves looked great and I enjoyed the depiction of the Volturi. I look forward to seeing them again.<br/><br/>Yet, I digress. Kristen Stewart was actually not bad in this film. She certainly gave Bella a bit more spirit than in the Twilight movie. And she had good chemistry with Taylor Lautner (as Jacob). I found Robert Pattinson a bit lack-luster. I felt he didn't really show any real affection for her, and that their romance was not believable. Taylor Lautner was great as Jacob. Bubbly and fun, and pulled off the moody transformation pretty well.<br/><br/>Was sad to not see as much of the Cullens, but as others have said, it would have made for a very long movie.<br/><br/>As for the criticism it has received for pandering to fans of the book - why not? - just about every person belonging to the demographic of the movie has read the book.<br/><br/>Any other plot issues I had, or problems with the characters were problems I'd had with the story as told in the BOOKS. The books are far from perfect, and far from great literary works. But I enjoyed them for what they were, as I enjoyed this movie for what it was."

Granted a few lines have been left out a few have been added or changed, but for the most part it's like the novel itself. My only problem with the twilight movie series is Kristen Steward herself. I don't know what she did, but she must have done someone out there a really great favor(cough cough)She is an even worse actress than Megan Fox and she is no where as hot. But anyway I'm OK with the movie, so-so on the makeup, and no-no on the casting of Bella."
"tepettful","7","1","6","22 November 2009"," Wasn't so bad at all
","I feel sorry for the staff, actors and actresses, etc for the lot of bad opinion in connection with this movie. They worked hard, it is not their fault if the film is cheesy, honestly, everyone who read S Meyer knows that S Meyer's style is just horrid, however the basic idea is interesting.<br/><br/>I saw the movie with my husband, we are both about 40 and like to think that have a decent taste. And it is true that we've seen much better movies, but it is just injustice to give for this movie 1 or 3, so it was better than this and my opinion, that boys so much were fed up with their girlfriends' Twiligh mania that they just gave bad scores for this movie because of anger and jealousy.<br/><br/>The other thing is that it seems to be impossible to satisfy both groups, the fans (who wanted the book line by line - which was a mistake) and those who wanted to see a good vampire (horror) movie. Actions just did not help winning for the second group, because it is a love story and not more.<br/><br/>From the very first moment I saw the Twilight (which was better than this and had an interesting, charming mood, colouring, etc) and after this read the books I felt so sorry for the whole idea, because so much could be in, but S Meyer is not a talented writer, she looks like as if she types to her computer that what is fashionable in teen girls, what element needed for a good book and computer wrote it. It would be better if she give up writing, but again, I feel sorry for the actors and actresses, it is not their fault, they are all rather young, and I do not like if these bad opinions here influence their futures and personalities.<br/><br/>(Sorry for the poor English of mine, I am not English)"
"eyesofpercept","6","1","6","21 November 2009"," Chris Weitz turns New Moon into generic money maker
","I really did not like the feel of New Moon. I love the story and have read all the books. New Moon was pretty much spot on with the book in the sense that scenes were 98% book derived. However, Weitz's take on New Moon has left me feeling annoyed. He took a sensual, magical book and first movie and turned it into a stereotypical American money maker ""blockbuster"". <br/><br/>The movie was all fast, cheesily cut dialogue with almost no time to feel real emotion from the characters. I did not appreciate the scenes in which Weitz tried to turn a serious situation into a comedy by having the characters emphasize lines into a joke that were not meant to be funny. But I guess that's what brainless American's want so he had to go there. <br/><br/>The movie felt rushed and did not properly show the relationship formed between Bella and Jacob. Yeah the movie would have been longer but many fans would be willing sit through it anyways for the sake of a properly made movie.<br/><br/>The eyes, the eyes, the eyes. Waaaaaay overdone. These contacts were so crazy looking compared to the ones in the first movie it was almost hard to concentrate on the lines. The more subtle look fit much better. <br/><br/>And last I want to express my disgust with the musical score. Why oh why did you all have to ruin the musical integrity of the movie? All major movies do NOT need a full orchestra playing suspenseful music to make watchers feel a scene. It's really corny and at times I felt like I was watching something more like Home Alone. Twilight had a more intense feeling because this was not done. Whoever is doing Breaking Dawn, save the corny violins and clarinets for your next Hollywood production. And if Eclipse has this same sort of orchestrated music, edit the movie and do it like Twilight. :)"
"heatherperez5","7","1","6","21 November 2009"," I liked it better the 2nd time I saw it....
","Took my daughter to the midnight showing and was very upset with the movie. Maybe it was everyone screaming each time Jacob took off his shirt or maybe it was just due to being tired from everything we had to go through just to get in.... Went to an earlier showing the next day, and liked it a lot better (no screaming girls).<br/><br/>I must say that the soundtrack sucks, and therefore the music in the film doesn't grab me like it did in Twilight. Also, the contacts of the vampires are just plain wrong, so that was hard to get past.<br/><br/>I actually really love the Twilight movie, and read all 4 books in a matter of a week (after saying for a year that I would NEVER read them at all!). However, New Moon was my least favorite of the books, so I kind of expected that of the film too.<br/><br/>Hoping Eclipse and Breaking Dawn hold up to all of our expectations...."
"xbewitching","7","1","6","21 November 2009"," Definitely worth the time
","Let's start this off with the facts. I read all four books, and I saw the first movie. The books were, in my mind, pretty good. In no way am I obsessive about them, merely a fan, because how often do love stories have any decent action sequences? The world created was immensely interesting, and the characters have some depth. But I'll be honest: It's a cult novel set, and will be remembered as such.<br/><br/>The first movie, Twilight, was abysmal. The plot was hard to follow for anyone who hadn't read the book, and the actors who shined (no sparkly puns intended) were more often than not the supporting characters. But this is a New Moon review, so I'll move on.<br/><br/>Two friends invited me about a month prior to go with them to the midnight showing, and they paid for my ticket in exchange for rides home (at 2:30 in the morning!). So while I can't truly say that this was worth the money, it was definitely worth the 3 hours I sat in a theater with a bunch of swooning tweens.<br/><br/>Something to keep in mind when reading all these poor reviews is this series is driven by dialogue. Don't bother getting into it unless you enjoy conversation. I found a few of the deliveries somewhat stilted, but for the most part I found they were witty and made sense. Good job screenwriters, tsk tsk Kristen Stewart.<br/><br/>Again, supporting characters were great. Charlie is still a bumbling yet lovable father, Jessica is still self-centered and annoying (in a funny way). Alice is every bit the 'dancer' she's described as in the books, and Jasper finally has some personality! The Cullens in general should've gotten more screen time, but they didn't get much page time in the book, so this is just my way of saying the acting was more than decent.<br/><br/>The wolf pack was also great, despite being on screen (in person) for less than five minutes. It had been a fear of mine that the CGI counterparts to these actors would be corny or ridiculous, but even they were believable and intimidating. Kudos to Chris Weitz for putting money towards the wolves; it definitely showed.<br/><br/>I laughed a lot more during New Moon than I did during Twilight, which I think is a key point here. With all the angst and drama, the humor brings the story down to earth, and I buy sarcastic Bella much more than in-love-with-Edward Bella.<br/><br/>The highlight? Jacob, aka Taylor Lautner. I was glad they decided to keep him on, even more glad now that I've actually seen him act. This movie made me convert in terms of 'teams': I went from a solid Team Edward member to on-the-fence Team Switzerland. Lautner's performance was brought down mostly by Stewart's. If you can look past her, you'll enjoy the film for its details.<br/><br/>All in all, I see what lacks in this movie, but I'd still pay money to see it again. Twi-hards will love it, and as they are the target audience... I feel completely comfortable with giving this a 7/10."
"natedogs212000","5","1","6","20 November 2009"," entertaining enough to watch but acting wasn't there
","The major problem that I had watching this film was that the acting from Kristen Stewart was not the character that the books envisioned. I grant them that the film did follow the book's story line as well as they could on the screen. The tenseness did gain momentiam throughout the film and there was genuine concern that came across during the film due to the atmosphere created by the director and everyone behind the camera. However, there was still lack of emotion given off from the characters that the actors tried to portray. Kristen Stewart was the worst. She said her lines well but there was no body language that she gave off that made me believe that she believed what she was saying. There was no emotion behind the lines. It was like watching a catatonic actor. Furthermore, there was no real connection that I felt between any of the major characters, i.e. Edward, Bella, or Jacob. I feel that this movie could of been a lot better if the right actors were put into place beyond just for adolescent eye candy that I heard all the tween girls in the audience scream with in the movie theater. It would of been better if the right actors where put into the characters. Overall, I did find it entertaining enough to watch and have a good time during the movie. But there could of been a lot more done to do the characters justice and the storyline."
"rickbobby_94","8","1","7","11 March 2014"," What's with people?
","I have no idea why everyone gives this movie such bad criticism. Personally I think that this was by far the most well made Twilight films. It was visually beautiful, still had Rachael as Victoria who fits the role perfectly. It stayed true to the book, more so than the rest. Even the way the wolves look, and the style chosen vampire run was a lot better than any of the others! Personally I wish that Weitz had of directed every Twilight film, they would have been a tonne better. The later movies were just not up to par. People say that it was a slow paced boring movie, when the fact is the book was slow paced. They couldn't have changed the entire storyline just so that it was more actor packed and thrilling. This film is showcasing how Jacob and Bella's bond is formed, it's just like any other drama. Just because it's a vampire and fantasy based franchise doesn't mean every movie is going to be blood and guts. At the end of the day, the whole point to The entire twilight franchise, is that it's a love story. It was never intended to be a thriller."
"g-bodyl","7","1","7","20 February 2011"," Not as Good!
","New Moon is not as good as the first movie in the series. I think it's the worse one but it's still decent. I enjoyed most of the movie even though I am a guy. Once again the dialog is pretty stupid. I was laughing at some of the dialog. Also the ending was terrible. I never seen a worse ending to a movie. But that's all the bad things about the movie.<br/><br/>In this movie, it's pretty much a love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob. It gets serious between Bella and Jacob when Edward and his family leaves town for good.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. I read negative comments about Kristen Stewart and her acting. Well she's supposed to act depressed. And thats exactly how she was in the movie. I liked the Voluturi especially Michael Sheen. I am a big fan of his.<br/><br/>Yes, there is some sappy romance here. But there is more action that held my interest. I liked this movie better than I thought. I rate this film 7/10."

"masakiuma","7","1","7","23 June 2010"," Fans and Critics both need to shut it
","For anyone not familiar with the Twilight story, it is a pretty simple (and pretty clichéd now) premise about a love affair between a vampire (Edward) and a human (Bella). In this chapter, Bella reconnects with her childhood friend (Jacob) after Edward decides he has to leave town with his family and never see Bella again. The two main conflicts of the film are 1) A love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob and 2) Dealing with Victoria, the vampire who wants Bella dead after the Cullens (Edward's family) killed her boyfriend in the previous movie.<br/><br/>I'll say this right away, I think the Twilight series is far overrated by its fans, but far underrated by its critics. I'll just go right into the good vs bad.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>-The setting. I REALLY love the small town in the middle of the northwest US forest setting, and I think it was a perfect place to have all this occur.<br/><br/>-The special effects. Sure it was pretty obvious -when- there was CG, but it was still handled pretty well and not overdone.<br/><br/>-The characters. I definitely have some complaints about a few of them, but most are pretty intriguing. In particular I thought Alice, Jacob, and the Valteri were far more interesting than Edward and Bella. In turn, the acting is pretty decent also. Say what you want about Kristen Stewart, but she knows how to play the mopey teen quite convincingly.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>-The cliché. Don't you miss when vampires used to be evil? Nowadays we have Twilight, True Blood, the Vampire Diaries, The Gates, countless novels cashing in on Twilight's success...the list goes on. I really miss the days of Buffy and Angel when there were only one or two good vampires in the WORLD.<br/><br/>-The vampire rules. Here are the ""physics"" for vampires in this world: ~They are almost invincible. Sunlight and staking won't kill them. They're too damned strong!! They have to be completely obliterated to be killed...like completely dismembered or burned to a cinder. This means it would probably be impossible for a human to kill a vampire in this world because they are also super strong and SUPER fast. ~In the sunlight, they don't die. Their skin simply shimmers. You probably already knew this because it is the only thing that the Twilight critics ever complain about. ~I'm fairly certain that simply being bitten by a vampire without being killed will turn a person into one...inconvenient ~ Many vampires have extra powers. Future visions, mind-reading, and other psychic things ~There is a truce between vampires and werewolves (though they aren't really werewolves, they are shifters. werewolves need a full moon to change). The wolves protect humans and cannot harm vampires unless they break the truce. Simply put, the vampires are too overpowered.<br/><br/>-The ANGST!! My god, after Edward leaves Bella, she mopes in her room for like four months! She is completely prepared to throw her life away for some guy she met a few months ago. Edward is even worse. He's been around for ~119 years but he is completely prepared to die just because this girl he met recently may or may not be dead. These crazy teens and their ""all or nothing"" attitudes... I literally had to facepalm when Edward told Bella ""you are my only reason to go on living."" Sure that sounds romantic to all the clueless 13 year old girls watching, but what the hell was his reason for living four months ago?<br/><br/>Like I said before, the fans need to shut up and the critics need to shut up. Overall I thought New Moon, like Twilight, was not ""God's gift to movie watchers,"" but was still a decent film that I don't regret watching.<br/><br/>Final score - 7/10"
"lpalerno","9","1","7","19 April 2010"," Why The Hate?
","I'm sorry but I just don't get why people have this major problem with the Saga. I bet mostly everyone who does has never even read the books. I agree that this movie is for a certain demographic, as all movies are. It happens to have a major following which had to of been expected as the book was a best seller. Not to mention that romance's such as Titanic, Romeo & Juliet, etc. have always attracted major fan following by females. What's the big deal? I guess people just hate something automatically if it's popular. I just have to pose the question that if ""haters"" truly don't like it because they think the fans are ignorant and uneducated, isn't it fair to assume that they are just being sheep as well; not having the courage to form their own unbiased opinion?"
"aimeembrs75","10","1","7","7 April 2010"," Breaking Dawn
","I have read the entire Sage over 5 times...they are more engrossing than anything I've ever read before. I was thrilled with New Moon and found it to be a great improvement over the original Twilight movie and I can't wait for Eclipse. The one thing that I am most thrilled about is the recent news that Bill Condon might direct both Breaking Dawn movies!!!! I LOVED Dreamgirls and Chicago and this is the greatest news eve! I think having such a well respected director is going to make the movies even better. So excited!!!!!<br/><br/>The only problem I have seen yet is Bryce Dallas Howard as Victoria. I hate to say it but she looks so cartoonish and just weird. Oddly enough, I think she fits the books description of Victoria better than Rachelle but I just was weirded out by that part of the Eclipse trailer. I hope I'm wrong cuz I really like her!!!"

"Louisville88","10","1","7","16 March 2010"," I loved this movie!
","Okay, this movie was never meant to be a Gone With the Wind. It was not filmed to be a classic that showcased what greatness was. It was made to be enjoyed by the audience~ much like mission: impossible, the transformers and Harry potter films. I've read the books. Personally I dislike the Bella/Edward relationship. I dislike Rob Pattinson. However, Taylor Lautner~ whom I pictured as Jacob (not him but his likeness) was great. No Oscar for this, but still very good. He had emotion (something Pattinson lacks) and his affection for Bella is obvious. They're love story is developed I feel. The film entertained me greatly. It had it's moments of camp like the vision scene and Bella in the water when Edward appears. Overall, I think it was well done. As cinema quality I give it three stars. As an piece of entertainment, I give it four. Stewart was better here and really her scenes with Jacob are her best. Her love for Edward is more apparent in this film then in Twilight. I don't think pattinson will ever get better. Lautner will only rise."
"SophomoreSlump","6","1","7","30 December 2009"," Better not to have high expectation.
","I've never read the novel New Moon so I went to the cinemas with no expectation whatsoever than what I seen in the trailer. So here's in a nutshell.<br/><br/>The Good: The acting is actually better than what most reviewers said. Kristen Stewart did a great job playing a depressed Bella who just got out of a relationship. She really captures the emotion of only someone who has experienced that can know. The only person who is better than her was Dakota Fanning, playing the vampire Jane. She only gets a few minutes of screen time but it was enough to convince me how evil her character is and how good Dakota is.<br/><br/>Next, the CGI was a bit early millennium. But it was adequate.<br/><br/>The storyline itself was engaging. And the whole story was kept well-paced.<br/><br/>The bad: What makes the movie not as good as what the audience expected is because it lost its original formula from Catherine Hardwicke's Twilight. There were less chemistry between the actors. The directing and editing could've been better. It's just the entire atmosphere of the movie seems 'not right'.<br/><br/>Overall: New Moon is a great movie if you haven't yet read the book. If you have, then you might be disappointed."
"ShizzleMaTizzle","5","1","7","28 December 2009"," Nice but lacking something
","I have read the books, thought it was quite interesting to see how they suck you in. Seen the first Twilight and liked what I saw, showed the range of indie feeling I loved. I have given Twilight a 7. In New Moon, Bella was pretty much devastated by the disappearance of Edward. What I like about it when Bella found a glimpse of Edward, Kristen Stewart gave a great performance of how Bella was glad and thrilled she did found him even just for a little while. Stewart gave a splendid job with what she had, and she repress devastation well enough. Although Robert Pattinson gave a greater performance than Stewart does when it comes to losing the love of your life and that is impressive for the split second you found him in the movie. That is where the connection between Edward and Bella lies through out the movie that it didn't make sense to me that Jacob was a love rival, only a friend who is affectionate to Bella. Taylor Lautner gave a good performance even if at times he needed to pull something in a bit. But it fell bland to me how the film makers rushed the beginning and the end while pasting a longer time in the middle. Some scenes like when Bella went to the movies were almost dragged even if it was a pivotal scene but when it came to Jacob being angered at the end of the same scene, it rushed leaving audience a feeling of 'What?'. The reveal of the Volturri make the story go to a more steadier flow but the leaving at the end made it as if ""Yes, the Volturri was there"" and done. For a person who has read the book, yes New Moon followed faithfully through the book but for any reason, a movie adapted from a book shouldn't be 98% following the book. Twilight gave a range of diversion here and there from the book which made it flow into a better movie. Overall, the cast deal with a great job but the film makers should be very careful handling an adaptation. Stewart, Pattinson and Lautner gave a great performance overall, and even of the push of Jacob in the movie, it was still a love story between Edward and Bella. In my opinion, that is where Bella has based her world upon, in books and movies."
"shinhbang","9","1","7","27 December 2009"," Well done!
","I can tell there were lots of exhaling towards this movie because it has topped Twilight the first movie. I'll just go ahead and get my review. First of all, I loved it! I'm not biased or anything. I simply like the movie. Sure there were some awkward parts but overall, it was a well done for me. I thought it was quite awkward when Jacob overreacted at the movie theater, but it didn't bother me much. The only thing I'd consider a flaw in this movie is Kristen Stewart. I have nothing against her, except I just think that she can't act. I mean, I was never entirely happy with the fact that Kristen Stewart played Bella. Kristen has received many awards for her movies before Twilight, and I thought she could've done better. Anyway, great movie! Jacob was deliciously-looking :]"

","On opening weekend my daughter and grandson and I went to see New Moon twice. Once was all we planned but the next day with a little spare time we decided we needed to see it again. Then on Sunday I went alone and I went a fourth time on this Friday. Each time it was thrilling, and close enough to the book to not mess up the theme to much.<br/><br/>I did find the goofy scene with Bella sitting looking out her bedroom window a little lame but that is how the book deals with it, soooooo.<br/><br/>The scenes with the wolves are fantastic (my grandson especially like their fights) and the loss that Bella feels is well portrayed after Edward leaves.<br/><br/>I especially like the basic theme and tension of these books and this movie. Self control and longing for each other are well used tools to make you feel their angst while seeing the necessity of it. Some have complained about Ms. Meyer's Morman belief in abstinence before marriage being overly pushed but I think it is much deeper truth that our joy is much greater if we must struggle for a while. I am not prudish and in fact was an unwed mother in the days when it was really looked down on so I am not trying to preach, but there is a truth in the story and one that certainly can't hurt teens. I loved the ending, it was perfect.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see Eclipse and any Pattinson interviews I can find. I liked the Ellen Degeneres interview the best."
"raevan-2","7","1","7","6 December 2009"," New Moon - Just what I expected.
","First off. I am not a Twilight Fan, I personally don't ""feel"" the characters, I read all the books because a friend of mine said they were really good. I found the first two books less than average and the last two books improved. I have read that most think the last books are the worst but as an avid reader of romance, horror, and fantasy I enjoyed those the most. <br/><br/>Now for my movie review...with what they had to work with the movie wasn't as god awful or bad as I imagined and I was surprised to find myself entertained in the same average way I was entertained reading the book series. They followed the book very closely unlike almost every other book to movie I have seen. The makeup was still pretty awful and I hope in the third movie they figure out a way to make the vampires look more like vamps and less like drag queens. One thing I hoped they would do to the movies was create some chemistry with the leads instead of the dry obsessiveness of the book Edward and Bella. I don't understand and am quite confused how anyone can think there is any lovey dovey romance with these characters. I mean I can't think of one scene in the whole movie/book series that I can go aww they really are made for each other! (if someone can point me to that part I think I missed it...)<br/><br/>I read lots of complaints about the acting and there was some parts of bad acting but again I don't find them completely at fault since SM cheesed out their book counterparts. <br/><br/>Overall I gave this movie a 7. 3 for the story, 1 for making it a better movie than the book, 1 for keeping me interested for 2 hours, and 2 for good luck since it got a lot of one stars and to be fair it didn't deserve it. Sure it wasn't a blockbuster but it wasn't as bad as people are making it out to be. <br/><br/>Oh and on a side note the worst part of the movie was when they are at the movies and..omg that was so dumb. :)"
"virgo9588","6","1","7","3 December 2009"," hhmmm.......
","I would just like to start off by saying that I have read all the books and seen Twilight and New Moon.<br/><br/>I saw New Moon when it came out (i saw the midnight premiere) and thought the movie was pretty good. I believe it met my expectations. But my brother, who is not a fan, told me about all the reviews that were on this website and I don't agree with most of them. Until I came to one that made a great point. If you like it ""Yay"", if not than ""Yay for you too"".<br/><br/>Yes, the movie did lack some of the books important points (like the flight home from Italy and the grand theft auto of the infamous porsche) and Rosalie did look like crap. But what really bothered me was the over-criticism this movie has gotten. So what if the vampires shimmer instead of turning to ash and so what if they want to be ""vegetarian"". Vampires ARE NOT real. So Stephanie Meyer has every right to make vampires however she thought fit. And to be honest I'm glad this wasn't another cheesy dungeon and coffin vampire story. Or one where the vampires jump around in leather suits wearing sunglasses all the time. More power to someone who wanted to take a different outlook on the traditional, FICTIONAL, boring vampire.<br/><br/>I think the actors did a good job and I like all of Kristin Stewart's movies. So I knew what to expect. And on another note, Bella is supposed to be emotionless. Someone she loved just left her. I'm sure most people have experienced heartache. Yes, even you men. Now I'm not a teeny bopper so I don't take the story so literal, but why criticize Bella so much for Edward leaving her. It's fiction, that's those people's fault for believing that all men are that way. And that all relationships are that controlling over a human. If anyone had really read the book, they would have gotten the story and why the movie was the way it was.<br/><br/>I do hope that Eclipse is better in some aspects. But each one is supposed to be uniquely different than the other. So I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the next one."
"zerix666","5","1","7","2 December 2009"," Pretty good. Not great, but pretty good.
","After reading some other peoples comments I must say I'm glad I haven't read the books. I thought that the character of Bella was just supposed to be someone that had problems showing there emotions, but evidently that was just bad acting... Knowing that takes a bit away from the effect of the movie, but thats okay I guess. Anyways on to the actual review, the first movie was mediocre, not terrible, but not very good. As such I wasn't planning on watching this one, however a bunch of my female friends kept telling me that this one was gonna be better, so I caved and decided to watch it. I wasn't disappointed, much. This movie is indeed better than the first one. not great, but still pretty good. The special effect are better (I'm quite a fan of the wolf transformations). and The overall plot is quite a bit better as well. It even made me actually want to see what was going to happen next at a couple parts. The acting is still pretty bad (though as I said above I didn't realize how bad till afterward). But I don't really feel like going into to much detail. I just thought people might be interested in a view of the movie by someone that isn't either by some old guy or a 15 year old girl (I'm a 21 year old hetero male)."

","I'm really sick of haters that rate this movie 1 just because it's 'Twilight' and therefore it must be bad. Sure the dialogue and acting isn't the greatest, but hey, let's focus only on the bad things and degrade this movie to no end!? Silly...<br/><br/>I've read about 20 comments with the lowest ratings and it's so sad. Let me just focus on a few things that kinda sorta p*ss me off. A lot of comments is on how horrible Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were. You get the feeling that they were the only actors in the movie! Dakota Fanning. Amazingly creepy. She should have more screen time. Michael Sheen. Scary, crazy, as Aro should be. Billy Burke! Come on, you can't say he wasn't good. Seriously people.<br/><br/>The other thing that really annoys me is the comments on how the dialogue was cheesy and how nobody says these things in real life. Hello!? It's a fantasy movie based on a fantasy book, off course it's not real life. At least it's true to the book.<br/><br/>Some also say it's a stupid teen movie and they regret seeing it. Well maybe you shouldn't see it since it's directed towards the teenage-girls fan-base and they're probably not a teenager or a girl. Why waste your time? You want action movie? This is not it.<br/><br/>So in the end I think it's a solid movie, pretty typical book adaptation with a little bit of bad acting, some average acting and some good acting, clever humorous moments, amazing colours (the forest, wow!) and cinematography (esp. the shooting angles). It might help to know the background story a little bit before seeing it.<br/><br/>And please don't believe the haters!"

","So, I am over 25 and I liked the books. <br/><br/>First, I'd like to say that it'd be nice if people could get to know the story before going to see the movie and kill it in a comment. A lot of people are focused on Bella's behavior, what the people do and how the story goes ; it's in the book, all of it. I mean, you may not like the actors, the music or whatever but if you don't like the story, just don't go see the movie!<br/><br/>Now, about the film, it is true, the love part is not shown enough ; the movie is very slow - lots of shots of the actors faces, not moving, lots of pauses - and in the same time too quick, at the end it goes too fast and the story is impossible to understand if you didn't read the books. Plus, some things present in the books are not needed here, or would have to be explained. Lots of cheesy sentences - you do need sentences before and after to make sense... The actors have 10 sentences each/1 sentence for each passage of the film, and big (funny) parts of the book have been taken away.<br/><br/>Some guys just cut too many parts of the movie because someone had decided it had to be 2h and not more.<br/><br/>Action scenes are really good."

","Don't go in with high expectations and you will thoroughly enjoy it! It stayed true to the book and the director did an excellent job. I enjoyed it more than twilight and found the vampires looked a lot better in this movie. I didn't like Kirsten Stewart in Twilight but I think she stepped up in New Moon. The director did well with what he had to work with as most of the book was depressing and written as Bella's thoughts. Im glad they didn't drag out Bella's lonely months and went straight to the action! If your worried about wasting your money then wait for it to come out on DVD! If your a true fan of the Twilight Saga then you will love it!"
"Stampsfightclub","7","1","7","29 November 2009"," More action and fantasy - but is that so good?
","Bella Swan (Stewart) struggles to adapt to life after Edward (Pattinson) leaves for her own safety and soon she is spending time with Jacob (Lautner) who is a werewolf.<br/><br/>There is a certain credibility with watching this film if you are not a teenage girl. For one the appreciation of love and lust intermixed with the foundations of friendship are all maturely depicted in Stephanie Meyer's book so you are looking for a good adaptation of mature emotions. There is however sadness on the stereotypical portrayal of viewers for these twilight films; teenage girls watch for the sheer factor of Pattinson and Lautner. But the refusal to watch a film based on the fan base is frankly ridiculous.<br/><br/>The sequel to the globally popular Twilight has already spurned millions in cash and even broken The Dark Knight's record for biggest opening day, but does the money guarantee satisfaction? The old saying of the film is never as good as the book is absent here as there is plenty more action to be enjoyed. However the generation of emotion from the book never fully comes across on film. The critics jumped on the lack of action in the first and this picture tries to make amends and does so with a passion of action.<br/><br/>This is the main reason the film is to be enjoyed. The brief but well directed trial bike sequence on the appropriate wet roads is good and the cliff diving sequence adds a spice of darkness and passion to the feelings of Bella. The wolves generate a feeling of spice and action, in good sync when Laurent emerges. In general the film has a livelier outburst and the sequences of action and fighting are far better than the brief scenes in Twilight. Therefore this should be appreciated by a wider audience as we still have the love.<br/><br/>The book had the action sequences and this film justifies them well enough to satisfy the twi-hards. Balancing the action and dialogue was well portrayed as well.<br/><br/>However this film has a few major flaws. For one the general feeling is never quite accurate. We can not really associate with Bella during her tough parts of separation. The constant inclusion of a ghostly Edward giving advice does not benefit the supposed feeling of isolation. And perhaps the initial love and companionship the two main characters had in the first film feels irrelevant in the grand scheme of proceedings here.<br/><br/>The soundtrack boasts new artists all over and we can never have appropriate silence to reflect the mood. Chris Weitz must be quite green as if he isn't shooting a pair of branches or trees he is shooting a hard to view werewolf.<br/><br/>However this is a good fun film. Jacob is a better character than Edward owing to his more adventurous personality which adds another dimension of love. The action is far better and though the feeling of love isn't as high as the first this is a worthy watch."
"SeanDTheFilmMaker","5","1","7","28 November 2009"," Mixed on this one
","The first Twilight was horrible to say the least, and this one was actually better. However I think some of the previews that played before it where actually more entertaining.<br/><br/>That being said, if you where to cut out all the scenes with Ed and Bell together it would be a fantastic movie. It feels like they are so close to a really good movie but they give us no evidence of why the two even like each other except that Bella blinks a lot and gasps between sentences when talking to him. So it is senseless and Bella falls into the category of a retarded person. Im mean who goes through a break up and acts like they are trying to kick Cocaine and heroin out of their system? I mean how long where they together, a year possibly two? I've known relationships that have ended in which the couple's where together for years. It sends out a weird message about obsession that adults can identify but young kids might not. Unfortunately showing a story that says its OK to be obsessed with a guy to the point where you are suicidal is not the something the MPAA worry about kids seeing, just nudity.<br/><br/>But as far as the Jacob character and the rest of the ""pack"" that was damn good actually. I think, as I said to people before, the idea of creating a story between Where wolfs and vampires was actually a really good idea, in fact the only good idea the author actually had, too bad she submerged in unbelievable bull crap. So you have to kind of ignore the Bella and Edward love angle cause it sure as heck isn't love and sure as heck isn't working.<br/><br/>Of course Jacob has his corny moments. Though I never seen anyone take off their entire shirt to field dress a small head scratch. Then again maybe that works with girls. Well then again I don't know any girls as foolish or gullible as Bella so perhaps not.<br/><br/>In the end I gave it 5 stars cause half the movie was good, the rest of the vampire stuff, especially the vampire Vatican thing was a waist of time. And you can tell too cause even the filmmakers didn't bother spending too much time on it.<br/><br/>If you want to actually laugh out loud, go for it see this movie!"
"drjmarkov","8","1","7","26 November 2009"," I liked the film
","The film is generally good and I don't see why most of the comments are negative. This book is hard for filming, because this is an emotional,but not full of action story. You must not blame the director or the others from the staff.They have done their job absolutely fine.Some of you say the dialogs are not good,but simple-this is Bella, the Charlie's daughter and they don't speak a lot.Some say that Kristen Steward was not playing well.I don't think so.The book tells about the ""numbness"" that Bella try to hold instead of the ""pain from the hole in her chest"". How do you expect to play numbness if she is more emotional.This is neither a Gothic nor a fantasy story-this is just a love story.If some have expected anything Dracula-type, this is not their movie.There is no controversy between the Good and the Evil.This is just a story for an impossible love."
"Ed63","5","1","7","20 November 2009"," I wanted to like it
","Having read all 4 books (loved them) and enjoying the first movie, this was a huge disappointment. The director did a horrible job and did not get the most out of the actors which we saw in the first movie. Catherine Hardwicke did an excellent job with the first movie. The acting at the beginning of New Moon was wooden and unbelievable. Spoiler! The additional fight scene with the Volturi near the end of the movie takes away from the chess match between the Cullens and the Volturi throughout the books. Additionally, Edward according to the books could not lose a fight because he can read the minds of his opponents. So are we to expect Hollywood to ruin the end of the 4th book as well? Probably. Yes New Moon did have its moments and it did stay close to the book at times but again the directing is the major weakness of this movie. At least there is another director for the next movie and hopefully they will have someone capable for the 4th movie."
"luckyfreakybaby","8","2","22","20 November 2009"," Kinda sad, movie nothing like book
","If you haven't read the books, you will probably give this movie a 10. If you have read this book, you will be very disappointed. The movie has a few quotes from the book, but does not follow at all. The movie all in all was very well made, I am just upset about how little the movie followed the book. The movie did not focus on some of the most key features of the book. I almost felt hurried to get to the end of the movie. The wolves played a huge role in the book, well the movie they just don't get much time. I am team Edward all the way, but why make the movie so much different from the book? And I don't remember Rosalie apologizing to Bella in the second book?"
"TheBrownBunny66","7","1","8","5 January 2010"," Unexpectedly enjoyable
","I only recently read the books because my girlfriend wanted to chat to me about it. I had actually seen the first movie before reading the book and thought it was mildly diverting. Personally i had loved Catherine Hardwick's work on 'Thirteen' and 'Lords of Dogtown', finding them grassroots and stylistic. However this didn't seem to translate particularly well to Twilight for me as the casting was wrong, story unimaginative, sfx appalling, and acting mostly awful.<br/><br/>After reading twilight and new moon i went to see New Moon with great trepidation, aware that the book was pretty unfilmable in its singular incarnation. The plot was very lopsided, believability was at an all time low with the introduction of the lycans, and it was very unresolved.<br/><br/>However to my great surprise a minor miracle occurred, Chris Weitz, despite everything working against him, had created a thoroughly enjoyable film. Gone was the pretentious unrelenting introspection of the first film. Gone was the drab blue desaturated palette and one level emotions. Instead Chris Weitz had finally realised the narrative world in which these characters inhabit. With some clever timeline changing, pushing Bella's cliff-dive until after the discovery of Jacob as a lycan and then creating an action-scene of the wolf-pack chasing Victoria (not in the book) to mix with this to the sounds of Thom Yorkes 'Hearing Damage', i was incredibly impressed with the choices that were made.<br/><br/>Other clever devices were visualising Edward in the scene's with Bella doing dare devil activities, therefore clarifying a point that was somewhat fumbled in the book. Also finally the vampires actually looked somewhat threatening, appearing more gaunt with stranger eyes; Chris Weitz nails the balance between beauty and beast that was very superficially handled in the original film.<br/><br/>Overall the SFX are a marketable improvement over the original film, the sense of speed when the wolves and vampires run is SOO much more impressive. Rather than the lame glide effect employed in Twilight, these species smash into things with both elegance and brutality.<br/><br/>Another reason i liked New Moon was the development of Jacob and his affect on Bella. It was always something i liked a lot in the book, finally seeing Bella acting like a teenager rather than some boring introverted self-pitying bore. Seeing there relationship bloom was interesting, fun and believable - something i find particularly remiss in the Edward/Bella relationship (does that mean i'm Team Jacob? - haha gag). This movie dared to treat Bella as a human being who does stupid things for the sake of rebellion. Under the hands of another director it could have seemed pretty lame, but Chris Weitz has a particularly elegant eye, unwilling to jump to quickly from one plot point to another without setting up his themes and characters before hand.<br/><br/>I think thats the thing that i found so beguiling about this film, the seamlessness of the narrative arc. From such poorly written and realised book, Chris has made a fully fledged film that excites and emotes.<br/><br/>I really liked the realisation of the Volturri, finding them actually far more threatening in the movie than the novelisation. The introduced action piece that was absent from the book between Edward and one of the Voluturri brutes doesn't feel tacked on, instead its exciting and shows him as vulnerable, again something the book seems absolutely unable to allow.<br/><br/>I think thats what i loved most about this film. It allowed its characters to become imperfect. Edward is not the strongest, Jacob's adolescent rage and fleeting love sets himself up for bad situations, Alice has trouble controlling her bloodlust, as with Jacob, and Bella lets her impulses override her internal danger mechanisms. There is something romantically dangerous about the characters struggles in this new film, and Chris Weitz has translated them beautifully for his adaptation.<br/><br/>The only major criticism would have to be the ending of the film. Very daytime soap, and endlessly frustrating in terms of 'sequalitus'.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a really wonderful film, great cinematography, flawless soundtrack, improved acting (particularly good performances from Jasper, Alice, Jacob and Bella's father), really enviable screen writing (i would have hated to adapt the book), and close to flawless directing.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy."
"slayguy86","6","1","8","14 December 2009"," Better in some ways but worse in others.
","Well first things first, I'm not a fan of the books in any way. So I'm kinda treating this series of movies like I do with the Harry Potter series, so I don't particularly care if things are different from the book version etc.<br/><br/>To be honest it wasn't quite as bad as I originally thought it would be, some parts where actually quite enjoyable, then again I've always been one for werewolf movies than vampires. However like the previous instalment, it lacked something and as a result failed to grip me as a non fan of the books.<br/><br/>New Moon's big problem is its pace or lack of in certain areas, it doesn't seem to move forward very quickly since it's padded with long talky scenes that would be considered compelling drama to a 15 year old. The werewolves them selves don't get a lot of screen time as it is and for that matter neither do the vampires. The fact that it takes at least half of the film to get to anything vaguely exciting is what makes the film a bit of an all round disappointment.<br/><br/>On the plus side the effects and fight scenes are well done, so kudos to the stunt and effects teams there. However it's still amazing that our two leads (Patterson and whats her face) and still haven't improved or developed their performances since the last instalment, again like Twilight I got more joy out of the supporting actors performances than our two leads.<br/><br/>I'm giving the movies a 6/10... not bad but not great."
"dorkyj2002","7","1","8","27 November 2009"," Better than the first, still needs work
","***Spoilers***<br/><br/>I didn't have huge hopes for the second of the Twilight saga. I loved the books, but the first movie was horrible. Not as bad as something like ""Disaster Movie,"" but still pretty painful to watch. That being said- and even though I only gave this a 6.5/7 rating- this was a huge improvement from Twilight. This film was not as awkward; I feel it followed the book much better also. The acting still needs work though. Stewart still overacts and Pattinson still underacts. I can't explain it, but that worked for this movie. Because you had to believe Bella was emotionally dying and Edward was trying to leave her to a ""normal"" life. Better cinematography, better action, and better ""direction"" makes this the film to beat when the other two come out. The only real reason I gave this rating was for a couple of scenes which should have been tweaked. Michael Sheen's performance as Aro was an interesting twist. At the same time, however, I felt he came off as Johnny Depp in Charlie & the Choc. Factory creepy. When I read of the Volturi in New Moon, I was petrified by their evil. Not stifling laughter whenever they spoke. <br/><br/>I have to give it to Weitz on this film. I cannot believe the same director of ""The Golden Compass"" helped bring this film to life. It's really ashame someone else is directing Eclipse. I would like to have seen what else Weitz has to offer the Twilight franchise."

After months of her still wanting this life and her rescuing him, he does go back to Forks and stays with her. I think you should read all the books before you make any opinions because you don't know all the facts.

I saw the movie with my friends (even the guys) and they said that is was a really good movie. The acting could have been a little better. In the book there's this big-ish transition between chapter 3 and 4 and I was wondering how they would do that, Chris Weitz (sp*) directed that very well. If Summit hasn't decided on a director for Breaking Dawn they should have Chris direct again. This sounds like a whole bunch of blah blah blah but unfortunately we have to write at least 10 lines."

","I am a 16 year old girl, and I love the Twilight movies, as do most of my friends. However, contrary to popular belief, we don't love them simply because Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are 'super hot' (although I will admit, it does help).<br/><br/>First of all, Twilight is an amazing love story, which thousands of people have fallen in love with. It's got those timeless elements of forbidden love and tragically flawed characters, mixed together with an ultra modern twist (ie the vampires and werewolves.)<br/><br/>Then, the films bring this story to a whole new level as we get to watch it portrayed by a cast full of extremely talented actors. I have seen Kristen Stewart in many things besides Twilight, and I can honestly say that she is a very talented and intriguing actress (and if you don't believe me- go watch Speak). In New Moon she continues to bring great depth and truth to the character of Bella, as we watch her spiral into depression. <br/><br/>Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are both also very easy to watch and play their characters perfectly, in just the way Meyer intended. Pattinson, was unfortunately very serious and depressing in this movie, however I don't think there was any way around this as it was what the plot called for. And, he did play serious and depressed very well. Lautner brings a much needed warmth to the film which makes New moon completely different to Twilight, and I challenge you to not be drawn in by his infectious smile. <br/><br/>My favourite thing about this movie in particular, is that it's hilarious! One thing that I didn't like about the first movie was that all of the humour seemed to have disappeared somehow in the book to screen process However in New Moon, I spent a lot of the movie laughing quietly in my seat at the original one liners written excellently by Melissa Rosenberg and acted out perfectly by the cast (most notably Anna Kendrick- Jessica, and Billy Burke- Charlie)<br/><br/>I will say that this movie isn't perfect, some of the lines can be slightly misconstrued and there are some extremely cheesy moments which are quite cringe-worthy. However, I personally am willing to forgive them this. <br/><br/>Overall, I love this movie. It takes an incredible thing to capture the hearts of people worldwide and The Twilight Saga has done exactly that."

","I went into this movie expecting lousy acting and a lame screenplay. What I found was actually surprising. The acting was much better than Twilight with the exception of Kristen Stewart's depiction of depression. That was the most disappointing part of the entire movie. Robert Pattinson did a much better job at feigning regret. Taylor Lautner held the tweens hearts while they screamed at his newly buff body. The story, itself, is the second of the Stephenie Meyer's series. It centres around Bella's depression after Edward and his family leave when Jasper actually tries to attack Bella after a paper cut at the family home. After the Cullens depart and she's had months of depression, Bella finds friendship and eventually more with Jacob Black. As everyone who's read the book knows, Edward returns eventually after Bella saves him from (pardon the pun) exposing himself to the humans. The Volturi were well casted as well as the part of Jane. Dakota Fanning makes for a worthy vampire. Overall, it is a good movie even though Kristen Stewart could've done a much better job."
"haydenlover","2","1","11","6 December 2009"," Put the twilight stigma behind and enjoy it for what it is: Pure Entertainment
","I just finished watching the Twilight Saga: New Moon and was pleasantly surprised. It was an entertaining and different weekend flick. However, it seems that a majority of the people on the internet would not agree with me. I will attribute this to the general stigma people have towards twilight. Mind you, I'm not a very big fan of the books and found the first film absolutely cringe-worthy and hilarious but I went in with an open mind and actually found myself enjoying it.<br/><br/>Yes, New Moon is a very melodramatic movie and may not be for everyone. However, that doesn't necessarily make it bad. The style director Chris Weitz incorporates reminds me of your typical Bollywood (Indian Film Industry) movie which I think brings something fresh to Hollywood. Two thumbs up to Weitz for making this movie a thousand times better than Twilight. The CGI may not be top notch but was done well and the scenes seems to flow better than they did in twilight. My favourite part of the movie was a chase scene through the woods accompanied by a Thom Yorke song. It stayed with me after I left the theater.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't Oscar worthy but how many performances these days truly are? In my opinion the stand out performance was Taylor Lautner's who brought a certain vulnerability to the character of Jacob and in the end made Jacob seem more likable than he was in the book. I think more people should focus on how much of Jacob's personality he has embodied than how much muscle he put on. This movie actually made me like Kristen Stewart somewhat as an actress as her incessant blinking has toned down a bit and she brings to screen a character many girls (although they shouldn't) can, in secret, relate to. I'm a huge fan of Robert Pattinson but the movie didn't do him justice. I'm glad he smiled more than he did in twilight but his performance just didn't make me ache for Edward the way some of his other characters in movies such as How to Be, Little Ashes and The Bad Mother's Handbook have.<br/><br/>And of course I can't forget Billy Burke, Peter Facinelli and Machael Sheen who brought the extra pizzaz needed to make the movie worthwhile.<br/><br/>My only complaint: Bad Script! Summit should really consider hiring someone else to write Breaking Dawn.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Patra28","10","1","11","5 December 2009"," new moon versus twilight
","I don't know where to begin the comparison between Twilight and New Moon. There are very few things i liked in New Moon but the most annoying thing was Robert Pattinson's acting. HORRIBLE! I cant believe how bad he was. That voice, no emotions, just lipstick... he appeared a lot in the movie (not true to the book) and I COULD HEAR PEOPLE LAUGH in the cinema every time he was just saying there,like a sculpture. Oh god ! then the running scene with Bella as vampire was so wrong!!! I consider myself a fan of the twilight saga but watching this movie was not worth at all. I think Kristen Stewart was OK. You can tell she tried her best and managed to describe the main line in the book.Thats all!!"
"julia-eunyoung-song","7","1","11","5 December 2009"," Much better than expected and satisfies fans
","I've been reading some of these reviews and I solely opened an account with IMDb to add this comment. There has been a lot of slander against this movie and to be frank, I don't understand why. If you are a person who has not read the books, that may be a reason, or if you a person who expected the movie to be exactly like the novel, word for word, then that may be a reason. <br/><br/>I personally found the movie quite enjoyable. I have read all four books, and I have watched the previous movie Twilight. I have to admit, with the Twilight movie, I was fairly disappointed because it had too many awkward moments. But with New Moon, as a fan of the Twilight Series, I was satisfied with how the movie turned out. Chris Weiz took out minor details that could be sacrificed, and added parts that would have made the novel even more amazing. I found the Volturi battle scene an upgrade from the movie. Yes in the novel there was a dramatic face-off but in the movie, the battle just seemed to be more appropriate now that we look at it. I do have to admit Chris Weiz did leave out and changed a few scenes to make them a bit weird, but he did a much better job with New Moon than Catharine Hardwicke did with Twilight. I absolutely loved the film. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson should done a being job acting, but we're stuck with then until Eclipse and I've accepted that so I've tried to see the best in them through the movies. Taylor Lautner did a pretty fair job in my opinion as well. For a beginner actor (I know he has done previous acting but nothing mainstream like New Moon) He has done admirably. And the scenes with his shirt off were extra treats.<br/><br/>Also I've noticed many other comments with people who think that New Moon sets a bad example for women and young girls. IT'S JUST A MOVIE, AND VAMPIRES DON'T EXIST. It's just like Stephanie Meyer's response to Bella becoming pregnant in Breaking Dawn, It's just a story, Bella is in a fictional world with mythical creatures. Edward isn't going to get any younger, and he is her true love. Female vampires cannot become pregnant so Stephanie Meyer creates a FICTIONAL back story for Bella. People may also say that this gives no reason to create young female angst when losing their ""true love"", well this is fiction where true love exists. Also if we look at the media, there are millions of other things that have a larger impact on the way the youth thinks. Don't just blame New Moon, there are worse influences but we don't see the youth becoming mindless corpses. Young girls do not see New Moon as a guide book, it's entertainment."

","It is awesome! New Moon is better than the book! If you are waiting until the crowds die down rent Twilight then go see New Moon. I saw it the first day it came out and I plan to go see it at least 2 more times! My granddaughter has all the books, I saw the movie Twilight, then I read the book. Next I read New Moon and waited for the movie. After I see the movie again and again I will read the next book in the series! This movie Taylor Lautner are Kristen are the stars. Rob Pattison has less of a role, but his acting was flawless!<br/><br/>You can see the chemistry between Rob and Kristen on the big screen! I now have a blue ray player. So I will purchase Twilight as blue ray. Will look forward to buying New Moon when released on blue-ray.<br/><br/>This movie has it all, action yes, suspense, yes, love story yes.

"ShannonR","7","1","11","24 November 2009"," True to the book
","As a fan of the books I can say this movie was done pretty well and stayed very true to the author's story. I'm not a fan because of the hot guys or plan to model my life after Bella's (she's just a character folks, not meant to be a hero or idol). I enjoy the love story as well as the drama and suspense of each book's plot. If you're not a fan of the books or story then you probably won't enjoy the movie, simple as that. But I enjoyed it quite a bit and thought the characters, especially Jacob, were portrayed very well. I missed a little of the visually artistic approach taken with the first movie, New Moon is definitely a more literal interpretation, however, the story is told well and I found it quite entertaining. I definitely think you get more out of it if you have read the book, but most, if not all, of the major details/events are in the movie and I felt it told more of the complete story than the first movie did. Looking forward to the third!"
"Kelchubordnor","6","1","11","20 November 2009"," New Moon better than the book (fortunately)
","To be honest I read the book about 3 months ago and was a little disappointed as I got bored. I found the book very easy reading but sort of lacking the body of the first. Well I wasn't too sure what to expect as twilight is pretty much word for word movie to book exactly the same. Fortunately and I'm sure the Edward Cullen fan club will disagree with me, the important stuff is in the film. To be honest Bella's friends are wasted and didn't even need to be in the movie, also the werewolf bit is confusing as they would actually be spirit walkers as opposed to werewolves, different process similar result. The film does feel a little long and also it ends rather abruptly but there you go. The scenes in Italy are beautifully shot but again something feels missing. The soundtrack is good (I actually bought it before I saw the movie) and despite the critics that I have read, I like it. So please go and enjoy but don't expect twilight."

","Okay what is with all you other people slating this movie? Seriously? If it was so bad how come it has broken box office records for the amount of money made for a new movie? Are you people who are leaving negative comments the type of people that work in boring mundane jobs think you're super cool for being so laid back? Whatever, it was a good film and I have seen loads worse! Grow up and stop being so negative. Maybe when you can have an intelligent conversation, until then don't talk crap unless you really know what you are talking about! I mean it really was much better than the first one by far! And that goes to show you the difference between a good and bad director. At least in New Moon they didn't leave out key scenes which they did in the first one (the scene where Bella passes out because of the blood in class, that was quite a key scene).<br/><br/>Anyway I thought this was fantastic! They got Jacob down to a T and the whole Voltari thing was pretty super. The only thing I would say is they could have played with the other members of the Voltari a bit more, but there is only so much you can put in a movie.<br/><br/>I would also say it's a bit violent for younger viewers, but the books do get a bit darker and this is not necessarily a bad thing. Overall great acting from all cast, I think they played the wolf pack brilliantly and Emily was perfect for the role. I was a bit unsure about Rosalie in the first one, but she comes out perfectly in this one, even if she's only in there for a short while. As for Bella's father, they couldn't have chosen a better actor for this role.<br/><br/>Overall a great movie, like I said much better than the first one. It's not going to win any Oscars, but that was never the point of this movie. This movie is a great film based on the book, almost down to a T and Stephanie Meyer should definitely be proud of this one!"

Chris Weitz is a much better director than Catherine Hardwicke. I hope he directs the remainder of the films.

"MyOwnGuardianAngel143","7","1","16","20 November 2009"," Exceeded my expectations
","I am an avid fan and reader of the Twilight series. I fell in love with the books, and when the first movie came out, I was very disappointed in it. I don't think the acting was all that good, save for a VERY select few (Carlisle, Alice And Charlie for example), and I think Catherine Hardwick tried too hard to make the love/action story entirely into a chick flick. Because of this, I went to New Moon with very low expectations, despite the new director. I was astounded by how blown away I was by this film. I thought Kristen Stewart did a terrible job as Bella in the first movie; there was typically little to no emotion shown on her face. Her expression when she told Edward she loved him was similar to the one on her first day of school. However, she seems to have developed a LITTLE bit of emotion in this second movie. Maybe by Breaking Dawn, we'll see a full range of emotions in her. Maybe? I'll keep my fingers crossed. I also didn't like the acting of Robert Pattison, and the little I saw of him in New Moon did impress me. I think he did a very good job being cruel in the break up scene, and a very good job when he came back in the scene in Italy. Taylor Lautner, whew... I was floored. I am a HUGE fan of Jacob; I am crazy about him. I couldn't form much of an opinion of Lautner from the first movie because he had very few lines. However, in this second movie, we get almost a solid hour of Taylor Lautner. He was phenomenal. Not to mention, the shirtless-ness... can't say I'm going to complain. Taylor did a magnificent job as Jacob, and I'm glad he stayed on. Dakota Fanning did incredible as Jane. In fact, I think they casted everybody in the Volturi very very well. I don't think they could have made a better choice for actors. This film stuck a lot closer to the book, which made me quite happy, as the first film lacked in that particular area. The hits Alice takes at Jacob when she returns after Bella cliff dives are beyond hilarious, and were the perfect time for comic relief. The almost-kiss between Bella and Jacob had me gripping my boyfriend's hand to the point where I almost broke it. Lautner did an amazing job showing the heartache and sadness when he realizes Bella is going to go to Italy to save Edward. The action scene in the Volterra, which wasn't originally in the book, was very well placed and very well played through. The music score, I will admit, could have been better, but I like how they didn't overload the movie with music like Twilight did. The movie, overall, was incredible and I would go see it again, happily."

","My God. Even if the first one wasn't technically a good film, at least you could enjoy the weirdness and not get ever bored. That didn't happen with this one. The first hour is almost unwatchable, with a depressed Bella after Edward abandons her.<br/><br/>The movie shows us the play Romeo and Juliet, so we can force a conexion with it and the story we watch about these two lovers. But it doesn't work at all, and that forces the writers to make characters act in contradictory ways all of a sudden so they can force the comparison with the classical.<br/><br/>What we do have is boring scenes that amount pretty much to nothing until sudden changes force a huge jump in the plot, for then a bunch of scenes of nothing until the next jump, often requiring characters to appear out of nowhere to force those changes. There is no tension because there doesn't seem to be a logical story progression and then we are at the end of the story in the third act, and barely anything happened.<br/><br/>A bad, awful ""romantic"" teen story.

"filipemanuelneto","5","0","2","25 March 2020"," General improvements over the previous film.
","This film was based on a series of ""best seller"" books about the romance between a vampire and a young human. I never read the books (nor do I intend to) to know what they are like, and I'm willing not to talk about them, but if Edward and Bella's love story was supposed to be epic something didn't work. Despite this, and just like the first film in this tetralogy, this film was a box office champion, teenagers consumed it well and the studio rubbed its hands in satisfaction.<br/><br/>The plot is easy to summarize. After realizing that Bella was in danger with him, Edward leaves her, wishing she would forget him and live a normal life. But she falls into depression and seeks to put herself at risk in the hope that he will appear through visions that she has whenever she is in danger. At the same time, she approaches Jake, who is in love with her and wants to have a chance. It turns out that he also changes: he belongs to a tribe of werewolves and, somehow, it activates and he starts to be able to transform into a giant wolf. From there, the animosity between him and Edward grows, given that vampires and werewolves are natural enemies, and is linked to the competition for the love of young Bella.<br/><br/>Despite the change of director, little changes. Chris Weitz seems more capable as a producer than as a director. The film is going on without us feeling connected to what we are seeing. With the exception of some very concrete scenes, there is no involvement or depth, everything seems futile and a deep and dramatic love, capable of transforming a person's life, ends up just looking like a childish crush. The sudden ending of the film would, I think, have the intention of provoking a ""wow effect"" in the audience, but in me it only caused the sensation that the final part of the film was cut.<br/><br/>What I said about the actors in the first film applies perfectly to this one. There were some casting errors that didn't help. Kristen Stewart is a weak actress with no presence or expression, and the same can be said of a dull Robert Pattinson, who seems to be more dead than his character. Both were poor casting choices and the romance between them never convinces by the absolute lack of chemistry. In spite of everything, comparing the two films directly, I think Stewart took advantage of the previous experience and did a better job here, which may be the result of some critical spirit and the ability to face mistakes and try to do better. Better than them, Taylor Lautner is more intense and palatable, and that intensifies a lot here. Together with Billy Burke and Ashley Greene, they are the best interpretations of the film. The Volturi manage to appear cold, calculating and threatening, especially Dakota Fanning, Jamie Campbell Bower and Christopher Heyerdahl. Michael Sheen seems polite, even aristocratic, but he based his character on a thousand stereotypes about European noble vampires and looks like a caricature and not a credible character.<br/><br/>Technically, the film shows improvements compared to the previous one, perhaps the result of a stronger financial investment by the studio. CGI wolves are excellent and are the most striking and interesting visual resource. Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack stood out more and this is worth it because it is one of the best technical notes in tetralogy. Editing and post-production work were poor. Good scenery, props, good large-scale images of cold and cloudy landscapes and a beautiful city of Volterra complete the technical work.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel that this film represents a slight improvement over the previous one. We continue to face a dull story, but the introduction of truly threatening characters and the greater role given to more emotional characters and capable actors gives it a bag of breathable air that its predecessor does not have."

","3 out of 5 stars (average)<br/><br/>Note: the ""Twilight"" saga is one of the most fascinating franchises I have ever viewed. Its characters are fascinatingly uninteresting, its ""romance"" fascinatingly creepy, and its ""message"" fascinatingly bizarre. However, I liked it at one time. This review was written at a time when I wasn't allowed to see a great number of vampire movies, meaning that I found the action scenes in this to be great (they are decent at best). Therefore, please take the following review with a grain of salt, and know that a current evaluation of this film is coming. Enjoy!<br/><br/>It seems not too long ago that we were first introduced to Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) when the Twilight saga began, along with the rest of the characters from the book series. Bella is still ""Ms. Angst"" and Edward is still speaking in Shakespearean-type prose.<br/><br/>Bella is upset because it's her birthday. Why? Because Edward never ages and she is afraid she will grow old and useless while Edward will remain young. At Bella's party at the Cullen's, Jasper almost bites her because of a paper cut. Suddenly, Edward announces that he and the rest of the Cullen's; Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, Carlisle, and Esme are leaving the tiny town of Forks because ""people are noticing Carlisle hasn't aged one bit."" He tells Bella he's never coming back: it will be as if he didn't exist. Bella, being the goddess of angst she is, goes into a deep depression. This leaves her father Charlie (Billy Burke) confused on what to do for his daughter.<br/><br/>But, when Bella discovers that when she is in danger, Edward will appear in a vision and speak to her, our idiotic Juliet immediately goes to her childhood friend Jacob seeking help. She begs him to help her fix up a couple of motorcycles so she can see her undead Romeo by taking a ride on the wild side. As she and Jacob work on the motorcycles, Bella gradually comes out of her depression and develops great feelings for him. Later, when Jacob starts exhibiting very strange behavior (i.e. disrespect, anger problems, and avoidance,) Bella wonders what is going on.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Jacob and several others on the Indian Reservation have a deep secret inside. (It seems Bella can't find any normal human boys to like.) What is the deep dark secret? How is Bella involved? Will she and Edward ever make out again? To find out, you'll have to see this exhilarating thrill ride or talk to one of the ten thousand screaming girls who have read the book and would happily kiss Robert Pattinson had they the chance.<br/><br/>Speaking of screaming girls, my friend Meagan saw the midnight viewing the night the movie came out and I interviewed her the next day at school. Here's what Meagan had to say:<br/><br/>K-What did you think about New Moon compared to Twilight?<br/><br/>M-New Moon is definitely more adrenaline-rushing.<br/><br/>K-Who do you think is a better love interest for Bella?<br/><br/>M-Edward<br/><br/>K-Do you think the director stayed close to the book?<br/><br/>M-No<br/><br/>K-Do you think that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson will continue to play Edward and Bella?<br/><br/>M-I hope so.<br/><br/>K-What did you think about the actress who played Jane?<br/><br/>M-She was really good.<br/><br/>K-Who do you think is a better director?<br/><br/>M-The first one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
I disagree with Meagan about the movie staying close to the book, which embarrassingly I've had the pleasure of reading. I thought the film stayed pretty close to the book, most of the time. My mom felt the Jane character in the book was totally different then portrayed by Dakota Fanning in the movie. (Jane is a Vulturi Vampire who enters the story in the end of the movie and book.) I thought this director had better pacing than the first movie, which seemed a little slow for me. The camera work in the beginning of New Moon was terrible though-I was sick of seeing the back of Bella's head as the camera revolved around her during her many months of depression.<br/><br/>I think, and please don't hurt me for saying this, that Jacob is a better love interest for Bella than Edward because he's more relatable. I know they don't end up together but I enjoyed watching their chemistry anyway.<br/><br/>If you want more action, more comedy and more Jacob, go see this action packed film which surprised me by staying close to the book. Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action"

"Badmoviessuck","4","0","1","8 January 2019"," Bella is a user
","I think this movie is better than the last one.
It's still bad but this one is an improvement.<br/><br/>ROMANCE
This is a better version of the last movie in my opinion.
The relationship with Bella and Jacob is better than the relationship between Bella and Edward cause Bella and Jacob has some chemistry.
The problem with Bella and Edwards chemistry was that it was non existent.
Bella and Edward talked to each other it was for the sake of moving the plot forward, not expanding the relationship.
But in this movie the dialogue between Bella and Jacob is only to expand their relationship which is the plot of the story... well now i know why their relationship is better.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
Bella is one of the worst protagonist i have ever seen.
When Edward leaves she goes through some stuff.
Jessica even says that she is going through depression but that barely shows.
She changes as a person and becomes an adrenaline junkie by watching action movies and ride bikes and she has also those dreams that occur to show how much she is suffering.
But when then the rest of the movie she acts just the same as she did in the last one.
Having bad dreams dosen't equal character development.
She is also a user.
When Edward left she was all over Jacob but when Edward came back She went back to Edward.
Jacob is the best character in this movie.
His desire to protect Bella is the reason to why he is such a good character.
Jacob wants to be with Bella but he wants to protect her so he he changes and joins a group, it's not a big change but it's something.<br/><br/>THE FINAL ACT
They failed making the final act.
They just shoved it in there to end the movie.
There was fake stakes, bad fight scenes, bad CGI, everything was there.<br/><br/>VERDICT
This movie is bad.
People complained about the slow pacing but it never bothered me.
But i don't understand why people hate this movie more than the first one, the first one dosen't work it's giant mess but this movie atleast does the romance part decent."

"TheNabOwnzz","1","0","1","16 June 2018"," One of the most inhumane and emotionally deadening movies ever created
","The first Twilight was already a disaster, and i thought to myself , 'This one couldn't possibly be any worse'. Unfortunately this assumption was incorrect and thus we have an even inferior sequel to an already terrible original film. <br/><br/>Like the first one, New Moon doesn't seem to understand anything about humans and human emotion, which isn't a surprise since i would have expected this after the first one. However, New Moon seemingly takes itself a lot more seriously than the first one because there are numerous melodramatic scenes with cringy dialogue, terrible acting and with some music added to it like this was something that was supposed to invoke emotions in the audience. The combination of writing and acting doesn't really get any worse than this, but atleast it still somehow works as an unintentional comedy of sorts, as i found myself laughing through a lot of parts of the film that weren't supposed to be funny ( Especially Bella's performance with Volturi ). Like the first Twilight, New Moon also keeps insulting the audience's intelligence with its dumb flashbacks right after something from the past has been said, like we needed to be told twice because otherwise we wouldn't understand.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is once again terrible as Bella Swann, Robert Pattinson is also extremely unabsorbing as the completely uninteresting Edward & the addition of Taylor Lautner ( Jacob Black ) as a main character now has also not helped the movie to go forward. It really seems to me all of the actors in this franchise never even went to acting school, as all of them put emphasis on parts in sentences that i have never heard before and none of the actors seem to even understand what they are saying ( Especially Stewart, who is frequently seen shaking her head after a line or stating a long 'uhmmmm.....' before a line ). <br/><br/>The narrative structure is even worse than the first, as simply for plot reasons and nothing else Edward leaves Bella so when the obvious later happens ( He returns, obviously ) it is supposed to invoke emotions in us as the audience, but this lazy writing really doesn't get through to the objective movie watcher. Bella's depression state is obviously not convincing at all due to Stewart's wooden, emotionless & unimmersive and non existent acting talents that the audience does not feel anything for her at all, since we are always reminded by her terrible performance that we are watching a movie instead of being absorbed into its world ( And a particularly bad movie aswell ). <br/><br/>The CGI of the wolves is terrible, but the way they walk is even worse, as if it were straight out of a superhero kind of videogame. The remaining 'evil' vampires make a return for no apparant reason other than as the black guy whose name i forget states 'to kill Edward's mate as he killed Victoria's mate', yet we are supposed to believe these vampires are more than animalistic monsters ruled by instinct, yet the movie contradicts itself here once again, and all for the sake of there being some would-be tension. ( Tension, however, only works if you care about its characters, and quite frankly, you don't. ) In the end nothing at all is done with their storylines, and you keep wondering to yourself what the use of them was.<br/><br/>It is, even more so than the first, a constant abundance of cringeworthy scenes followed up after one another because it takes itself even more seriously than the first because of its extremely melodramatic scenes which features actors who never even went to acting school and are only capable of literally reading cue cards. Oh, and yes, it is just as insulting to the audience as the first one was, if not more."

","I for one thought this movie was a vast improvement over the first, primarily because it stayed so true to the book. And Weitz, unlike Hardwicke, wasn't itching to impose his own style on the story by using crazy camera angles and other weird stylistic elements that were nowhere suggested in the pages of Twilight. New Moon was fittingly glossy and stylistically neutral, appealing to a wider range of tastes. It was filmed beautifully and, to my great relief, had a much wider color palette than the first film.<br/><br/>I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.*"

","After watching the first film in the Twilight series I decided to take a look at the IMDb credits for the second movie,and I was surprised to discover that it was directed by one of the main people behind the first American Pie,which led to me getting ready to have a slice of Twilight Pie.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Celebrating her 19th birthday with boyfriend Edward Cullen, Bella Swan gets a paper cut,which leads to Edward's brother Jasper attempting to kill her.Saving Bella from his brother and fellow vampire,Edward begins to fear that he might not be as lucky a second time. Taking charge of the situation,Edward tells Bella that he is leaving the city and her due to wanting Bella to be as safe as possible.<br/><br/>Sinking into a deep depression ,Bella stays in her room for months until her dad Charlie pushes Bella to go out and catch up with her friends. Knowing him casually at high school,Bella finds Jacob Black as a kind shoulder to cry on.As Bella and Jacob start to get close,Jacob begins to fear about Bella finding out his secret,which is that he is a werewolf.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Sending the main couple on their separate ways in the opening,the adaptation by returning writer Melissa Rosenberg turns down the brooding light Gothic romance for quirky indie Drama vibes.Whilst the lack of Bella & Edward sharing scenes does lead to their romance lacking the passion that made it the focus of part 1,Rosenberg gives the title a wonderful set of funky fangs,thanks to sinking a light comedy into the movie,which leads to some surprisingly funny character moments,as Rosenberg slowly casts a charming warmth over Bella's relationship with Jacob.<br/><br/>Given only a year to make the film, (which led to part 1 director Catherine Hardwicke turning down the chance to return) director Chris Weitz & cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe deliver an impressive blend of eye-catching romance and an epic-scope horror crunch. Backed by a jangly score from Alexandre Desplat,Weitz & Aguirresarobe open up Bella's depression with long dazzling,circling tracking shots,which along with displaying the passing of time in an expert manner,also reveals how lost Bella gets from the world.Unleashing wolves,Weitz punches action thrills into the horror animals,as a tense werewolf fight stomps across the screen,as the vampires are revealed in a dazzling sea of red.<br/><br/>Licking up every drop of boiling horror romance, Anna Kendrick, Dakota Fanning & Michael Sheen give delightful performances as Jessica,Jane and Aro,with Sheen biting into Aro's boo-hiss horror villainy with a superb relish.Taking on the challenge of being the main romantic lead in the title, Taylor Lautner gives a very good performance as Jacob Black,due to Lautner keeping away from given Jacob signs of brooding by presenting Jacob as a humble,down to earth guy who is struggling to tell a girl he has feelings for a secret,which just happened to be that he is a werewolf!,as the second chapter of the Twilight saga ends."

","Just when I thought the first in the Series had me hooked, they go and make New Moon. Although there is not as much of Edward in this movie, the second of the five, this one started to tell the story and develop the key characters in greater depth. When Edward leaves her, Bella's world completely falls apart. My heart broke for her, I felt the holes in her chest right along with her. And, to try and make Jacob fill the void - well, there was just no way this wet behind the ears kid (aka werewolf) was going to match the intrigue, beauty and passion of Edward. It was nice of Bella to give Jacob a sliver of a chance though. I was elated when Edward tried to expose himself to the humans because that was the only way Bella could save him, and save herself. Many of the other characters in this move kind of started to play second fiddle, as the characters of Edward and Bella really stepped forward, which started the dominated of the balance of the series."

","As this movie began, I had my doubts if it would ever become any interesting. The first half hour of the film is very slow paced, with few moments that deserve spectator's attention. However, after some while, we're given what we want: a fantasy romance. In ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"", we don't have a remarkable plot, a well written story or a professional main actor. However, we do have one thing that makes up for that: we have a GREAT directing! Chris Weitz is able to create intense scenes between the characters, even thought there isn't anything special in what they're doing; it's just the way director makes it look-- along with a sensible soundtrack. I know it may feel a little corny the way the camera goes round and round, but it simply WORKS in this occasion. Also, the photography directing is very well done, delivering magnificent scenes-- especially those made in the woods. Anyways, I know it wasn't meant to be very intelligent or anything; Twilight franchise was made to teenagers who usually enjoy creative romances and its aspects, and for this matter, the franchise is, at least until this installment, efficient. Congratulations for the team!"

","I feel that this film needs to have a fair rating. I have read all of the books many times and will admit that I'm a huge fan. The first Twilight film wasn't brilliant so I can see people were underestimating it before seeing it. I personally think the books are so amazing, Stephanie Meyer is an incredible writer, I can still read them now. New Moon is probably my least favourite (being a team Edward fan!) but it doesn't mean it's not good. I think the film demonstrates Bella's hopelessness without Edward very well. Although my favourite scene, when Bella pushes Edward out of the sun wasn't quite up to my standard, only because in the book it's such a lovely moment and it feels slightly rushed in the film. Of course they do miss small details out but I believe Robert Pattinson is very well suited to being Edward. I like how he includes the small details from the book, like random quotes. I do however believe Kristen Stewart to be quite poor at playing Bella as she's so determined and selfless in the book but in the films she can be quite irritating. I believe it is RUDE to dislike this movie if you've not seen the first movie, or have any idea of what it is about, or read the books, which I would 100% recommend."
"Scrugulus","6","0","5","5 July 2012"," OK, but confusing......
","Let's start by stating what this film had in common with the first one: quite decent acting on all fronts. What it didn't have was a common theme: it completely fell apart into two separate story-lines: 1) the Edward-Bella-Jake plot and Bella's suffering and her recuperation through her time spent with Jake. 2) the Volturi plot<br/><br/>In my view, it would never have been easy to seamlessly string those two together, but the way it was done in this film certainly didn't work. That being said, both plot-lines were decent, the first one more so.<br/><br/>Were it for the first plot alone, I would probably give the film at least 6.5 out of 10, but I guess as a whole I'll rather end up nearer 5.5....."
"Jgordon96","10","0","5","26 May 2012"," Wow, Kristen Stewart is one talented girl.
","I watched New Moon with my girlfriend just today and wow, i gotta say i was pretty blown away even more than the first. This is only my 2nd review but i think i am getting pretty good at it. So.. the movie, the whole setting was totally different to the other movie as a lot more happens, the tone of the film is more humorous in parts, whilst the rest of the movie is very upsetting, (not giving away anything of course) You really see Kristen Stewarts acting chops in this gorgeous film. Now that they have millions to spend on the next movies and this one they have improved on everything. I thought the acting was very well portrayed and they stayed so true to the book, even more than Twilight if i am being honest. I though Chris Weitz did a great job, people should not have doubted him. Kristen Stewart was heart breaking in this performance, she was just perfect, i almost felt her pain. Again well done Kristen, you are the one to watch. The wolf pack cast fit the bill perfectly too, i think Taylor Lautner did a pretty swell job as the bad-ass Jacob Black. He is one ripped dude. Overall this film was stunning for me, i think critics are way too harsh on this great and fun series, i can relate a lot to it in some ways, with relationships and all. I fully recommend this amazing film and the rest of the series, top actors in this franchise, cannot applaud enough. Go buy New Moon and fall in love with the fans!"
"fredericksmith1952","6","0","5","22 May 2012"," I find this second installment of the series much more intriguing than the first.
","Yes, I know. I started with Breaking Dawn Part 1 and haven't even touched upon Twilight yet. My bad, I guess, but I find this second installment of the series much more intriguing than the first. Here we have actual drama, as real as a story about vampires can be, and real conflict. Bella is a teenage girl who acts like a teenage girl, and both Jacob and Edward act like teenage boys...which is sort of a real contradiction in Edward's case. I mean, after a couple of hundred years, don't you think a man might have some modicum of maturity? But maybe being a vampire retards your common sense in favor of your hormones. Hmmm. Wait a minute, what hormones? He's dead! Oh well, I could go on and on with the contradictions in this film, but who am I to rain on anyone's parade? This is a Romeo and Juliet set in the fantasy of seclusion and passion, a love that was written in the stars. The special effects are great, especially the transformation sequences with Jacob and the rest of the tribe. After all, you knew they were werewolves, right? And the addition of Michael Sheen as Aro, the head of the Volturie and Dakota Fanning as Jane, the evil inflicter of pain with a devilish smile, brings a new dimension of mystery to the story. Rated PG-13 for violence and dramatic action, this one is safe for the teens and even the 10 year old girls who are lovers of romance. Collectible if you have the original, and my wife and daughters own all four and are anxiously awaiting the fifth. (There you go, ladies, I reviewed it.)"
"annevejb","Null","0","4","26 August 2011"," Novels and stuff, v1.10
","My comment re Twilight (2008) is about the features in the series, but version 1.00 written before I had read the novels. This is about the features in the series, but written after I have read the novels.<br/><br/>I considered the features to be rather highbrow, not what I expected from a best seller. I noticed a user comment that considered the novels to be easy to read and brilliant, very traditional best seller.<br/><br/>I now find the novels to have lots and lots of easy to read words, but that a good attention span is needed for them to make sense, Eclipse especially, and such as attention span is something that has been knocked out of me during recent years. Many should have no problem reading these novels. I find the novella, The Short Second Life Of Brie Tanner, to be the easiest to read, though I would have preferred it to have chapters. I enjoyed reading 'Brie'.<br/><br/>The novels have chapters but these are not obvious as it is the author and main title that are at the top of the pages. In easy to read books I find chapter headings to not feel so relevant, but if I want to reread particular parts they become useful. Also, as I no longer tend to read a book through all at one sitting, chapters make for handy start stop points.<br/><br/>'Brie' is about stuff misquoted in Eclipse feature, likely for storytelling reasons, that is not in Eclipse novel. After my difficulties in reading Eclipse I looked for an audio book version and there is one available to Australians as a download, at a very affordable price for an audio book, but I am the sort to look for lower cost second hand versions and that does not appear to be part of the 'download' market.<br/><br/>I have found some very professional sounding You Tube audio books, BreakingDawnReader1, with a male reader for book 2, of 95% of the more approachable Breaking Dawn. I first read the paperback, mostly a chapter at a time, and then listened to the relevant part of the YouTube audio book.<br/><br/>I find the features to not be a waste of time, though they are not something that I want to return to often. The novels have so much extra detail that they clarify stuff that I found the features to not convey so well. The biggest example as this being a love story, I found that was obvious in the novels but suspiciously fake in the first three features. In the first three features I interpret the main characters as living in a delusion, but I interpret them from my own lack of success re practical romance.<br/><br/>After getting to know all five of the features my view has changed. I rate them all a lot more. I can now accept the romance in the earlier stories.<br/><br/>Stephanie Meyer has written something in these that has triggered a lot of echoes in the popular imagination, but this is not a writer that I am likely to follow, except maybe on film.<br/><br/>I do not consider J K Rowling to have had a success re features, I am likely to prefer to avoid features of any of her future stuff, but I will be oh so tempted to get to know her future novels, I do find the Harry Potter novels to be delicious. As are the Twilight novels, just they make too many demands on me There are those who appear able to get by okay in the modern world and there are those who get attacked by wolf packs regularly. The Harry Potter features as examples of the results of wolf attacks."

"KasinathCR","7","0","5","4 November 2010"," A Good Follow-Up to Twilight
","I don't know why the critics bash this movie like anything? Most of the critics would've read the novel and hence would've felt that the movie fell short of the impact that the novel created. I, quite frankly, more of a movie buff than a reader of the novels as I mentioned in my last review of Twilight(2008). I watched the second installment of what they named as ""The Twilight Saga"" immediately after watching the first so that I could understand the continuation and flow. To be very honest, I completely enjoyed this one more than the first. <br/><br/>The Story is that Bella and Edward get along right from where they left in the first. This time Bella becomes 18 which is an year older than Edward who always remains in 17 because he is a vampire(A Peculiar concept which I didn't mention in my review of Twilight(2008)). Edward takes Bella to his home for her birthday celebrations and due to a little paper-cut, Bella bleeds. Jasper Cullen, the mate of Alice Cullen, thirsts for Bella's blood and Edward confronts him by pushing Bella. Bella scratches her arms and more bleeding tempts a few other Cullens as well.<br/><br/>Fearing that the Cullens themselves will end Bella's life, Edward decides to part ways with Bella asking for a promise that she won't do anything reckless and assuring that, that would be the last time she'll ever see him. All the Cullens disappear from Forks and Bella struggles without any contact to any of the Cullens. Jacob Black(Taylor Lautner) comes to the big picture as Bella's best friend through her difficult times without Edward. <br/><br/>Bella decides to break the promise she made to Cullen and goes reckless believing that Edward will return to be with her again. Meanwhile Victoria, the vampiress stalks the Forks county planning to make Edward suffer without his mate as a revenge and Jacob gets in to a stage called Mono(A Transition phase in their tribe in which a man gets the power to morph in to a wolf) and begins to follow a guy named Sam Ulley, who is the leader of the group of Guys in Jacob's tribe who went through their mono.<br/><br/>The mission of Sam's gang is to capture the vampiress who is stalking Forks and killing people. Meanwhile Bella jumps off a cliff(as a reckless act)in to a sea where the Sam's boys perform cliff jumping and Alice sees it in her vision and tells Edward that Bella jumped off a cliff. Alice comes to visit Bella's place but Edward stays where he is, not willing to break his own promise. Jacob saves Bella from the sea and they head home only to see a surprised Alice. Edward calls at that time and Jacob misinterprets the situation on purpose, Edward decides to end his life thinking Bella is dead.<br/><br/>Alice tells Bella at that time that Edward has decided to die in the hands of Volturi clan(Royal Vampire Clan who'll kill other vampires if they're exposed to public). Bella immediately travels to Italy where Volturi clan resides to save Edward. An obvious little battle between Volturi and the Cullens(Alice and Edward) before Alice stops the Volturi from turning Bella promising that she herself has seen in the future that she'll turn Bella in to one of them. Volturi clan's head Aro gets convinced and sends back the Cullens and Bella.<br/><br/>So Edward and Bella, get back together again much to the envy of Jacob Black. The struggle for Jacob Black in choosing between Bella's Love and their tribe's honor is portrayed decently but acting is still immature. Some characters like Emily(Sam's fiancÃ©e) and the creepy Jane(Dakota Fanning) supports the flow well. I pretty much liked this one over the first one and can't wait till I see the next one, ""The Twilight Saga""-""Eclipse"". This is a good follow-up to Twilight, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>My Verdict- The Twilight Saga-New Moon 7/10"
"Dsalvatore","10","0","6","28 October 2010"," A True Fan
","A true fan will forgive the movie's creative liberty from the book and just enjoy the inner worlds and connections of the characters. For instance, does anyone take into consideration how hard it must be for Jacob to feel like an outcast. He knows that Bella will never choose him over Edward, no matter what he does. AND SHE LOVES HIM. But the triangle neither tears them apart nor brings them completely together. Now that is utter TORTURE. And Edward can just leave Bella and she forgives him regardless of his excuse? It's so unfair to Jacob who shows her true and undying love.<br/><br/>A true fan also takes sides. A true fan must have an opinion and cannot favor both Jacob and Edward. The feud is too strong. The line has been drawn."

","I loved the first film of the Twilight saga, but this film for me takes it to a new level.<br/><br/>Taylor Launtner outshines his-self in this film. As a young actor, he is very talented and truly gave his all in this film - physically and mentally.<br/><br/>The story thus far is about a complicated relationship between human Bella (Stewart) and vampire Edward (Pattinson). This time Edward decides that to protect Bella, he must sacrifice his love for her and leave - ""as if he never existed"".<br/><br/>Bella then forms a strong relationship with pal Jacob (Launtner), which also gets complicated by the revelation of Jacobs undying love for Bella and that he is in fact a werewolf. Bella seems to move on thanks to Jacob but also puts herself in dangerous situations so she can see the illusions of Edward protecting her.<br/><br/>While all this is going on, Bella is in constant danger yet again by being the stalk victim of Victoria, who is after revenge on Bella and the Cullens over the death of her mate, James.<br/><br/>The film then starts to kick off with the cliff-diving episode, which see Bella arguing with her illusion of Edward. This then triggers Bella's best-vampire friend Alice (Greene) to come back to Forks.<br/><br/>Words gets to Edward that Bella jumped off a cliff (and assumes she has died), causing him to go to the Voluri to ask for death. There is only one person to save him... his beloved human Bella.<br/><br/>The Volturi ends up knowing the existence of human Bella knowing of their world and gives an ultimatum - change or die. Obviously Bella will be changed.<br/><br/>They leave a romantic cliff-hanger at the end, when Edward asks Bella to marry him.....<br/><br/>This is a romantic, emotional roller coaster film, with a few appearances from the werewolves/shape-shifters. Definitely one for the Twi-hard fans."

I don't think that was supposed to be the effect, but it did liven up the film a bit.<br/><br/>Even simple effects like Bella's hallucinations of Edward were pretty bad. It's like they didn't even try... just overlaying some stupid Photoshop effect directly onto the rest of the video, instead of blending it in.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on Edward's fight with the Volturi.

"angel-l-moore","10","0","5","27 July 2010"," A soulless journey to damnation
","""Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you and I don't have anything to be afraid of"" <br/><br/>New Moon captures a thematic essence to protect Bella's soul. The question of the film asks if Bella's soul should be protected. Edward's goal was to prevent her from eternal damnation. Bella's desire to become immortal overcame her concern for her soul. Bella wants to be immortal regardless of the cost. She wants to be anything other than what she is. For example, in the film titled ""Twilight"", Bella makes the statement that ""Death is peaceful, easy, life is harder"". Edward Cullen is afraid that his soul will be exposed to eternal damnation defined by the dangerous predator he is. He does not want to be responsible for the eternal damnation of Bella's soul. Although, Bella sets forth the belief that the Cullen family could never be doomed to eternal damnation.<br/><br/>The film directs the focus of undying love. It is the kind of love that consumes every breath. Their souls become one. It represents a complicated love story fueled by the idea that nothing can hurt Edward Cullen except Bella. This is the kind of love that you cannot live without. They had a connection beyond what words could describe. A relationship not meant to works fits perfectly like a puzzle. Two worlds apart yet one connected soul will leave you wanting to see more. A love created to transcend the impossible. The undefined nightmares keep haunting Bella due to the absence of Edward. Bella's cry of pain to remind her that he is real. The affection of yet another boy toward Bella's character erupts. A boy and a were-wolf expressed his love for Bella. An ongoing love triangle represented by Jacob, Bella and the one that owned her heart, Edward Cullen.<br/><br/>An intriguing setting located in Forks lingers on captivating special effects. There are enormous were-wolves to add to the mystery. Lighting in the film expressed a dim somber mood. The director used low-key lighting to capture the mystery in the film. The director also used a motif to create a continuous vision of Edward to warn Bella to not be reckless. The motif showed a mirage of Edward that wasn't real. The vision was repeated in the film.<br/><br/>I could not look away, afraid I would miss an important detail. The film took me by surprise. I thought it would only appeal to a teen audience. One of the best films of 2009 and a storyline that made me understand what all the hype was all about. An intense theme any adult or teen must see."

","I like this fantasy romance movie. I did not read any of the Twilight books but I like this movie just on its own. I like the bright flowerbed scenes, the colorful beautiful sets, costumes, nice hair(or wig) and makeup, CGI scenes, angle of the shots, good soundtrack. The actors are good-looking too. And Taylor's real buff.<br/><br/>They say villains are hard to play and I think the villain character Aro(played by Michael Sheen) of the Volturi had a very breath-catching and commanding performance.<br/><br/>There's a lot of emotions in the script and that takes a lot of sensual acting. Non-actors just take these for granted and don't understand the real work that goes behind making things look good and real.<br/><br/>Also, I made a music video of the movie that shows the sensual emotional moments of the movie. Check it out! If you like my music video then you should watch the movie too! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfraMoBow4c"
"kerryldilks","9","0","6","13 July 2010"," Definitely not the book...but good anyway.
","As a reader of the books, New Moon was fantastic. Until...my husband saw it and started asking why I thought Jacob was such a bad guy. Then I knew that, although the all of the pivotal events were there (and visualized very well), the sentiment I felt from the books was lacking. ""Non-readers"" will definitely get a different feel for Jacob's character than those who have read the books. I guess this explains all of the insane ""Team Jacob"" hysteria.<br/><br/>I've read some criticism for Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Bella and the fact that she switches from ""vacant stare"" to ""frowning stare"" and ""What does Edward possibly see in this girl?"" Well, that's pretty much how it goes in the book too. Bella's an idiot teenager, so Kristen's doing' a pretty good job so far.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that Jacob's whine-bag, neediness has totally escaped the screen version of this saga I very much enjoyed it and definitely recommend it."
"zardoz-13","10","0","7","8 July 2010"," The Sequel Without Fangs Still Sucks You Into Its Fantasy
","The suspenseful ""Twilight"" sequel ""New Moon"" picks up where the original film concluded with Bella still begging Edward to change her into a vampire. Like any worthwhile sequel, ""New Moon"" develops the complications that our hero and heroine face and provides deeper insight not available within the narrative confines of ""Twilight."" Poor sequels replicate originals as if to prove that their predecessors weren't flukes. Good sequels broaden their narrative base, depict characters in more facets, and ultimately surpass the original in overall concept. ""New Moon"" succeeds splendidly in all respects. The werewolf transformations that occur in the second half-hour bolster the supernatural elements because an individual shape-shifts into a gigantic wolf as they leap into the air. What the werewolves lack in urbanity compared with the vampires, they make up for with their larger-than-life size and ferocity. Of course, nothing in ""New Moon"" should induce nightmares and paranoia in the real world because the filmmakers keep everything PG-13 mellow. You never get a glimpse of vampire fangs. Furthermore, the werewolves are more majestic than terrifying. ""The Golden Compass"" director Chris Weitz and ""Step Up"" scenarist Melissa Rosenberg introduce the equivalent of the vampire Supreme Court in this installment. According to protagonist Edward Cullen, the Volturi lay down the law for vampires. Chiefly, a vampire may face death at the hands of the Volturi for failing to keep their existence a secret. ""We don't make spectacles of ourselves,"" Edward explains to Bella, ""and we don't kill conspicuously."" Like most sequels, characters that appeared in the first one bite the dust in this one. You'll find out soon enough who goes bye bye.<br/><br/>""New Moon"" dwells on the themes of death, old age, and suicide. Bella is desperate to become a vampire, but Edward resists her pleas to change her. The greatest character growth in the franchise occurs when Jacob (Taylor Lautner) changes from a harmless kid to Mr. Hunk. While ""Twilight"" concerned an interspecies romance between a female human and a male vampire, ""New Moon"" takes the relationship to a different place. The hero and heroine lose each other in a sense, but Bella is inconsolable with grief when Edward abandons her for her own good. Consequently, she behaves recklessly until she learns the truth about Edward. Vampire movie buffs may turn their collective noses up in contempt for this soft vampire epic. Again, the vampires never bare their fangs and they don't sleep in coffins. Indeed, ""Twilight"" author Stephenie Meyer follows the Bela Lugosi vampire formula. All the vampires look young, sexy, and craving to crunch neck. They aren't worried about anybody remotely resembling Van Helsing. Moreover, ""New Moon"" is basically a status quo values movie. As much as Bella yearns to be changed, most of the characters--especially the vampires--don't think that she should. In other respects, ""New Moon"" is entirely predictable in terms of romantic melodrama. Young love flourished in the first one, but it came with a price. Young love curdles in the sequel. Think of ""Twilight"" as gal gets guy and guy gets gal. ""New Moon"" strains the relationship and it's gal loses guy and guy loses gal."
"googizmol","Null","0","5","7 July 2010"," Too good to be missed
","As the summary states I feel this movie is too good to be missed.<br/><br/>2 years ago my younger brother recommended Twilight to me. I've always liked Vampire ""stories"" since my teens so I decided to watch it. At the time I was clearly not intrigued about the movie but decided to at least give it a shot. I watched it for about 30 minutes and felt there was something missing. Although the movie had a gripping and haunting feeling I have to attribute my lack of interest due to something else.<br/><br/>2 years later (2010) something kept nagging me. My brother who I know for a fact is not a vampire buff or has any inclinations towards the genre (I might be mistaken) actually thought the movie was something special. So I decided to watch it again. Oh my god.<br/><br/>I could go on about things in the movie that touched me, which was everything. From the location to the actors, the director and obviously the writer of the books. But I won't. All I can say is this; if you are remotely inclined to the vampire genre watch this movie. It's a movie for, dare I say it, everyone.<br/><br/>There is obviously a love plot but there are so many other plots going on. What really gripped me and I'm a 34 year old male, was the love story between 2 guys and a gal. Torn love. Hell this movie pulled me back to my adolescence. Before you jump to any assumptions remember this. This is a movie about vampires. Or is it really."
"kedryd","9","0","5","30 June 2010"," This is just my humble opinion...
","I like the movie, many people like the movie... sure, most of the people who likes this movie and the first one are fans of the books I haven't read all of the books, but I still like the movies, it doesn't have the best acting ever, but you have to understand that this is not meant to be an academy award winner And what about the 4 and a half stars? I'm guessing that most of the people who gave a low rating to this movie are fans of Bela Lugosi or of those classic vampire movies, or people who thinks that vampires should wear a black coat, with long nails and big and sharp teeth, if so, this movie isn't for you but that doesn't mean you can criticize the people who likes this kind of stuff. Anyways, back to the movie... I think this one is way better than ""Twilight"", Chris Weitz's style fits so much better to the story than Catherine Hardwicke's, the special effects are good, not to fancy, not to fake, but good, and the story, many fans complaints that certain parts are not like the book and stuff like that... THIS IS NOT THE BOOK, THIS IS A MOVIE, like I said, I haven't read all of the books, just the first one and half of the second, and for what I've read, the movie is pretty faithful to the book, you have to understand that they have to change the story a little bit, it would be boring if we see in the movie what we already imagined while reading the book, there has to be something new. So, if you have an open mind, give it a shot, you'll probably like it, if you don't, stay away, this is not for you"
"gchild94","8","0","5","30 June 2010"," Really enjoyed New Moon
","First of all let me just say that I'm not tween girl who fancies Robert Pattinson or the guy who plays Jacob. I've not read any of the books but I have had the books summarised to me by my girlfriend who really likes the Twilight saga. I was looking forward to seeing the werewolves in this movie and they don't disappoint in the slightest. I love the whole pack mentality and for me Jacob is the star character in the movie. As for him getting his top off and showing off his body well it doesn't do anything for me personally but I can understand why it appeals to the ladies. And for all the haters (and there seem to be a lot of you) the werewolves seem to spend most of their time in the books wearing hardly anything at all so it's not just a ploy to get young girls into the cinema. If you've not been pre programmed to hate this movie before seeing it or any of the Twilight movies then don't be put off by it's extremely low rating. After all, who wouldn't want to turn into a huge werewolf at will...I know I would."

"pk_pulak_kmr","8","0","5","20 June 2010"," Faithful and likable, despite a flawed treatment
","The Twilight Saga- New Moon is the second installment in the Twilight film series. Though I was initially a little put off when the film began, it soon became quite an interesting adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's novel. Let me start with my biggest complaint about the film- it's treatment of the novel. The mood is too dark and sober. While it works when it's supposed to, it often ends up sapping the humor out of the script. The first few minutes, as a result, are rather dull and sluggish.<br/><br/>Then, Edward leaves Bella, and she collapses onto depression. The atmosphere around the film finally begins to make sense. Bella's mood is documented via her letters to Alice, which are also an important plot device in the middle stages of the film. The film really takes off when Bella starts having hallucinations of Edward whenever she does something reckless or stupid. Because of this, she brings some defunct bikes to her friend Jacob Black for repair. It's there that they begin to form a bond that really helps Bella in dealing with her separation from Edward. Sure enough, her plan works, and Edward's hallucinations keep berating Bella even as she takes lessons in bike riding. However, Jacob soon disappears, and when Bella sees him again, he tells her to stay away from him. Soon, we find out that he's become a werewolf, and is part of the wolf-pack which protects the town of Forks from- you guessed it- vampires. <br/><br/>The film scores mainly due to it's decent presentation of Bella and Jacob's romance. By contrast,Kristen and Robert lack the chemistry they shared in Twilight, although there is some of it towards the end. Another high point is the special effects and action scenes, which are a marked improvement over Twilight. Bella's and Charlie's relationship is portrayed just as well as it was in the first film, and the meeting with the Volturi gives the film an opportunity to show off some beautiful set-pieces, as well as a cool fighting sequence between Edward, Felix, and Demitri (which wasn't there in the book). <br/><br/>Overall, though the film has flaws in treatment of the plot, as well as some minor plot inconsistencies, it makes for an entertaining watch for fans of the franchise. Be sure to buy the DVD,if you know what The Twilight Saga is all about."

"gradyharp","5","0","3","22 March 2010"," The Saga Pokes Along
","For lovers of THE TWILIGHT SERIES the second installment NEW MOON should satisfy. It apparently follows the Stephenie Meyer novel fairly well and certainly has more to look at than the first installment. For lovers of teeny bopper films, vampire and werewolf legends, and sappy highsschool romance this installment will provide many pleasures. For the rest of us it is passable entertainment.<br/><br/>Chris Weitz succeeds in making the impossible story lines move seamlessly, and while the majority of Melissa Rosenberg's script sounds like highschool lunchtime chatter, the story of Bella (Kristin Stewart) falling in love with Edward the vampire (Robert Pattinson)only to be deserted and then protected by the apparently normal American Indian Jacob (the very buff and studly Taylor Lautner) who turns out to be a werewolf....it goes on and on until there is finally a confrontation between vampires and vampires and vampires and werewolves that provides a semblance of an ending. Part three is coming soon.<br/><br/>The scenery in Washington State is nice and the musical score is pretty. The acting is bland as is the chemistry between Bella and Edward and Bella and Jacob. But then this film is not meant to be challenging - just entertaining. And it is.<br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"bob-rutzel-1","5","0","2","21 March 2010"," It was okay
","I now know why Vampires live forever. Movie Producers won't let them die. <br/><br/>When we last saw Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson) they were in love and Bella knows all. So really there was no need for a sequel, but now Edward tells Bella they cannot be together. Bella is crushed. And, a new wrinkle has emerged and his name is Jacob (Lautner), and he is in love with Bella and he has a secret too. Secrets abound and Bella is caught in the crossfire. Sounds like one of your soaps, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Return with us now to those chilling days of Vampireville, where Vampires rule again. <br/><br/>The first half of this movie was very slow, disappointing and the acting suffered as did we all. Someone needed to put some life into the main characters, and wake them up and tell them a movie is being made. Yes, the situation was serious but hey <br/><br/>There were many, many scenes that contained too much silence, and hesitations as perhaps there wasn't enough dialogue to cover things. Dragging out these scenes had us looking around to see what was playing next door, and many of those scenes had no music to help things along. The Director did pass Movie Making 101, didn't he? Maybe he didn't see Heaven's Gate with those ever slow drawn out scenes. <br/><br/>The second half had more life, with some pretty good fight scenes and CGI as well. The movie saves itself. This was okay, but hopefully, the next segment to this series will be as good as the first Twilight movie was. Let's hope. And, let's hope Ms Stewart can conjure up more than one facial expression.<br/><br/>The very last scene indicated to us there will be another sequel. We may have to chose up sides: Team Edward or Team Jacob. Can't wait. This was okay, but we want better than okay. Okay?<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"AngieeeBabayy","8","0","6","20 March 2010"," This movie was actually very good
","This movie is romantic, tragic, and really a Romeo & Juliet-esquire type movie. It begins again with Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson)- madly in love and when he leaves her abruptly after a rough birthday incident, Bella finds herself falling into a deep depression of which Jacob (Taylor Lautner) helps her grow out of. Kristens acting is a little wooden, but it doesn't affect the movie at all. You can really feel the pain from the different characters as they progress through the story. Edwards, Bellas, Jacobs, and even Victorias pain make this story so tragic and really give off a sentimental vibe. When I finished this movie, I was left wondering what would happen next and how the characters would bind together. That's what a movie should do, and it in fact did.<br/><br/>I think some people are judging this movie too harshly. I think we all know this is adored by most females and extreme twihards, but I think that people who don't love the saga are only judging this movie based on that distinction alone- and that isn't right. You really have to see this movie yourself to see how much you'll like it. When you judge this movie you cannot judge this based on who loves this movie or how it is marketed and you will realize the true art of the movie soon enough. No, it's not a Oscar worthy movie, but it really is worth watching because of the storyline and characters."
"rdnekwomn73120","8","0","6","20 March 2010"," It's not a bad movie people!!
","I know that this series was geared towards a younger crowd. I am 36 and I guess a kid at heart. I have read all of the books a few times and when I watched Twilight I could see that there were some issues with the acting...Bella's blinking situation for one....but the story line isn't bad. I love to be able to put myself into my own mind which is what using your imagination is all about and these books do that for me. I just finished watching New Moon for the first time and I thought it was great!!! I read what some people have said about Kristen ruining it because of the bad acting but I don't think she did that bad. She does show more emotion in this one and I think that she is still learning about acting. As far as the movie missing so much from the book...well, it would have to because if not it would just be an extremely LONG movie. The parts that are missing aren't huge key parts of the book. I paid close attention with no distractions and I couldn't see why so many people hated this movie..I think you have to have an open mind when going into a fantasy movie, and if you don't then I am afraid that you are going to miss out with this movie!!! that is just my opinion and i hope that i didn't offend anyone."
"blackberrybabe","9","0","6","16 March 2010"," Awesome continuation of the unforgettable love story
","New Moon is the second installment in Stephenie Meyer's blockbuster franchise. Like the first film, it does not disappoint. I was so excited to see this movie; this was the first of the Twilight films that I was able to see in the theater after becoming a fan. Like many, I was at the midnight showing.<br/><br/>This movie is closer to the book than its predecessor; although I did not have a problem with Twilight. In this one, Edward breaks up with Bella to protect her from himself and others like him after she cuts herself at a birthday party and Jasper lunges for her. The Cullens leave Forks and leave her absolutely devastated. After months of numbness, Bella begins to find comfort in her best friend, Jacob Black. She finds out that he is a werewolf when Victoria (a rogue vampire we meet in Twilight) comes to kill her. The Cullens killed Victoria's lover, James, at the end of the first movie and she wants revenge. She is able to out-maneuver Jacob and the other wolves and almost gets her hands on Bella. Meanwhile, Bella has visions of Edward when she does reckless things. One day, she goes cliff diving which sets off a chain of events in order to save Edward's life. At the end of the movie, the Cullens have returned to Forks, Victoria is still on the loose, Jacob is in love with Bella and Edward promises to never leave her again.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner are perfect in these roles. Although I am Team Edward, I was glad to see Taylor have more screen time as he is denied this in the first one. There is plenty of sexual tension and chemistry between these two and we get to see Lautner with his shirt off several times during the film. That being said, I hated the almost-kiss between Bella and Jacob. Thank God for Edward interfering!<br/><br/>Robert Pattinson does not get much screen time as Edward leaves Bella, but when he is on screen, he keeps your attention. All I did was stare at him. He also removes his shirt towards the end of the film to the delight of many. He is absolutely perfect as the tortured vampire who doesn't want to leave Bella but does because he thinks it's best for her. He is gorgeous, like Edward is written, and articulate. The chemistry between him and Stewart remains and is even kicked up a notch with several passionate kisses throughout the film. Edward tells Bella that he lied to protect her and he will always love her. The movie ends with him proposing marriage.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also great, especially Ashley Greene as Alice. There is not a single person out of place. We are introduced to the wolf pack in this one and will see more of them in the next two films. The cinematography, like Twilight, is breathtaking. The wolves are CGI and completely believable. Music chosen for this installment fits perfectly, especially Possibility by Lykke Li and Monsters by Hurricane Bells. The costumes are modern and classy; the dress that Bella wears in the birthday scene is my favorite piece, followed by the green blouse when she is in Italy. Replicas of these costumes are available for purchase and both are currently hanging in my closet.<br/><br/>The next chapter in the Twilight Saga does not disappoint; at least it didn't for me. It is an awesome continuation of the story and leaves you hanging for Eclipse. Make sure you see it."
"Award_968","8","0","6","15 March 2010"," For the Fans
","There have been many bad reviews regarding this movie, and though I see the point of the reviewers, I disagree heartily. Being a fan of the book series, I found the Twilight Saga: New Moon to be enjoyable, true to the book, and a vast improvement to the first film.<br/><br/>First of all, we must acknowledge the good decision made by Summit to get rid of the director of Twilight, Catherine Hardwicke. In my opinion, by inflicting her own tone and mood onto Twilight, she drained the film of its natural feel. Chris Weitz, who directed New Moon, didn't take anything away from it, he simply added the magic of the book to the sequel that the first movie lacked.<br/><br/>Also, I would like to point out to the ""haters"" who have been posting their reviews on this page, that this movie was not made to win awards, or be considered one of ""the greats"". Of course, it would be nice if it made a lot of money, or won an Oscar or something, but that's not going to happen, because that's not why it was made. It was made for the fans of the books, end of story. So stop picking it apart!!!! As long as the fans are happy with it, it shouldn't matter wheher or not it's considered an incredible movie. And you're not impressing anyone by posting things such as ""This movie is filth."" Or, ""It comes nowhere near films such as Titanic or Gone With the Wind"". It's not meant to. As for the acting, though it's not award-winning, it is decent enough. <br/><br/>Altogether, I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable, and well directed. Also, in response to one of the other reviews that were posted on this page, it was by far much better than anything having to do with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which I consider to be filth. But maybe that's just my opinion."

","Well basically, I read the book just before watching the film, I only read half the book and then was very anxious to see the film, and I loved every moment of it. Edward leaving Bella, then her relationship with Jacob, and then Edward's return. Every moment I was intrigued, and listening carefully. Most of the book never made it to the screen, and I have read a couple of reviews saying there was no love between Bella and Edward, and I have news fir all of you, THAT'S BECAUSE HE LEFT HER IN A WRECK AND SHE GOT UPSET AND HE CAME BACK THINKING SHE WAS DEAD! They weren't going to be holding hands and laughing around the entire time were they? Lastly, the acting: In rankings of who acted the best in the film, my rating goes as follows: 1.Robert Pattinson, 2. Ashley Greene, 3. Kristen Stewart, 4. Michael Sheen, 5. Taylor Lautner.

"kjeksk","6","0","2","10 March 2010"," Too much book for a two hour movie
","First of all i have to say that i have very mixed feelings about this movie. I have read all the books, and from a fan point of view that have already read the books this movie makes it out better than from a point of view where the watcher have not read the book. This is in my opinion not exactly a good way to make movies. You shouldn't have to read a book to get the movie.<br/><br/>The thing that i feel is really holding this movie back is that the director should either have kept to the reader fans and made it truly for them, or truly for those who haven't read it. It seems a little like they tried to fulfill everyone's wishes, something i wouldn't say worked out as well as planed.<br/><br/>What they should've done was to cut out a few of the details that wouldn't have made a real difference to the main plot. There are some parts that i wouldn't've really understood if i hadent read the book, and in my opinion thats not something you put in the movie.<br/><br/>So my conclusion is that they failed at the prioritizing part. It does have some of the things i really liked about the first movie, but sadly not enough for me to give it any higher score than this.<br/><br/>Also, i cant decide if Kirsten is a brilliant actor or a really crappy one. I usually think the brilliant way, but at some points it makes me wonder.<br/><br/>6 out of 10! The biggest minus was the things that i wouldn't have understood if i hadent read the book, and it was a lot of those here."
"maryjoan-668-285186","8","0","6","22 February 2010"," Flawed but entertaining
","At the time I post this there are 754 reviews. I doubt anyone is actually going to read this, but after reading through the first dozen or so, I just had to voice my opinion.<br/><br/>I really think some people just don't understand the characters. Edward is supposed to be cold. Don't hate him because he's beautiful. He's supposed to look like a model posing. Bella is supposed to be quiet. Anyone who's been around a teenager knows there are two kinds - the ones who never stop talking and the ones who never say anything. Bella is the quiet brooding type, who takes everything very seriously, and is both young and inexperienced and mature and thoughtful at the same time. This was explained in Twilight, when she made the decision to let her mother go and when she decided to stay with Edward. Jacob is supposed to be warm and sunny and crude and exuberant. He is the typical teenage boy full of testosterone and the opposite of Edward's suave coolness. So let's drop the whole acting is wooden, no expression, just reading lines crap. The actors are well-cast and interpret the roles true to the intent of the book.<br/><br/>Having said that, what is wrong with the movie? The Cullen's are under-utilized and Edward is hardly in the movie, but that is the way the book was written. In fact the first half of the book is snooze-fest with Bella moping around miserable. The film did a good job at picking up this pace. I particularly liked the time passage sequence with Bella at the window.<br/><br/>I think the effect of the wolf-transition could have been more interesting. It was too quick and I'm seeing better in The Wolfman trailer. The diamond effect on Edward's skin was much improved from Twilight and there were no awkward running scenes in this sequel. I'm not sure there is a way to film someone running with someone else on their back without it looking awkward but at least I was spared the feeling of watching a circus act on a unicycle.<br/><br/>The editing was too choppy and left out a lot of important plot elements. If I hadn't read the books I would have been very confused. It started when they failed to show Bella finding the motorcycles in the trash with sign noting ""as is"". This is symbolic of Bella's state of mind and wouldn't have taken but a few seconds of screen time. It wasn't particularly clear that Harry Clearwater was having a heart attack, since he had just been knocked down by a werewolf. How about an ambulance, stretcher, hospital, something? Bella's cliff dive didn't show any exhilaration. They did a great job filming Sam's arc into the water earlier - why the rush job on this much more important scene? And they totally flubbed the phone call scene that starts off the confusion about Bella's ""death."" It isn't clear that Charlie is actually planning Harry's funeral nor do they include Jacob's confusion over the caller. In the book he thinks it's Dr. Cullen, not Edward. Instead it comes across as intentionally cruel as opposed to a cascade of mistakes. I would have liked to have seen Bella and Alice en flight to Italy as it would have added gravity to the sequence. They were in a race against time, but you feel little of that tension. And then lastly, the pivotal scene in the square when Edward is about to reveal himself sputtered out at the end. In the book he actually thought he died and went to heaven, and was surprised to be in heaven as he thought he had no soul. This is important to his character development and just didn't come across on screen.<br/><br/>So I think this movie could have been much better, but I blame the director & crew, not the actors. It was still entertaining with its flaws and everyone in my audience gasped at the final line."

","I enjoyed the new moon movie however the romance between Bella and Edward were short lived, I mean I was expecting more love and feeling between the two especially in the bedroom scene toward the end, Edward did follow some of the story line but too much was missing, I understand the director had to form the relationship between Jacob and Bella but the real love should have been shown between Edward and Bella, It was way to short in feelings. I would have cut out some of the other parts, or added important scenes even if it meant a 3 hour movie. I just missed the romance, the feeling in my stomach when they first kissed in twilight, the way he came back to here ion the original twilight movie in the bedroom when she gave too much in her kiss to him, I miss that feeling in New Moon."

","I am such a huge fan of the series and Chris Weitz did a great job directing New Moon. It was FAR better than Twilight. The acting was still horrible but it was entertaining to see Jacob and Edward shirtless...just kidding, but not really. Anyways, I loved watching Dakota (PHENOMINAL ACTRESS AND SO YOUNG!!!!!) but she was the only good one. Jasper still looks so stale. The acting is maybe slightly above a soap opera, but it could go either way. I REALLY REALLY think they need to split Breaking Dawn into two movies, it 's too long. Sorry, my review is all over the place but mostly, the acting is HORRIBLE, and it's just a bad adaptation from the books. But I still love them. IT's MY GUILTY PLEASURE!!!!!!!"

","New Moon is a love and a fantasy story. When I saw the movie for the first time I could not stop watching it. I think I saw the movie five times in one week. It is so many feelings in the movie so when it happens something in the movie it feels like it happens to you to. The actress are so good! Whitout Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson it had not been the same movie because they make you think that all this fantasy in the movie actually exist and they are playing the parts so good. When you have seen New Moon the only thing that you want is that everything in the movie should be true and that Kristen and Robert should be a couple outside the movie to. It happens things in the movie that you did not think would happen so it makes the movie exciting. I think that I like the movie so much because Bella and Edward are not supposed to love each other in the movie because he is a vampire and can injure her. I just love it!"
"oliviu2009","7","0","8","23 January 2010"," Not bad for a 2009 movie... if you don't take the message seriously
","Regarding the fact that most of the movies made lately are absolutely unwatchable, this is not so bad. It is surely much better than Twilight, and this is due to Jacob Black. There are still bad, bad things in it. First, Bella is awful as always, with her obsession to become a vampire (who the hell would want such a stupid existence?!... Good God, I just can't understand the fascination for become a vampire, though I surely understand the fascination for the phenomenon itself... what the hell are you thinking, guys?... or are you thinking at all?...). There is no respect for the werewolf or vampire lore whatsoever. Edward is quite bad. And the big tomcats (I saw that in the movie were called werewolves, but I'm sure it's a mistake, they were clear giant tomcats, not a resemblance with a werewolf whatsoever... see The Wolfman if you are seeking for something real regarding this aspect)... they were purely laughable. But there are good things to. As I said, Jacob Black is a very well made character, and it is played excellent. Too bad he cut his hair, this made him appear younger and not so serious like until then. But he was still good. The Volturi were good either. Something like Interview with a vampire kind of vampires, which is not very good, but still is good comparing this to the Cullen family. And Jasper managed to be frightening. This is a good point too. I can recommend this movie, if you can ignore the Bella and Edward storyline, which appears to me also stupid and immoral. Because believe me, to be a vampire or with a vampire is NOT something a normal person will want. Not in the least."
"c-f-c","9","0","8","20 January 2010"," The sizzling chemistry continues into the sequel
","Twilight the series so far seems to have the same effect as Marmite. You either love it or you hate it. Absolutely its the type of movie that will draw ridicule from 'serious' film buffs who would instantaneously judge themselves 'above' this type of movie even before seeing it at the cinema (where of course it will always live up to their expectations of being awful) and alternatively draw plenty of fans who would love it based purely on the fact that you get to see hot fit male bodies of the perfect age to attract hormonal teenage girls.<br/><br/>I want to state at this point, I don't claim to be a serious movie buff (Though I do enjoy films regularly) and I'm also not a hormonal teenage girl!<br/><br/>Its also important for you to understand that a majority of reviews and judgements of this film are from people whose expectations of the film are massively prejudiced by reading the books. I haven't read the books and I don't intend to. I'm not here to judge the relevance of this movie compared to its book counterpart and I think its a major issue that many reviewers of this film are mentioning the book in reviews when this is a movie web site and the existence of a corresponding book should not have any impact of someones judgement of the film.<br/><br/>I also think many reviewers have been influenced by their experiences in the cinema at the time of viewing. Having to watch it with large groups of loud young girls is hardly the fault of the movie itself and cannot be included in the review. I've seen this film on a number of occasions all late night adult showings and at no point was there any issue with 'youngsters' in the audience.<br/><br/>This movie is a continuation of an ongoing love story. That's what these films are...Love stories. Acted with unbelievable chemistry these stories are of forbidden love, love unrequited and the difficulties of loving 'across' differing 'groups'. The main protagonists have a chemistry that I believe is unsurpassed in any modern day movie I've seen. The passion when they make eye contact is so intense and sensual and the pain they are experiencing with the difficulties of their situation is brilliantly expressed with their obviously conflicting emotions.<br/><br/>This sequel takes the films up a notch with the introduction of the 'opposing' clan and that heightens the tension whilst also introducing the character that must deal with their love being rejected and the pain and angst regarding that rejection.<br/><br/>To look at these movies as vampire action movies is folly, this is modern day Romeo and Juliet with a twist. Yes, the movies do appeal to youngsters but they also appeal to any adult capable of looking back at a time when their emotions were in flux and they responded to the way they 'felt' as opposed to doing what they know they 'should'....a time when they could look at someone and that look could be so intense, so deep, so lustful. Perhaps only the young are capable of that expression of emotion in which case these films certainly give you a route back to that youth.<br/><br/>I would seriously see both this and its predecessor with an open mind. Watch it in comfort at home when teenage girls wont prejudice you to think it immature. Watch it without expectation and enjoy the complexities of the relationships that most of us can only dream about."

Twilight the movie sucked, but it doesn't mean I didn't watch it 15 times and counting. New Moon was four billion times better than Twilight, at least Bella didn't babble like she did in the hospital scene in Twilight.

","The New Moon I am not one to usually watch these types of movies, but for some reason this one stood out to me. I didn't see the first one either. This movie was extremely good. I enjoyed myself very much watching this. For a movie that is based on a book, I think the authors and the writers of the movie did a good job with the movie.<br/><br/>Watching this movie kind of reminded me of a newer Romeo & Juliet. In the beginning of the movie, I wasn't very into it. It was to slow at some points. After the first 10-15 minutes it defiantly got better. Throughout the movie I could see the characters changing a lot. One of the main characters, (Taylor Lautner) Jacob Black, changed a lot. His look even changed also. In the beginning he went from having very long hair and kind of quiet and shy, then to having his hair very short and into a bad boy. Him having a crush on (Kristen Stewart) Bella Swan throughout the movie is good because she has to battle another for her love.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in present day. Even though the characters are different and not just human, the movie is normal. The characters where regular clothing and speak English. There are not really cheesy parts in the movie, some dull time but not cheesy. As long as you're into action and drama you should enjoy this movie a lot."

","I must first write that I am an avid vampire fan. Therefore, not so much a fan of the vampires depicted in the book or the movies. As this is a review of the movie, that's what I'll stick to. I will agree that there is much that is not discussed in the movie, and at times difficult to follow if you hadn't read the books. The acting is okay, with Belle having little to no depth. However, I will say that the quality of the movie itself is MUCH better than Twilight. If you complain about Belle's character, and how or why Edward could ever fall for her, then you are not familiar with the books. The story line is exactly the same as the book, so should not be critiqued in the movie - it followed suit exactly (although I DID keep asking myself why Edward fell for her in the book). Story line is much more fluid than the first, editing better, action scenes better. I enjoyed the movie, and will purchase the DVD. So, as an overall movie, it was good. As a story for a young girl to follow, terrible, finding no quality of life in the ""normal"" world sad, and unfortunately only finding yourself in a ""guy"" is a bad example of what girls today should be looking for. But again, this is no different than the book, so shouldn't be given a poor review for the storyline. All in all a 6 for the quality of the movie."

","Okay, first off, I will admit I have read the book. Like most books made into films, the books are usually better. I will not deny that this movie is also another one that was best left on print.<br/><br/>I have read many reviews made on this film, and most say it was just horrible. Some even said it was worse than Twilight. That's where I disagree. New Moon actually followed the book even more than Twilight. Honestly, the first movie seemed boring to me compared to New Moon. New Moon had action, CGI was okay, and it had actual laughable humor (which the first movie lacked). There is still however some things that could have been improved in New Moon; I cannot deny that.<br/><br/>There were some things that I did not like in this movie. Firstly, Bella's screams. When she screamed from nightmares, I thought it was overly done. It sounded like she was giving birth or something. Edward looked like he was going to cry when he was about to break up with Bella. In the book, he's suppose to be believable and seemed to really not want to be with Bella anymore. Jacob is to be more frightening, and the list goes on. I think the actors should actually look up into the book and see how the story went out. If they really want to be believable, appeal to the fans, and know how things are suppose to be acted out, they should do some homework.<br/><br/>I am not a crazy fan of the saga, but it is pretty good. People remember that this movie isn't going to be exactly how YOU imagined it upon reading the book. So expect to find cons. Overall, I think this movie was ALRIGHT, and it holds my attention to look forward to how Eclipse would turn out."

If you go into the movie looking for something mildly entertaining and not very thought provoking, you'll get that. Obviously it isn't Oscar-worthy, but what did you expect? The visual effects are fairly good and the story line is entertaining. Chris Weitz's portrayal helped view the series in a different way than how Twilight was delivered by Catherine Hardwicke. Most of the actors were surprisingly good, but with some poor parts. I gave it a 5 out of 10 because it's not horrible but obviously not the best thing ever."

","To begin with, I haven't read any of the Twilight books. That said, I really enjoyed the first movie. I can't really say the same for New Moon though.<br/><br/>The acting is ""wooden"", as many have said, it appears very clichÃ© in a way that gets boring very fast. Pattinson pulls off 2 or 3 different faces throughout the whole movie. The plot is decent, but the way it evolves is dull, and there's very few but good scenes of action. <br/><br/>I know this isn't a long review or something. It's more of a comment actually.

"jazzk-604-761096","9","0","4","9 December 2009"," Incredible movie and amazing in every sense of the word.
","OK I am going to say right now that many of the comments for this movie are absolutely incorrect. If you do not like it, or anything in this genre why the hell are you watching it. Honestly! Stephenie Meyer has sold so many millions of copies of this series because..wait for it....it's an incredibly popular series that literally has people in a frenzy. As for the actual movie New Moon, it has been taken to a whole new level, and absolutely blows Twilight to pieces. I honestly don't know where to start, OK, I suppose a huge part of the appeal of this movie is the characters...who range from absolutely gorgeous, downright sexy, and incredibly lovable. Before I go into this, im going to defend Kristen Stewarts character of Bella- I have seen so many comments about how annoying and depressed she is...but let me ask you something....have you ever lost the one person you loved more than anything else you have ever been able to comprehend, along with 6 beloved members of your soon to be family, and to top it all off, the life you had chosen. My guess is no. Leave your nasty comments to yourself, Bella has every right to be like that. Now on to the characters and storyline...<br/><br/>The relationship between Edward and Bella in this movie has literally been taken to a whole new level, you can see the desperation, and need for one another in every scene they share together. Perhaps the most hearbreaking thing you experience while watching this movie is seeing the absolute desperation and dangerously obsessional way the love one another build up, knowing whats going to happen.<br/><br/>Jacob's transformation in this film is absolutely incredible and I do not mean just physically. The connection between Bella and Jacob literally draws you in and at certain poins during the film you just want them to kiss so badly it almost kills you. Their relationship definitely develops a lot faster than in the books, and Jacobs love for Bella is absolutely obvious and more than just a little devestating.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Bella never never stops loving Edward, he is still in every thought and memory she has and this entire movie is about her trying to survive losing him, everything she does is an attempt to keep herself together.<br/><br/>New Moon is incredibly intense, both physically and emotionally. The characters are lovable, the wolf pack a welcome addition, and the volturi definitely captures the essence of what such a society would be like.<br/><br/>All in all, New Moon is an incredibly love story, that tells a tale of neverending love, devotion, and the unbelievable dangers that come with it. It'll stay with you forever."

I'm quite the action fan, and I enjoy the idea of Werewolves vs Vampires, (Underworld and it's sequels) I just found myself so bored throughout this film. As with the first. I loved the baseball scene in the first, and I LOVED the wolves, and the CGI used to create them. I thoroughly enjoyed each scene they were in and in my opinion, the film could have done with a lot more of them. The scenes where they chase Victoria out of town where fantastic. Also, I enjoyed the scene with the paper cut. Sadly, I had to sit through 2 hours of put on romance and blatant filming that is simply there to snap knicker elastic, (the first scene with Edward, and the carefully rehearsed scene when Bella bangs her head spring instantly to mind) just to get to the best bits.<br/><br/>I just don't it. I just don't buy Edward and Bella's relationship. I just don't buy Bella's and Jacob's relationship. I haven't read the books so I may be missing some important plot. But this film had no pace.

"mncs27","7","0","7","30 November 2009"," Fact: Twilight was better than New Moon
","I think we can basically state it as a fact that the movie Twilight was MUCH better than New Moon. However, I still think, as a huge Twilight fan, that the movie brings a very close visual of the actual book. There were many parts, such as Bella's relationship with Jacob, that should have been emphasized more. There was no true chemistry between any of the characters and the acting was much too awkward to bring out any true emotions. I personally had goose bumps throughout all of Twilight, but felt nothing during New Moon. The movie did not get to the key cores of the book rather just put a visual on the book.<br/><br/>New Moon is about the pain and suffering a person is left with when losing a loved one. It is about finding comfort and realizing what is truly important in life. Bella literally put her life into Edward and all of the Cullens, and was left with nothing. She had dreams of everlasting love with Edward, which is something every girl in love would only dream of having. Bella is left with a gaping hole in her heart and struggled to find any way to get a sense of happiness again, to a point where she puts herself at risk just to feel Edward's presence. She also finds comfort in Jacob, and their relationship expands and grows during Edward's absence. The misunderstanding between Edward, his sisters, and Jacob causes all the characters to take drastic measure in order to save Edwards life, thus bringing us to new events and a new story. <br/><br/>The real pain and the true emotions are not brought out in the movie, and i believe there were many points in the book were not shown correctly in the movie. I think all Twilight fans were expecting another breath-taking Twilight, but were disappointed. If it weren't for the disappointment, I think the movie was not all that bad. I am very much looking forward to the third movie Eclipse, but definitely no expectations."
"Jill1995","8","0","6","29 November 2009"," Great. Except the leading actress.
","First- I am a big fan of the books and I am 14 so I am a high school girl and we are apparently all supposed to love everything to do with twilight no matter what. However, New Moon was my least favorite book, but I have been excited for the movie since about January. In my opinion, the first movie was awful. It didn't follow the book very well and I think that if it wasn't based on a bestseller book, it would have been a flop. The second movie was an improvement. It followed the book much better. It included almost all of the things in the book.<br/><br/>I would have liked this movie more if Bella was played by a different actress. I don't think Kristen Stewart is very good at showing emotion. I first saw her in Speak. Kristen was great in that movie. But that character showed no emotion, that was who she was. In New Moon Bella shows a lot of emotion, even thought it is all depression. She just didn't show any kind of emotion. <br/><br/>The wolf pack in this movie was great. They acted very well together. (They were also very hot and shirtless a lot ;) ) I wish they had gotten more screen time. The humans (Mike, Jessica, Eric, and Angela) were also great. They had many funny parts throughout the movie. I think my favorite scene was when Bella, Jacob, and Mike go to the movie.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie, in Italy, there was more fighting than the book has. However, it all worked out and I liked how the director and script writer solved it.<br/><br/>The movie ended with a cliffhanger that, of course makes you want to go see Eclipse. This is how the book ends too, but there is a little more at the end of the book."

In a weird way I kind of liked it.<br/><br/>The plot has Edward leaving Bela who is than watched over by Jacob who's (possible spoiler here) a werewolf.<br/><br/>First off you kind of need the first film to set up Bela and Edward's relationship (maybe not since I never understood what she saw in Edward.) Here there is no build up just the two kids with crazy lust for each other with no explanation. It just is.<br/><br/>Next you have to understand that this is very over long soap opera that kind of looks like a soft core film where everyone keeps their clothes on (except the guys with six pack abs). Its pure teen angst drawn out to a silly degree. I was giggling through a chunk of this...its so silly... except if you're in its target audience in which case its note perfect.<br/><br/>Personally I think if there was shorter this would be better. The real problem here is not a heck of a lot happens. Its lots of angst and maybe romance with a couple of plot bits thrown in for later use. There's enough plot for half a film but twice the require running time. I may have liked it but I kept checking my watch and reaching for the remote (which wasn't there because I was in the movies).<br/><br/>I need to add a couple of things, first off some of the performances are wither wooden or so over the top as to be ridiculous. Michael Sheen should be ashamed. Secondly I need to ask why is Edward and the other male vampires considered sexy? I could understand it if they didn't have the make up on but they mostly looked under fed, pasty faced and silly.<br/><br/>That said this is better than the first one, I just wish I had seen this on TV where I could have zipped through the silly parts."

Yes they did a great job including the main parts of the story. But what about the little details in between? What feelings or emotions carried you to the next scene? Those are the signifigant details that get forgotten when doing a book to big screen.<br/><br/>The reason the New Moon book was so engrossing was because it included all the thoughts & raw feelings of all the characters...Kristen did a gr8 job with hers, that's because they included that. But after her depression passed, what about the rest of the emotions? I say next time if you're running shy on screen time, add in the feelings a person is experiencing with a narrative overview while you're progressing so rapidly from one scene to the next to fit it all in.<br/><br/>What connects us most to our love of the books? Don't leave that out in the movie..That's why Titanic, The Notebook, Gone with the Wind, were so amazing. We can connect.

","The movie was fine I think great effects, fine story, and talented people, what could go wrong well I'll tell you.<br/><br/>I don't really understand why they had to make this movie usually are secondary images made to unveil a new event, but this second part of Twilight left my with the same questions as the first one did and unveiled nothing except the fact that Jacob was a werewolf which I think people had realized in the first movie, it was at least no shock to me. <br/><br/>But I'll give it six out of ten it not a bad movie just not very revealing."
"shhiler","8","0","7","25 November 2009"," If you haven't read the books, very good movie
","I have read some of the comments on New Moon and I have to say the people that are saying that Edward and Bella were casted wrong are wrong. If you have read the books, you would know that they do a very good job at portraying their characters. I went into the movie knowing that it wasn't going to meet my expectations because what I see in my head when I read a book is never going to make it onto screen. I thought the graphics were amazing!!! The chemistry of Rob and Kirsten is evident on screen. Taylor was also a good choice for Jacob, even though I pictured him more cocky. I personally love the first Twilight movie and I personally love New Moon. I am an older reader also and can not get enough of the saga. I encourage anyone who has read the books to see this movie. Don't expect the most amazing movie you have ever seen, but it is surprisingly close to the book. Enjoy."
"derum-1","3","0","6","25 November 2009"," Only worth to watch for spec. fx.!
","I was watching this movies and all the time I was thinking - this is just some fantasy world! Do girls really like to imagine everything so much?<br/><br/>Bella's part played by Kristen Stewart in movie is too lazy. Didn't like acting performance. As about Edward character, played by Robert Pattinson, he ''acts'' even worse...You can see and hear, that he has not been to drama lessons, maybe few, cause the way he talks - 90% in the same tone. There are certain lines in movie that you have to express and say with feelings and passion! Otherways it's pointless, just ''Blaa, blaaa, blaaa, I Love you, Bella!''. He has taken his vampire ''mask'', put it on, and that's it - ''I'm gonna be i cool vampire guy with shiny lipstick on my lips and two expressions in my face''. <br/><br/>So..In my opinion - miserable movie with no guiding lights for your life. That's sad for all those girls who are getting inspired by this crap. They just have to live and love in real life and real situations and that's completely different story. Get out of that fantasy and fairytale world! 1+2 for well done fight scenes! At least nice special effects. Joy for eyes on that scenes."
"tamara-zenner","6","0","8","24 November 2009"," New Moon: A Fan's Perspective
","I have read the whole Twilight Saga, and consider myself a moderate fan. (I don't wear Team Edward/Team Jacob garb, but I truly enjoyed the story even though I'm almost thirty years old.) The ""Twilight"" movie left a lot to be desired -- namely poor acting from the female lead, Bella (Kristen Stewart) -- but because I enjoyed the second novel more than the first, I expected much more emotion and action in the ""New Moon"" film.<br/><br/>My expectations were too high.<br/><br/>In ""New Moon"", I feel several things were lacking. First, there weren't enough scenes with Jacob to accurately portray the friendship. In the novel, Bella spends lots of time with Jacob, telling him repeatedly that she only wants friendship... But the two become very close, and he continues to pine for her even though he knows where she stands. Because the scenes between the two of them were so limited, the movie portrays Bella as a misleading tramp who loves Jacob only until Edward comes back... If they had spent more time together in the movie as friends, the movie would have been more accurate in showing a deep friendship, rather than a rebound relationship.<br/><br/>I also feel there are far too few scenes with the werewolves. They are an integral part of ""New Moon"", but the movie seems to follow the bittersweet romance of Bella and Edward exclusively. There isn't enough tribute to the remaining cast, including the Volturi.<br/><br/>The filmography was well done, the soundtrack was fitting, and I enjoyed the movie overall. I just feel like the perspective was off. I'm hoping ""Eclipse"" makes up for the first two let-downs."

","to answer my title yes i did. i was very disappointed with twilight when it came out. o and yes i have read every twilight book more than once. the new moon movie of this saga was B+ A- worthy. it did not excite me because the pretty much showed the movie with the releasement of the numerous clips. i can say the movie was shot very well and the cgi was on its game but i have to say the acting was a bit off for me..some of it. the performance given by taylor lautner was very amateur( which i guess he is) like other have said it felt some what like a soap opera. i wish the casting director was a little more selective about who was what character but i can gladly say i cant wait for eclipse and robert pattison and kristen stewart and co. new movies to see how they perform"

","If you've read the books, of course you're going to be disappointed. But, the truth about New Moon is that it was decent. It wasn't amazing, and it was not horrible. I enjoyed it. I won't lie, i went into the theater thinking ""oh god, this movie is going to suck balls. i'm wasting my $9.50,"" but in reality, my money was almost worth it. Yes, the acting could have been better, and yes, they missed a lot of key elements from the books, but remember this is a franchise. They're creating what the people want to see, and tweaking the story a little bit to add excitement isn't a crime. You can only get an amazing book so good on the big screen. Overall, i think they did a decent job of adapting the book into the film. 8/10"

"dontpointyourfingeratme","5","0","3","21 November 2009"," not as bad as people say it is
","I went to New Moon thinking it would be horrible movie & planning to make fun of it the whole time, but in it actually wasn't that bad at all. <br/><br/>Compared to the last Twilight movie. I'd say this one was about 15x better. It doesn't have all those weird slow motion shots, pointless scenes, or half as many corny lines (so it's less funny than the previous one). Instead it has a more realistic semi-romance (between Bella & Jacob) and lots of camera shots that make you dizzy. <br/><br/>Basically I give it a 5/10 because the story. If you have a young daughter don't take her to see it. It'll give her self esteem issues and make her think all you need in life is a man to protect you. If only the story was better and less about a girl wanting to die and give up her life for a guy/vampire."
"NousPax-1","6","0","4","21 November 2009"," Twilight 2: Mooning the Fans.
","In in my 50's and am an escapist meaning I do not try to ""Break"" movies but am incredulous about this one. Since I liked the 1st one, had to see this too. Overall the effects were excellent, the plot generally good. OK, cutie Bella lives near some woods and she is a helluva monster attractor. Vampires were acceptable to me, but she also attracts werewolves? Are you efing shatting me? WTF? This is for 7 year olds! Her friend of many years Jacob, all of a sudden turns out to be a werewolf, but he was born that way? First movie and much of this shows him as normal then confuses the viewer with his Lycanthropy. ARE YOU SHATTING ME? I was in an audience with about average age of 20 overall and many ppl besides me were laughing at scenes that WERE NOT intended to be funny. One spoiler not given away here is the very last line of the movie which is funnier than hail! Really, when everyone else is laughing, then I'm less concerned about offending the others by laughing. Again cool FX, good plot though poorly executed and some unintended bonus chuckles."
"imran-13","5","0","3","21 November 2009"," Watch ONLY if you've read the book and have NOT seen trailers
","I watched this movie with my wife, who is a fan and have read the books. <br/><br/>Pace was slow, and fast. Romantic wannabe scenes were drawn too long, plot details were skipped too fast. Trailer had 'adrenaline'. Movie had none. <br/><br/>Most of the movie I wish I was somewhere else. Some jokes were funny but that's it. I knew Jacob is a ware wolf. Trailer gave away the only thing that I'd love. If I wanted to know, I would've read the book....<br/><br/>I kept asking my wife when we came home about unexplained plot details and she explained that <br/><br/>Vampires:<br/><br/><ul><li>Every vampire had certain powers, which they sorta did when they were human. Now as vampires they're 10 fold</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alice can see future, bits and pieces. She was considered a witch and tortured until she was made a vampire and those powers became 10 fold. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Edward could read minds except Bella's, which intrigued him</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jasper can lighten or sadden the mood of room. He was newest hence couldn't resist human blood as well as other Collins...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They chose frock because it's the wettest place in America and very less sun will keep them disguised. </li></ul><br/><br/>Werewolves: <br/><br/><ul><li>Mother nature balance, they're vampire killers. Kids of town having vampires start turning into ware-wolves after they hit puberty. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Vampires could NOT feel their presence (genetically or something, Ware wolves can fee vampire's) and hence Alice could NOT see them in her premonitions. That is why she saw Bella falling down, Victoria swimming towards her but couldn't see Jacob saving her.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jacob's father didn't become ware-wolf because there were no vampires when he hit his puberty. </li></ul><br/><br/>The ELDER Vampires (whatever their name was) wanted to kill Bella because even as a human, she's so powerful that vampires like Edward can't read her mind or cause her pain, imagine those powers 10 times with Bella as a vampire may not be too good for vampire clan, and may become obvious. That's why they were curious to see her and then were convinced to kill her. <br/><br/>After knowing all this, movie made some sense to me and I kinda like it. Else it was 1 / 10. That's why I recommend read a book or know book summary, THEN see this movie. I love portrayal of mythical creatures like harry potter / LOTR, even if it's for vampires. <br/><br/>Book to Movie Adaptation: It's no Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>What I do NOT understand, why they wanted to kill Edward? And how long a distance vampire / ware wolf can detect another vampire? Town? <br/><br/>From Twilight, why Jason, Vistoria's love, HAD to eat Bella and Bella only? Somewhat that protected food? <br/><br/>What I wanted to see was Victoria scaring us all by kidnapping Bella (who loves to walk alone in spooky forests), standing over her, a little beating, tasting her 'dessert' a bit as revenge, then Edward and Werewolves joining powers to rescue her. Or at least in Bella's window for a scare. Not stupid elders and boring love trio. <br/><br/>It is a chick flick, and lot of noisy chicks were in the theatre. It was fun to watch movie with hard core fans."
"sime47","6","0","3","21 November 2009"," Average movie
","This movie is nothing special and it could have been deeper but the reason why I gave 7/10 is because I enjoyed watching it in theater being one of the few male persons and laughing to funny female reactions when they see Jacob and Edward half naked or when something gets in way while two lovers are trying to kiss each other. Movie is also much better than ""Twilight"". Fans will be very pleased with this movie but the others won't be so excited but maybe they will find themselves in similar situation as mine and maybe enjoy it. The movie definitely does not deserve bad rating like 4.2! It's much more than that."
"nikki-barker","6","0","4","21 November 2009"," Slightly disappointed..but better than Twilight
","I first came across this series when Twilight came into theatres. I went to see the movie and loved it for the most part but the blue tint, poor CGI, and constant eye fluttering/corniness of Kristen Stewart's (Bella) acting drove me nuts.<br/><br/>After I saw the movie I read the books Twilight and New Moon. I was super excited for New Moon to come out last night. The weak areas of Twilight were improved for the most part. No more blue tint, better CGI and less eye fluttering from KStew.<br/><br/>Her acting is better in this movie, but I found that when she was supposed to come across as having a burning hole in her chest it came across more as a mild period cramp. She didn't portray the pain convincingly at all. The depression, spot on.<br/><br/>Rob Pattinson (Edward) overall was good, but there was some underlying nervousness/anxiety that I picked up from his acting in some of his scenes. I know there were spectators for some of the scenes so maybe that's where that came from.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner (Jacob) and the rest of the cast were perfect.<br/><br/>The added action scenes added a lot to the movie and some tweaks made more sense than the way the book did things but it really annoyed me how much they changed the ending from the book. It's one thing to tweak a little wolf scene, a whole other to mess with Edward/Bella's reunion sequence.<br/><br/>The dialogue was much better than the book. I was surprised at how many times I laughed at the little one liners they threw in there.<br/><br/>The new contacts or overly CGI enhanced contacts were extremely distracting and overpowering.<br/><br/>The scene that bugged me the most was when it showed Alice's flashback. I have no idea what anyone was thinking when they did this scene. Bella and Edward running around in the forest in clothes from the early 1900's? How is that is supposed to depict Bella as a vampire in the future? The slow motion of them running through the forest in those period clothes made everyone burst out laughing in the theatre because of how absurd and retarded it looked.<br/><br/>Overall I will buy the movie when it comes out but there were some obvious amateur mistakes that I wasn't expecting considering the fan base and expected revenue from this movie."
"pearl_4","7","0","13","20 November 2009"," Average nevertheless worth watching
","The major problem with this movie is that it's not bad but it's not brilliant either. Yet the fact that it falls into the average category doesn't fail to disappoint. Despite mostly the bad criticism the first movie had received I still enjoyed it immensely and being true to my promise I did actually read all four books after. With the second movie being so hyped up I did expect a step up (bear in mind that I loved the first film a lot). To be brutally honest the movie appeared too childish for my liking. The not-scary-at-all werewolves gave a Narnia feel to the film. I also wasn't impressed with Kristen Stewart's acting this time - throughout the first half of the movie she seemed merely upset, saddened by Edward's disappearance - which is MILES AWAY from the original text describing Bella feeling like a lone satellite spinning instinctively though her planet had disappeared. I think that was the core moment of the second book that was sadly missed. The story presentation appeared slightly adapted for a younger generation, to be precise (no offence in mind) for 13-16 year olds who are mainly after pretty faces, special effects and cheesy romance... Don't get me wrong it was dramatic enough in a High School way but not as intense and mystical as it should have been. The missing links left more questions than answers. The visions of Edward - they've never been explained; if it wasn't for the book I'd think that Bella was doing Lady GaGa. The first movie hints that there might be a friendship between Bella and Alice (though you can't rely on Alice's subjective vision of future) and then before you know without any warning Alice is becoming a key character pretty much from the start of the second movie. Yet the director manages to fit in the scene of Bella's dream with the mirror - in my books, it's a movie time poorly spent. Of course there are plenty of positives to the movie as well! For a start, the soundtracks! OMG they WERE brilliant and I'd even go as far as to say that they created most of the right atmosphere in the film. Dakota Fanning and Michael Sheen brought with them a good acting, I did especially like Dakota's part - she pulled off the evil character of Jane with an angelic face perfectly! The movie was actually beautifully made: 10 out 10 for fantastic scenes of Italy, Brazil and even Forks. I was impressed with them! I do feel sorry for Robert Pattison: his acting is not being noticed as should be. Being a part of the cast he gets the undeserved criticism for the failed expectations but he is actually good. Overall I would say that people who have never read the books have all the chances to enjoy this movie, yet those ones who appreciate the book story are more likely to be disappointed. It's still a movie worth watching but I can't help but feeling sad: I've never been embarrassed before to openly declare I adore the Twilight saga, with the this movie out I am not sure I feel the same way..."
"diliaoviedo","7","0","17","19 November 2009"," My review without spoilers
","I just think people need to go in with real expectations, this is not an Oscar worthy movie but it is entertaining none the less. is not like New Moon is the best movie ever made but as i said in my FIRST review it has improved in a big way when you compare it to Twilight. The acting really has improved A LOT especially with Kristen when you compare Twilight's Bella with New Moon Bella, is like she is reflecting in her portrayal how she has grown is like what we've seen lately in interviews a more self assured girl but still very nervous and shy and in her acting is the same, this time she does a better job at portraying the emotions especially the heartbreak this character is going through. Taylor really does a good job playing his character he really gets Jacob but as it also happens with Kristen there are scenes where he just doesn't quite achieve to capture the emotion of the situation and comes off stiff. Rob as i said he's not in the movie enough to make an informed decision as to whether or not he has really improved in his performance, but from the times you get to see him on screen there is improvement in his personification of Edward. The supporting cast does a great job i think but they are what they are, which is basically filler characters in the story. However it really shows in the new actors and in the supporting cast which of them are great actors on their own because even if they only show up for a couple of minutes in the film they steal the show. the perfect example for this is bot Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning who both played the character of Aro and Jane down to the T and do an incredible job in bringing to life this characters. and Anna Kendrick who in just seconds of being in screen steals the scene. Now visually this film is 100% better than Twilight, the photography was incredible which with me being a photography student is one of the biggest things that attract me to movies, Chris Weitz did a great job, the contrast,lighting and color palette and the sharpness of the images was done really well this looks and feels more like a high budget film. Some of the special effects could still be improved but overall they are really good. and in terms of the music i love the soundtrack of this movie. In general is a very entertaining movie and a perfect 2nd installment to this saga,but don't go into it thinking you're going to see the latest masterpiece in modern cinema cause you are not."
