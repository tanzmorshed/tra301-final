","Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. ""When you re-write a script it gets better and better"" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like ""Nick of Time"" ""The Astronaut's Wife"" and ""Secret Window"" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a ""safe"", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!"
"JawsOfJosh","10","285","327","25 February 2004"," Burton's grand masterpiece, too bad so few have noticed
","As one of the most overlooked films ever made, ""Ed Wood"" does for Tim Burton what ""Malcolm X"" did for Spike Lee and ""JFK"" did for Oliver Stone, it ruins any expectations one can have of Tim Burton, because he has set a standard here that he will never achieve again.  An interest in the period in which it is set is essential, given the set decoration is the film's greatest triumph.  It's not surprising that Burton's first ""biopic"" is about someone revered in the b-movie heyday of the 1950s - that spawned Burton himself. Burton must have felt he had to make this picture because without filmmakers like Ed Wood, Burton himself would have never existed. Set in seedy B-movie Hollywood in the mid 1950s - and wisely and beautifully shot in black-and-white, Johnny Depp plays the titular character; a young, talentless, but optimistic auteur who dreams of being a film director; going so far as to model himself after his idol, Orson Welles.  Despite an over-reliance on stock footage, a tin ear for dialogue, and a fondness for wacky, exploitative horror and sci-fi fare, Wood wiggles his way into B-moviedom.  Casting anyone willing to step before his camera, Wood cranks out a series of cheesy movies.<br/><br/>When he has a chance encounter with horror film legend Bela Lugosi, now a 74 year-old, foul-mouthed morphine addict wrecked by his lost fame, Ed sees his meal-ticket. Quick for his next fix, Lugosi doesn't seem to mind that Wood is also an out-and-proud transvestite with a particular fondness for Angora sweaters, and soon begins starring in Wood's features. Lugosi, played by Martin Landau, gives the story its biggest jolts of energy. Landau is hysterical in scene after scene utilizing the ""dirty old man"" routine. Remember, there is nothing funnier on earth than an old man who likes profanity.  A gentle - albeit somewhat fictionalized - bond forms between Wood and Lugosi.  Depp does a spectacular job of fleshing out Wood's quirky innocence and unbridled passion for moviemaking.  This may also be the only Johnny Depp film where you actually see him smile!<br/><br/>What ultimately makes this film so stellar is the impeccable production and costume design and the crisp B&W cinematography; it literally transports you back to the clean-cut, wide-eyed days of the 1950s.  I cannot recommend this film enough if you have an interest in the world of 1950s B-movies that produced titles like ""Teenagers From Outer Space"" and ""Project Moonbase"". This film functions quite well as a time warp.  I liken ""Ed Wood"" to epics like ""JFK"" because like those films, this movie doesn't seem to be about what happens as much as how it FEELS to be there; and that's what draws me to the film every time I see it.  With ""Ed Wood"", I'm not always interested in following the story, but I'm totally fascinated with being inside that world.  Tim Burton did the best job that anyone could in taking you there."
"axlgarland","10","121","137","24 August 2005"," Nice to meet you Mr. Wood
","It is a well known fact by now that Johnny Depp is a subtle, tender, beautiful force of nature. Tim Burton has been able to create universes that Johnny Depp can inhabit with the strange naturalness of someone who belongs. ""Ed Wood"" is the ultimate demonstration of that theory. You're introduced to the world of someone who appears almost a figment of someone's imagination to realise that there is something of him in you and me. What is incredible is that the realisation comes hand in hand with a personal discovery. That funny weird kid represents more than something but the best of you and me. Angora sweaters and childish dreams. The purity of an artist with a talent that is concentrated in his heart. Remember the Salieri of ""Amadeus"" torturing himself cursing God for giving him the gift of recognising the talent in others without having any of his own. Ed Wood, as told by Burton and Depp, is so far away from that pathology that to watch his films after having met him with Johnny's face is an entirely different experience. Everything makes sense. Strangely enough (or not) ""Ed Wood"" died at the box office but as it happens more often than not, ""Ed Wood"" is more alive today than many of the greatest moneymakers of all time. Yes, that business of time never fails. Greatness prevails."
"pkendell","Null","342","413","26 April 1999"," An Unlikely Masterpiece
","I hear that ED WOOD took just $6,000,000 on its initial cinematic release in the USA.  I'm not surprised.  The extraordinary thing is that the film was financed and released at all.  Had it not been for the prestige that Tim Burton had already earned from his previous projects, ED WOOD would no doubt have foundered long before the cameras began to roll.  The result could have been another 1941  but it wasn't.  What came out of Tim Burton's fascination with the `Worst Director of All Time' was something very rich and strange  perhaps the most un-Hollywood Hollywood picture of the 90s.<br/><br/>I see two main themes in ED WOOD.  The first is the dreadful fear that hovers over everyone who enters the creative arts  `Am I any good?'  `Is my work any good?'  `How do I know if it's any good?'  `What if I think it's good, but everybody else thinks it's rubbish?'  Artists use all kinds of strategies to deal with these fears  some become eccentric, others arrogant, others diffident.  Without the right to fail, no artist is likely to take the sort of risk that sometimes, just sometimes, leads to great work.  Tim Burton knew this.<br/><br/>Edward D Wood Jnr believed himself to be a creative artist.  Oh, how he believed.  But he still failed to create anything worthwhile.  And this leads to what I believe to be the second theme of the movie, and the reason why I think it failed commercially.<br/><br/>Look at all the things Ed did right.  He believed in himself.  He followed his dream.  He worked hard.  He was an entrepreneur  he did his best to make others believe in his dream and help him to turn it into reality.  In short, he did all the things that the self-help books, the daytime TV shows, the junk ballads and the feel-good movies tell us will give you success. Just wish upon a star, work all the hours there are to turn your vision into reality and you will succeed.  Ed did all of these things.  And still he failed.  He died short of his 60th birthday, living in a crime-riddled apartment building, drunk, broke, supporting himself and his loyal wife Kathy by writing formula pornography and making sex instruction flicks on 8mm.<br/><br/>America doesn't want to hear this.  Hollywood doesn't want to tell America this  that you can try and try and try and still get nothing but heartbreak.  This is why ED WOOD is such an un-Hollywood film  and why it's one of the best Hollywood films of the 90s."
"oshram-3","9","236","286","6 December 2004"," The one he'll be remembered for
","It's sort of embarrassing to admit it took me ten years to see this film. I'm not really a big fan of Tim Burton, and while I never had anything against him, I've only recently started to enjoy Johnny Depp's work. Given the subject matter, this just wasn't a movie I was interested in for a long time. But sometimes good things really are worth the wait.<br/><br/>Ed Wood, of course, chronicles the Hollywood career of its eponymous subject, truly one screwed up individual; a cross-dresser with a fetish for angora, Wood churned out one horrifically bad film after another, culminating with Plan Nine From Outer Space, before descending into crappy porn films toward the end of his life. It isn't necessarily a happy story, and Burton wisely only tells a small sliver of it, from Ed's first movie, Glen or Glenda, through the premiere of Plan Nine.<br/><br/>But the love that Burton has for Wood and his movies shines through in every frame. Though I find Burton needlessly artsy as a director, here that tendency serves him frightfully well, as he manages to do the near-impossible; make a film about someone that plays like one of their films (the abysmal Dragon is a shining example of how NOT to do this). Shot entirely in black and white, we see all of Wood's weirdos not as they were, but rather as Ed probably saw them, through the bizarre filter he must have viewed life with.<br/><br/>Depp is simply brilliant here, probably even better than he was in Pirates of the Caribbean. He captures Wood's enthusiasm and slanted viewpoint, but he does so in a loving, positive way. Wood accepts, as we must, that he was a screwed-up hack, but it never drags him down; in fact, Depp has him reveling in it, and it is that very passion that buoys up the movie. It doesn't hurt that nearly everyone else is very strong too, from Jeffrey Jones' crank 'psychic' Criswell to Bill Murray's Bunny Breckenridge, who often talks about having a sex change but never goes through with it. George 'The Animal' Steele captures Tor Johnson perfectly, and even Lisa Marie is excellent as Vampira. But the true great performance of the film, outshining even Depp, is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. He won the Oscar for this, and deservedly so; he presents Lugosi at the end of his life, a washed-up has been, a shell of a man who was once a great star but is now no more than an addict. Landau virtually disappears in the role, and all you get is Lugosi, every tragic inch of him. Again, we see him not only as he was, but how Wood and even Burton see him, and the effect is masterful. One speech in particular, where Lugosi repeats a speech that Wood wrote for him about once being the master of the world but now on the verge of coming back is particularly haunting, and Landau is simply riveting.<br/><br/>Ed Wood is a rare beast  it's a Tim Burton film that doesn't go overboard, it's a movie about Hollywood (sort of) that isn't self-indulgent, it's a nostalgia trip that manages not to be sappy but is still very warm and caring, and overall it's just a strikingly well-done film. I was impressed on many levels, most particularly with Depp and Landau, but really with the whole movie, that such a truly screwed-up human being could be shown in such a positive, indeed, loving way. Ed Wood is nothing less than a tribute to its subject, and in that, as in many other ways, it succeeds marvelously. If somehow you've missed this film, as I had until recently, you owe it to yourself to see it. It's simply a wonderful piece of film-making that should not be missed."

","If you ever seen Samurai Cop,The Room or even Dolemite you'll know all about cringe-worthy entertainment. These movies are so outrageously bad that you'll enjoy them on many levels and will be quoting them probably for the rest of your life, more so than well- respected movies. But behind every disaster is a director with heart, and a cast in need of a paycheck.<br/><br/>Call it irony, but Tim Burton assembled a fine cast of character actors and made a film about the worst director of all time and in the process spent more money than Ed Wood could ever dream of. Like Dolly Parton once said, ""it costs a lot of money to look this cheap"". Say what you want about Ed Wood, but 50 years after his monstrosities were produced, people are still watching them. I doubt you could guarantee this longevity for The Hobbit or any of the current 40 million films that star Benadryl Cabbagepatch.<br/><br/>Martin Landau carried away an Academy Award, as Best Supporting Actor, as did Rick Baker for his make up effects, but, even with these selling points, audiences never gave it a chance, which is a real shame because the movie needs to be seen to be believed, and for all aspiring or struggling filmmakers out there you will find many familiar problems between yourselves and Mr. Wood, regardless of your talent.<br/><br/>Chronicling the events of the mid-Fifties, through the production of three of Wood's classic disasters, Tim Burton's biopic achieves the impossible - we side with Ed, we identify with him, we wish him and his eccentric gaggle of pals only success and happiness in his cozy little world of half-baked ideas and misguided optimism. Success eluded Wood, but he achieved a greater fame and lasting appeal beyond his short life and this eccentric movie, which will make you faceplam for most of its running time, is our portal into Wood's oddball mind.<br/><br/>Alternately hilarious and touching, our sympathies lie with Wood and his ever loyal, declining co-star Bela Lugosi (a barely recognizable Martin Landau). Other characters pop up, including the hairy-as-hell Tor Johnson (George 'The Animal' Steele), wannabe transsexual Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), a very, very buxom Elvira-type (Lisa Marie), Criswell - the most famous predictor in the land (Jeffrey Jones), and a beleaguered Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio) - an atypical assortment of rejects, failures and weirdos.<br/><br/>Burton is inclined to produce a flop, when he indulges too much. Just as the audiences stayed away from Mars Attacks!, they never even considered Ed Wood, because of the black-and-white photography, which was a truly inspired decision. One cannot imagine how much the movie's legitimacy would have been lessened if it was in color. I must assure you that, no matter how offbeat and strange it looks, this film is an absolute classic that begs to be seen. It may not be to everyone's taste, but it has a wicked sense of humor and is sure to have you in stitches."

","This was the movie that Johnny Depp should have been nominated for! He was amazing! And seriously, this movie deserved so much more than just make-up and best supporting actor. ""Ed Wood"" is a terrific movie that every film fanatic will love. It has humor, drama, and romance. The thing is, I had heard a lot about Ed Wood, and was curious on what his life was like. My sister recommended this movie, and I think I might steal it from her. Just kidding! But it's worth not only a watch but a buy as well.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is perfect. I don't think there is a way you can change it to make it any better. I would highly recommend this movie any time.

"Coventry","10","23","25","3 June 2003"," A masterpiece about failure
","It's truly ironic that Tim Burton was able to make such a great masterpiece out of the life story of Edward D. Wood Jr. The least you can say is that his life wasn't. What makes this film so great is that Burton never makes fun of Ed Wood. His way of film-making, his lifestyle and his vision of things are always shown with respect. It's obvious that Burton didn't intend to make a comedy about Hollywood, but a drama about a man with a dream to make films. And he won't give up that dream, no matter what. I'm a great fan of Tim Burton. Especially when he casts Johnny Depp in the leading role. Edward Sciccorhands, Sleepy Hollow and this Ed Wood can easily make the top 50 films of ALL TIME. There's chemistry on the screen, when those 2 work together. And Johnny is not alone this time. The Oscar that Martin Landau received for his role of Bela Lugosi is perhaps one of the most deserved ones in the history of the Academy Awards. He's very creepy as the washed up actor, but very pathetic at the same time. It really is an outstanding performance. Patricia Arquette is just adorable as Kathy, the woman who stays with Edward in good and bad days. She's always giving him support, believes in him, accepts him as he is ( his confession to her in the spook house is really heartbreaking ) Lisa Marie is really sexy as Vampire. People can think she receives all her roles because she sleeps with the director, but she really can act. Very well as the matter a fact. One little disappointment maybe, I was hoping the role of Orson Welles ( played by Vincent D'Onofrio - one genius plays another one ) would have been a little bigger. ""Ed Wood"" is one of the best films of the 90's... what am I saying ? One of the best films EVER !!!"
"editorbob","9","89","109","9 March 2004"," More than merely a biography, or an homage
","I am a Johnny Depp fan, and this film only reinforced my enjoyment of his genuine talent. He's whatcha call a real actor. He's on record (""Inside the Actor's Studio"" & elsewhere) as saying that his characterization of Wood was a mixture of ""the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939) and Casey Kasem."" Well, I must add that either he left out channeling Jon Lovitz or that's where Lovitz got his inspiration, too. It is at moments positively eerie how well it works, and without feeling like Depp stole Lovitz's act--his overall character is so much more, so much else, that the Lovitz echo becomes a small part of a larger coherent whole, although it never disappears entirely.<br/><br/>Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette as the principal women in Wood's life are each endearing and effective in their own separate ways. Bill Murray is fun as always, and the secondary and bit players are very well cast.<br/><br/>Martin Landau . . . well . . . Martin Landau simply left me awestruck. Depp is all over the screen doin' his best wacky movie guy and chewing the scenery, Parker, Arquette, Murray, and the rest are obviously having a real fun time backing him up, and Martin Landau is shuffling around in the foreground muttering in Romanian and writing a book called ""How to Steal a Movie."" Mind boggling performance, and absolutely deserving every award it got him in 1995, which included a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, Golden Globe and SAG Awards, and the American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. (Incidentally, his daughter Juliet, better known to millions of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans as the vampire Drusilla, is one of the supporting players.)<br/><br/>If I weren't already a Tim Burton fan this movie would have made me one. He here makes an almost perfectly crafted period piece (anachronisms noted--see the ""goofs"" page--and dismissed), half cheesy fake scifi B movie and half period noir thriller, as a cinematic biography about the quintessential cheesy fake noir scifi thriller B movie guy. This film goes beyond pastiche, and beyond homage to a genre, although it is both. With this film Burton genuflects--no, prostrates himself--before the gods of 1950s low-budget black and white, and the gods are pleased indeed. It seems like he must have watched every movie made in America for under a million dollars between 1948 and 1962. I lost count of the echoes and parodies and pastiches and mini-homages that fill, I think, every darn frame of the movie, and which by no means are mostly of Wood and his work.<br/><br/>As with, I think, every movie biography, there's the odd gratuitous fact changing (see the ""goofs"" page again)--you know, the ""Why'd they do that when the truth wouldn't make any difference?"" kind of stuff, and as glowing as this review obviously is I must also say that it is in some ways an imperfect film--it glosses over Wood's later career, for example. But it it so obviously a labor of love and joy for all involved that in my opinion its imperfections are inconsequential. Ed Wood stands proudly, with that slightly odd gleam in its eye, with the best movie biographies made."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","16","17","17 February 2008"," Burton & Depp: Perfect For This Story
","It's appropriate that Tim Burton would direct this and even more appropriate that Johnny Depp would play the lead character as this story profiles an unusual subject: the worst director of films, perhaps, in Hollywood history....and one of its strangest characters.<br/><br/>As interesting as the story is, I found the black-and-white photography to be the best aspect of the film, but that's no surprise since Burton usually excels in making great visual films. Depp was hilarious as ""Ed Wood."" The eternal optimistic attitude and silly smile on his face in this film always makes me laugh and actually is inspiring in parts. You can't help but like poor Ed.<br/><br/>The most dramatic figure is Bela Lugosi, played memorably by Martin Landau, who deservedly won many awards for this performance. What a tragic figure.<br/><br/>To no surprise, there is a cheap shot against Baptists, who are made to look like meddling fools, something Hollywood loves to portray when it comes to any Christian character. Other than that, it's a fascinating film and portrait of a weirdo that only real-life weirdo Johnny Depp could do justice!"
"Scritzy","10","129","162","27 June 1999"," Kinship with a Fringie
","The theatre wasn't exactly filling up fast: so far my husband, a friend and myself were the only ones seated. Just before the movie began, a young couple walked in. And shortly after the movie began, they walked out. I wonder if they asked for their money back. I hope they didn't get it.<br/><br/>The movie was ED WOOD, Tim Burton's homage to trash-film director Edward D. Wood Jr., which only played in Greenville for two weeks and did not show up at the second-run movie houses. Apparently no one wanted to see it. Their loss.<br/><br/>But perhaps I'm being too hard on those who don't appreciate the subtle nuances of Eddie Wood's movies. To me, Eddie was a glittering bead hanging on Hollywood's lunatic fringe. However, Eddie, a transvestite who often directed his masterpieces wearing high heels and an angora sweater, was not exactly your mama's director. He was no Frank Tashlin, who tried to make Jayne Mansfield respectable in THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT. He was no Norman Taurog, who made Elvis look like a dork in countless girls-cars-and-guitars flicks. He wasn't even Russ Meyer, whose exploitation films are legendary in their trashiness. No, Eddie just never seemed to get a break. He wanted to be Orson Welles. He didn't even find the measure of fame accorded to Orson Bean! He remained a pathetic outcast, forever a fringie.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is appropriate that Johnny Depp was chosen to portray Eddie Wood. Depp has a long history of playing outcasts and fringies -- Edward Scissorhands, Gilbert Grape, Hunter Thompson. Depp makes it clear that Eddie's angora-covered heart was in the right place. He worked hard on his scripts, he gave important roles to spectacularly talentless actors like Vampira, wrestler Tor Johnson and Eddie's own main squeeze, Dolores Fuller. And he was very kind to the drug-addled has-been Bela Lugosi, even dissuading the drunken Drac from committing suicide (which wasn't entirely altruistic, perhaps, as Lugosi had threatened to take Eddie with him). Depp makes Eddie appear almost human.<br/><br/>Depp's portrayal is just one of several that are outstanding: George ""The Animal"" Steele as Tor Johnson, Jeffrey Jones as Criswell, Vincent D'Onofrio in his cameo of Orson Welles and Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge -- one of the rare times Murray has immersed himself in his character and not been merely Bill Murray with someone else's name. Also delightful is a brief appearance by organist Korla Pandit, 1950's television personality once billed ""The Prince of the Wurlitzer.""<br/><br/>However, all the performances in ED WOOD are overshadowed by Academy-award winner Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. For those enough old enough to remember Landau in TV's ""Mission: Impossible,"" it perhaps isn't surprising that Landau was able to hide so completely behind a spookily accurate makeup job; seeing Landau's Lugosi watch himself on television was eerie because Landau looked enough like Lugosi to make it seem real.<br/><br/>The film ends on a high note, which Eddie's life didn't -- he died in his sleep, watching a ball game, just a few days after he'd been evicted from his apartment.<br/><br/>ED WOOD is not a family film. Some of the language is strong, drugs and drink are abundant, and many of the characters are a shade on the bizarre side. It might be hard to explain to one's children why this apparently virile man loves to raid his girlfriend's closets.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ED WOOD hasn't exactly burned up the box office. Perhaps it is because so few people can relate to someone as weird as Eddie, with his terrible stories about men in angora sweaters, killer octopi, blank-eyed wrestler slaves and, the piece de resistance, aliens with eight failed plans to take over the universe. I believe Eddie himself felt like those aliens, which is why, viewing PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, he said, ""This is the one I'll be remembered by."" And perhaps that very weirdness made the story appealing to me. Having lived as a misfit and outcast, working hard all my life to reach a goal that has remained elusive, I can, to quote someone I don't care for, feel Eddie's pain. It's too late for him, but perhaps there's hope for me yet ..."

","Although I had never heard of Ed Wood before hearing of this film, I now understand why anybody would even consider making a film about him. Even though branded as ""the worst director of all time,"" Wood was refreshingly passionate about what he did. Of course, I can't really judge his work, but from what I saw in this movie I'm pretty sure that the critics are right about him.<br/><br/>But that's not the point of Ed Wood. Not at all. My favorite scene in the whole movie is the conversation between Wood and Orson Welles. One perhaps the best filmmaker of his time, the other a young, struggling filmmaker without experience or talent, but each knows what the other is going through. They have the same problems and the same ambitions. The fact that one is a genius and the other a total failure is only secondary.<br/><br/>The performances are all first-rate, starting with Depp and Landau and going all the way to the supporting cast which includes a great performance by Bill Murray. Opposing Ed Wood's statement that ""filmmaking is not about the tiny details,"" Tim Burton gave us another great film filled with wonderful details.<br/><br/>The film does not go into detail about Wood's experiences prior to and after making his first films which is understandable when you make a little research on this very website.<br/><br/>This film made me curious about Ed Wood's work and maybe I'll get over myself and check out Plan 9 from Outer Space or Glen or Glenda.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","What a delight! Dreamlike in tone, ""Ed Wood"" lovingly imparts to viewers the humorously delusional world of 1950s bad-film artiste Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Johnny Depp), creator of legendary bad films, most notably ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Part of the film's charm is how it portrays Wood, gushing with uncalled-for enthusiasm and optimism. Depp's facial expressions are priceless; that glib smile, those bugged-out eyes, the raised eyebrows, all enhanced by exaggerated makeup.<br/><br/>But no amount of incompetence can deny Wood's passion for making films. With a big megaphone to call out commands to his actors, Wood is like a ten-year-old boy, thoughtless of the finished product; he just wants to play movie director.<br/><br/>Wood surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, including most especially washed-up ""Dracula"" actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whose relationship with Wood propels most of the film's plot. But there are other, equally eccentric, people drawn to Wood, the most interesting being Bunny Breckinridge (a surprisingly good performance by Bill Murray), Vampira (Lisa Marie), and Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), that otherworldly seer of the future. The misfit label applies to Wood too, of course, who directs his actors, dressed in women's clothes, seemingly oblivious to the managerial discordance of such attire.<br/><br/>The script's characters and the film's high-contrast B&W lighting combine to portray Hollywood as a comically nightmarish place of delusional unreality. Simple sets mirror the cheapness in Wood's world. And that bongo-laced score with accompanying Theremin and crashing symbols is almost hypnotic.<br/><br/>Acting is way, way above average. Depp is absolutely terrific. And so is Landau. I can't think of any weak performances. My only problem with this film is that the plot gives a tad too much attention to Lugosi.<br/><br/>That Wood was anointed as the ""worst director of all time"" seems a bit cruel. At least he had heart and soul. Yet one cannot deny the unintended humor in his films.<br/><br/>Wonderfully nostalgic, ""Ed Wood"" reflects back to another era in film-making, when thinking big, self-assurance, and nerve were all a young man needed to make his Hollywood dreams come true, no matter how untalented."
"Patuquitos","10","10","11","31 January 2005"," One of the most charming movies ever
","When thinking about Ed Wood there is a word that always comes to my mind in first: charm. This movie oozes a worthiness for loving it few movies do. Because underneath its mix of genres, it's the most unnoticed one which ends up revealing itself as the most important: affecting drama.<br/><br/>Ed Wood is an all-around player. It has tons of humor (white and dark), including many comic scenes and hilarious characters. It has an experimental feel too, reflected on a couple of bizarre shots. It is an impeccable drama, full of feeling and transcendent events. But in the end, Ed Wood is, overall, a sort of a romantic comedy between the characters and the audience. I know it sounds pedantic and weird, but remember this thought when the final credits roll.<br/><br/>What does this feeling come from? It comes from Tim Burton's genuine love for the characters. No matter how pathetic they are, Tim shows love for them in every shot, and he shows it so well that the affection is contagious. You just can't help but feel that Ed, Bela, Tor and Vampira have been there in your life forever. They are family.<br/><br/>And just because of that, the film is so affecting. Bash me if you want, but Bela Lugosi's death saddened me more than 200 dramas. The affectionate friendship between Ed and Bela is touching, and Bela's death put an end to that. It also helped the fact that Martin Landau nails the character, playing the role of his life. His performance is one of the most astonishing I've ever seen, and clearly one of the three main reasons to watch this movie. Hats off.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is in top form too, constructing, in my opinion, an almost perfect film that ranks first in his work. Other Burton's movies are tremendous, but this simply has it all: awesome performances, intelligent script, prominent aesthetics, historical accuracy (although this is not an inherent value in Burton's work, it is here), and a jaw-dropping direction. Just take a look at the scene that takes place inside the ""spook train"" and you'll know what I'm saying. There's a care for detail too that shows in credits, music...<br/><br/>And one more thing: if you don't laugh with this film, you're dead.<br/><br/>RATING: 9.8"
"knifeparty2004","10","8","9","27 March 2013"," Burton's best!
","Filmed entirely in black and white, the story is a fictionalized biopic of Edward D. Wood Jr, (Johnny Depp), a 1950's film director who writes, produces and directs a series of low-budget, science-fiction/horror films. Struggling to break into the film industry as a Director, Wood serendipitously runs into aging film star, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau,) believing he is his ticket to success.<br/><br/>While the film essentially lampoons Wood's attempts at film-making, its central theme is the heart-warming friendship between Wood and Lugosi as the latter battles morphine addiction. The performances are exceptional. Depp entertains as the deluded, eccentric, transvestite filmmaker while Landau is equally brilliant and delivers an Oscar-winning performance as Lugosi. The supporting cast are just as memorable with good performances from Jeffrey Jones (Criswell), Bill Murray (Bunny Breckenridge) and Sarah Jessica Parker (Dolores Fuller)."
"Sebastian1966","10","8","9","3 December 2007"," Tim Burton's best film, and possibly his most personal.
","I loved Tim Burton's early films; EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, BATMAN, BEETLEJUICE and hell, even FRANKENWEENIE. However, his efforts lately has been rather unsatisfying. BIG FISH was a welcome exception, but SLEEPY HOLLOW and PLANET OF THE APES were rather dull and formulaic. APES, even more so, especially considering the awesome 1968 original (by Franklin Schaffner). In my opinion (and mine alone), Burton's best film was also one of his biggest financial duds at the box office; ED WOOD (ironic, considering the film is a biopic of a dismally unsuccessful film-maker). But ED as a movie (it's NOT a terribly accurate biographical account) is a cheesy voyage to the bottom of bad movies and the people who make them. The film takes some liberties with the true tale of Edward D. Wood Jr., a hack '50s director whose 'masterpieces' include JAIL BAIT, GLEN OR GLENDA (a surreal crap-fest about transvestites), BRIDE OF THE MONSTER and the infamous PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE (despite its ""worst film ever"" reputation, there ARE worse; Phil Tucker's ROBOT MONSTER for example). ED WOOD chronicles a roughly 5 yr. span (1953-8) in Wood's strange, tragically short life (he died in 1978 at age 54). During this period, he churned out three of the aforementioned 'classics.' In his portrayal of Wood, Johnny Depp really owns this movie. His performance is a deft blend of child-like optimism, coupled with a cynical, con-man's cunning. Forget the PIRATES franchise, THIS is Depp's best. Sarah Jessica Parker (purposefully overacting just a bit, which works well for this film) plays Delores Fuller; Wood's long-suffering girlfriend, who eventually leaves him for a ""normal life"" writing Elvis tunes. Patricia Arquette plays Wood's replacement girlfriend and soon-to-be long-suffering wife, Kathy. But the most poignant relationship in the film is the eccentric, father-son bond that develops between Wood and his ""star;"" drug-addled, washed-up ""ex-boogieman"" Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau in a deserved Oscar-winning role). Their relationship echoes Tim Burton's own real-life collaboration with the late Vincent Price. It's one of the many reasons that of all of Burton's films, this one feels the most personal (even more so than SCISSORHANDS). And the gorgeous black and white photography effortlessly evokes '50s B-movies (or in this case Z-movies). Many good performances round out the film (Bill Murray excels as aging drag queen, John ""Bunny"" Breckinridge, in what could easily have been a jokey, one-note role). But the film is at its best when the focus is on Wood and Lugosi. In this romanticized version of Ed Wood's life, Wood gives Lugosi's final, declining years a real sense of purpose. In return, Lugosi gives Wood fatherly love; prompting Wood to become the doting son during the worst of Lugosi's manic fits of depression and addiction. In fact, the shifty, manipulative Wood only seems truly sincere and honest when interacting with Lugosi. When the aging actor finally dies (after decades of drug abuse), Wood relives their final scenes shot together (in an heartbreaking scene) to the strains of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. Far greater artistry is employed in this film than Wood himself could have ever conceived of; let alone for his OWN biopic! Even composer Howard Shore's evocative, '50s sci-fi inspired musical score is pitch perfect (right down to the use of bongo drums and the electronic theramin). ED WOOD also echoes earlier Tim Burton characters; from Scissorhands (a character unable to physically connect with people because of his 'design flaw') to NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas' Jack Skellington (a good-natured, graceful, living skeleton who attempts to play Santa Claus; easily my favorite holiday film). The tale of the misunderstood misfit who attempts to achieve something utterly beyond his grasp (be it physical closeness, Christmas magic, or in Wood's case, making decent films). ED WOOD is the perfect distillation of this theme. Failure after failure, the boyishly optimistic Wood keeps pulling himself up, time and time again; undeterred by his overpowering limitations. Tim Burton, with all the skill and natural talent (at this phase of his career, anyway) his subject so desperately lacked, tells this story as a personal, humorous and ultimately, loving tribute to all those who continually strive to achieve that which is beyond their reach. From that strife, in murky water with malfunctioning prop octopuses, is where the story of ED WOOD lives."
"Quinoa1984","10","10","12","8 April 2006"," one of the best films of 1994
","Here is an example of film-making elements coming wonderfully together, in a package that can entertain the usual moviegoers and give the movie-geek his or her money's worth. That it is also perhaps the most well-rounded of Tim Burton's films, with enough does of comedy, drama, and movie-within-movie stylings, to fit two movies is an added plus. He tells the story of Edward D. Wood Jr (Johnny Depp), who may or may not be the most well-known bad filmmaker ever to exist with enough humanity and care to not make it at all parody, even if there is comedy interspersed. His story is one that is actually quite the same of most filmmakers, who want to make it somehow and have big dreams and lofty visions. Though taking into account Wood's preclivaty of wearing women's clothes (particularly the angora sweaters), hanging out with transvestites and other undesirables, and his best friend is a thought to be dead ex-horror icon (Martin Landau as Bella Lugosi, in a richly deserved Oscar turn) addicted to methadone, the path of his story is rather unconventional to say the least.<br/><br/>But the style of the film is quite ingenious, with rich and cool black and white photography, a finely moving and appropriate score (though not by Danny Elfman), and touting an all around best-in-show cast. Depp especially has a lot of fun playing this man, who may or may not be close to how he was in real life (from what I've read about him it's a fairly close depiction), and his portrayal of Wood is not at all cheating and is, in some scenes, really touching. The ones that stick out for me are the ones with Landau at his house, and filming his one scene from Plan 9 From Outer Space, but the ones with him on his 'sets', filming such drek with the passion and ambition of the greats, is really refreshing to see. Ed Wood is quite the biopic, showcasing Burton in another maturer form outside of films like Pee Wee and Batman, but with the same knack for entertainment. After all, how can you dislike a film with Tor Johnson, Elvira, and Bill Murray desiring a sex-change operation?"

","If a life in film is a a relationship with a being, then this is the shoes. They're handy, and only seem necessary when not dreaming.<br/><br/>But they're not what gets you anywhere.<br/><br/>I consider this Tim Burton's best film. That stop animation thing was more successful, but its too artificially goofy. This is more real and the idea is to straddle the line between homage and distanced observation. Its the only one that I think works, though ""PeeWee"" comes close. But that's because that whole movie is in its tone. Here, the movie is centered in the beings involved and how they relate to the films they are making, which of course happens to be the same relationship the characters and actors have with the movie we are watching.<br/><br/>Its because it is a real movie, with arcs, three acts, and an end that works. Burton isn't so picky about these things in his other projects and none has all three. <br/><br/>I wonder why no one holds him to this value, of building a film from the inside out. He needs someone to guide him away from merely starting with tone, and Elfman honks.<br/><br/>There are two folds here. The first is obvious, a self-described quirky filmmaker making a film with wit about an unintentionally quirky filmmaker making what he sees as serious films. The second is the ""Shadow of the Vampire"" bit about Landau's Lugosi. Its something of a wholly separate thread, handled with a different tone in all dimensions. <br/><br/>Meaningful narrative needs tension, and I am increasingly convinced that in cinema that requires two different whole personalities. It seems better if those wholenesses have their own cinematic space, as it is here.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"bkoganbing","10","7","8","5 September 2007"," His Talent Did Not Match His Ideas
","Poor Ed Wood, celebrated only now not for any great work he achieved in life, but for the spectacular mediocrity of his productions. Yet I'd like to think that somewhere in the great beyond Edward Wood, Jr. is pleased at how Tim Burton and Johnny Depp captured the very soul of a man who was born too soon or too late for various points in history.<br/><br/>As a biographer on his page at IMDb correctly points out during the hey day of the Poverty Row studios he could have settled comfortably in a career putting out shlock and making a living at it, had he come along in the Thirties. If Ed Wood were a young man today, he would find acceptance and support for his cross-dressing in a growing movement for transgender rights.<br/><br/>It was his sad misfortune to come of age in the fifties when movies were competing with television and could no longer inflict shlock on the public. He could no longer get work at Monogram or PRC or any of those other minor studios as a hack writer. But Wood was ambitious and like Orson Welles who he idolized he wanted to be a one man creative force.<br/><br/>As a cross-dresser Wood dreamed of a project that could explain his story and the stories of millions of others. He went to battle in several campaigns in the Marines with female undergarments. As Johnny Depp tells us his biggest fear was getting wounded lest his secret be discovered.<br/><br/>In his film Glen or Glenda he tried hard to tell of the duality of his sexual nature. Sad he didn't have the talent to pull it off.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp who made a deliberate career choice of eschewing teenage idol roles which he could have had after 21 Jump Street, notches his best screen performance as Ed Wood. Depp should have gotten at least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.<br/><br/>One man who did win an Oscar in Ed Wood was Martin Landau who really does make you think you're watching Bela Lugosi. A Lugosi who puts aside the mask of horror he wore on his public face and lets you into his inner sanctum. A broken 70 something narcotic addicted actor who forms a great kinship with Wood because he feels needed and wanted again by somebody. And Wood basks in the attention that a former film star gives him. It's one of the most touching symbiotic relationships ever shown on screen. Landau's Best Supporting Actor was a foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>Long after the action of this film concluded Ed Wood died in 1953 in total obscurity. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have given his life meaning in this film. As transgender people demand their just due in the public square, I'd like to think that an eighty something Ed Wood would be right in the forefront of things. I myself went to Washington, DC this year and lobbied with a number of transgender folks all over the country for federal hate crimes and anti-discrimination laws as a friend and ally. Ed Wood would be there no doubt in my mind.<br/><br/>I'm willing to bet that he would have been doing a documentary on a subject near and dear to him. And it would have been a subject near and dear and Oscar caliber stuff like his own life story was."
"dbdumonteil","9","7","8","17 June 2002"," Tim Burton's best film ?
","With this film, Tim Burton planned  to tell us the life of the worst director in the world ever. His name was Ed Wood and he lived in the fifties. We learn that Ed Wood loves wearing angora pullovers and women clothes. He also loves being dressed up as a woman and above all he's fond of the actor Bela Lugosi and his horror films. When Wood's meeting him for the first time, he's so elated that he wants him to play on his poor films. On the other hand, Burton show us the way Ed Wood used to make his films and we can say that they were very eccentric: for example a wholesaler in meat accepted to produce one of his films ""Bride of the Monster"" and the special effects are ridiculous: in the worst film ever made ""Plan 9 from outer space"" (even the title doesn't mean anything), flying saucer are made of cardboard. Then, in the last years of his life, Wood was living in poverty, took a lot of alcohol and finally died in 1978 at the age of 54 years old.<br/><br/>This film is very successful because Burton attempts to reconstruct Ed Wood's life as precisely as possible and Johnny Depp is very convincing in the role of this fascinating man so Burton succeeded in his plan. Of course Wood's films are the worst films ever made but he thought that he was making masterpieces just like Orson Welles! I found it both funny and extraordinary. But the film is worth being watched thanks also to Martin Landau who is very good in his Bela Lugosi role; thanks to his performance, he won an oscar for the supporting role. The other actors like Bill Murray or Patricia Arquette are very well used  Moreover, the film alternates comic moments, especially when Wood is making his films, and tragic moments such as Lugosi's funerals. At last not only made Burton a masterpiece but he also paid a tribute to Z films."

"bob the moo","Null","9","11","18 April 2004"," If you didn't laugh about it you'd cry - so Burton wisely takes the route of weirdly dark comedy
","Ed Wood is a frustrated actor and director who's small theatre productions barely can get a good word said about them.  When a cheap little production company advertises a project about sex change, Wood jumps at the chance and uses his personal fetish for women's clothing as the hook to get the job. Despite his final project being laughed out of the major studios, Wood now has the taste for it and starts to try and get funding to make his own films - aided by the ailing star Bela Lugosi who is desperate for work to help fund his habits.  With a collection of freaks and oddballs, Wood made what are now considered to be some of the worst films ever made.<br/><br/>Some things in life are depressing and it is often the case that we try to look on the bright side and make jokes about the situation as an attempt to deal with it.  I'm from Northern Ireland and my humour is quite dark and gallows style simply because that is the kind of comedy I grew up with was draw from the background of murder and violence - gallows humour is an appropriate term.  This film may not be based on gallows humour but it is such a potentially depressing story that the only way to do it and make it enjoyable is to tell it with humour.  Burton treats his subject with a great deal of affection and thus makes this film a funny tale of a dreamer who we know will never see his dreams fulfilled in the way he would like.  The story is funny but not in the cruel mocking way that it could have been but in a fanciful way that is amusing and all the better for being based on truth.  This strand continues all the way through the film and helps us to like Wood even if it is impossible to defend his films - the ending is perfectly upbeat considering that Wood then ended his life an alcoholic making cheap nude pictures.  The characters are exaggerated but still quite true to the real life people they represent (I take this from comments made in documentaries).<br/><br/>As director, Burton is excellent.  He gives the whole film an otherworldly feel that is very fitting for a tale that involves characters that are very weird indeed.  The affectionate approach that Burton has for Wood really helps - I wonder does he relate to the guy just trying to make the films that appeal to him or what it is that makes him feel this way towards him? Either way the end result is very good and it stands out as a film that is pretty much without flaw.  I questioned the film's inclusion in the imdb top 250 but then I thought well, what is wrong with it? I had to admit that almost nothing is wrong - the only thing would be that the story may not be to everyone's tastes and not everyone will buy into Burton's affectionate look at Wood.<br/><br/>The cast is led by a magnificent performance by Depp who I have long maintained is one of the finest actors (or at least bravest) of my generation.  Here he continues Burton's affectionate approach by portraying Wood as a man filled with hope and dreams - even doing a good job of turning cross dressing into an amusing quirk.  The cast is truly all star but they all do a great job playing their characters.  Landau's Oscar may have had a touch of sentimentality about it but it was still deserved - he plays Lugosi really well and manages the difficulties of his drug addiction really well to make him both amusing but deeply sympathetic.  The support cast includes good turns from Parker, Arquette (quite interchangeable really!), Jones, Murray, Starr, D'Onofrio and Spradlin.  All the cast do well but it is those that play Wood's wooden cast members that do the best job - managing to do both natural performances outside of Wood's movie but also doing justice to just how bad their characters really were!<br/><br/>Overall this is a great movie but the tale of a rubbish movie director who enjoys cross-dressing and hangs out with a group of weirdoes is likely not to be to everyone's taste.  Regardless of this, if it interests you then you should be pleased with a slick movie that takes an amusing and affectionate look at what is a fairly depressing story."
"Red-Barracuda","10","4","4","10 March 2015"," Fantastically good biopic
","Ed Wood is, for me, without question Tim Burton's best movie. It's not exactly a typical Burton movie, although it does still have his stamp. It, of course, tells the story of the director Edward D. Wood Jr. who for some is the worst film-maker who has ever lived. I feel I should lay my cards out on the table up front in regards to this widely held view and say that Wood is not only categorically not the worst director ever, he isn't even close to being such. Anyone who has seen a selection of Wood's movies should be able to see that, while they may be full of silliness and mistakes, they are also utterly unique in approach and, best of all, highly entertaining. And, trust me, you can't say those two things about the output of the vast majority of directors in the history of cinema. No, Ed Wood is a treasured cult film-maker for a reason.<br/><br/>Getting back to Burton's biopic, it's a fabulous tribute to the man with an excellent script, beautiful look and some amazing performances. It's definitely a case of hats off to Burton for immortalising Wood with a film that pulls off the very tricky thing of celebrating the ridiculous nature of his work, while paying respect to his singularity of vision. We are invited to laugh at the shoddy content of his films, while being actively encouraged to respect the man for his passion and optimism. Of great service here is Johnny Depp, who truly plays Wood to perfection, making us understand how his films ended up the way they did without ridiculing him. There is plenty of drama to work off, with Wood's cross-dressing compulsion and his friendship with horror icon Bela Lugosi, who is an aging, heroin-addicted and poverty stricken man by this time. He is played with uncanny brilliance by Martin Landau. The make-up is incredible and you truly forget it is not Lugosi himself on-screen so wonderful is the acting. Later in the movie there is a key scene where Wood encounters Orson Welles in a bar. Here we have the so-called worst director of all-time talking on the same level with the man who is for many the greatest. The point of the scene is that, no matter the perceived abilities of the men, they both suffered very similar problems with getting their films made as they wanted them; both were highly personal film-makers and such types never truly fit in to the Hollywood system.<br/><br/>Stylistically, this is bang-on yet never over-does it. The brilliant opening credit sequence pays playful homage to the kinds of cardboard sets and terrible special effects Wood became synonymous with, while the very effective Howard Shore soundtrack is on the money. The decision to shoot is black and white was perfect as it mimics the world of Woods films. We are introduced to all manner of strange misfits who hung around Wood and appeared in his movies. The story covers the production of Wood's three most famous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Outer Space. Pleasingly, there is plenty of time devoted to each film and we are able to enjoy loving scene reconstructions from all, including some choice, strange and ridiculous dialogue.<br/><br/>Ed Wood is an equally hilarious and heart-felt film. It is about the love of movies. It's very inspiring, entertaining and poignant. A brilliant achievement from Tim Burton and a fabulous tribute to one of the ultimate cult film-makers of all time."

","One of my favorite movies of all time. Not just because of the Depp-Burton thing, but because I have been a fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. for many years. Here is a story of a man who wanted to entertain, and thats exactly what he did. It may not have been the way he wanted to do it, but nonetheless, it was still entertaining. Its only sad that he couldn't have lived to see this movie. There are a lot of things one could say about Ed Wood, and some of them would not be to nice, but this film makes him look like a star. One hell of a nice guy that just wanted to get a story out of his head and into the eyes of everyone else. No matter how bad things would get he always had a good attitude about it all, and that should show most of us that no matter what happens in life, you just take it and try again. If it were not for writers like him we might not have some of the great directors we have now. People who take a shot at something and hope for the best. Some of us may not be able to take a leap like that. The movie well fits the man and his band of friends that were with him the whole way through making some of the worst films in movie history. I give this movie a ten because it is one of Tim Burton's best films and has a good heart. I am just glad it didn't go as far as some of Ed Wood's later movies. I am a fan of Bela Lugosi, and its very cool to me when my son wanted to know more about him and his movies. This film should be shown to younger generations (well not kids) to not ever forget the people from the past and how good some of those movies were, even if some where bad."
"moviemattb","10","3","3","13 October 2014"," A Genuine Classic Movie of the 90s
","Edward D. Wood, Jr. was hailed as the worst director of all time, and was famous for making horrible movies such as ""Glen or Glenda;"" ""Bride of the Monster;"" ""Plan 9 from Outer Space;"" and many other movies that he has made. He works so fast, and never gives up his dreams as he continues to make movies. There have been many fans who enjoy watching movies that are suppose to be bad they are really good. Of course, I enjoy some of Wood's movies and some of the other bad movies that are not directed by Ed Wood like ""Sharknado;"" ""Troll 2;"" and many others. Now, in the mid-90s, there was a movie about Ed Wood and it was famously directed by none other than Tim Burton. Burton was perfect for this biopic on the world's worst director, and he actually succeed it for what he had envisioned for this movie. Johnny Depp was wonderfully superb as Ed Wood, while Martin Landau was absolutely sensational for playing the star of ""Dracula,"" Bela Lugosi. The makeup design by Rick Baker was top notch perfect; the music by Howard Shore was well done, and the film's cinematography was brilliantly shot in black and white. It works so well because most of Wood's movies in the 50s were filmed in black and white. I understand that the movie is not really 100 percent well accurate, but it didn't bother me at all. I still enjoy the movie for what it is, and I wouldn't be upset about this movies if it is whether or not accurate. Nevertheless, it does have a great message when it comes to filmmaking because making movies is not really easy and it cannot always be about the big picture that it will always turn out to be a hit at the box-office, nor saying that it has something to do about the money. I, on the other hand, will never take that kind of route when I am making movies of my own. I make movies by showing the best of my efforts without trying to be a snob or just rushing my movies to get things done. We, as filmmakers, should always take our time and effort as we fully realized our visions for what movies that we want to make. Of course, there will be times that we do get a bunch of bad rep by critics, and we will always have to accept the responsibilities of criticism. We are not always that perfect, and we can't always say nasty things to the critics that our movies are perfect. I know I do enjoy working on some of the movies that I make during my years in junior high school and high school but I am always aware of some of the problems that I had when I am making movies. If they are not as perfect as I hope for, then there is no need to get upset about. We always make mistakes, but we can learned from them as we continue to make good movies and maybe there can be a possibility to make a movie that is perfect. Remember, whenever you are making a movie that you are making, there will always be times that your movies can come out being brilliant or just end up being a disaster. It does take quite a risk for making a movie and we always have to expected for being good; some times your movies can get good reviews and some times your movies can get bad reviews. Whether you have a hit or a flop, all you do is just try to keep up the good work and give out your very best. That is what it takes when it comes to filmmaking. This movie is very important to me because I always want to take notes from it so I can make my movies really good, and not having it to come out as a piece of garbage. Heck, this can be important to you too if you are into the filmmaking business. ""Ed Wood"" is a genuine classic movie of the 90s, and it shall always be one of my favorite movies. I give ""Ed Wood"" a 10 out of 10."

The simplicity and the laugh when you put your perspective to the whole situation really cheers you up and makes you simply love those people, enthusiasm, laughter... The whole world. I admire the connection between J. Depp and the characters he portrayed, because they give the heart and the sheer essence of little child's soul to each other. So innocent, yet so deep and composite. That's why directors do not feel the necessity to put the pistol into Mr. Depp's arms and, instead, they give him those lovely characters to make them more lovely.

I think his early work had an imagination and timeless appeal that, frankly, his later films have utterly lacked. And the genius of Tim Burton's early work culminated in what I believe to be his true best film ED WOOD (1994). If Tim Burton were ever going to win an Oscar as Best Director for his early work, this should have been the film. And it also boasts what I think is the BEST performance of the iconic Johnny Depp's career. Depp was totally robbed of a Best Actor nomination (and had he been, HE would have been my pick for the award!).<br/><br/>Also, ED WOOD was the BEST film of 1994! Not Forrest Gump (which won and is way too schmaltzy and sentimental for my taste)...Not Shawshank Redemption (which was nominated for Best Pic, but has way too high a rating here on IMDb! #1 of all time? Are you freakin kidding me?)....Not Pulp Fiction (also nominated for Best Pic, but has dated too much for my taste and isn't even Tarantino's best film IMHO!)...Nope, ED WOOD should have been nominated and WON Best Picture of 1994! <br/><br/>ED WOOD is Burton's tribute to the titular filmmaker who is widely regarded as the worst of all time. And a brilliant tribute it is! Burton basically goes for the purely comic approach, with touches of pathos and reality checks thrown in for good measure. Depp's awesome, energetic, all-in performance drives the film. He stays in character for the entirety of the film and this is one of the funniest performances of any male lead in a comedy film.<br/><br/>Martin Landau was absolutely brilliant and on-key as horror film icon Bela Lugosi. Landau totally deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Rarely do I think they get those awards right, but they sure did in this case. It's just a shame that Burton, Depp, and the film didn't get their due as well.<br/><br/>In addition to Depp and Landau, the supporting cast is wonderful: Sarah Jessica Parker as Ed's uptight first girlfriend, Patricia Arquette as Ed's true soulmate, Lisa Marie's uncanny Vampira impersonation, and the great Bill Murray as one of Ed's eccentric (was there any other kind with this man?) collaborators.<br/><br/>Shot in black-and-white to give the film an old-school vibe and to mimic the era of film of Ed Wood's prime, the film plays like a parody of a parody. Certainly, the situations that Wood encountered didn't come across as THIS hysterical, but I think this is Burton's way of honoring the auteur, while still entertaining the general movie-going audience.<br/><br/>Brilliant, funny film...Burton's best...Depp's best...One of THE best!"
"TheLittleSongbird","10","3","3","18 April 2010"," A perfect example of a film that had me completely gripped right from the beginning!-Utterly brilliant!
","This biopic on ""the worst director of all time"" Ed Wood Jnr is utterly brilliant from start to finish. From its exhilarating beginning, helped by Howard Shore's brilliant score and Jeffrey Jones's delightful turn as Criswell, it completely gripped me. For me it isn't only one of Burton's better movies, but also one of the better movies of 1994. Tim Burton's works are admittedly strange and offbeat, and while people mayn't like that, I do. And that is why I loved this film, it was funny, it was touching, it was strange(well sort of) and it was offbeat. It is gorgeously shot, with black and white photography that is really a marvel to the eyes, and Burton lovingly directs. The script is funny and poignant, and the restoration of Wood's productions are astonishing. It was even nice to see Plan 9 From Outer Space, I know that critics cite it as the worst movie ever made, but there are other people who consider it as a ""so bad it's good"" movie, the way I have heard people talk about the film, whether they love or hate it, is quite fascinating. And the performances are brilliant; Johnny Depp is amazing as Ed Wood, portraying him as an optimist and an ""anguished cross-dresser"", and Martin Landau is absolutely superb as Bela Lugosi. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are alluring and convincing as Delores and Kathy, and as Bunny Bill Murray does well even if Bunny could've been developed a little more. Overall, gripping, funny, touching and brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","Ed Wood, I tell you. He was probably one of the most favorite worst director in the world. But that's what I﻿ love about the guy, he had a passion for films. Thats what made him happy. I wish I would have met him. He probably would have been an interesting guy to talk to. He's the kind of guy I'd hang every day. That's would be so fun.<br/><br/>He doesn't deserve to bashed upon. His work, was﻿ a work of heart. He loved cinema in every way, shape and form and clearly wanted to be part of that.<br/><br/>And next time you criticize someone so harshly, think if you can do a better job than them, which I doubt you could do."
"Scars_Remain","10","3","3","18 February 2008"," Maybe Burton's Best
","Ed Wood is one of my all time favorite directors. Yes, he made bad films and generally had no idea what he was doing, but he was a very humble guy and he never let bad press get in the way of doing what he had a true passion for, making movies. The problem with the guys making bad horror movies today(Uwe Boll, Ulli Lommel, Eli Roth) is that they all seem arrogant and that is such a shame. Ed Wood is a hero of mine for sticking to what he loved and still keeping a good head on his shoulders. So it's no wonder why I loved this movie so much.<br/><br/>I found a copy of this at the library and I was expecting it to be good but not nearly as good as it was. See, I was expecting a fairly depressing drama that left me feeling cold, but what I got was a quirky and fun comedy with some dramatic elements. I knew from the second that this one started that it was going to be a new favorite of mine.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have come to be one of my favorite film duos. This film is no exception to their greatness. All of the actors are absolutely wonderful in their roles. The story is great because it mostly sticks to the true story and I really appreciated that. I also love that it was filmed in black and white to give it the whole ""Ed Wood"" feel. I had so much fun watching it.<br/><br/>If you like Ed Wood's films and you're interested in the story of his life, this movie is certainly for you. I can't recommend it enough and I think you'll enjoy it as much as I have. Give a chance, please!"
"HelloTexas11","10","3","3","1 December 2007"," brilliant biopic
","Anyone familiar with Ed Wood's story, and I think that takes in most movie buffs, will be nodding his or her head in knowing amusement several times during 'Ed Wood.' It is the masterfully told tale of the legendarily not-so-masterful director of the same name. In fact, that may be its biggest transgression: it's too well made to fit the subject. Be that as it may, Tim Burton has crafted a loving but unsparing look at Ed Wood and friends. Wood himself is overshadowed at times by Martin Landau's uncanny portrayal of Bela Lugosi, which not only won an Oscar but is quite simply one of the greatest performances by any actor in any movie, period. It is at once sad, funny, poignant and even poetic. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood, and while he doesn't really look like him, he certainly conveys Wood's boundless enthusiasm for film-making convincingly. He also invests the character with Wood's small-town naiveté, and makes his cross-dressing seem almost, well, normal. It makes sense to Ed Wood anyway. The film succeeds on many levels, for instance in its depiction of how low-budget movies were made in the 1950's. Any student of the cinema will find that part of the film fascinating. Burton wisely shot 'Ed Wood' in high-contrast black and white (the only way to go for this material) and his recreations of Wood's movies are very convincing, even when they are matched with the actual original footage. It's a shame 'Ed Wood' was such a flop at the box office though it is understandable as well. Audiences for the most part had no idea what it was about, and were not inclined to see a movie about the worst director of all time. Sometimes original or unique stories are simply proclaimed 'wrong' by mainstream film-goers and that is the fate that met 'Ed Wood' in its initial release, though critics loved it. This is a film that bears repeated viewings, as there's something new to be seen every time and a host of wonderful performances by everyone involved. I think even Ed Wood would have loved 'Ed Wood.'"
"s-woodier","10","3","3","2 October 2007"," Pull the string! Pull the string!
","This is probably the finest film to come out of Hollywood. It is also about the worst films to come out of Hollywood.Who can forget Glen or Glenda? Who can forget Bride of the Atom? Who can forget Plan 9 from Outer Space? Well, just about everybody.Ed Wood is an hilarious and often moving experience about a man who thought he was destined for greatness, when really he was destined for ridicule. Tim Burton recreates superbly the tackiness of Ed Wood's efforts to make an impression.Jonny Depp excels as the ever keen Ed Wood and Martin Landau turns in a virtuoso performance as drug addicted Bela Lugosi, who finds himself relying on a loser for support in his time of crisis.Ironically,Tim Burton found himself in Ed Wood's shoes when this film was released, as it was generally overlooked, which is surely the ultimate tribute to the film's inspiration!A masterpiece."
"CapRising","10","3","3","22 September 2007"," A wonderful, loving tribute
","There is probably no actor who could have brought Edward D. Wood Jr. to life better than Johnny Depp. But my special kudos are reserved for Martin Landau and his portrayal of Bela Lugosi (""Shit! I lost my transfer!"").<br/><br/>A fond look back at the freewheeling auteur days of Hollywood - before the bloodsucking corporate grave robbers took over.<br/><br/>I loved the production values that gave the behind-the-scenes story of Wood look like one of his pictures. Sarah Jessica Parker was well cast as Delores. Jeffrey Jones brought us a surprisingly compelling Criswell (I still remember his newspaper column from the 1960s and 1970s).<br/><br/>The closing ""Whatever Happened to...?"" recaps are the perfect ending to this great flick.<br/><br/>No one who likes movies should miss this one."
"Colashwood","10","3","3","20 February 2006"," The one and only Time Machine
","There has been an Ed Wood DVD box on the French market for a few months now, including Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Why are these films considered as the worst ever made in Hollywood (or elsewhere) is beyond my understanding. They are very awkward ; the acting is stiff and mostly unprofessional ; and still they do convey  especially Glen or Glenda and Plan 9  an eerie feeling of metaphysical dereliction  the dreadfully lonely scene with the old widower in Plan 9 is outstanding in an odd way. <br/><br/>*** Spoilers*** I bought the box, and a few days ago I landed up with Tim Burton's Ed Wood. Ed Wood is an outstanding film, showing, of course, none of the awkwardness of Ed Wood's own creations. The cast is wonderful (Depp, Landau, Lisa Marie, Jeffrey Jones especially), the direction is so precise and subtle it lets you savor the taste of good bad cinema without a single sneer ; the music is grand (Theremin be thanked !). And there is more to it  a perfect reflection of the sad, bleached light that irradiates Ed Wood's own films, (if nothing else could). The scene of the old widower now gets a poignant explanation  Depp-Wood stages it without even having a film in his mind, just to reassure poor old dying Landau-Lugosi. Well, he might well have less altruistic motives, but what do we care ? Wood records the frail gait, the trembling hand, the white light reverberating on the shabby suburban home. That is the sequence that shimmers with such melancholy in Ed Wood's real own Plan 9. No wonder : death looms large. I love the fact that Burton includes this very same sequence in Ed Wood, with an ecstatic Depp lip-sync-hing the scene  who mirrors who now ? Isn't Ed Wood, the man, a Burton creation, after all ; or isn't Ed Wood the film time-teleported directly from the fifties to your screen ? Who knows ? It takes the slightly too familiar faces of Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker to steal you from this ravishing time wrap (Landau's and Depp's should be as familiar : but they're far greater actors, aren't they ?). Alas, you are not lost in the black and white land of your wildest dreams and there's a way back home.<br/><br/>*** An other spoiler, and a puzzle*** A word about Orson Welles' uncanny apparition. The smooth-skinned, handsome Welles you see here is a thing of wonder  so like Kane's Welles that the mind boggles ; but then : how can he be filming Touch of Evil ? And that, my friends, is one of Ed Wood's (the film, the man) greatest and most devastatingly naive ideas."
"dougandwin","8","3","3","7 September 2005"," Depp and Landau are standouts.
","The era and efforts of the worst Director ever, Ed Wood, have been very well recreated in this movie, and the acting of Johnny Depp as the title character and Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi are quite remarkable and the latter clearly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Award. Depp seems to be able to take on the most outlandish of roles, and make them not only, believable, but truly memorable, and that us very much the case in ""ED WOOD"". It is possible, or even probable, some of the events depicted may never have occurred, but it was entertaining and gave a good insight to the Hollywood of that era. I was most surprised to see Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker being cast, and in their somewhat ""weird"" roles they carried them off very effectively. The ending, where the film reveals what happened to all the characters made for a very interesting conclusion."
"itamarscomix","10","3","3","24 May 2005"," Tim Burton's Lost Masterpiece
","Doubtlessly the most underrated and misunderstood movie in this brilliant director's career, Ed Wood is one of Tim Burton's best movies, right up there with his four timeless masterpieces - Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman. It's very different from anything else he's done before, though. Even the music is different - it was composed by Howard Shore ('The Lord Of The Rings') instead of Tim's regular partner since the beginning, the brilliant Danny Elfman. Few of Burton's beloved motifs are to be found here. I think the reason is that he meant for Ed Wood to look like an Ed Wood film rather than a Tim Burton film - and it works, down to the black & white and the cheesy dialogue. It's a camp masterpiece, and essential for Burton fans.<br/><br/>Granted, Tim's choice of subject matter for this film - a biography of the worst director in history - may seem odd, but then again he was never the kind of director who repeats himself (except for the excellent Batman Returns, of course). And in his skilled hands, the rather messy storyline makes for a wonderful comedy that is absolutely hilarious - but also, at times, touching. The character of Edward Wood (played skillfully by the one and only Johnny Depp) is so absolutely pathetic that he can really get to you - his incredible ambition even at the face of repeating failure (""...The worst movie you ever saw? Well, my next one will be even better!""), his childish enthusiasm, his absolute assurance in his 'vision' (his wonderful dialogue with Orson Wells) and lack of patience to get it done with (he does one take for every shoot) and his fondness for women's clothing make him a unique and lovely character, and in Johnny's hands he is brought back to life.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also wonderful, and a great deal effort was put into choosing actors as similar as possible to the real people they're portraying. Best of all is of course the wonderful Martin Landau who does fantastic job as horror superstar Bela Lugosi. Jeffery Jones as Criswell, Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, pro-wrestler George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller, as well as all the rest, are terrific. I recommend seeing at least one of Ed Wood's films (preferably 'Bride of the Monster' or 'Plan 9 from Outer Space') before watching Ed Wood, and that would give you a much better perspective at the film and the characters."
"Infofreak","Null","3","3","15 August 2002"," One of Tim Burton's most enjoyable movies. An absolute hoot!
","'Ed Wood' is easily one of Tim Burton's most enjoyable movies. If you aren't familiar with the work of Ed Wood, specifically 'Glen Or Glenda', 'Bride Of The Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space', you may not get as much out of this brilliant movie as you should, but that's your problem - educate yourself! Johnny Depp's mannered performances can often become irritating, but this time he fits in perfectly with this stylized fun. In fact it's difficult to think of many other contemporary actors who could pull this off as well as he does. Depp is supported by a well chosen and effective cast, including another spot on bit of casting with Martin Landau as horror legend Bela Lugosi, and fine work from Sarah Jessica Parker, Mike Starr, Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette, and Burton semi-regular Jeffrey Jones. There's also a memorable cameo from Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Welles in one of the movies stand out scenes. 'Ed Wood' is an absolute hoot, and one of the most entertaining movies of the 1990s. This is essential viewing for cult and horror buffs, and hopefully will encourage others to explore the weird and wonderful world of b-grade (and z-grade!) movies."

","As a big fan of Ed Wood's work, (more specifically: as a BAD movie buff), I must say it is great to see Edward D Wood, Jr. get some recognition for his hard (bad) work.  <br/><br/>The movie has many inaccuracies, things such as the sequence of Wood's films, and other details of the movies.   But in my mind the real life of Wood would not have made for a very good movie, so Tim Burton took some liberties.  For a change this does not destroy a historical representation, but rather makes it easier to follow.  <br/><br/>Last of all, the cast was excellent.  Johnny Depp is one of the finest character actors in Hollywood today, and he managed to bring a warmth to a man who was, in real life, deeply, deeply disturbed.  Depp was surrounded by many other fine actors, and the cameos by some of Wood's real life friends were a delight!"

","A biopic of the life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', 'Edward D. Wood Jr.' and who now occupies a lofty position as a cult icon ; being based on Rudolph Grey's book ¨Nightmare of ecstasy : the life and art of Ed Wood¨. This is a touching and comic tribute to a Hollywood maverick , a cross-dressing , angora-sweater wearing director, concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when lack of financing and repeated failures led to make a lot of bad films , in spite of Wood's optimism and vitality . And focusing his relationship with Bela Lugosi and his rare troupe of actors . This is a mostly true story of the legendary director of awful pictures and his strange group of friends and actors .<br/><br/>This is a splendid tribute by Tim Burton to bring to the screen the tale of a filmmaker many consider to be the worst of all time . Lavishly produced , in fact , this film cost more to produce than all of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films put together . Tim Burton said that he was drawn to the story because of the similarities between Edward D. Wood Jr.'s relationship with Bela Lugosi , now ageing and unemployed horror star , and his own friendship with Vincent Price late in the actor's life . Burton focuses on Ed's relationship with Bela , whose career is over by the time Wood befriends him . Depp is extraordinary and engaging as Ed , the strange filmmaker whose Angora sweaters were his weakness , women were his inspiration and movies were his passion . Johnny Depp has said that his characterization of Edward D. Wood Jr. was a mixture of ""the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of OZ and Casey Kasem."" . Martin Landau's winning of the 'Best Supporting Actor' Academy Award for his portrayal of down-on-his-lucky Bela Lugosi marked the first time in Oscar history that a performer in any category won for playing an actual movie star . However , Bela Lugosi Jr.'s only objection to the film's portrayal of his father was his speech. In Lugosi's memory, his father never used foul language .<br/><br/>Sensational support cast , the secondary actors are mostly convincing and enjoyable , almost every role has an appropriate resemblance to his or her Z-player counterpart and the performances are adequate such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller , Jeffrey Jones as Criswell , Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge , Max Casella as Paul Marco , Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks , Lisa Marie as Vampira , George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Juliet Landau as Loretta King . Ed Wood was a low-budgeted auteur of such lousy actors and notoriously bad movies as ¨Glen or Glenda¨, ¨Bride of monster¨ and ¨Plan 9 from outer space¨ . Agreeable musical score by Howard Shore , the sweeping music during the epilogue is based on the music from Glen or Glenda and being the first film by Tim Burton to not feature Danny Elfman's soundtrack . Evocative as well as luxurious cinematography in black and white by Stefan Czapsky . The motion picture was compelling and stunningly directed by Tim Burton . Rating : Better than average , well worth seeing . Essential and indispensable watching ."

","Anyone who considers himself/herself to be a creator of any kind - inventor, musician, artist, writer - will consider this movie to be their worst professional nightmare. Imagine yourself dedicated to your craft, day after day and year after year putting out what you consider to be your best work in a field that you love only to find, at the end of your life, that you have failed in every way measurable and imaginable. This is essentially the story of director Edward D. Wood, Jr. 1924-1978, who was voted the worst director in the history of film in 1980, and as a result saw a renewed interest in his films that persists even today.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a great performance as Ed Wood as he was in the 1950's, starting with his friendship with Bela Lugosi and ending with the premiere of his best remembered film ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" and his elopement with Kathy, who remained his wife for twenty years until his death. At this point in his life Ed's enthusiasm for his work is irrepressible. Fortunately the film ends before he descends into frustration, alcoholism, and a series of skin flicks in the 60's. The genuine friendship between Lugosi (Martin Landau) and Wood is one of the more touching parts of the film. The men settle into almost a father/son relationship with a real mutual professional admiration. Lugosi supplies Ed with a star with which he can attract investors in his films, and Wood supplies Lugosi with work and a reason to go on living. Landau's portrayal of Lugosi is phenomenal. At times you forget that you really are not watching Lugosi himself."
"pekinman","10","5","6","15 September 2009"," It's becoming a classic
","It's hard to believe 'Ed Wood' was released 15 years ago. It went on to my instant favorites list the first time I watched it and seems as fresh and brilliant now as it did way back when. <br/><br/>It was an inspired idea for a Tim Burton film and it is about as close to perfection as a film from Hollywood can get. The casting is beyond criticism, Howard Shore's musical score is one of his very best, full of memorable moments and catchy tunes (especially the opening credits with the bongos), the costumes and makeup, camera work, the whole ball of wax is beautifully conceived and executed. The f/x are great because they are just as seedy and ridiculous as Ed Wood's on when he filmed 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', paper plates as flying saucers, school room teachers' desks for control consoles within the space ships, stewardess uniform for the female E.T., rubber octopuses etc. It is all very funny. <br/><br/>Ed Wood's cross dressing does not come off as eye-rolling ridiculous, it too is very funny. Ed, played by the ever-wonderful Johnny Depp, is a fundamentally kind man, full of ambitions and drive to succeed against horrendous odds, his biggest obstacle being his own lack of talent. But now he is a Hollywood immortal, along with Vampira, played by the marvelous Lisa Marie, and, of course, Bela Legosi at the very trashed-out end of his long career; an astonishing, moving and often hilarious performance by Martin Landau.<br/><br/>Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones add to the extremely funny cast of main characters. Patricia Arquette and Sarah Jessica Parker are Ed's two girlfriends, Arquette playing his eventual wife, Kathy, a lovely performance, the one quiet and relatively sane person in the entire movie.<br/><br/>This is not just a very sophisticated adult comedy it is also recommendable to kids who are old enough to have developed a sense of humor, though the cross- dressing angle may cause some parents to give pause before allowing their 12 year old boys watch it. And the drug-rehab scene with Bela Lugosi is intense, but perhaps a good object lesson for youngsters who may be thinking shooting up heroin might be cool.<br/><br/>I think 'Ed Wood' is Burton's best movie, so far."

","I was curious to watch this movie because of my brother; he was the one who told me about Ed Wood and his fame of being the worst director that already existed. I liked it a lot, and because of it, I started to watch Ed Wood's movies as well.<br/><br/>This movie is kind of funny, and I would almost consider it as a comedy, if it wasn't a Biography; the fact about it being black and white didn't bother me as I expected,and Johnny Depp was great in the role of Ed Wood.<br/><br/>Besides the bad fame Ed Wood took, because of his low quality's movies and his lack of techniques and good sense, I found beautiful to see how dreamer he was ,and how he tried to reach his goals besides all the problems and difficulties. I think that one of the most important things in the life of a person,is to never give up of what you really believes,having the power to always carry on in your life. That's also why ,one of my favorite parts of this movie, is when Ed Wood meets Orson Welles,and Orson says ''Visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?''."
"tjb103","8","5","6","7 January 2005"," Is it me or are black and white films just cooler? (Raging Bull, Casablanca and ED WOOD!)
","Having sat through the disaster that is the remake of Planet of The Apes, I felt that Tim Burton, not Edward D. Wood Jr., deserved the accolade of 'worst movie director of all time'. However, it was only a minor blip in a career that really I much admire: Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow being two of the three films that particularly stand out. There is no surprise that these two movies include the wonderful Johnny Depp, whose career peaked in the 90s (Pirates of The Caribbean was NOT that good, in fact it's quite average if you watch it again - most likely due to Orlando Bloom) with the outrageous Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas and the magnificent Donnie Brasco. However, Depp's defining performance (I think we're seeing a trend here) is in the biographical film of the title character Ed Wood. His constant smiling and his optimism, despite the truly terrible films that he writes/produces/directs/acts etc, are quite lovable to such an extent that the audience let him get away with his angora sweater fetish. The film is so funny - not only Depp, but the supporting cast as well. Martin Landau won an Oscar for his performance which I find actually quite surprising because Oscars don't generally go to comedic characters (Sam Jackson in Pulp Fiction, anyone?) but I guess even the stiffs at Oscar would have had a hard time not laughing at Landau's 'Bela Lugosi' wrestling with a plastic, inanimate, giant octopus. I love the style of the film: it's nice to see that the people from Hollywood still have the time to laugh at their industry's past mistakes in between making movies like Armageddon, Pearl HarboUr and The Sum of All Fears (do we sense another trend here?!)- actually, while I'm on it, I'd just like to say Ben, what happened, man? You wrote, inconceivably, Good Will Hunting!. But the best part of the film is that it's all true (well most of it, anyway). Check out Edward D. Wood Jr.'s career - he did actually make a film called Glen or Glenda, about a heterosexual man with transvestite tendencies, starring none other than Bela Lugosi. Only in Hollywood. Anyway, I realise that I haven't really given you that much information about the film here, so all I'll say is that I loved it. If you haven't seen it yet I envy you, because this film has the unusual quality of being fantastic the first time round; thus, you are in for a treat."

","What an enigma of a film. It wasn't as funny as it could have been. It wasn't as interesting as it could have been. And yet it held the attention. I think the film itself was supposed to be as tacky and ephemeral as the dreadful Ed Wood productions themselves. That's a dull concept but Depp made it watchable despite his annoying grimace and unconvincing angora fetish. His character needed to be fleshed out a little more. He came across as just a bit mad whereas he must have had some substance to his life. They could have had much more slapstick fun with the hopeless actors and hangers-on! The big bald guy was a natch for laughs and Bill Murray was sparingly used."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Ed Wood (1994) <br/><br/>This is one of the best movies of 1994 for me. Depp's performance of the title character is so enthusiastic, you can't help but like him. His enthusiasm is contagious. He should have received his second Oscar nomination here, as it was, he was ignored again, and remained without a single nomination for several more years. Depp is superbly backed up by a ridiculously talented cast. Martin Landau is simply superb as Bella Lagousi, Bill Murray was also deserving of an Oscar nod, but like Depp he was ignored. Sarah Jessica Parker, Mike Starr, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey Jones and Lisa Marie all stand out too. There is not a weak link in the cast.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is not between Ed Wood and one of his women but his relationship with Bella Lagousi. A man he truly adores.<br/><br/>The movie won two Oscars. One for Martin Landau in the Best Supporting Actor category and one for Best Make Up and opened to great reviews but was a box office bomb. <br/><br/>Grossing only $6 million against an $18 million budget. Was it the fact it was released in black and white?? Was it that it was released one week after Don Juan Demarco, the subject matter??? Whatever it was that turned audiences off, it's a real shame, as it's a great movie filled with great performances."

","This is probably my favorite Tim Burton film because I love the incredibly wretched films of Ed Wood and appreciate a bio-pic of this king of dreck! Having seen BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, GLEN OR GLENDA, PLAN 9, NIGHT OF THE GHOULS AND JAIL BAIT, I was absolutely thrilled that the stories behind these films was finally brought to the screen. Plus, it was a great thrill to see the behind the scenes work that crazy of Ed did to get his horrible films made. It also helped that Johnny Depp played the character with so much energy and sincerity. It helped even more that the producers took such great pains to replicate the weird group of stock characters from the Wood films. Of course Martin Landau got a lot of attention (and an Oscar) for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, but the rest of the characters were so close it was spooky. Plus, I admired that even the clothing and sets were dead on as well. Instead of simply making fun of Wood's horrible career, the film is more of a loving homage to a man who made rotten films that were still somehow very appealing--leading his films to be regarded as trash film cult classics. Perfect and enjoyable throughout and a truly wonderful time capsule."
"Dan1863Sickles","9","4","5","10 June 2005"," Failure And Success -- An Unlikely Masterpiece Pt. II
","Not only is this bittersweet story of a ""failed"" Hollywood dreamer by far the best movie of Tim Burton's career, it seems to have inspired more compelling commentary than any other film on IMDb. I would like to focus on the ""failure"" of Ed Wood as an artist -- as opposed to his success as a human being -- and explore the movie's definition of ""sucess."" <br/><br/>A few years ago, a very insightful gentleman made a number of brilliant points about why this movie wasn't a hit. (Check the IMDb comment index for ""An Unlikely Masterpice."") Basically Ed Wood's failure shows that the American dream is a lie. Do your best, believe in yourself and never quit, and you can still end up with nothing. Unquestionably that is the message the mass audience got, and that is why the movie bombed in theaters. But is that all the movie really says? If Ed Wood's failure as an artist was the only point, this movie would be just another dreary tract of the socialist realist school -- like Rod Serling's ""Requiem For A Heavyweight."" Ed Wood is just another dreamer betrayed by the system -- he's Willy Loman gone to Hollywood.<br/><br/>If you watch the movie closely there's another story going on. This is the story of Ed Wood's growth as a human being. Even as his movie dreams fail, the movie charts his successful -- I repeat, successful -- efforts to form meaningful relationships with people he cares about.<br/><br/>Notice how the movie quietly records Ed's growth in relationships. At the beginning, he's living with Dolores. He doesn't tell her he likes to wear women's clothes. He's a gentle man, and he tries to be caring, but he lies to her and manipulates her in many ways. And their relationship suffers, not because of his lack of talent, but his inability to trust. (Note the superb performance by Sarah Jessica Parker, who makes the potentially grating character of the ""wife who doesn't understand"" into a completely compelling and sympathetic figure.) When Dolores leaves him, Ed has the opportunity to retreat, to become more bitter and manipulative. Instead he learns to be more open and honest. When he meets Cathy, (Patricia Arquette's character,) who is completely innocent and trusting, he knows he can lie to her and start another relationship like the one he had with Dolores. Instead he chooses to tell her the truth right away, literally ""on the first date."" This extraordinary act of courage is in many ways the most compelling moment in the film. And the sweetness of their relationship is a victory many great artists never attain.<br/><br/>The same principle applies to Ed Wood's friendship with Bela Lugosi. On one level, this is indeed supreme pathos -- Lugosi who once made masterpieces is reduced to working for a talentless dreamer. But as men, as opposed to artists, Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi are both redeemed by their special friendship. It becomes very clear that, whatever is failings as an artist, Ed Wood is incapable of failure as a friend. He agonizes over Lugosi's decline and gives everything he has so that the great actor can spend his last days doing what he really loves. The fact that the movies they make together are not great works of art is recorded honestly -- but the emotional value of their friendship is also important. These are two men with nothing who choose to create a family bond, and this too is a great victory.<br/><br/>Watch the scene where Ed Wood is at home with his adoring new girlfriend Cathy and a dying Lugosi calls for help on the phone. It would be so easy to ignore Bela now that Ed has someone new in his life. But Ed Wood is as incapable of cruelty as he is of artistic success. What he is capable of is growth as a person -- a careful study of the picture shows that he is actually a far better man at the end than he was at the beginning. Far from being pessimistic about life, in many ways ED WOOD is an uplifting movie about the values of friendship, trust, and intimacy."

","This movie is interesting and well-made, a fun romp through the less than professional Hollywood lots of the day. Johnny Depp is great as director Ed Wood who comes across as a really nice guy, but devoid of the strength of character or vision needed to be a good director. The subplot is also interesting and even sad since it illustrates how the once-famous Bela Lugosi ended up in the obscurity and poverty all Hollywood stars must surely have nightmares about. Tim Burton's directing is very good, and the end product is quite satisfying."

"lee_eisenberg","10","5","7","26 September 2005"," This was the first R-rated movie that I ever saw in the theater.
","And I'm proud that this was the one that I saw. This story of B-movie director Edward D. Wood, Jr. (the brains behind such camp as ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""), was probably Tim Burton's best movie ever. In the title role, Johnny Depp makes you fall in love with Ed Wood, regardless of how you view transvestitism. What the movie shows is that even though Ed Wood and his cohorts had no talent, they all stuck by each other. Specifically, Wood gave the washed-up - and rather bitter - Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) a job. If anything, I think that ""Ed Wood"" deserved a lot more recognition. At least Landau won an Oscar. Right after I saw this movie, I went out and rented ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". They were lovably moronic."
"MovieAddict2016","9","5","7","16 November 2003"," A film experience unlike any other, which makes it the ultimate nod towards Ed Wood and his films...
","Edward D. Wood, Jr. is the man responsible for such films as ""Glen or Glenda,"" ""Bride of the Monster,"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" to name a few of the films mentioned in ""Ed Wood"" (1994), Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's nod towards the man and his films, which garnered him the official title of the ""Worst Director of All Time.""<br/><br/>Ed Wood was in love with every frame of every film he made, or so this film tells us. He's oblivious to any technical blunders--when his film ""Plan 9"" is being directed, a Baptist preacher mentions that one of the tombstones fell over during the shoot in a fake graveyard, and that the characters on screen arrived at day but now it's night. ""Ever heard of suspension of disbelief?"" Ed asks. He stresses that he's a director and he knows what's best.<br/><br/>In one of the more ironic scenes of the movie, he meets his role model, Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio), in a restaurant. Welles complains about his struggles in filmmaking, and Ed tells him how he relates--of course, Welles has no idea that Ed is a Z-movie director. On some strange level, they are briefly similar. Only in their struggles, however. Welles tells Ed to not give up, to take charge of his picture. It renews Ed's feelings towards his ""Plan 9"" project. He marches back to the set, shouting orders at crewmembers. It's reminiscent of the scenes in all movies where the characters are inspired and suddenly win the day. The sad--and utterly ironic--thing is, as the audience, we know no matter how inspired Ed feels his film is going to bomb. His effort is pointless.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Ed (Depp) and his girlfriend, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), trying to get a movie made in Hollywood. Ed likes women's clothing. A lot. Dolores can't figure out where her angora sweaters keep getting to. Ed loves women--he says by dressing in their clothes it makes him feel closer to them. Err...yeah, right.<br/><br/>Ed struggles to get a film made in Hollywood. He meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) in a coffin shop and they become close friends; this helps Ed's position in Hollywood, too. The unfortunate problem, however, is that Lugosi is a washed-up druggie living by himself in a messy home. He's a wreck. Nobody wants him in a picture.<br/><br/>Nothing stops Ed. He finally gets his big break when a movie producer who is unashamed to admit that he makes `crap' funds Ed's first full-length feature film, `Glen or Glenda."" It's an uncredited parallel of Ed's own life--a tale about a transvestite who is afraid to come out of the closet.<br/><br/>
The fact that Ed Wood has absolutely no directorial talent is established early on when he is rummaging through old stock footage of charging buffalo and octopus. ""Why if I had half a chance, I could make an entire movie using this stock footage. The story opens on these mysterious explosions. Nobody knows what's causing them, but it's upsetting all the buffalo. So, the military are called in to solve the mystery."" Sad.<br/><br/>Ed does, indeed, use the footage of buffalo in the beginning of ""Glen or Glenda,"" for no apparent reason whatsoever. It just appears via a dissolve. Ed is practically thrown out of Hollywood--but yet he makes another film, this time ""Bride of the Atom,"" the title changed to ""Bride of the Monster"" before it is released to the public. It flops, needless to say.<br/><br/>Wood remains the optimist. He cons a Baptist church into funding his newest feature, ""Plan 9 From Outerspace,"" which is often heralded as the pinnacle of really bad movies, along with ""'Manos': The Hands of Fate"" and ""Pod People."" He's a self-assured liar and a thief--he swears to the church that they'll get enough profit from his movie that they'll be able to make as many religious films about apostles as they want. Perhaps, in the end, he wasn't lying after all.<br/><br/>Behind the laughs is a great piece of work. Filmed in a distinctly wacky black and white, and filmed with the same purposeful akwardness of an old Ed Wood movie, Tim Burton has done the unimaginable--he's managed to make a two hour + film about the life of the worst director of all time, and he's also managed to make it quite interesting.<br/><br/>""Ed Wood"" is bizarre, delightful and strange. It's from another world. It's a unique film experience unlike any other. It's got the odd eccentricity of ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the joyful glee of ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" while keeping the gothic look of ""Batman."" All in all, it's a nice little trip.<br/><br/>And ""Ed Wood"" is packed with movie in-jokes. We, as an audience, know the future of Ed Wood's fate--which is why much of it is funny. There's also a great scene during that in which he meets Welles. Ed says, ""Do you know my movies have even been recut after they were finished?"" Welles replies, ""I hate it when that happens."" And that pretty much sums up the film's sense of humor.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"
"jboothmillard","10","6","9","13 July 2005"," Ed Wood
","I have always liked director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) and his films (here he was nominated the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm Award), and this biography showing his love for classic sci-fi films is another terrific example of his distinctive style. We saw him in Edward Scissorhands, and then Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp played director Edward D. Wood. If you have heard of Wood, he considered himself a great director of great films, mostly horror, but in fact he was voted one of the worst film directors of all time. He also had a habit for dressing as a woman, ever since childhood. Anyway, this film basically shows the process of making his ridiculous and utterly awful films, and relationships with people, including his wife (for a while), Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), his new girlfriend Kathy O'Hara (Patricia Arquette), and his favourite actor that he worked with, Dracula's Bela Lugosi (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Martin Landau). Also starring Jeffrey Jones as Criswell, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Welles, Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, Mike Starr as Georgie Weiss, Lisa Marie (Burton's fiancée at the time) as Vampira and Juliet Landau (Martin's daughter) as Loretta King. Landau is fantastic, Depp is funny, and there are some fantastic giggles in this great biographical period comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair, it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Johnny Depp was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor. Outstanding!"

","""Ed Wood"" (1994) is a comedic drama biography about Edward D. Wood and his dream and dedication of becoming a famous director. Ed, played by Johnny Depp, is ambitious, charming, lacking talent in his execution and possesses a quirk that threatens to ruin his relationship. This film is visually sound and fitting in black and white with a few quirks, though I do wonder how it would affect an audience in color. I enjoy an underdog storyline and this film delivered on several fronts. Most specifically the front of a person with a dream in an industry that I wish to see myself one day. I can't say that I was blown away by the film, especially with a two plus hour runtime, but I found it very satisfying.
 
 This film is full of name actors and I truly commend Tim Burton for pulling all their performances together so well. The direction he provided allowed me to forget that I was watching a biography and instead enjoy a story about a man and his journey. It may have been because of these name actors that I felt the acting was superb all the way through. However, I feel the film was a little long and it is difficult to determine where some of the fat could have been trimmed. Overall, I believe this film to be really good even though it is not my ""cup of tea."" I recommend this film to anyone who aspires to make it in Hollywood, especially as a director or producer."
"lesleyharris30","9","2","2","1 March 2018"," Truly Unique, Strangely Captivating,
","Ed Wood is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. You will not find anything else like it, a very unconventional biography that tells a story of a man who never did anything exceptional. Ed Wood was a man who always wanted to make movies, but had absolutely no eye for it, here we get to see the making of some of his infamous classics, and while we will laugh at his work along the way, we also sympathise with this man who just wanted to create, who simply dreamed. It was a perfect vehicle for Burton and Depp, you can feel their manic creativity come to life as they tell this bizarre true life story in an energetic manner, there is no other duo that could have told it more brilliantly. <br/><br/>While I did love and was fascinated with the making of his movies, I would have appreciated a deeper insight in to Wood's personal life. It skips over a lot of important elements, bringing them up but never scoping them fully, particularly in his two love lifes, it would have been interesting to receive more information there. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast is absolutely tremendous and fit in to this weird world brilliantly. Johnny Depp is, of course, the highlight as Wood, he is absolutely mesmerising in the role, shining and completely believable as this person one could so easily have made a caricature out of. Depp is also joined by the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette and Bill Murray, who all manage to be truly convincing, despite the absurdness of their characters. Martin Landau also deserves huge credit, usually playing a straight man, he completely transforms himself as Bela Lugosi, doing something immensely different from what we came to expect from his as an actor. His physicality and transformation is so amazing, I did not even know it was him until I saw his name in the credits, a very well deserved Academy Award win. <br/><br/>Beautifully frantic, never boring. Terrific performances and an immersing story, I would certainly recommend Ed Wood to anyone looking for an interesting true story.<br/><br/>
An ambitious film director struggles to make his visions a reality. <br/><br/>
Best Performance: Johnny Depp"
"oOoBarracuda","9","2","2","21 February 2017"," Ed Wood
","Tim Burton was two strikes deep on my cinematic experience with him. After seeing, and not caring for, Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd, I was ready to give Burton one last chance before writing him off, completely. Good thing I used Ed Wood for his third strike. An engrossing, thoroughly engaging biopic, Ed Wood tells the story of the famously horrible, yet passionate, film director, Edward D. Wood Jr. Edward D. Wood Jr. has famously been named the worst director of all time, responsible for such films as Plan 9 From Outer Space. Somehow, Burton took a genre, known for its tedious approach and formulaic output, and made an interesting film about a largely unexplored figure. Ed Wood, made in 1994 stars Johnny Depp, as most Tim Burton films do, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette. Burton and Depp put in career best output in a film that was clearly close to Burton's heart.<br/><br/>Edward D. Wood Jr (Johnny Depp) is a Hollywood eccentric who enjoys wearing women's clothing and has even admitted to wearing women's undergarments under his uniform when he served in the military. Ed has a passion for 'telling stories"" and wants to follow in the massive footsteps of his idol, Orson Welles. Through extreme passion, Wood is able to carve a place for himself in Hollywood, backed by a loyal crew and accompanied by a star who has dimmed, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). The problem with the story-telling of Ed Wood, is that his dreams are too great for what can reasonably be placed on celluloid, especially given the small budget Wood had to work with. Despite ever gaining any commercial or critical success, Wood held tight to his dream, creating film after film that few audiences ever saw. His personal relationships were important to Wood, always remaining loyal to his friends and loved ones, despite their troubles, as his friends and loved ones remained loyal to him. An interesting life, worthy of delving into for film fans, Ed Wood is a good vehicle with which to begin the journey into Ed Wood Jr.<br/><br/>I love black and white films, I instantly enjoy a film more when I see that it is in black and white. When a film is in black and white that doesn't have to be, I appreciate it all the more. It only makes sense for Ed Wood to be shot in black and white, covering a man who began his work in filmmaking career in the 1950's, but the fact that Burton was able to pull it off in 1994, speaks volumes to his commitment to the project. Burton also used fantastic classic cinema film techniques with the great iris in/pit shots. Burton clearly wanted to make a film that was as period-accurate as he could, and I appreciate his adherence to classic cinema. Burton also used low angle shots to an effective degree, much as he did in Edward Scissorhands, which are always nice to see. After seeing four Johnny Depp films this month, I am nearly certain that I don't care for him as an actor, but he was at a career-best in this film. Burton was also at the top of his game, possibly due to his passion for the project, giving audiences an engaging look into an ignored director largely lost like the films in his career."
"Leofwine_draca","8","2","2","7 July 2016"," Biopic from the heart
","You can't imagine anyone else but Tim Burton making this heartfelt tribute to the man they call ""the worst director of all time"". It's a great film, deftly tying tragedy, romance, comedy and drama into what has to be one of the best biopics ever made. Burton successfully recreates what it may have been like to be Edward D. Wood, Jr. and also accurately portrays what the '50s may have been like for a low-budget movie maker. Many of the scenes are intentionally funny because of the things that happen to Wood and his pals and because of his sheer audacity as a film-maker, and it's not often that I get a genuine smile on my face while watching a film like this.<br/><br/>The acting is of the highest order, especially from Johnny Depp with another character he makes his own. Martin Landau puts in a superb performance as Bela Lugosi, with the help of some realistic makeup effects from Rick Baker, and deservedly won a best supporting actor Oscar for his turn. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are the long-suffering girlfriends; Bill Murray excels as a camp friend who wants to have sex-change operation; Lisa Marie is the spitting image of Vampira; Jeffrey Jones is hilarious as Criswell and everybody else puts in a spirited turn.<br/><br/>Of Wood's films, I've only seen PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE at the moment, yet Burton's portrayal of the making of the film comes very close to what actually happens in the film; I'm sure the same can be said for his on-set recreations of GLEN OR GLENDA and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER. Filming it in black and white was a touch of genius as well. ED WOOD is a film for Burton fans; Depp fans; Wood fans; fans of movie-making; '50s cinema; anybody with an interest in the movies and who knows who Wood was. A moving and amusing tale of blood, sweat and tears and one man's dream versus a harsh reality."

Between biographical and fantasy, a great mixture that rings coherently. Very good Tim Burton."
"dougdoepke","Null","2","2","14 December 2015"," How Ironic!
","Two hours and I didn't get up once. Of course, I've laughed along with thousands of others at Wood's totally inept productions, except I'd never gotten around to catching this flick. No doubt this is the best movie Wood's name has ever attached to. Depp's likable never-say-die buoyancy carries the benighted Wood from one fiasco to the next. If sheer drive converted into talent, Wood would replace his idol Orson Welles as cinema's top dog. But then reality is no problem if you just ignore it. I love that near riot scene at the premiere of Bride of the Gorilla. Does that dampen Wood's artistic confidence—not a whit. In my book, Depp deserved the Oscar, hands down.<br/><br/>Speaking of Oscars, Landau too deserved one. His resemblance to the real Lugosi is uncanny. Plus, he manages the touching moments of a has-been monster in really poignant fashion. And get a load of Vampira (Lisa Marie). I wanted to snuggle up and run at the same time. <br/><br/>What the movie does in spades is show the fringes of the Hollywood glamor factory, with its many colorful characters. I especially like Wood's run-ins with the tyrannical schlock-meister who insists he only does ""crap"". Sounds like real behind-the-scenes candor. At the same time, the movie doesn't include Wood's seamy battle with alcohol or the rat-traps he was reduced to living in. The narrative's really about his professional career rather than his personal life.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the two-hours remain a highly entertaining look at an amazing personality, who never took ""no"" for an answer. And, oh yes, there's the movie's big irony—Edward D. Wood Jr. did become famous, after all."
"Hitchcoc","9","2","2","7 August 2015"," Eternal Optimism
","I just never got around to seeing this. It was worth the wait. Ed Wood was one of the most optimistic beings ever to set foot on this earth. He had a love for life and a spirit that, unfortunately, greatly outpaced his talent. One thing to remember is that money always influences art. Some of the shortcomings of his films had to do with extra takes costing money. Film has never been cheap. But this need to be efficient and timely, also led us to some of the most memorable (though bad) footage in film history. The fact is that he ""did"" get the films made. He did have a family of actors that stood by him. He did eventually find someone to accept his being a transvestite. I don't think ""worst director ever"" is quite fair because those guys never got a film made, let alone any for major release. <br/><br/>Then there is his relationship with the morphine riddled Bela Lugosi who becomes dependent on him. Wood gave graciously, looked out for the sad old man, and brought him ""back to life."" Martin Landau's performance is outstanding as the classic horror star, living with regrets and what ifs. <br/><br/>Tim Burton pulls this off beautifully, giving his film the cheap appearance of Wood's films. Depp is charming as the ever positive Wood, always making lemonade when life threw him a new lemon. Excellent film."

"jzappa","10","2","2","26 January 2014"," You Can't Help but Root for the Underdog
","When Tim Burton makes a movie about Ed Wood, one assumes it would be some sort of an ostentatious lampoon, as in Mars Attacks for instance. Wrong. Ed Wood is either a stroke of luck for Tim Burton in regards to acquiring great material it's kismet for him to helm, or what I truly suspect, which is that it's a deeply personal and knowing labor of true, joyous passionate love and mature, careful craftsmanship.<br/><br/>Whether or not the movie is totally accurate as a biopic doesn't matter. It's about more than just an account of Ed Wood's life. It's about a passionate young storyteller breaks down doors, bares his soul, deals with merciless criticism, estranges relationships and fights the system only to prove himself an infamous hack and laughing stock. He was eccentric, relentless, even a little delusional maybe, but he could've been anyone.<br/><br/>This is the film I would argue proved Johnny Depp as an established, certified great actor. He captures all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood surviving, owing to a hilarious capacity for seeing the silver lining in the blackest cloud. The script imagines him as a model American dreamer, an idealistic underdog with little to be so hopeful about, since he was also a model American failure.<br/><br/>Something people forget is that Sarah Jessica Parker is a good actress. Something people take for granted, though, after the millennial works of Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola and Jim Jarmusch, is this early example of colorful departure casting by Bill Murray. But the stand-out is the landslide hallmark of Martin Landau's long career, totally disappearing into a darkly hilarious rendition of Bela Lugosi.<br/><br/>It's not just Landau's amazing performance that makes him stand out though. Really, at the core of the movie is Wood's friendship with Lugosi, who he genuinely loves, and who comes to depend on him. We see Lugosi alone and withdrawn in a tacky little house, settled in the hollow melancholy of his faded glory and addiction. His first scene is an exquisitely crafted gag showing him trying on a coffin for size. And Wood is able to relieve the despair, if just fleetingly, in a last-minute streak of roles which gave him amplified renown, as the star of some of the most legendary and respected horror classics ever made, and then of some of the most infamous and derided."

","Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is an underling at a Hollywood studio in the fifties. But, of course, he wants to direct his own films when he can get his hands on the money. One day, Ed is passing a coffin shop when he actually meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whose prime has vanished, due in part to the former vampire's drug use. Nevertheless, Mr. Wood is thrilled and arranges to meet with Lugosi again. Ed's live-in gal, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) is not impressed, she would rather he have met Robert Taylor. Not long after this, Mr. Wood, who presents himself well in interviews, does secure funding from a D-list movie producer. While before its time, Glen or Glenda turns out to be a giant bomb. One reason is Ed's too rapid and careless direction and another is its subject matter, cross-dressing. But, even after a severe tongue lashing from the producer, Ed is not discouraged. He finds the money for his new production, Bride of the Atom, from a naive starlet who wants a starring role. This sets Dolores off, for she was promised the role, and she breaks off their relationship. Since Lugosi is the star, the film has more merit than G or G but not much. Lugosi, too, checks into a detox center where he manages to get off the needles. Mr. Wood meets a lovely lady there, Kathy (Patricia Arquette) who becomes his new love. Still, Ed goes on talking his talk, convincing a group of Baptists to fund another science fiction film, which will provide money for their future religious endeavors. Suddenly, Lugosi passes away. There are other huge production problems. Will Ed complete his masterpiece, Plan 9 from Outer Space? This summary of mine does not sufficiently portray this fantastic film about the real director, Ed Wood. It is rip-roaring funny and the cast is superlative. Depp, yes, is great as the title character but Landau is terrific and won an Academy Award. Parker, Arquette, Bill Murray, J.D. Spradlin, Jeffrey Jones, Tina Marie and all of the others are very fine, too. Shot in black and white, as Wood's films were, its presentation is likewise wonderful, with great art direction, sets, and costumes. One must also applaud Burton's visionary direction. Don't settle for tame entertainment tonight. Get Ed Wood and walk on the wild and wacky side!"

People who have seen the director's films will probably enjoy the recreations of classic scenes (including the fantastic ""pull the string"" segment).<br/><br/>All in all, it's a charming and often very funny biopic, with a suitably campy performance from Johnny Depp and an excellent performance from Martin Landau as the ageing Bela Lugosi."

","This is an interesting movie... The plot has to do with the real life of Ed Wood, a wanna-be director of b-movies and the people in his life. I found a parallel with ""All about my mother"" from Almodovar with the scene of Ed's (or should I say Eda's) dance. In the film from Almodovar it was Segrado's speech - here it was a dance. Both seemed to me very profound messages going something like - ""It is OK to have monsters""...<br/><br/>I think that this movie would benefit greatly from a greater engagement of emotions since these where usually playing in sotto voce...! I think the relationship of Bela and Ed could be more developed and so could relationships in general.<br/><br/>I feel that Tim Burton's work (here and in nearly all of his movies) has to do with coming in terms with monsters within - these may or usually may not be as frightening as before approaching them... As such I am really interested in watching all of his movies!"

","Having seen Ed Wood on VHS last night, and Orgy of the Dead last week, I feel like I came to understand Ed Wood, Jr. Well, somewhat, anyway. Wood might be categorized, if that is the proper term, under ""American Originals."" To me, Johnny Depp's portrayal was especially interesting also because everyone has a biography, his story, or history. Or, if you will, her-story. I very much liked this movie.<br/><br/>I remember seeing both Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre in 1964 when they were publicizing The Comedy of Terrors. More or less AWOL from my job at the US Post Office that day, I've mostly forgotten about that job but who could ever forget Karloff and Lorre??? <br/><br/>The 1968 movie Targets, directed by Peter Bogdonovich and one of Karloff's last films, reminded me a little of Ed Wood."

","At these stakes it was four in the morning and energy was running out. Gian was falling asleep, one of the reasons why he wasn't paying that much attention; he had had some tough days. On the other hand, I was tired too, but with the disposition to watch Depp's magic.<br/><br/>Quickly, Depp it's not the best element of the film, but achieves an uplifting performance, with smiles of his own and respect to his director, who directed him some time before in one of his career's best performances, as another Ed; in the fantastic ""Edward Scissorhands"".<br/><br/>It is Martin Landau's show however, who studied his character to the end of the line, just to play it perfectly. It's hard that the movie gets laughs because of its fidelity with its characters' reality, but in short amount of time we understand that it was like that. We understand that Ed Wood was an awful director, writer, producer and actor, when he admired Orson Welles and wanted to be like him.<br/><br/>Bela Lugosi was Wood's friend indeed, and worked as a star in the horrible films this movie shows. The people that worked with him (with Ed), a bunch of useless;the well known, the show business persons: they were all real. And Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski don't have to write about it, so it's like that how we can laugh.<br/><br/>Tim Burton, at that moment of his career, known as Gotham City's ""creator"", and a gifted man with the camera, was surely the right man for this job. He brought the correct cast, the correct crew (without Danny Elfman, who was replaced by Howard Shore's unfamiliar score) and I can't imagine the film in other hands. It wouldn't even be that good.<br/><br/>Although the opening credits showed the director's ego at that time, due to the exclusion (in the credits) of actors that were important because of their characters, replacing them for important name that appear less than a minute in the film. Beside all this, when you see a Tim Burton piece, you know you won't be disappointed visually. It's amazing; even in black and white."

They did an excellent job at recreating the sets and matching the dialog. I'd say that this film was arguably Tim Burton's best. ""Big Fish"" was good, but it didn't have the Tim Burton style. ""Edward Siccorhands"" had a little too much Tim Burton style, but that didn't detract from the film at all. I guess it's all just a matter of opinion.

"ssm-10","10","2","2","12 March 2005"," 'Cut, perfect!'
","'Ed Wood' is definitely Burtons most personal, and perhaps best film. A labour of love for him, as a huge fan of the real Ed Wood, Burton set out to make a film that acted as many things at once; a biopic, a romance (not in the most likely fashion and in more than one way), a comedy and a drama. He succeeded on all counts.<br/><br/>'Ed Wood' tells the story of the man who was voted officially to be the 'worst director of all time'. Johnny Depp gives a career defining, painstakingly accurate and sympathetic performance in the title role, taking the audience with him as he goes from one film to another. Starting with 'Glenn or Glenda?' (Wood's first film), followed by horror 'Bride of the Atom', then through to the fantastically inept, most famous 'bad movie' ever; 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. All the way through remaining enthusiastically optimistic, upbeat, and indefatigable.<br/><br/>The film is technically efficient also, though the by far the best and most memorable aspect of the film is the performances. Depp's may be excellent, but it is the Oscar winning Martin Landau as the now down and out former horror star Bela Lugosi who steals the show; presenting a complex, yet accessible character study. Landau conveys both spirited humour and tragic regret perfectly. His friendship with Depp's Wood is both touching and also often depressingly dependant. Wood's documented transvestism is handled in a way that stops it being in the least bit odd or unusual, and simply deepens your relationship and sympathy for Wood, already an endearing character.<br/><br/>The photography is superior also, and the choice to film in black and white was both commendable and extremely brave in relation to expected audience response. To question whether or not it would have been any different if in colour is both unnecessary and missing the point entirely.<br/><br/>'Artistic license' is often used in films such as this to a great degree. 'Ed Wood', however, stays very faithful to the facts, altering only minor details, yet in doing so also forms a much better rounded and amiable story. <br/><br/>Filled with many memorable scenes, not least of which being Wood's incidental meeting with Orson Welles in a bar (a brief but astonishingly accurate portrayal by Vincent D'Onofrio), a first class screenplay, and performances to which may be the standout's of both Depp and Landau's career. <br/><br/>Ed Wood is perhaps the perfect example of a biopic, as well as a very accomplished drama/comedy/romance. If you have never seen it, see it now."

The movie displays , with great charm and heart, the missing attributes from ED's films, that he had in life. The story centers on the friendship, between Ed Wood, and the legendary actor , Bela Lugosi, and what a ride it is. Scene after scene takes us through the revolving doors of show business, and the endless steps to produce and\or direct a movie. A terrific script by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, elevated by the performances of Bela Lugosi(Martin Landau), Ed Wood Jr.(Johnny Depp), Bunny Breckinridge(Bill Murray) , Dolores Fuller(Sarah Jessica Parker),and lovingly directed by Tim Burton, all worthy of Academy nominations. A True American Classic.<br/><br/>Trivia, one of life's ironies is near the end of the movie when the conversation between Orson Welles telling Ed Wood of his difficulty to finance a movie of Don Quixote.

Ed is a transvestite, a hidden fetish since childhood.

The movie flops and Ed is stuck again.

Though Ed charms everyone to follow him so blindly, while he is walking blind himself; the blind leading the blind. It's hard not to see why Ed Wood became the worst director of time, never taking second takes; no matter how bad the first one was.<br/><br/>Tim Burton, a brilliant visual director, uses the monochromatic black and white film to excellent measure. Using classic shot and camera angles, Burton gives homage to the noir 50's cinema. Johnny Deep is an absolute knock out as Wood. He encapsulates that hubris nature of Wood so perfect, and the charm he uses to pull everyone along. Martin Landau is stellar as Bela Lugosi. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette as Wood's two loves are both amazing. Bill Murray is glamorously flamboyant, he steals the show every time he's on screen.<br/><br/>Ed Wood is an amazing film, looking at the starting point on one of film histories worst directors."

This film introduces us to Ed Wood and his many friends, most of them actors and people in the movie business, and his love of dressing up in women's clothing. (This film's humor is often tongue-in-cheek and even witty in places, but it's also sad - and certainly not a comedy.)

"shadock-2","7","3","4","18 February 2001"," Lovely little movie
","It is strange that director with the obvious talents of Tim Burton would chose to make a film about the worst filmmaker who ever lived.  However, in light of recent research about the inability of the incompetent to know they are incompetent, it seems to be a clear case study of just such a person.<br/><br/>That being said, despite the fact the film didn't make any money (despite costing next to nothing to make), the film is well put together and compelling in its own way.  Moreover, considering the budget of Burton's previous movies (Batman, Batman Returns) and the weaknesses of the subsequent one (Mars Attacks), this one stands up with his better work. Burton seems to cast by random chance (Michael Keaton as Batman!), but instead he seems to know exactly what an actor is capable of.  Johnny Depp as Wood is allowed to be the only one who is allowed to be in on the joke, yet ironically he is the only character who can't see the folly of his ways. He brings a passion to Wood that isn't there in real life (check out Wood's own performance in Glen or Glenda), but his passion for his work brings us sympathy as he goes from botched production to botched production.<br/><br/>Martin Landau also seems miscast as Bela Lugosi (the real Lugosi would have appeared to be a midget against the much taller Landau), but like Lugosi's stand-in in ""Plan 9"", he too manages to walk the fine line between passion and overacting.<br/><br/>Thus while Wood fails as a director, he succeeds as a human being.  He may have made the world's worst films, but at least he made a modest living doing what he enjoyed doing and lived out his dream."
"david-345","7","3","4","16 February 2000"," A good film that should have great
","Ed Wood should have hit a home run but it didn't. It should have been so much better but it wasn't. That's not to say that ED Wood is a poor film, far from it but with a little better casting, it would have been near perfect. As it stands, the performances (and I use the term loosely) of Johnny Depp and Sarah Jessica Parker nearly ruin all that the film achieves. But let's look at the good. It was a very, very long time ago that someone who won an Oscar truly deserved it. Martin Landau deserved his Oscar for his incredible turn as Bela Lugosi. He was simply not playing a role in a film, he ""was"" Bela Lugosi. There are times that the makeup, cinematography and Landau's performance make you forget that that you are seeing Martin Landau. You are seeing him literally become the late horror star. Its one of the most remarkable feats in recent cinema history and truly deserving of the praise. It's an understatement to say Landau steals the film, he literally picks it up and carries it away with him. There is another stellar performance in the film, that of Patricia Arquete as Kathy. It's a warm, understated performance that was as deserving of an Oscar nomination as Landau's. Bill Murray is an always welcome presence and the casting of Jeffrey Jones as Criswell is pure brilliance. Those two always give their best no matter what film they appear in. Director Burton deserves much credit for his brave stance of filming the picture in Black and White, it simply would not have worked in color. Regretably, this descision is probably what killed the film at the box office but Burton truly showed he knew what he was doing. This is a movie that begged to shot that way and Burton delivered. Burton must also be given a major thumbs up for packing the movie with Ed Wood's real life hangers on in cameo roles as well as casting wrestling promoter Gene LaBell and exotic pianist Korla Pandit in small but noticeable parts. And lets' face it, who else could have played Tor Johnson but George Steele?<br/><br/>All in all the film would rank a solid 10 if it wasn't for the participation of Depp and Parker. Why is Tim Burton so enamored with this Johnny Depp? He has proven time and time again that he simply cannot act and in Ed Wood, he cannot act with a vengeance. Watch for his scenes near the end, instead of projecting wide eyed wonder as was called for, he projects the image of a madman about to go on a killing spree. A truly poor performance that almost ruins the film. Nearly as bad is Sarah Jessica Parker. Some see her as a very talented actress. I see her as a scenery chewing hack who is a major eye sore. And we can't forget that Burton's girlfriend Lisa Marie plays Vampira. A note to perspective and veteran directors, do not, under any circumstance cast your girlfriends in your movies. Marie is laughably bad. Martin Landau's fetching daughter, Juliet (who plays Loretta King) would have been a far more inspired choice for the role.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Ed Wood is a good film but with some better casting in two of it's major roles, it could have been so much better. Still if you are a fan of the cross dressing director, you need to see this film. It certainly wasn't deserving of it's poor box office run Johnny Depp or not."

Both are extremely moving and adept at showing the respect and regard they had for each other when their world seemed to be falling apart. The story doesn't flinch in showing Lugosi's fall from grace with his addiction to morphine and other drugs that eventually took his life.<br/><br/>A near perfect recreation of the '50s Hollywood scene with its low budget studio settings, wisely photographed in the B&W manner of most of the Lugosi thrillers.

","Director Tim Burton's comedy-drama about 1950s Grade-Z filmmaker Ed Wood is imbued with nostalgic heart and soul. Burton has always shown genuine feeling for outcasts and eccentrics: their passions make them outcasts--and the fact they don't realize it make them eccentrics. The pack of loonies following Edward D. Wood, Jr. around Hollywood aren't sycophants, they're his family. They're also a very funny, colorful bunch. The picture, shot in gloriously flat black-and-white (which matches the times, and mirrors the films of Ed Wood), has an episodic structure but wonderfully smart, canny dialogue from screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, adapting Rudolph Grey's book ""Nightmare of Ecstasy"". We clearly see what draws people to Ed Wood: he was a used car-salesman for the movies. Johnny Depp is excellent in the lead, most especially in his scenes with an unrecognizable Martin Landau in an Oscar-winning turn as a drug-addicted Bela Lugosi. When Ed is told Lugosi's health insurance has expired and he must leave the hospital, it's an extremely poignant moment that touches on a lot more than just a hack moviemaker struggling to keep his main ""star"" going. Burton is very effective at introducing us to a whole troupe of people we might normally recoil from, and he's sympathetic enough not to poke fun at anybody. There are weaknesses: some details are skimmed over and some sequences fail to take off. We see an awful lot on the making of ""Bride of the Atom"", but its raucous premiere is too easy a way to explain the public's reaction (was it given a general release? was Ed Wood able to make any money from it?). The large, perfectly-assembled cast seems right at home in these surroundings; if the performances are a little over-the-top, that's all right because Burton's perception of Ed Wood may be the same as ours: the man made silly movies, and he was a cross-dresser, but he was extremely passionate about both! Burton isn't afraid to get giddy over Ed's notoriously awful cinematic output. His film is a winner! ***1/2 from ****"

","Ed Wood (1994) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Burton's masterpiece is a loving tribute to ""B"" monster movie maker Edward D. Wood, Jr. played perfectly by Johnny Depp. The film covers Ed's life up to the release of Plan 9 From Outer Space but the true heart of the movie centers on Wood's relationship with a washed up Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). To me this is perhaps the greatest film about the making of movies because of how it shows the ups and downs even though the majority of Wood's life were full of downs. The movie is about a lot of things and includes many great jabs at Hollywood but the true brilliance of the film is in its relationship between Wood and Lugosi. This here is where the movie really jumps off the screen because the love story between these two struggling men is where the heart is at and it's these scenes that are going to make the movie last for a very long time. The beautiful B&W cinematography also stands out and Burton has no trouble at building up a realistic setting. I know Burton will always be best known for his big budget action pictures but there's no question this here is his greatest work. The amount of time and detail in every shot jumps off the screen for various reasons but one is the performance from Depp. The way Depp brings Wood to life is something incredible to watch as his always joyful personality jumps out at the viewer and grabs ahold of them making him impossible not to love. As great as Depp is though the film still belongs to Landau who rightfully won an Oscar for his role as Bela Lugosi. Having seen nearly every Lugosi film available, I'm still shocked at how well Landau does him to this day. After numerous viewings of this film I still can't believe at how well Landau got his accent as well as certain gestures and moves. Depp and Landau together make for one of the most beloved duos in film history. Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey JOnes, Vincent D'Onofrio, Juliet Landau and Bill Murray all turns in strong supporting performances as well. Mike Starr, as producer Georgie Weiss, also sticks out in a great comedic performance. I can't think of too many film's that contain a bigger heart than this one. Not only showing the love between Wood and Lugosi but also being able to show respect and love for this type of movie. Burton was a big fan of these ""B"" and ""C"" movies so it was nice seeing him pay them respect and this really comes true when the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space where the cast and director get cheers for what joy they've brought many fans."

In real life Ed Wood was little more than an alchoholic and pornographer. If anyone out there thinks I am being too hard on Eddie that's too bad cause these are the facts. It should be a crime to take someones life and rewrite it for ""entertainment"" purposes."

","I'm not sure how come I missed seeing this until now - I've been intrigued by Ed Wood since the Medveds' books were first published, I like Johnny Depp, and I usually like Tim Burton's movies (on first viewings, at any rate). Anyway, I've seen it now.<br/><br/>It's a relatively straightforward recounting of the events in the 5 years or so from the point where Wood met Bela Lugosi to the point where Lugosi died. Of course, it just so happens that all Wood's highest profile movies had Lugosi in them, so they are all included.<br/><br/>The reconstructions are pretty accurate, and the casting is spot on. Martin Landau, in his Oscar-winning performance as Lugosi is excellent - old, frail, sensitive and cranky, and clearly the most talented individual in Wood's entire set-up.<br/><br/>In fact, the only performance I can criticise is Depp's - his relentless cheerfulness and confidence in the face of setback after setback becomes a little one-note after a while, which makes it slightly more difficult to care than it should be. Did this man really never comprehend how truly bad his films were? Conversely, the filmmakers clearly convey the respect in which they hold Ed Wood - he undoubtedly had a passion for film and, despite having no discernible talent as a filmmaker, he managed to get a number of feature films onto the silver screen, and the fact that none of them was very good does not diminish that achievement one bit."

"tfrizzell","Null","2","3","28 June 2000"," Tim Burton's Most Personal Film
","""Ed Wood"" is a film, shot entirely in black and white, about the infamous film director who is frequently credited as being the worst director ever. Of course the film is quirky and funny, but also very serious and dramatic in some areas.  The film takes place in the 1950s when Wood is trying to make his name in Hollywood by comparing himself to Orson Welles (both being writers-producers-directors).  The fact that they have the same career is about the only real similarity.  Wood is trying to make it big and enlists the help of the aged, washed-up Bela Lugosi (played to the paramount by Oscar-winning Martin Landau).  In spite of the failures Lugosi stays behind Wood and they develop a very close friendship.  Wood's strangeness is depicted in the fact that he rarely takes more than one take on a scene, regardless of what happens during that scene.  He is also odd because he likes to dress in women's clothes.  In a funny yet sad scene near the end Wood declares that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" will be the film that he is remembered for.  He is right.  However, it is an awful film from a man who may have been too ambitious to make it in Hollywood.  In many respects, ""Ed Wood"" is a modern day masterpiece, a poor man's ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Raging Bull"".  All deal with men who want to be great but always seem to miss the mark somehow.  Tim Burton's direction is gloomy and you can see how much he feels for this man who never accomplished his goals in the cinema.  The screenplay is sharp and Johnny Depp is unforgettable in the title role.  The supporting cast is also a real joy to behold.  Patricia Arquette, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffrey Jones, and Bill Murray all add great elements of comedy and drama to this fine motion picture.  4.5 out of 5 stars."
"audrablum","10","1","1","30 September 2018"," Under appreciated movie, unnoticed film history
","This week I watched the bio-dramedy Ed Wood (1994). In this film, Johnny Depp portrays a botanist gone director. Through a wild and crazy series of ups and downs, hard work and luck, Ed learns the movie business. This was nothing like previous Tim Burton movies as the movie was comedic and biographical. I really enjoyed seeing Johnny Depp in this role. I felt like his acting really had the opportunity to shine in a new way. The story was entertaining and engaging. I went into the film not knowing much about it and was saddened to learn that this was based on the real life story of director Ed Wood posthumously named ""worst director in the world."" I felt like this was a very low blow on Hollywood's part. No one, in my opinion, deserves that title and it is especially low to assign that title to someone after they have departed this world. This movie was a professional work and as such it had very high production values. I thought that Martin Landau played a stellar Bela Lugosi and Vincent D'Onofrio was a convincing Orson Welles. I thought the casting was exceptional as most of the stars looked like the parts they were playing and in D'Onofrio's case even sounded as convincing. I really liked the black and white touch that this movie was given. It really pulled the viewer back into an earlier era of the movie business and the editing and shot style imitated films from those days. As the movie came to a close I found myself wanting more movies of Ed's life. I wanted a part two. All in all, I enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch this again."

","Ed Wood is Tim Burton's second best film in my mind. For me, Edward Scissorhands would still take the cake for first place-you just can't beat mystical and magical- but despite that being the case, Ed Wood I'd arguably say, is Burton's most masterfully directed and written film yet. <br/><br/>This is the original Disaster Artist, just with more heart and gusto-not tryna' diss on The Disaster Artist, I'm just trying to make a comparison cause I'm too lethargic to explain the overarching synopsis of Ed Wood. This film, even from scene 1, is down-right engaging, enticing you into defensibly the most allusive true story about a Hollywood star. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is at his absolute prime when portraying Ed Wood. Sitting on it, this might be his most gifted performance of his entire career-it's a very underrated one indeed. It may not necessarily be Depp's most iconic role-I'm sure all you Pirates fans would reward that trophy to Jack Sparrow-but it's certainly his most driving. All the minor gestures and gimmicks he squeezes into this character makes his believability all the better. And when you mix Wood's character with Martin Landau's Oscar-Winning and furthermore, calamitously tragic performance as Bela Lugosi-which was in fact, 100% well-deseved of that Academy Award-you have yourselves one of the most compelling duo themes present in a based-on-a-true-story film. <br/><br/>Ed Wood may be Tim Burton's least Tim Burtony film, but it's at the cost of creating one of his most prolific and momentous masterpieces. Ed Wood is the utmost curious retelling of a man in seek of his aspirations and obsessions. You know you've accomplished something ravishing when your viewer-that being this dork, me-doesn't want it to end even after its over 2-hour runtime. I could fancy a couple more additional hours of this cinematic treasure any day. (Verdict: A)"

","Ed Wood was the worst director of all time, but you must admit, his love for film was unbounded, and that counts for a lot. I sometimes think that some directors today are missing the affection that Wood showed, and are quite willing to put out something that may not be as bad as e.g. Plan 9, but is certainly in cases unwatchable, as though they don't particularly care about the product that they have unleashed upon us. Ed Wood believed in the films he released, and loved everything about the business.

Johnny Depp plays Wood with a cock-eyed optimism, and that positive spirit is what brings out the humor in his many failures. That, and a zest for angora sweaters.<br/><br/>It's a modest movie, even with such a strong cast (particularly Martin Landau) and I love that it's uncharacteristic of Tim Burton.

"ThomasDrufke","8","1","1","8 September 2016"," It's All About the Big Picture
","Leave it to Tim Burton to direct a film about the ""wackiest"" filmmaker of all time. But in all seriousness, Ed Wood may very well be the best directing job of Burton's career. It's funny, strange, and rapidly paced. Burton deserves credit.<br/><br/>I really love when movies take place within the world of filmmaking, especially during the 1950's. It was just an interesting time to be involved in the film business. Perhaps nobody more interesting than Edward D. Wood Jr. Although apparently much of the film's details were made up for the movie itself, it's hard not to get a kick out of Wood's story. A man stumbles himself into Hollywood with little to no experience, and manages to garner decent budgets to make multiple films, that's Hollywood 101.<br/><br/>One of Burton's greatest qualities is the ability to develop a great journey for the characters. Ed Wood has a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it's the stuff along the way that makes for the most entertainment. The sheer absurdity of Wood's story is really where Burton tends to bring out his best work. Watching a man without any real talent as a filmmaker plow his way through studio executives and convince actors to join him in his quest makes it all the more amazing. I mean come on, this guy compares himself to Citizen Kane on multiple occasions.<br/><br/>As for the performances, there's almost too many good ones to mention. Johnny Depp, in his second Burton feature, begins to show exactly why he's one of this generation's greatest talents. He easily could have been nominated for an Oscar here. It's also the first real time he played such a uniquely strange character, something he's got himself stuck into doing these days. Martin Landau, who did win an Oscar for his turn as Bela Lugosi, is what makes this film work so well. It can get tiresome watching Wood's undeserved success, but Landau works so impeccably well as a drugged up Lugosi. I couldn't have imagined someone better in that role.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast and crew also deserve credit, mostly for succeeding in making such a strangely delicious film. After a while, you begin to go along with the joke of Wood's career. And to look up and see that there's still plenty that isn't falsified makes it all the better.<br/><br/>+Unique characters and story<br/><br/>+Movie about movies<br/><br/>+Burton's tight directing<br/><br/>8.0/10"

For Wood, you feel sorry for him because the audience knows that each of his films will be considered the worst. However, the acting of the whole cast allows the audience to remain in their seats and hope that a miracle can happen. As an audience, you wish that for only once, one of Wood's films can turn out to be a success. During the scene of the premiere of his film ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" is the only moment where the audience can feel some relief as Wood can be seeing that he has accomplished his vision. Unfortunately, we know what the outcome will be.<br/><br/>This drama film is strongly well made that you want every single character to triumph. The acting is brilliant and genuine that you feel what each character is going through. Ed Wood is very optimistic and has high hopes that every film that he makes will be a success. <br/><br/>Martin Landau, who perfectly brings Bela Lugosi back to life, steals the show as his character makes the audience to feel his pain, loneliness, loss of fame and bankruptcy.

I like how Burton directs and Johnny Depp portrays how passionate and driven Ed Wood is about movie-making even though he wastes people's money and people think his movies are terrible and most people hate his style of directing and don't approve of his lifestyle like his transvestism. But I like how they focus on the story of how he made movies like ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".

","First things first: this might be short thanks to the computer problems that I'm having. For what it's worth, I will say that it is humbling to have your life dictated by some machine. We have freed ourselves from many of Mother Nature's restrictions, but in their place, we have built ourselves gods of steel and microchips. I wonder if that's an improvement.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a person with (hopefully) more talent than the real Ed Wood, I hereby present this review of this cult classic by Tim Burton. Burton is a strange director for me; while I like most of his films, I do not absolutely love any. Some of you might think this has something to do with my not liking his style, but in fact that is my favorite thing about him. I like Batman Returns over Batman for specifically that reason; they gave him freer rain in the former, and he used it to carve out his own unique style. The closest thing he has to a great film in my book, Edward Scissorhands, is also the most flush with his handiwork.<br/><br/>If you are like me, and you love his style, make sure to check out this one. Despite being an ostensibly 'real world' movie, no one else could have made this movie. Perhaps no one else could have even made an Ed Wood film, or at least a good one; Burton, for whatever he may lack in pure cinematic skill, he more than makes up for in his ability to portray the complexities of dark and twisted, but well-meaning men.<br/><br/>This film flopped at the box office, and predictably so; people are used to the creepy reveries of Burton, but this is a whole different sort of weird and bizarre: a realer, more disturbing sort. And from a pure financial sense, who on the planet wants to see the guy who made Beetlejuice and Batman direct a film about an infamously bad director? Seriously; no one, kid or adult, male or female, who is not a serious film-goer or Burtonite, would ever go see this on their free time. Thankfully, it spread over time and now has gotten the cult love it deserves, the cult love it was perhaps always destined for.<br/><br/>I am perhaps more intrigued by this film than I am a fan of it. I feel more down-the-rabbit-hole here than I ever did watching Burton's mediocre adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. Ed Wood seems like the sort of man who I would eavesdrop on while pretending to listen to music, so interesting is his weird life. Despite the face that his flaws are evident, you can't help but like him. Depp (not yet a frequent Burton collaborator) portrays him as a man with no talent but a lot of heart, who kept going towards his vision no matter what the system or the world or reality seemed to shove in his face. As a writer, I can't say that this didn't have an impact on me, this dedication towards your dreams for as long as you may live. He is by no means a figure to be looked up to, but he is a figure to be respected.<br/><br/>The intro, where you are introduced to the film by a B-movie monster, is campily spectacular and sets the tone for the film. Now, if only it had done more to live up to that tone in the first third, which is slow and a bit limp. The other two thirds are better, but the film does fade sometimes, specifically during the filming sections. Ed is more of an interesting person than he ever was as a lousy filmmaker. And there are parts that are a little mish-mashed: some of the sections have too much dialogue, others too little.<br/><br/>But through these flaws, it keeps you intrigued. I picture a younger version of myself turning the pages in a giant Gothic storybook, wanting to know what's next. The performances are stellar. Howard Shore's score is not LOTR-caliber, but it is sneakily ambient. And Burton, like Ed, made sure to do it his way."

","A big hearted, quick-tempo biopic with as many personality quirks and oddly-charming eccentricities as the subject himself. Ed Wood, widely regarded as the king of the pointless, meaningless, hacked-together nonsense picture (aka the worst director who ever lived), is both blessed and cursed to not comprehend the depths of his own awfulness. Forward he endlessly marches, procuring has-been celebrities and clueless investors through sheer force of will and personality, all in the quest to become the next Orson Welles. Which, of course, is like buying a can of bug spray and expecting it to serve as a dessert topping.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is a great, big, overinflated bag of optimistic energy in the title role, half carnival barker and half renaissance man, but he's overshadowed by a heartbreaking turn from Martin Landau as a struggling, drug-addicted, late-life Bela Lugosi who somehow gets wrapped up in Wood's little world. Landau won a surprising Best Supporting Actor award for this take, well-deserved as he projects all manner of emotion to an unsuspecting audience and towers over every scene in which he appears. Bill Murray is also fabulous in a very small, nearly-pointless role, which surely deserved further exploration. Alas, at just over two hours, there wasn't time to get to everything.<br/><br/>One of Tim Burton's best, most restrained films, bubbling and churning with his own brand of black, twisted humor, but also much more controlled and traditional than his more definitive films (say, Beetlejuice or The Nightmare Before Christmas). Energetic, entertaining, funny and poignant and tolerant, it touches a whole lot of emotions with impressive delicacy, and its deep ruminations on acceptance remain particularly relevant in a modern setting."

","I already knew much about the man, having seen Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Bride of the Monster, albeit on MST3K. Back then, I was fascinated by these terrible movies, which seemed to have a lot more fun in them than the ""good ones"" of the time period, some of which, however acclaimed, I do not care about. I didn't know about Wood's passions, his history, his relationships, and I could think of no better vassal than this film.<br/><br/>Criminally ignored at the Box Office, despite the consolation of Critical Acclaim, and the first Oscar ever given to someone portraying a real life movie star, this is one of the films that runs the full kaleidoscope of human emotion, not the least of which is heart. Ed Wood lived to be a joke, and his inept films are a demonstration for that, though it is never cruel in the slightest towards him. Depp, in a performance that eats Jack Sparrow for breakfast, radiates a passion for his work that anyone who likes films can grasp instantly. He idolises his film stars, has posters in his ramshackle apartment, and talks about them all the time at worm. Added to this is Wood's battles with the studio system, wherein we now have an actual reason to root for him, whereas other movies would throw an obstacle at the protagonist without the audience given time or reason to like him. It may be clichÃ©, but look at Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars Prequels. We don't care about him, so why should we care about his situation. Wood is the underdog, screwed over by the Hollywood system. Yet they have a point. He is fantastically terrible. And that is the main victory of the film. Despite knowing that he's crap, we still want to see the producers hand him money to make his dreams come true, despite it being a Box Office bomb in the making. Most other pictures would have had us rooting for the producers in that case, but here we root for the doomed path. His Reaganite optimism is a breath of fresh air in an industry dominated by the bottom line. You'd wish you could be friends with this guy, talking about your favourite movies together, going to the bar, and of course, the cinema.<br/><br/>I can go no further but talk about Landau's Lugosi, which thankfully was fully rewarded with an Oscar. Lugosi is the number 2 character in the film. Once top of the world, in Dracula, The Black Cat, The Raven, he's a morphine addict waiting for death. Wood is the precursor of Lugosi's arc, who gives meaning to his life, racked by debt, divorce, and addiction. While this could be the recipe for sentimentalism, we are thankfully spared that, and given a tour-de-force in comedy. Swearing is so much funnier with his Hungarian accent, especially when he gets perverted. ""If you want to make out with a young lady, take her to see Dracula heh heh."" A recurring joke has that no one realises Lugosi is even alive, and certainly that Karloff is his superior, whom Lugosi doesn't seem at all bitter to. ""**** YOU!!! KARLOFF DOESN'T DESERVE TO SMELL MY ****!!!"" His relationship with Wood is the core of the film. Lugosi is given a reason for life in his dying days, and this gives his character meaning. It was based on Burton's own relationship with the sickly Vincent Price.<br/><br/>Then there is the humour, which was inevitable given Wood's ineptness, and it shows:<br/><br/>A Monster Octopus has no motor, and the actors have to move the legs themselves<br/><br/>An actor in a police get-up scratches his face with the business end of a revolver while his finger is on the trigger, before falling over and knocking down a wooden gravestone.<br/><br/>Lugosi reads incomprehensible dialogue on the set of Glen or Glenda: ""Bevare ze BIG GREEN DRAGON, who sitz on yor DOORstep.""<br/><br/>Many others follow, but the best is when Lugosi goes on live television for a skit. I won't dare spoil it.<br/><br/>Wood made decisions that no sane man could have made, but in a Producer's-style twist, he ironically ensured that his films would be remembered forever. Some say Plan 9 is the worst film ever made. This is evidence that they've never watched many films. I could literally name 100 worse films right now. The reason? Wood had a passion that could not be tamed, and that life and energy still translates across the reel.<br/><br/>The main message of the movie is a brilliant, but important one: It doesn't matter how good you are at something. You're not wasting your time if it is what you love."
"slokes","9","1","1","9 December 2014"," Hooray For Hollywood
","""Ed Wood"" is about as good as Hollywood gets while perversely celebrating the worst Hollywood has ever offered. Forsaking grim reality for the Hollywood kind, it tells an involving story with a deft mix of humor and heart.<br/><br/>Wood (Johnny Depp) is a struggling writer of bad dinner-theater drama who dreams of finding success on the big screen. One day he spots boyhood idol Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) inside a coffin he's testing out for a road-tour production of ""Dracula."" Lugosi, who has seen better days, takes up Ed's offer of a ride home. Soon, he is signed to be in Wood's movie about a cross-dresser. The movie predictably fails, but Wood and Lugosi become unlikely friends in the face of uncaring Hollywood.<br/><br/>Wood at least can handle criticism, having practice: ""Worst film you ever saw? Well, my next one will be better!""<br/><br/>There is a lot of room for pathos here, and even more if ""Ed Wood"" stuck more closely to the facts. The film is a triumph precisely because it plays with the truth in such a genial, gonzo way. Wood in the film is not the dysfunctional alcoholic he was in life but a highly motivated young man bursting with energy. He has a gift for making friends, strange friends but good ones, like TV psychic Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), horror-movie MC Vampira (Lisa Marie), and out-of-work-and-out-of-the-closet actor Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray).<br/><br/>Murray alone has so many funny lines in this film I could fill the rest of this review with them and be done. There are a lot of funny lines in this film, some buried so deep you have to watch it more than once. I just caught one, where the owner of the coffin shop responds to Lugosi's complaint (""Too constricting!"") by earnestly saying no one has ever mentioned it before.<br/><br/>Because the film is in black-and-white, it seems to go by people, which is unfortunate. Director Tim Burton and co-writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski present us with a very accessible story that includes clever shout-outs to bad-movie buffs, not just hilarious re- enactments of terrible scenes from Ed Wood's own movies but left-field moments where Ed is inspired to write lines that will become famous in his movies (""Pull the strings...wait a minute!"")<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the cast, with the exception of Murray and Landau, but all do great work here. Depp's artificiality in the title performance initially put me off; then I realized he was playing off the conventions of the 1950s in a way that sets the tone for the whole movie. Sarah Jessica Parker is an actress I can't stand, but she's fantastic here as Wood's girlfriend Delores, the one person who sees how bad his movies are and can't stand it. Her facial reactions when listening to two of Wood's disciples sing his praises are priceless.<br/><br/>Watching ""Ed Wood"" may be tough for five minutes if you aren't used to black-and-white movies, but that will disappear once Landau makes his entrance. The film just builds from there; it's structurally as strong as it is quotable. The humor makes it enjoyable; the compassion makes it memorable.

","(76%) If ""the Artist"" was a loving nod to the best of silent Hollywood cinema, then this is one to some of the very worst of Hollywood cinema, yet with the same exact sentiment running through. It's a tragic comedic portrait of a man more ambitious than talented, as he becomes through the length of the movie almost impossible to dislike and/or not root for because he tries so hard and really does want to make a good picture. The whole cast is great, particularly Depp and Landau, and Burton movies always look at the very least good and this really is no exception. As drama comedies based around very bad movies go this is likely to be the very best, and comes highly recommended for those interested in the other side of Hollywood history."
"GusF","Null","1","1","27 August 2014"," Tim Burton's masterpiece
","An outrageously entertaining and often hilarious tribute to perhaps the worst director of all time. It could also be seen as a tribute to all the little guys in Hollywood who never made it big. Johnny Depp is absolutely fantastic as Ed Wood, whose relentless and infectious optimism, eccentricities and complete acceptance of his friends' many eccentricities make him a lovable protagonist. It's more of a comic retelling of Wood's life and career during the 1950s than an historically accurate biopic and that approach works very well in this case. I thought that it was a wise decision not to make it an outright parody of Wood. I also thought that the use of black and white fitted in perfectly with the film.<br/><br/>Martin Landau is brilliant (and almost unrecognisable) in his Oscar winning role as the fallen star Bela Lugosi. Having worked with his idol Vincent Price, I imagine that Burton knew exactly how Wood felt to be working with Lugosi, giving the film a more personal dimension than many of his other ones. The rest of the cast is excellent too, particularly Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge (who played the Ruler in Wood's magnum opus ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""), Patricia Arquette in the fairly small role of Wood's incredibly supportive and understanding girlfriend and eventual wife Kathy O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones as Criswell. Sarah Jessica Parker is surprisingly good as Wood's less supportive previous girlfriend Dolores Fuller, who was reportedly far nicer in real life.<br/><br/>The film was a financial flop, making less than a third of its already small budget, but I think that this is Tim Burton's masterpiece. It's one of my top 20 films of all time and my favourite film about films / filmmaking."
"rajatdahiyax","8","1","1","31 July 2014"," True dedication to real stars..
","Hollywood visionary Tim Burton pays homage to another Hollywood visionary, albeit a less successful one, in this unusual fictionalized biography. The film follows Wood (Johnny Depp) in his quest for film greatness as he writes and directs turkey after turkey, cross- dresses, and surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, outcasts, has-beens. The real story, however, is his friendship with aging, morphine-addicted Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whom he tries to help stage a comeback. Landau's unforgettable Oscar-winning performance must be seen to be believed, as must Rick Baker's Oscar-winning makeup. While it would have been easy to make a film simply ridiculing the bumbling director, Burton instead focuses on his driving passion for filmmaking and his unwavering persistence in the face of ridicule and failure. Possibly the most surprising aspect of the film is the genuine sentiment with which Burton treats the relationship between Wood and Lugosi; his devotion to Lugosi is touching, as is Lugosi's final soliloquy -- an inane bit of dialogs from the hilariously bad Bride of the Monster that grows into a poignant metaphor for the actor's life and ultimate triumph of his spirit. Even the look of the film is right; it manages to preserve the air of one of Wood's own films while retaining a sense of artistry in much of the composition on screen (note the scene at the drug rehab where Lugosi endures a horrifying night of detox). In all, Ed Wood is a unique film -- at times side-split-tingly funny; at others, tragic or even frightening -- and a heartfelt tribute to the love of movies, good and bad alike"
"Aimalkhan123","10","1","1","22 July 2014"," One of the great movies of our time based on the life of one of the worst directors of all time.
","Have you heard of a film called ""plan 9 from outer space""? No? Okay, how about ""Bride of the monster""? Fine, what about ""Glen or Glenda"" perhaps? Unless you are some sort of a weirdo cinema fan who spends all his time watching every single movie under the sun, the chances are you have never heard of any of those movies. If you do know about any of them, I tip my imaginary hat to your awesomeness.<br/><br/>All of the above movies have two things in common. They are terrible. So terrible that every year hipsters around the world gather to watch and pay tribute to them. And they were made by a guy named Ed Wood. You have never heard of him either. Ed Wood has the dishonor of being considered the worst director of all time. Why would anyone make a movie about him? I asked myself the same question until I watched Ed Wood. Johnny Depp gives a heartfelt and hilarious performance as wide eyed talent-less but passionate and endlessly optimistic young man who believes in himself and harbors great hopes of one day making it as big as his idol Orson Wells. Sarah Jessica Parker plays Dolores Fuller his long suffering girlfriend and star of most of his movies and Martin landau as the washed up drug addict real life actor Bella Lugosi, a roll which deservedly won him a best supporting actor Oscar.<br/><br/>Other supporting cast includes the always wonderful Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette and Jeffery jones as his band of misfit cast and crew. The film follows the adventures of the titular character and his weird set of friends as the stumbles across Hollywood struggling to make some of his most famous movies. Tim Burton is the perfect choice of director for this movie. His own fascination with freaks and outsiders works wonderfully well here. Shot in black and white, the set designs are perfect. The movie looks and feels like a Hollywood B movie from the 50's. Every frame is lovingly crafted. Burtons love and fascination with his subject is shines through every frame of the movie. It feels like watching a really good Ed Wood movie. Genuinely hilarious at times, Ed wood is a very unhollywood film. It goes against the idea of try and try until you succeed. Perhaps that is why it has remained under the radar of general audience for so long. Tim Burton has made one of the great movies of our time based on the life of one of the worst directors of all time. That is pretty ironic."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","1","1","25 February 2014"," Tim Burton and Johnny Depp at Their Best
","There have plenty of director/actor partnerships throughout the years. John Ford had John Wayne whom called him Pappy; Martin Scorsese had Robert De Niro to help define his artistic talents and the obsessive Werner Herzog had the equally unbalanced Klaus Kinski. But if any partnership typifies the dynamic in today's modern Hollywood it'd be the peculiar Tim Burton and heartthrob Johnny Depp. Over a twenty year association the two have made eight films together from the much celebrated Edward Scissorhands (1990) to the much maligned Dark Shadows (2012) with seizures of creativity in between.<br/><br/>Arguably the best film the two have ever made together was the little seen early ninties film Ed Wood (1994). The film depicts the life and times of Edward D. Wood Jr., a film director commonly dubbed the worst auteur who ever lived. Since his passing, his paltry eight full feature films have become the stuff of legend, finding fandom among schlock-horror fans and sci-fi film buffs who laugh at their cheapness and incompetence. His opus, Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) includes ineptitudes from switching daylight to night in seconds, plainly visible film equipment and priceless lines like ""Inspector Clay is dead, murdered and somebody's responsible."" Ed Wood's script is written by oft writing collaborators Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski who subsequently wrote The People Vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and Man on the Moon (1999). Clearly they have a talent and enthusiasm for writing about oddballs. Their script lays the foundation for an intimate portrayal of Wood and his loyal band of misfits. It's solemn yet offbeat and quirky leading to some inspiring moments, many of which involving Johnny Depp and Martin Landau's infamous Bela Lugosi. There is one scene where the heroin addicted former horror star contemplates suicide aiming a pistol first at himself then at his good friend Ed. ""Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea"" says Wood. ""If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking?"" ""Formaldehyde,"" says Lugosi. ""Straight up or on the rocks?"" Johnny Depp once described his characterization of Ed Wood as a mix between Ronald Reagan and the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz (1939). The man's optimism in the face of rejection drives the film with the quickened pace of an energizer bunny. His wits are matched by the supporting players which include Bill Murray, Jeffrey Jones, George 'The Animal' Steele, Patricia Arquette and Sarah Jessica Parker who can only swallow the fact Wood is a hack for so long.<br/><br/>The real draw of course is Martin Landau whose interpretation of Bela Lugosi, the original Dracula (1931) is astounding. It isn't mere impersonation which, lets face it, everyone has an impression of Dracula; no its pure stagecraft. His stellar performance ranks in this writer's mind as possibly the best and most accurate depiction of a real personality ever put to film. Landau would go on to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and God bless him for that.<br/><br/>The movie is shot in black and white which might deter some viewers. Yet for those who ever wanted to reward themselves with a gratifying story about the foibles of filmmaking, or amerce themselves in Z-Movie lunacy watch Ed Wood. It exhibits shrewd writing by seasoned professionals and features some top-notch performances including one of the best Depp has ever committed to celluloid."

This movie originally had horrible reviews, and believe me, I wasn't too thrilled to watch it. I gave it a shot and that shot paid off. Don't underestimate this movie.

He so much wanted to succeed in the real film industry but ended up in the film industry which everyone watch:porn. That is it. We all want to watch the regular films, but ALL men and a lot of women watch porn. I wonder how Ed Wood be as a porn director? He probably would be very successful.

How not to laugh at him struggling with that octopus? How not to sympathize with him seeing his weakness, and forgetfulness that he suffered?<br/><br/>There is another scene that is simply stuck in my mind, that is the scene where there are a fake scenario and the guards raise it, in front of the producers. The question is: ""Do you really know how to make a movie?"" Of course not! <br/><br/>But what is the value of Ed Wood for the history of cinema? Some may value his works in a particular way, some may simply ignore it. But for me, what remains about Ed Wood, even confessing that I didn't see any of his pictures, is that he is a dreamer, a guy who strongly fought to make what he wanted, against everything and everyone. And no matter how bad are his works, he made his history. Yes, he did it!"

","Now here is one of the great films about making....films. For those who don't know, Ed Wood is known to be not one of the, but the worst director of all time. This film celebrates his legacy with great love and respect. Tim Burton is one who, in my personal opinion has never made a truly great movie. That was until I saw Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood his character is portrayed by Johnny Depp. Despite me claiming that Johnny Depp is an overrated actor, his performance in this film is so good, it almost made me respect Ed Wood as one of the greats. By that I mean that Depp shows how much this man loved his work that it almost makes you love his work too. One of my favorite lines is when Ed Wood is in a waiting room explaining to a lady, his future wife, about his profession in life....and he compares himself to the great Orson Welles. Now while this may seem ridiculous to most, just the way Depp explains this makes you think, Hey! Ya know, that really makes sense. That is because it is so true. Ed wood is the B version of Orson Welles....actually, make that the D version of Orson Welles. There is one line that truly sums up Ed Woods legacy. That line is towards the end of the film during the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space when Ed Wood says, ""This is what I'll be remembered for."""
"lolbleachfan","9","1","1","17 August 2013"," An Inspiring Story
","Ed Wood is often called one of the worst directors of all time, if not THE worst. His films suffered from laughably poor production quality, continuity errors and sub-par acting. Usually, we as the viewers, mock these flaws in films such as these but we rarely ever think about the work that was put into them or what the people behind them are like as individuals.<br/><br/>In this film based on Ed Wood himself, follows the making of his three most infamous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space and shows all the trials and troubles he had to go through to get these films made as well as his relationships with the actors, crew and in his personal life, most notably with famous horror star Bela Lugosi.<br/><br/>Rather than make fun of Ed Wood or his work, the film instead portrays him as an ambitious young film maker who might be a little too ambitious for his own good. It's a more human look at him, almost on a personal level. Ed is played by Johnny Depp, who does a fantastic job as portraying him as both funny and sympathetic. You root for him all the way and feel his sadness and disappointment when things do not turn out as expected for him.<br/><br/>Even though Depp acts well in the film, as do the other actors for that matter, the person who steals the show is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau plays the part to a tee and, much like Depp, plays him both funny and sympathetically only better in my opinion.<br/><br/>The story alone is inspiring to anyone who is or was ever interested in doing something creative, especially film making. The final scene with Plan 9 playing in the theatre as Ed looks on, his face beaming with such happiness and mouthing the words he wrote and by the end he doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it but rather he is content with seeing his vision come alive.<br/><br/>I should probably also mention that the film is not really entirely accurate to Ed Wood's real life but I feel if it was entirely accurate, the film wouldn't be as good. The only real flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that at the very end the film gives us a slide-show of all the characters and what has become of their real life counterparts and some of them are pretty sad to think about for such an uplifting movie, especially Ed himself, but that's very minor and the rest of the film is so good, I don't really mind.<br/><br/>So, the next time you mock a film for not being up to your standards, think a little of the people behind it and the troubles they all went through to see it come to fruition. Then maybe, just a little, you can begin to appreciate film a whole lot more. I know I did after I saw Ed Wood."

","Ed Wood, which is not totally a non-fiction film, is a wonderful portrayal of man who has multiple personalities, found it hard to get money, and is a guy who was voted ""Worst Director of All Time."" This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was produced back in the 1950's.<br/><br/>Burton's film is about the director Ed Wood as he enters the most productive years of his life. Wood happens to be a man who is fond of wearing women's clothing and deeply idolizes Bela Lugosi, the star of the original Dracula film. Wood, with the help of Lugosi, goes on to make some monumental films.<br/><br/>The acting is very good in the film. Even though Johnny Depp pairs up with Burton way too much, he delivers a surprisingly comical performance that seems straight from the heart. Martin Landau is brilliant as Bela and delivers one heck of a performance. There are some other great characters especially the humorous performances by Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his ""bad"" films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10."

To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography. The plot is admittedly not riveting but interesting and heartening enough, but above all, Burton's execution of this unlikely film is what makes it ""the one (he'll) be remembered for""... at least for me."

Johnny Depp was great - as Ed wood a bizarre filmmaker who is constantly gathering unique actors / people to be in his movies. He is in love with movies and his passion is clearly shown through out the film as he struggles to make his movies.<br/><br/>Eddie and Bela Lugosi had this crazy friendship going on through out the film.

"nnguyen0297","10","1","1","1 March 2013"," One of the best movies about making movies
","There's quite a lot to say about Ed Wood. But I guess I'll start by saying that I find it to be one of the most overlooked film in history. Why is it so overlooked? Well, no one really knows why it failed at the box office at the time even though it was a critical success. But thankfully, it has gained more fame and recognition over time, yet I still believe it's overlooked. The film is about a young movie director who has a passion for making movies even though he downright sucks at doing it. That's all I'll tell you people because the rest of the plot is really hard to explain in one review, and is super long so I really don't wanna do it. Anyways,the film is just a masterpiece. It's funny, inspiring, emotional at times, but it still gives you that warm feel-good feeling in the end. It gives viewers the message of never giving up and to do what you love no matter what others say. But what really made this movie so good are the characters that it has. Every single character in this movie has a different yet unique and memorable character trait. They were so fun to watch and you couldn't get enough of them. Of course that's do to the wonderful performances from he cast which includes Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, and best of all, Martin Landau in the role of Bela Lugosi, which I believe, is the best performance of his career. The film was directed by Tim Burton and it really showed. You could see a lot of his elements in this movie. You have that dark eerie atmosphere, and you have the characters who are different from other and are rejected by society, yet they swallow all the opinions from others and try to achieve great things. Unfortunately in real life Ed Wood never became a critically acclaimed director.... but that doesn't kill the message of the film. Sometimes you gotta face reality. Many people try to achieve great things but unfortunately, not all will succeed. And I know that whoever is reading this review might be a bit upset from what I just wrote like 2 lines ago and considering there's like a hundred more reviews on this film i'm sure not many will read it but remember this: Ed Wood may not have succeeded in making movies but he is still famous today. Why? Well for one thing his movies are so bad that people enjoy watching it because they're amusing, and also because he never gave up. He was called the worst director ever but he still made movies. Even though he didn't achieve what he hoped to achieve, he still kept trying because he loved what he did and he wanted to be remembered from it and chased his dream till the day he died. Not everyone will succeed in their goals, but if you tried and had the courage to give it your best, you will still gain a positive outcome for your attempts. You should always try to do something that you love even though it may sound improbable. But make sure it's not impossible because if you try to like jump of a building and fly or something then well, i don't know what to say. Because if you don't try, how will you know if you will succeed? And if you don't succeed, always have a back up plan. Just saying. Well anyways I highly recommend you see this movie if you haven't. It's really funny, and really inspiring, go check it out. I give it.... 5/5 stars"

Yet, Tim Burton manages to compose a dark humored comical tale based on the life and career of this man. Johnny Depp brings his natural odd sense of humor to his performance as the title role. Depp's Ed Wood is composed of the director's odd taste in film direction and his harbored transvestism, but is well acted and brings out laughs at certain points in the film. Martin Landau's supporting role as the famed horror star Bela Lugosi is so brilliant highlighted by the fading stardom that hit Lugosi in his latter years in a changing film world (Landau won the 1994 Oscar for Supporting Actor in the role).

The guy was an underdog he was really down on his luck and constantly struggling to make his dreams come true. Most of the people that try to bring him down or discourage him are all rational people, and you don't like them because their total blow holes; I remember always thinking ""Cmon just let him do his own thing."" And that was a good feeling, a feeling I don't get much for character real or unreal.<br/><br/>Yes, it true that Ed is a hack and a flaw person, from writing scripts that have some really bad dialog down to being delusional and eccentric, but he was actually honest about it you actually see him putting it out there, like in one scene he wears a dress while directing a scene for ""Plan 9"" as a way to feel good, in a way it sort of reminds me of the common idocricies we would do to help ourselves think or feel something like I've seen some girls in my collage classes that would draw or write some things on the sides before taking notes, not kidding.<br/><br/>And he saw let alone worked on his films and there were lots of mistakes from bad production quality, bad context, acting, and other things. But it never discouraged him, he had a vision and was relentlessly determined to keep on building it and after it was done in his eyes the final product was perfect even though reality said something else.<br/><br/>But of course it was also Martin Landau's performance as Bela Lagosi that also carried out the film, this is my favorite role from that actor because you really believe your seeing and hearing Bela. Seeing the twilight times of this actor I'll admit is really sad and made me wonder about a lot of others actors and actresses out there whom are now out of the limelight. You really felt for the guy from beginning to end, from his desire to continue acting which is one think I admired despite how old he is he could still do it let alone acting is what made sense to his life. Down to the time in the film he passed away which made me shed tears, I know this was something that happen long ago but they way they build it up gripped at emotions.<br/><br/>The real life supporting characters are great, my favorite one is Bunny Beckaridge by one of my favorite comedian actors Bill Murray, what he says at the Babtism always cracked me up.<br/><br/>I really like the humor in the film, it's true this film is a biopic drama but it's not oh so serious which I feel is a tone that fits perfectly and makes the characters feel more human. My favorite humorous moment is when Ed and the gang go to the movie premiere of ""Bride of the Monster"" and everyone is booing, throwing popcorn, it's crazy though the strangest thing about that scene is their doing this when the movie is just starting. I have only two conclusions about this, one this could of been a simple technical mistake or the theater is just reshowing the movie, though if that was the case why the heck would anyone stay).<br/><br/>I really love this film because it really is an inspiring movie because it really has a good lesson on simply fighting for your dream. Ed didn't do it for money or glory (theoretically anyway) which I never found good reasons to do filmmaking for; he did it really just to be and do what he wanted to do because it made sense for his life. That the same for all of us for whatever we do or desire.<br/><br/>Visions really are worth fighting for.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","If you, like me, at any point want to get into anything involving film, then you better watch this movie. The tale of what some people call the worst director ever will show how hard the film business can be. Tim Burton is very good at directing, and this film shows how much he loves film, as much as it show how much Ed Wood himself loved film.<br/><br/>I have a couple of problems, one I was hoping to laugh more. I know this is a dramedy, and I chuckled a descent amount of times, but I was hoping to get a few bigger laughs. I wish Bill Murray was in it a bit more, Murray is always a funny presence. Also, despite the fact that the film ends on a happy note, I still felt sad. We all know what fate befell Wood, and it makes the ending depressing.<br/><br/>Other than that, I really enjoyed this film. It really makes you feel sorry for Wood, he clearly loves movies and wants to make them, but the studios get in the way, and he never does a second take. Bela Legosi, despite being a bit mean at times, is very likable and you feel sad when he dies. I hope I'm not spoiling anything. The acting and direction are both great. And it really is good at showing how demanding the film business can be.<br/><br/>If this is what Ed Wood was like in real life, than no he isn't the worst director. He tried hard, and clearly loved film. Look at Uwe Boll who knows he will always make money and fights his critics. Like I said, if you want to be a filmmaker, you really should see this movie."

","The mighty epics and incisive dramas of the 1950s should be well-known to anyone with a cursory interest in classic cinema, but now less familiar are the numerous B-movies that formed a teaming if slightly seedy underbelly to Hollywood's grandiosity. The movies may have been cheap and shoddy affairs, but that doesn't mean there weren't behind-the-scenes stories that were just as fascinating as the juiciest tidbits of A-list gossip. Here we see a celebration of one of the B-flick's unsung heroes, the great Edward D. Wood Junior.<br/><br/>The project was given, very appropriately, to that champion of B-movie chic Tim Burton. As a film director, Tim Burton is far from the best, but he had a certain kind of genius that could shine through in the right project. For Ed Wood, he seeks very much to immerse us in the eponymous filmmaker's world. When, for example, Dolores notes that her sweaters are always stretched and Eddie turns over with a guilty look, we are suddenly sharing that private space between him and the camera. Many scenes are shot from a low angle, such as when Wood first meets Lugosi, which reduces the image to the actors' heads, the sky and the odd signpost. It creates a very surreal image, with very little to tie it into the real world. Nothing normal is allowed to steal into the frame. Burton also stages a lot of the scenes with a certain sense of occasion, as in Lugosi's final speech or Wood's entrance in women's clothing – these events are given an air of grand theatricality. This is Wood's world – only seeing the glamour.<br/><br/>Actors don't often get the chance to ham it up in modern cinema, but even though Ed Wood is about real historical personages, these individuals – Bela Lugosi, Criswell, Bunny Breckinridge and of course Mr Wood himself – were hugely flamboyant figures, and besides, the world in which Ed Wood takes place is somewhat hyper-real. Johnny Depp demonstrates his magnificent ability to walk the line between drama and comedy, giving the title character a boyish charm that makes us forget how atypical he is for a lead. Martin Landau plays Bela Lugosi as a ham who hammed even when he wasn't in front of the camera, showing the old horror legend as larger-than-life but also painstakingly human. Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones play similarly oddball characters, and just have fun with the opportunity to chew up the scenery and still remain faithful to the actual people they are portraying.<br/><br/>In Ed Wood Burton, along with writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski make Wood's movies look better than they actually were. And Landau makes Lugosi seem like a better actor than he really was (at least, as he was at that forlorn stage in his career). While little that appears here is outright fabrication, the facts have been dressed up, exaggerated, just as Wood might have done himself. And this is all fair enough in the spirit of the thing. After all, Ed Wood doesn't seem to be a document of how things actually were, but of how we should like to remember them."

","i've always felt that Tim Burton's classic 'Ed Wood' was all about Hollywood and more important about the heart and mind of the filmmaker and artist. his film 'Edward ScissorsHands' was about the artist in general, but 'Ed Wood' is about the artist as a cinema artist and filmmaker in particular.<br/><br/>sure Ed Wood jr. might have been pretty bizarre, but he obviously loved to make movies, was sincere about it and most of all, he's not boring. bad films are boring. Eddie's movies are always so weird and kooky and quaint that they stand out from other bad films and from other films in general. you really remember them.<br/><br/>there has been a lot of quibbling about the accuracy in Tim Burton's movie about EWJ's life accounts. i own and have read Rudolph Grey's book (i bought it for my brother in 1992 and read it before the movie came out), and i would have to say a good percentage of Burton's film is fairly accurate. sure 'Plan 9' never premiered at the Pantages theater in Hollywood, and Wood never met Orson Welles (who incidentally was much older at this time period than depicted here). but some even weirder things, like the Baptist church involvement and Vampira's taking the city bus to the filming in full costume, were absolutely true. Burton did take liberties with the truth here but i would say there is more truth than fiction here which brings to mind the old adage about the truth being stranger than fiction.<br/><br/>whatever the case, this film glorifies not only Hollywood, but the independent filmmaker and THAT is true democracy. i wish more people were truly that fair and democratic when evaluating things in our society. we actually might get somewhere if people practiced more thinking like this.<br/><br/>this is one of Hollywood's greatest classics. certainly one of it's funniest. all the elements here work well and go beyond the call. the performances are just great, especially Landau, who in my opinion gives one of the very best performances in the history of the Academy Awards. the whole film in general is just brilliant.<br/><br/>so many lines in the movie sum the whole like Criswell stating ""can your heart stand the terrifying TRUTH..."", but sometimes i think it's the dialogue between Weiss and Wood where Weiss yells, ""i asked you for a sex change film and you give me some crap about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters!"", to where Wood replies, ""i don't happen to think he's a schmuck"". oh well. time alone and time will tell."

","Gene Siskel said in his highly positive review of Tim Burton's Ed Wood that ""this is a film that loves movies and loves movie making."" I really can't improve on that. You feel an undercurrent of happiness all throughout, even when sadder moments creep in. The cast all seem to be having the time of their lives on screen, and Johnny Depp and Martin Landau simply steal the show. You root for these low-lifes and their struggles to make a film. You want to be there with them, enjoying their struggles and joys. And to portray Ed Wood as such an enthusiast may not be 100% accurate, but it is very very fun to watch! Ed Wood is a great picture for teens on up. It is a must see for film students. And it reminds me happily of a time where Hollywood didn't call all the shots (and thankfully that is coming back into play), where low budget films ruled, and where any Joe Shmoe with a couple of nickles and some imagination could make a motion picture and get it shown on the big screen. A true delight!"
"KnightsofNi11","9","1","1","19 December 2010"," Possibly Tim Burton's best film
","Edward D. Wood Jr. was revered as the worst director of all time. Tim Burton's Ed Wood is the tragic yet hilarious story of his attempt to make movies and just how unsuccessful he was at doing so. Johnny Depp portrays the strange and eccentric director in one of the best performances of his career. It is a very unique film with a very unique style, especially since it is all shot in black and white. Tim Burton's vision for this film stays very prevalent and obvious throughout the movie. It is very focused in its goal of simply portraying the life and eccentricities of Edward Wood Jr. The movie isn't cruel or mean spirited to him or his strange group of friends who help him make his movies. It simply tells the true accounts of how this man went about making his movies and all the little speed bumps along the way.<br/><br/>What makes a film about the life of Ed Wood work so well is how much of a character the man actually was. He was so impassioned about making movies and had such big ideas for his films. He idolized Orson Welles and other huge stars of his time. The man wanted nothing more than to make films. He just had no earthly idea how. In the grand scheme of things the story of Ed Wood is quite the tragedy since he never got the recognition he longed for until after his death, but the movie Ed Wood focuses on his determined filmmaking stretch where he remained strangely optimistic and was determined to get every film he worked on completed. And thats something he actually did, they were just all awful. The story this film tells is incredibly entertaining and is a very fascinating study of the over zealous man that was Ed Wood.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is incredible as Ed Wood but the film also offers a great lineup of supporting cast members. The best is definitely Martin Landau as the discouraged and washed up old Bela Lugosi. His story is even more tragic and depressing than Wood's, but Landau's portrayal is exquisite. So much so that he won an Oscar for it. I get the feeling Lugosi was an odd character because Landau portrays him with so many funny little nuances and quirks, making him such a fun character. The other cast members do a great job as well. The two love interests Wood has during the movie are hilarious contrasts of one another and Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette do a great job in those roles. Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones step in for some bit parts that are hilarious in their own ways. Vincent D'Onofrio steps in for about two minutes of screen time in a cameo as Orson Welles in one of the best scenes of the whole film. The whole cast of the film is full of odd personalities and strange habits and it makes the film a consistently fun ride.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's auteur style is another of the shining aspects in this film. It is very different and unconventional, but it works extremely well throughout the film. First off he directs it all in black and white which makes it stand out anyways. But there are times when it actually feels like a film directed during Ed Wood's time period, obviously a lot better than Ed Wood himself would have directed it. This style stays consistent but never so much that the film loses its appeal. It has a great flow to it and keeps your attention from start to finish. I was never bored of the film and no aspect ever grew tired or overdone. It is an incredibly well made film.<br/><br/>Ed Wood is one of the most entertaining biopics I've ever seen. Ed Wood and the quirky people who surrounded him make for some of the most unique and fascinating stories imaginable. And of course it helps when these characters are so excellently portrayed by the A-list stars that drive this film. The 90s were Tim Burton's golden age of filmmaking and Ed Wood proves it."
"Crusader814","8","1","1","9 December 2010"," Tim Burton's Best
","Edward D. Wood Junior is hailed as being ""the worst director of all time."" And from what I saw in this film, rightfully so. I was familiar with his films but had never watched them before and after seeing this, I plan on watching them.<br/><br/>Ed Wood follows Edward D. Wood Junior's attempts to make it big in Hollywood, but he can't seem to face the fact that he doesn't have what it takes. As he casts washed up movie stars such as Bela Lugosi. This film is enjoyable to watch and laugh out loud funny, but also, at times, surprisingly moving.<br/><br/>This film got snubbed at the Oscars in my opinion. It should have been up for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, Supporting Actor and Makeup. It did get wins for Supporting Actor and Makeup but how about nominations for the other deserving cast and crew members.<br/><br/>Tim Burton gets the best possible result from the screenplay, which is the best a director can do. His decision to film in black and white really worked well on the screen and isn't something you see very much of nowadays. He also controls the emotions you feel when watching a particular scene, as there can be a fluid transition from comically funny to sad.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a great performance, as the cross dressing, bumbling and clumsy Edward D. Wood Junior. Martin Landau was awarded an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, and rightfully so. Bill Murray as always gives a great performance as well as Martin Landau's daughter, Juliet Landau, in the role of Loretta King. All the other performances are top notch as well. The screenplay also has to be acknowledged, as it is snappy and full of wit, with some classic quotes. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, I highly recommend it, especially if you're a Tim Burton fan, as this is his greatest film."

","Edward D. Wood Jr. is a man of mystery. Why would anybody find his films acceptable? Well, actually, they didn't. Hollywood hated his films, along with critics, and audiences too. But no matter what happened, Wood's ambition never stopped.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the real life person in a Willy Wonka sort of way. Always sort of chipper. And it's terrific. The film Ed Wood, from visionary mastermind Tim Burton ,is one of the best films of his career. No doubt about it.<br/><br/>Wood was a very guy. He liked dressing up in women's clothing, but he was not gay. He dated Delores(Sarah Jessica Parker), an aspiring actress, and she was creeped out by him. The film tells the story of him. Or the fall and fall of Ed Wood. Because every movie he did sucked.<br/><br/>It shows his relationship with Bela Lugosi(Martin Landau in his Oscar winning role), and him trying to be a success. Wood directed films such as ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", and ""Glen or Glenda"", a film about transvestites, in which he played one.<br/><br/>Bill Murray plays a transvestite named Bunny. Ed Wood is an incredibly interesting film. If you don't know anything about Ed Wood(All I knew was that he sucked), then you will be in for a surprise. I am a fan of Tim Burton's work. I think that everything he does, no matter what happens, will blow you away. I love some of his films. I just saw this film for the first time, and I think it's one of his finest.<br/><br/>This is also one of Johnny Depp's best performances. The acting from almost everyone is extraordinary. Sarah Jessica Parker shines a lot, and Martin Landau steals the show. This is definitely on my top 3 of Burton's films. Bravo.<br/><br/>I love everything about it.

Ed Wood despite being told by people that he has no talent works for his dream, and tries his hardest. That is a message for anyone wanting to make films.

","Watching Johnny Depp as the irrepressible Ed Wood always brings back the memories (most of them bad): memories of trying to make Public Access movies with amateurs whose sudden ""claim to fame"" led them to dictate how we would and would not shoot a scene that I had conceived and written and was supposedly directing; watching my would-be ""stars"" as they literally walked away, time after time, from location after location without cause and without giving reason; etc. In January of this year, I'd planned to begin a remake of a short I'd made 15 years ago (IN THE WOODS, about a group of homicidal mental patients rampaging through a forest near the hospital from which they had escaped). At the last minute, both the cameraman (who had a camera capable of shooting widescreen and in black and white) and the makeup/fx guy (who claims to have worked on a zombie film shot in New Orleans last year) punked out on me (though they kept the copy of my script). In February, I wrote and planned to direct THE CRAVING (about a cabbie who battles a zombie plague here in Wilmington- called ""Filmington"" in my script), but the cab we were to use developed transmission trouble the day we were to begin shooting; nix the cabbie vs. zombie movie. By March, I'd done a story for the fourth issue of my black and white comic (CAPE FEAR COMICS), entitled BOTTOM FEEDERS. The story involved a group of homeless people who do battle with the UNdead- another homage to George Romero. I'd hoped to premiere it at a zombiecon in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, in October. Things got off to a good start when a guy who'd helped put on a local stage version of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD volunteered to be the lead. We went out and shot some scenes of him arriving at the local bus station and then getting mugged (leaving him thus penniless and homeless in a strange town). That very evening, apparently, he got a call from a local video store to which he had applied. No longer would he be available for BOTTOM FEEDERS. As this is being written, I'm trying to cast for my fourth attempt at making a movie this year: it'll be called KILLBILLIES, and it's a cross between DELIVERANCE, SOUTHERN COMFORT, and THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. One of the leads is a professional wrestler who lives here in Wilmington (North Carolina). Like Ed Wood himself, I refuse to be dissuaded, but the lack of money has proved an almost insurmountable obstacle (NOBODY is willing to work for nothing around here). I'll keep you posted."

","It is a sad fact (well known, but generally ignored by the authors of the self-help books) that some people get the breaks and others don't. Those who don't seldom travel very far or rise very high, no matter how hard they work at it; and this is partly due to the even sadder fact that those who have gotten the breaks all too often take malicious delight in ridiculing and disparaging the efforts of those who have not. As a number of other reviewers have pointed out, Ed Wood was definitely a have-not; and while this film is not an entirely faithful recreation of his life, it does present a fairly accurate account of the general conditions under which the man was forced to work. How many of the supposedly great Hollywood directors (or the critics who lionize them) could have done any better in such circumstances? To compare Ed Wood's films to the multi-million dollar studio productions of the day is comparing apples to oranges, but how many critics have ever bothered to note the distinction? <br/><br/>Ed Wood has been accused of having no talent. A fairer assessment would be that whatever talent he might have had was never nurtured, developed or given one iota of direction by any of the people who could have helped him. If some established Hollywood icon had chosen to take the young Ed Wood under his wing and open a few doors for him, what sort of talent might have emerged? That we can never know. One thing, however, is certain: for all their faults, Ed Wood's films have been entertaining people (one way or another) for the past fifty-odd years, while many of the more expensive and polished films of his day are all but forgotten."

Ed Wood speaks to the passionate cinema loving man-child in all of us, who just cannot play it straight with the big guys and has to live the independent route--even if he does suck. I would not be surprised if positive reception of Ed Wood's movies post-1994 stem entirely from Johnny Depp's charismatic depiction of him. I certainly know this movie lead me to Ed Wood's films (by the way, this is the first time I watched this movie since I've seen them. It's worth noting that I actually really like Glen or Glenda for precisely the reasons stated in this movie--because it was honest, even if he had no idea what he was doing and wasn't smart enough to know how to make it acceptable for other people).<br/><br/>Oh God, and the acting! Martin Landau as Bela Legosi is downright chilling. Lisa Marie as Vampira is friggin' amazing! Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Welles nailed it! This movie is all about its own kind of iconography, the pulp we grew up with (too bad Burton's Mars Attacks isn't as good).<br/><br/>Everyone has a lot of fun, and the writing is snappy and believable--this movie is everything Ed Wood wanted to be, and it's almost heart-wrenching to think that he eventually got it, but through no effort of his own, but through Tim Burton's.

"RFHartwell","9","1","1","15 November 2009"," One of Tim Burton's achievements
","Tim Burton has always done strange, in a good way kind of movies. He has directed Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd, and The Corpse Bride. What do they have in common? They have Johnny Depp as the main character. Johnny Depp brought great character to the Burton movies. ""Ed Wood"" is one of them. This movie is Burton's vision on the life of, what people said to be, the worst director of all time. Ed Wood made some of the strangest films of the 1950's. These include ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and the one movie he was known for, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". The cinematic shots in the film make one feel as if it is an old film. The movie is shown in black and white, so it really sets the mood in the time period. The casting in this film, aside from Johnny Depp, is superbly picked. Martin Landau as Bella Lugosi brings the character to life with his elderly enthusiasm. Half the time one forgets that he is not Bella Lugosi. Landau's performance as Bella Lugosi won him an academy award for best supporting actor. And he defiantly deserved it. The music in this movie is phenomenal. Some of the music was from some of the Ed Wood movies, and it replicates the quirkiness of an Ed Wood film. Jeffery Jones makes an appearance as Criswell, presenting the film in a host-like presence introducing the life of Edward D. Wood Jr. This movie raps around the beginning of how Ed Wood became a director. Even when one knows that he was the worst director of all time, one feels a sense of importance in Johnny Depp's character. He is eccentric but sympathetic. He felt his work was important, even though others did not. Whenever Ed Wood finished one of his movies, he felt that he was a true success. The relationship with Ed Wood and Bella Lugosi starts out with a meeting of two strangers, then their relationship grows as Ed Wood gives Lugosi a second chance at stardom. Ed Wood builds strong relationships with his fellow actors, a girlfriend respects his transvestitism, and his fetish for angora sweaters. The movie makes the characters human, that's why one feels great sympathy towards them. The editing in this film is fantastic. It brings all of Ed Wood's creations in one opening scene, and brings the origins of his films into a mostly true story. We now know who Edward D. Wood Jr. is because of Tim Burton. Ed Wood films may have been said to be the worst, but Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"" turns everything around."

","If you don't know who Ed Wood is, he is only a true Hollywood legend! He gave us such films like Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Such great classics and other all rightfully gave him the tittle of the world's worst dirctor of all time. He was not only the worst but also the weirdest. He even makes director Tim Burton, the master mind behind this film, look rather sane. With his bizarre cross-dressing life style and collection of odd friends one could easily mistake him as a fictional character made by Burton him self. But no! Ed Wood really did make some of the most painfully bad movies of all time and haunted movie goers through out his life.<br/><br/>Unlike Ed woods Films this movie is actually really good. I think it's my favorite Burton film. Once again Tim Burton cast his good friend Jonny Depp as the lead. Depp performance as Ed wood is really entertaining. In spite of the fact Wood is screwed up in the head, has no talent and is destined to fail one cant help but find him self liking this weirdo. Depp is not the only the great performance in this movie. Martin Landua dose a really great job as the has been Bela Lougsi. For those of you not familiar with Lougsi he only played Dracula and his performance has made him a horror icon to this day. However in this film we see him after his fame has ran its course. Now he is a grumpy drug addicted has been in his old age that no one will heir. No one but his number one fan Ed Wood. Bill Murry plays one of Ed's most bizarre friends. An overly depressed man who keeps moping about how much he wants to become a Women. Sara Jessica Parker also appears as Ed Woods's girl friend who he is keeping in the dark about his wardrobe. Not my favorit actress but it worked out. So we have an interesting cast of people playing a very strange cast of characters.<br/><br/>The first thing to be noted about the film is that it is filmed completely in black and white. In fact the film is made to look similar to what Ed Woods's movies were like. The only difference is that this one is decent. So we are not just seeing a retelling of Woods life, we are also seeing how he may have seen the world and the people in it. So thought out the movie we get a few moments that are much like the things you find in Ed's films but its place in just right. The movie is quite humors to. The things Wood would do to get his horrible film together, the dialogue and Woods ""film making"" had me chuckling. There is also some emotion found in the film, most notably in Woods friendship With Bela. This on screen drama earn actor Martin Landua an Oscar for his performance. To bad the real Ed Wood never got one of these. His movie probably could not earn a razy award in any age.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's odd Gothic style of filming some how works really well in the retelling of the life of such an odd man. Pluse he catchs that feeling of b-rated 50 scifi movies. After watching this I can safely say this is his most underrated movie. The only real thing that bothers me about this movie was when it neared the end. It's not much but I was hopping we could of seen a little more of what happen after the release of the last movie. Plus unlike everyone ells in Woods little club we were never told what happen to the Actress who stared in Bride of The Monster. I know its not much but for some reason that bothered me. These are very minor flaws and it was not enoughf to lower my ratting. In the end this is a good film about worst film maker.<br/><br/>That why Ed Wood gets a 10 out of 10"
"dead47548","9","1","1","8 January 2008"," An uplifting portrait of one bizarre man.
","Tim Burton takes a chronicling of the 'worst director of all time' and transforms into something far beyond that. He crafts a film about ambition and the dedication a man took in order to follow that ambition and turn it into a reality. He shows us a man who follows his dream, no matter how bad the reviews are. We see that it's not the world's dream, and it's not something that will be critically accepted in his industry but it is Ed Wood's dream and his final success of getting his picture made is one that completed his life. An uplifting tale of self-acceptance over doing things based on what other's perceive as excellent.<br/><br/>The performances really take charge in this one. Martin Landau greatly deserved his Oscar win for his portrayal of the late Bela Lugosi. His transformation is vital to the story as it's Bela who really charges Ed's career and inspires him to become the legend he eventually became. Martin captures the drug addicted, bitter old man's essence with ease and makes us feel as if we're watching the real deal. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette also deliver superb performances, each taking over one half of Ed's romantic life. For me though, the real star of this one was Johnny Depp. He has stated that his portrayal of Wood was a mixture of 'the blind optimism of Ronald Regan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz and Casey Kasem'. As bizarre as that sounds, it looks as though he hit the nail on the head and delivers one of the best performances of his career. A true marvel to watch, as he always is for me."
"porejide","9","1","1","27 December 2007"," Great movie, very funny
","Johnny Depp is hilarious as always, and Martin Landau also manages to portray a well-rounded character once all is said and done.<br/><br/>Two things I particularly liked about this movie: 1) Ed Wood's entreprenurial spirit. He's always a go-getter, looking for opportunities when the world is pushing him down. Calling up Vampira for a date, financing a movie from the Baptist Church, etc.<br/><br/>2) How Ed doesn't sulk when Sarah Jessica Parker's character leaves him. Instead, he goes out and finds somebody that will like him for who he is. So many times in Hollywood people end up getting back together with old lovers, mainly because it's an easy story to tell because you don't have to introduce another character. But this is more realistic and it teaches a better lesson. If you aren't compatible with somebody, you can always find somebody else."

"Det_McNulty","9","1","1","29 October 2007"," Charms Through Its Whim and Wisdom. Never Has A Bad Director Been Smothered In Such Respect
","Renowned for crafting incredibly bad films and often cited as the ""worst director ever"", Edward D. Wood Jr. has become a cult icon inside the world of film. Although his films are entirely detestable, they are rarely a chore to watch because of the comedic value which is on offer. It could be argued that he was the man who gave birth to ""Z movie horror."" It is widely acknowledged that Tim Burton has long been an admirer of classic horror films, which resulted in his reoccurring use of German expressionism (mise-en-scène) and Gothic themes in his own works. Similar to many of Tim Burton's films, Ed Wood is about a bizarre, eccentric and unique man.<br/><br/>Chronicling a man's rise to ""personal success"" and his overwhelming desire to become the next Orson Welles, Ed Wood charts the director's fascinatingly manic career; from Glen or Glenda, to Plan 9 from Outer Space. Both are two of the most shamefully undesirable disasters ""Hollywood"" has ever produced, but to Ed Wood they were gold. Even so, he was a man who had the utmost level of zest for his so-called ""art"" and would never back-down to the barrage of criticism he would constantly receive. To Ed Wood, Glen or Glenda was a highly personal film, which was supposed to tell the world his desire to wear women's clothes, instead it made him look entirely foolish. This pretty much defines the career of the ""world's worst director."" Strangely enough, Ed Wood is not a biopic which bashes the man, or makes fun out of him. Instead, Tim Burton creates a loving homage to the quintessential master of the ""Z movie."" <br/><br/>Upon finishing a Tim Burton film it is irregular not to undergo satisfaction, but with Ed Wood it is impossible. Evidently, (or at least I believe so) it is Burton's most triumphant work to-date, yet oddly enough, receives underwhelming acclaim. It is a shame that viewers of today are prepared to spend money to see terrible odes like Mars Attacks (a disastrous experiment by Burton) and then turn down the opportunity to experience a genuine homage, such as Ed Wood. The lovable, informative and often amusing take on the life of a cinematic failure ranks among the greatest films from the '90s.<br/><br/>Delivering staggering vigour and once again proving his versatility, Johnny Depp took centre-stage for his finest collaboration with mentor-like Burton. And to think that it was not until 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean was released that Depp received his first academy award nomination. Robbery, considering his performance was undoubtedly the best of its year (1994). How many male actors are prepared to accept almost any role, do anything for it (e.g. prance around in drag) and actually achieve the utmost level of professionalism? Luckily and ironically, actor Marin Landau received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (awarded for his role as the drug-addicted and deadbeat Dracula star, Bella Lugosi). These are performances of aching personality, and are drenched with amusing anecdotes.<br/><br/>Filmed in black-and-white, Ed Wood crafts a precise image of the 1950s Hollywood scene. Not only does it signify poignancy, but it also swells with nostalgia. Camera movements are both graceful and erratic, suited as allegory for Mr. Wood's own unpredictability. Surely this is a personal work, something which can be noted through the tactfully comic screenplay. With the exception of factual (although not fatal by any means) inaccuracies, the picture remains a victorious achievement and should be hailed for its comic brilliance more regularly, if you ask me. As a director (and on a side note), Tim Burton should be applauded for his ability to pay sympathy and respect for a man who was painfully oblivious of his exceptional ineptness. It would have been arrogant to have shown blatant pity for Edward D. Wood Jr., so as a director he remains subtle when underlying his sympathy (and even understanding) of a futile longing for excellence."

","Tragic story of a great genius who was born way before his time and who's time came after he sadly left us. Like Franz Kafka and Vincent Van Gogh Ed Wood, Johnny Depp, was never recognized as the genius that he was until he had to die and then be discovered by millions of film lovers. People who for the most part were born long after he wrote directed and starred in his last film.<br/><br/>Following his life long dream of making movies Ed Wood started out as man with ideas that were just to far out for anyone in the Hollywood of the early 1950's to take seriously. It was in 1952 when Ed saw a story in the newspapers about former combat veteran Chris Jorgenson having a sex change operation that got him interested. Ed, being a closet transvestite, decided to do a movie about Jorgenso and secretly about himself. Going from studio to studio all Ed got was the run around and door slammed, or laugh at, in his face. It wasn't until he ran into washed up movie horror king Bela Lugosi ,Martin Laundau, fitting himself for a coffin at a L.A funeral home that things started to turn around for the young and hungry director.<br/><br/>The movie ""Ed Wood"" centers around the friendship that was developed by Ed Wood and, at the time, the highly morphine addicted Bela Lugosi. Bela who hadn't made a movie in four years was now on his last legs and it was Ed who gave him the chance to revived his career which he did in three unforgettable films that Wood directed: 1.""Glen or Glenda"" 2. ""Bride of the Monster"" and 3. In a cameo role in what many people consider to be Wood's ""Citizan Kane"" the film that they broke the mold after he made it ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".<br/><br/>Were also introduced in ""Ed Wood"" to Ed's two wives Doloros Fuller, Sarah Jessica Parker, who left Ed when he gave her a supporting, not leading, role in his classic ""Bride of the Monster"" and also Kathy O'Hara, Patricia Arquette, who met Ed when he was at the hospital having his friend Bela dry out and kick his drug habit. Kathy turned out to be Ed's real and true love of his life who, unlike Dolores, stood by him through thick and thin and never left his side up until he suddenly collapsed and died from a heart-attack on the evening of December 10, 1978.<br/><br/>Having his first big success with ""Glen and Glenda"" in 1953 Ed set out to do films that would give his friend Bela Lugosi, who was the puppet master in that film, something to really stick his teeth into and came up with ""Bride of the Monster"" in 1954. Getting together a number of aspiring actors and actresses, like Tony McCoy Loretta King & 400 pound ex professional wrestler Tor Johnson, to play in the movie it took almost a year until Ed could get the money to finally finish the project.<br/><br/>""Bride of the Monster"" was not the smashing success, financially not artistically, that Ed hoped it would be but watching it now, like those who were lucky or brave enough to see it back then in 1955,it really stood the test of time after all these years. Seeing the great Bela Lugosi in what turned out to be his last speaking role and very possibly the signature performance of his career, as the insane and at the same time sympathetic Dr. Eric Vornoff, that's filled with so much tension electricity and passion that it completely blows away anyone who watches it. Bela delivering his unforgettable ""I Have'a no Home"" speech to his bitter rival in the movie Professor Strowski has to be seen, and heard, to be believed. Not to take anything away from actor Martin Landau, who received a Academy Award for his part as Bela Lugosi, you have to see Bela himself deliver he lines in the movie ""Bride of the Monster"" to really appreciate what a great actor he really was and, with Ed Wood's writing and directing, again became in the twilight of his magnificent film career. Even Marlon Brando at his absolute best couldn't come close to duplicate Bela's unbelievable performance in that movie!<br/><br/>With no worlds left to conquer after classics like ""Bride of the Monster"" ""jailbate"" "" The Violent Years"" and ""Glen or Glenda"" already in the can Ed went out to make the movie that he would forever be identified with ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". Sadly enough he wouldn't have Bela Lugosi, who died just as the filming began, to star in it. <br/><br/>Touching funny as well as heart-breaking story of the Great Ed Wood Jr who had to die, after being laughed snickered and scorned at while he was still alive, to be recognized and become the film and movie genius that he is today. The movie wisely ends just as Ed has his greatest success at the opening of his forgotten, and now rediscovered, anti-war and anti-nuclear testing sci-fi classic ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". <br/><br/>It was fitting to end the movie ""Ed Wood"" before we saw him, and his great talents, go downhill leaving him a broken and forgotten man who was left to sneaking out of one apartment and into another to prevent himself from being thrown out for not paying his rent. It's even sadder that Ed Wood didn't live long enough to get the appreciation that he so rightfully deserved to get from the movie going public. If there is a life beyond death I can see Ed there now looking down and basking in the love and critical acclaim, from both the public and critics, that he's getting now in death that eluded him all those years in Hollywood where he slaved and grabbed to get his movies made and distributed while he was still alive."

"funkyfry","9","1","1","20 February 2007"," Exceptional bio-pic only slightly marred by blurred truth
","This film traces the rise (but not the fall) of notorious B film-maker Edward D. Wood, Jr. Ed Wood made some of the most famous B movies of the 1950s, including the final films of legendary ""Dracula"" actor Bela Lugosi. The film depicts how Wood was able to overcome many obstacles to get his films finished, including primarily his lack of financing (the film accurately shows his unusual funders, including religious groups who insist on Wood and cast/crew being baptized prior to filming), his odd group of semi-professional actors (many of whom, including Lugosi, had issues with substance abuse), and his fixation on angora sweaters and penchant for cross-dressing. A picture strongly emerges that Wood was a dreamer, a man who had all the passion and energy necessary for film-making but lacked the talent to make it work.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent all around. Depp makes his strongest impression as Wood, bringing manic energy and enthusiasm plus a charming lack of self-consciousness. Martin Landau was recognized by the Academy for his portrayal of the aging, morphine addicted horror legend Lugosi. He is alternately pathetic and majestic as the moment demands, leaving us with the sad impression of a giant who was not appreciated in his own time but whose own ego might have grown unrealistically in compensation for the fact. As Wood's first girlfriend Dolores Fuller (who later had a career writing movie tunes for Elvis Presley), Sarah Jessica Parker also leaves an impression as a woman determined to make it in the world and Hollywood but unable to cope with Wood's transvestitism or his weird group of friends.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes the film truly extraordinary is Burton's ability to capitalize on the opportunities the script provides for moments of both great sadness and great humor -- sometimes even in the same scenes. For example, Lugosi's scene in ""Bride of the Monster"" (""Home, I have no home!"") is used twice. First it is used rather humorously as we see Wood's enthusiasm for the scene (which has elicited laughter from many audiences over the years because of Lugosi's strained enthusiasm and the over-the-top sentiment expressed in the speech (""I will create a new race of atomic supermen!"") during the actual filming. Then we see him doing the scene on the street on a whim, Burton keeps the camera intently on Wood and Lugosi, but as he finishes the scene we pull back and see a crowd has gathered, and they are applauding. <br/><br/>Unfortunately there is a lot of wishful thinking in this film if you were to look at it as a true biography of Ed Wood. There's a tendency to go by the adage ""print the legend"". Lots and lots of stories have been circulated about Wood over the years, many outright false, and this film unfortunately repeats some of them. This doesn't damage its standing as a piece of entertainment but does damage its integrity as biography and also as art in some ways. The film labors to give a picture of Wood as a guy who had all the enthusiasm and passion but none of the talent to be a success -- unfortunately this is incorrect to some extent on both counts. For example in his memoirs Alex Gordon (who produced ""Bride"" with Wood) says that he moved in with Wood to work on projects in the early 50s because he wanted to be closer to Wood: he said he admired Wood's skill as a writer but that Wood had no self-discipline. He and others have commented on the fact that it was Wood's alcoholism more than any other factor which impeded his success in Hollywood -- Wood would often spend production money on alcohol for himself and the cast/crew and would run out of funds prior to completion due to all the parties. None of this is shown in the film; all we get is a card at the film's conclusion which implies that alcohol was only a problem for Wood after the events depicted in the film. However it is truly important in Wood's career and life -- producers knew about his substance abuse problems and it was part of the reason he was never formally employed as a director by AIP or Columbia or any other ""studio"". The film would make you believe that it was either dumb luck or Wood's lack of talent that kept him out of work. But in my opinion there were many less talented writers than Wood working for poverty row companies, and in fact Wood was hired by professionals like Ron Ashcroft and the famous stuntman Yakima Canutt to do script doctoring on B movies in his early years.<br/><br/>The issue of Wood's relationship with Lugosi is a far more serious departure from truth in favor of mythology, however. People may not realize it now, but there was definitely a time when many if not the majority of classic horror fans considered Wood partially to blame for Lugosi's demise, or at least for the declining quality of his films prior to his death. Many of the rumors which supported this former belief are untrue, but Burton and his writers have here substituted an equally untrue opposite myth -- a kind of image of Wood as an angel helping to rescue Lugosi from his addiction. In reality Wood and Lugosi were more like co-dependents, and it's highly doubtful that Wood did anything substantial to help Lugosi with his addiction. On the other hand Wood did do a lot of things to help Lugosi professionally, so to some extent those parts of the film (depicting Wood's role in Lugosi's TV career, for example) serve to correct a longstanding impression that Wood was just a leach on Lugosi in the dying giant's last years."
"johnnyboyz","8","1","1","8 December 2006"," A fascinating look at a fascinating story behind a rather fascinating director; could in fact be called 'Plan 9: The Making Of'.
","'Ed Wood' is one of those films that comes really close to making fun out of itself. Its Hollywood, behind closed doors setting is something that has worked really well when exploited by certain films in the past, namely 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'The Player' and it works just as well here, setting up a big, intimidating world in which the characters try to live in and break through in. One person unfazed yet totally oblivious to the fact he's living under these conditions is our hero; Edward Wood which gives the film a comic touch straight away.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with Edward Wood or if you've seen any of his films then it helps  big time. Although it's probably not necessary to have seen them all; the focus here is one what professional critics and analysers have dubbed 'the worst film ever made' that film being 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. I, myself, have seen the said movie and rated it 4/10, yes, it was bad what with the awful camera work, fake sets and props and woeful dialogue but to be honest; I've seen worse (Batman and Robin, anyone?).<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the film gives off a fantastic look at Hollywood itself. The sets, the extras, the studios  they all combine to create an interesting utopia or dystopia for some. The references to Boris Karloff and the actual inclusion of Bela Lugosi and his problems is a wonderful sub-plot that really hammers home the authenticity of the film. Another interesting reference is when Wood (Fantastically acted by Depp) is talking to Lugosi (Again, brilliant acted by Landau) about the horror genre and Universal horror in general. They mention 'traditional horror' which utilises buildings, shapes and the like to create an atmosphere; something that 'Ed Wood' director Tim Burton actually does and can be seen in films such as 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'Batman Returns'.<br/><br/>Because Edward Wood is supposedly the worst director of all time, we see film producers laugh at some of his work he presents them early on; not sure whether to laugh or not. This is an interesting, subtle hint at our own reaction. If we've seen any of Wood's work in real life (especially 'Plan 9') then we know how they feel; do we laugh or not. Is this meant to be serious film-making? This draws us in to the film and helps us relate to the producers.<br/><br/>The films is packed full of references to previous Edward Wood films and we really can see his masterpiece 'Plan 9' forming as the film progresses. Each thing he picks up on, from the first sight of Vampira to the fact a random guy happens to look like Lugosi with half his face covered up. It's really engrossing cinema and it's interesting trying to figure out what's true to life and what isn't. In addition, if you've seen 'Plan 9', then the shooting of it on set is just fascinating.<br/><br/>With some strong acting from everyone, even the supporting cast and some great content; 'Ed Wood' is, so far, my favourite biopic and is genuinely funny and entertaining. Although I hate to go away thinking this was merely exploiting the worst director of all time, I shall just suggest it's more of a warning of what not to do than anything else."

","Tim Burton put together an ensemble cast on one of Hollywood's enigma directors, Edward D. Wood Jr. Burton was daring enough to film this biopic in B&W. Normally, I would avoid such things. But, this was awesome. The tones, the textures, the lighting, the scenes are fabulous. All shot in a most excellent manner. And to add the superb acting of Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray, and Sarah Jessica Parker; you have the makings of a classic film. It's ironic because the story revolves around a writer/director/producer and some of the worst films every put to a theater screen.<br/><br/>Although parts of the story can be dreadful, like watching Bela descend into his addition to heroin, there are some very subtle moments which are just hilarious. Landau acts out a tour-de-force performance. It is simply uncanny how well he portrays Lugosi. It is no wonder he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>In conclusion, even if you do not like Ed Wood or have never seen any of his films, I would still think you could enjoy this movie. However, it is soooo much better if you have some background knowledge of what you're getting yourself into. This is, by far, one of Tim Burton's greatest achievements in directing. A bold step which most would not dare take."

The acting is done well as always, especially the intentional bad acting, which is harder than it looks. I liked the fact that it was done in black and white, it gave the movie an aged look which is exactly what it needed. Depp in drag was definitely one of the movies high points. Bill Murry played, as always, an unusual part which was very suited for him (if you get the Special Edition DVD you can hear him sing Que Sera Sera in a slaughter house). The guy who played Bela Lugousi looked a lot like Bela Lugousi. It was a frightening resemblance. The overall movie is really weird, and those who have seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory will realize that Depp's acting in Ed Wood is very similar to that in Charile. Very smiley, very happy. I recommend it to everyone, especially those who like Plan 9 From Outerspace, and Tim Burton movies. It won't disappoint."

","It's unusual. The critical consensus on the films of Tim Burton seems to always reach a level of love-it-or-hate-it polarization, and with a few exceptions, I don't necessarily consider myself a fan of his work (his films are artistically brilliant, but usually in service to half-baked screenplays), but ""Ed Wood"" is a film so unlike any other in his creepy-crawly back-catalog that it performs one feat of brilliance after another, fearlessly and joyfully, extremely and tragically. By taking some welcome liberties with the actual story of notoriously inept filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr., Burton transforms this film (photographed in black and white, with makeup and production design that echoes the 1950s perfectly) into a documentary that exists in the alternate universe of one man's mind, while simultaneously being the most down-to-earth film he's made, with moments of staggering hilarity, tenderness, and imagination. In ""Ed Wood,"" Burton finally has the balance of his creative, offbeat vision in conjunction with a strong script that matches it well. The polarization that marks his films makes the subject matter an ironic choice to tackle--author of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" reviled by many as the worst movie ever made, and with a penchant for dressing in drag to ""feel closer"" to women, Ed Wood is a character with a demeanor as unusual as Burton's, and maybe the ultimate posthumous tribute of this film is the manner in which it displays Wood's spirit, sincerity, and vision in spite of his poverty-stricken projects. Johnny Depp's performance as the never-discouraged (except when dealing with Baptist financial backers) director is carried out in a way that should render it a flaming caricature, but instead becomes something of genius; his Wood conveys a vibrancy and life that sees him through the difficult times of his relationship with aging Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau, who won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance) and girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker); when crew members complain about getting only one-hour's sleep during a grueling night shoot, Wood counters: ""I got no sleep, and I feel great!"" Such a mantra could be applied to Burton's execution of the film--despite its deliriously light fantasy, fiction, and occasional lapses into the surreal (even incorporating a scene where Wood has a chance encounter with his idol, Orson Welles), ""Ed Wood"" is driven more by character than style; it would be fair to say the two mix harmoniously to create a work of sheer brilliance and total entertainment. Though I first watched this film 10 years ago, each subsequent viewing has played as consistently as the first, and if that isn't a sign of quality in a world of paper-plate flying saucers, I don't know what is."

","This, is to me, Tim Burton's best film. Johnny Depp is phenomenal in his performance as Ed Wood. As,is the always wonderful Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. The scene where Bela greets the trick-or-treaters @ the door & most run away screaming,sans one smart-aleck kid who tells him, ""You're not scary!"" & then seeing the disappointment cross Bela's face Ed Wood then proceeds to pluck out his bridge from the front of his teeth & that sends the young boy screaming in the night. I really loved the great relationship that was shown between these 2 characters. And, I hope in real-life these 2 were as close as this film makes out & this isn't just Hollywood B.S. Great acting chemistry between Johnny & Martin. Martin so definitely deserved the Best Supporting Actor award that he won in '95 @ the Oscars. You really feel for the Bela character's trial & hellish challenge of trying to kick a 20 year plus morphine addiction. You almost begin to root for Bela's comeback after his stint in rehab, even though you know from past history that didn't happen.I love how he always found a way in several films to incorporate his Angora sweater into his films. Lisa Marie was great & memorable as Vampira. It's too bad Lisa & movie director Tim Burton are no longer an item as it was always interesting to see what role she'd take next in his next film. Helena Bonham Carter, Mr Burton's new gal-pal though a very good actress in her own right(check her out in Fight Club) but she just doesn't have that whole cult-actress appeal that ms.Marie has that was one of the things that made a die-hard Tim Burton fan look forward to future projects. Also, the rubber octopus scene where Bela fights it @ like 4 A.M. WITHOUT a motor to make it move was just pure genius & showed just how dedicated Mr. Lugosi was to his craft even as a burnt out drug addict. This also to me was Bill Murray's best performance as Bunny. Forget these recent films his best is right here. And, i also love the scene where Johnny Depp in high heels chases after his fed-up girlfriend in Sarah Jessica Parker. This is a great film even if you've never heard of Ed Wood.

","Ed Wood (1924-1978) is generally regarded as the single worst film maker to emerge from Hollywood. This is not really true, for there were and are aplenty worse. But one thing has always set Wood above the pack, and that was his own unshakable faith in his talent. Unfortunately, the faith was misplaced and the talent was nonexistent--and although this Tim Burton film takes a slew of liberties with the facts of Wood's life and career, it does a remarkable job of capturing them as Wood likely saw them through the filter of his own outrageous ego. The film has two tremendous assets: the performers and its visual style. Johnny Depp leads the cast in the title role, and it is a virtuoso performance, for he entices us to like a man whose self-blindness would normally lead an audience to reject him out of hand; the performance is incredibly witty, wildly over the top, and yet it contains just enough pathos to allow us to relate to Wood on a human level. But the real stunner in the cast is Martin Landau, who picked up a Best Supporting Academy Award for his performance as Bela Lugosi, a legendary actor who was very much a forgotten star (not to mention morphine addict) by the time Wood befriended him in the early 1950s.<br/><br/>As with Wood himself, the film plays fast and loose with the facts of Lugosi's life, but it nonetheless captures something very essential about both Lugosi and the Hollywood that destroyed him, something very elemental that transcends the weird comedy of the piece. And Landau gives the performance of his career; you truly believe that this is Lugosi before you, a strange but appealing mixture of faltering humanity and arrogance desperate for an audience now lost to him. Other memorable performances include Bill Murray as the inept and very la-dee-dah actor Bunny Breckinridge; Jeffrey Jones as The Amazing Criswell, popular ""psychic"" and occasional Wood actor; Lisa Marie as television's ""Vampira;"" and Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's fast wife and occasional actress Dolores Fuller. Indeed, there isn't a false note in the entire cast right down to the bit players and extras.<br/><br/>In terms of visual style, Tim Burton nails the very look of an Ed Wood film in glittering black and white--but working with a budget that Wood never dreamed of he merges it with a series of classic Hollywood idioms that lift the style out of Wood's unfortunately flat style and into the realm of high art. In both look and direction, I strongly feel that this is Burton's single finest film to date.<br/><br/>If the film has a flaw, it is that at times it recreates the flatness of an Ed Wood film a bit too precisely over too long a period--and the result can feel slightly dragged. And it is also a film that will register most clearly with those who have actually seen the films on which the movie focuses, so it may not appeal to the uninitiated. But for those who have the right eye, it is a remarkable film. Wickedly funny, unexpectedly touching, extremely memorable... and strongly recommended.<br/><br/>Gary F.

"mrgray83","9","1","1","10 February 2005"," One of the best movies I've ever seen.
","And quite easily one of the top 10 of the 90's. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood, Jr in Tim Burton's Ed Wood, which is a recreation of the now famed director's early plight into getting his films made. His films are shunned in Hollywood when they are made because they mostly contain stock footage and Ed Wood seems to have an obsession with doing only 1 take in his films no matter how atrocious the scene goes, telling everyone that 'It's Perfect' when it's anything but. As I've stated, I think that this is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's doesn't feed you a lot of nonsense like most of the films do these days. It tells what is pretty close to how I perceive Hollywood really works. I'm pretty sure they took some artistic liberties with parts of the story, because some things seem a little far fetched even for a film about Ed Wood's life, but all in all, I liked it. It's very well made. And Martin Landau should be applauded for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. Absolutely amazing. I recommend this film to any and everyone. Knockout cast. Knockout story.<br/><br/>I rate it 9/10"
"vertigofan-3","8","1","1","25 December 2002"," Sarcastic, inteligent and moving view on Ed Wood
","MY RATING- 8.0<br/><br/>To begin, it's a well-aclaimed mov here in Portugal and we have some Ed Wood moviegoers (thank god there isn't a lot!)<br/><br/>It's a damn well made mov, created when Burton had finished his personal Batman Returns, this one on the life of Edward Wood Junior, the worst director ever. Well I never watched a mov from Ed, and to be honnest, I don't intend to spend my money doing so. This mov spare us the torture of it, and Burton uses again his strange sense of humour to tell the story of a guy who was convinced that his movs were excellent. In a way, the message is given by Vincent D'Onofrio in a delicious cameo as Orson Welles- we must go through with things, even if they're bad as Ed's movs. As Ed, Johny Depp goes quite well, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker as the girlfriend who leaves him, Bill Murray (ultrafunny!), Patricia Arquette (very sweet), Lisa Marie Juliet Landau and Jeffrey Jones as the omnipresent Criswell. But the real surprise is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the horror star from 30's Dracula. Under his heavy makeup, we really forget we're seeing an actor, he truly looks like Bela! What a performance! Impossible not to sympathise with him, he even won the Oscar (which is quite rare in a Tim Burton mov).<br/><br/>Overall, this is a quite entertaining doc mov, and a interesting change on the director's career, that will please fans and nonfans."

","Ed Wood is one of those rare films that grows on you with each respective viewing, and since I fell in love with it the first time I saw it...it still gets better and better.  Who would have thought the career of one Edward D. Wood Jr. would become a household word practically?  I never would have believed it...but its true.  The director of such films as Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and his infamous Plan Nine From Outer Space is big business and world famous.  If you don't believe me, just look in any horror magazine or cult publication.  Why?  Give the credit to this film, Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and other actors, one oscar winner named Martin Landau, and one fantastically funny, sensitive and nostalgic script.  This movie has it all and it is a non-stop look at the movie business for the independent film-maker in the fifties who just happened to like dressing up as a woman and befriended interesting individuals like a man who wanted a sex change operation, a wrestler-turned-actor, a phony larger-than-life psychic, and of course one man named Bela Lugosi, forgotten by Hollywood but not gone.  Tim Burton wisely chose to do this film in glorious black and white, and the photography, lighting, and shading are first-rate.  The script bends the truth quite often about Wood and his cast of irregulars, but then again this is a film meant to entertain not instruct.  Bela, as far as horror icon Forry Ackerman knows...and who alive would know better...never swore so much as even saying a damn.  But Landau is so convincing as the aged Bela...rejected by Holloywood and lost to poverty and obscurity..that his performance has resurrected interest in Lugosi and his films, and for one time brought him more popularity than his horror crony Karloff.  This film is an experience and if you haven't see it...do so.  It is really as good as every one says."

","This movie was so good.  I was impressed with the look.  After all was said and done, Criswell looked much as he did in the movie.  Tor Johnson was played well(or real badly as was needed).  Overall Tim Burton builds a world that really existed, but cuddo's could not be held back from Johnny Depp and Richard Dryfus.  Richard filled out the story with his rendition of Bela LaGusse.  Bela was real, and unfortunately tragic.<br/><br/>What the movie really pulls off is to make the Ed Wood story plausible. One watches Glen or Glenda, Plan 9, or Orgy of the Dead and say 'movies this bad can't be made by accident.' But Depp makes the movie, with his enthusiasm, ignoring the obvious and simply his ability to sell an object that stinks.  This movie is worth your time because it is funny, sad, victorious and scandalous all at the same time.  What a hoot."
"Snrub","9","1","1","8 December 1998"," Oooh, I did love this film...
","I am a great fan of Tim Burton and this is one of his best works so far. The movie hooks you from the start and keeps you there until it finishes. Johnny Depp delivers a spectacular performance as Ed Wood as he has done in Edward S. The fact that it is B/W makes it extra special as many of the best movies made are B/W: Raging Bull and Casablanca for example. I do hope that Buton carries on making movies well into the millennium!"
"krumski","3","10","30","11 March 2000"," The charm and appeal of this film eludes me.
","I just don't get it. Why make a film which celebrates and nearly canonizes a bad filmmaker? I've heard some say that it captures his buoyant enthusiasm and never-say-die spirit. Commendable qualities, to be certain. But it doesn't change the fact that HE WAS A BAD FILMMAKER! And he wasn't bad because he was reaching for something greater than he could achieve, or because he deliberately reveled in camp and bad taste for its own sake (like, say, John Waters). Nor was it true that he was unfairly labeled and vilified by the Hollywood establishment because he flew in the face of their conventions (as such, the association that's made with Orsen Welles late in the movie is particularly laughable). No, the reason Ed Wood was bad was because he was just naturally inept. He had no idea how to appropriately construct a scene, how to direct actors, how to light a film set, how to. .. well, the list goes on and on. Basically, everything a director needs to know how to do - he didn't have the first clue about.<br/><br/>What's odd is that the film makes this abundantly clear. There's no attempt to portray him as a closet genius or an ahead-of-his-time visionary. Indeed, the scenes of him directing on a movie set have a kind of 'Saturday Night Live' sketch quality about them, as we watch disaster breaking out all around, and Ed blissfully sitting in the center of it, thinking it's all great. If the movie was constructed as an elaborate joke - a parody of a ""serious"" biography by the use of a laughably inappropriate subject - it might have worked (although even then, it would be a cheap joke - making fun of Ed Wood is about as bold as making fun of Pia Zadora).<br/><br/>That certainly seems to be the movie Johnny Depp thought they were making - his portrayal of Ed is so cartoonish and one-dimensional, with exaggerated snappy line deliveries straight out of a '40s B-flick, that it's a role Jon Lovitz - in full ""Yeh, That's the ticket!"" mode - could have done just as well. Director Tim Burton, though, as well as writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, want to find more here than just Ed's ludicrousness. I know this is their intention not because they've found it, but because the film is a leaden bore - so that tells me that it wants to be ""important."" First of all, it's filmed in black and white and we all know that represents high ""artistic"" aspirations. Personally, I think a movie glaring with bright and tacky colors would be the more appropriate way to commemorate Ed Wood's life. But then, I'm thinking of it as a comedy, and this film is serious, very very serious.<br/><br/>What it's serious ABOUT, I have no idea. The cruel and unfortunate fate of the talentless? But shouldn't those lacking ability fall to the bottom of their respective fields? Certainly Burton is not bemoaning the fact that Ed was not more successful in Hollywood: that it is precisely Wood's enthusiasm and determination which are the qualities most in  need to counteract the jadedness of the industry? My god, maybe that IS his point! But certainly there exist - and have existed - directors and creators of actual skill and talent who have possessed the exuberance attributed to Ed here. Why commend him on his personal qualities when he was such a washout in the field where he chose to employ them?<br/><br/>I don't know. Lots of people like this film. More power to them. Maybe someday someone will be able to explain to me its appeal in a way I can comprehend. All I know is that, at some point, I became impatient and frankly offended at having to sit through the exploits of a no-talent hack. Zeal and enthusiasm - yes, this movie convinced me that Ed Wood had them. But so, I'm told, does Charles Manson. And no one's suggesting we should make a celebratory biopic of HIM."
"writers_reign","4","3","7","20 September 2014"," Mr. Redwood
","Tim Burton who couldn't make a decent film if they reissued Citizen Kane and replaced the Orson Welles director credit with Burton has found a way to justify the semi-mediocre material he's been turning out for years by making a film ABOUT a lousy filmmaker so that at last he can say, hey, guys, this isn't ME, Tim Burton shooting this crap, it's Ed Wood, so gimme a break why don't you. Burton really hits one out of the park in terms of chutzpah and he's also great at giving the impression he shot Ed Wood for a stick of gum. Martin Landau more or less steals what there is to steal as Bela Lugosi and long-time collaborator Johnny Depp phones it in as the eponymous character, Wood. Apparently Burton was aiming for a comedy but let's face it, Tim old son, the laugh's on you."
"kenjha","6","3","7","11 December 2009"," Witless and Tiresome
","This biography of the unbelievably incompetent director of such atrocities as ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is meant to be a comedy but it's not funny. Depp brings a lot of energy to the title role, although he seems to be basically doing an impression of Billy Crystal. What, Billy wasn't available? Landau is OK as Bela Lugosi, but it's hardly a performance worthy of an Oscar. Burton operates under the premise that watching an idiot at work is so entertaining that no real plot is necessary. And he's right - for about ten minutes. After that it becomes tiresome and goes on far too long. In a small bit, D'Onofrio does an uncanny impression of Orson Welles."
"classicsoncall","8","2","4","22 February 2018"," ""All I wanna do is tell stories."" - Ed Wood
","I kick myself every time this happens. Why, oh why did I wait so long to watch this movie? It's a complete blast, hearkening back to one of my favorite eras and film genres, 1950's B grade horror and sci-fi, built around the legend and career of cult film favorite Ed Wood Jr. No doubt Johnny Depp is sensational as the title character, and Martin Landau is due accolades as well for his portrayal of horror film icon Bela Lugosi. Ed Wood takes a cue from his own personal film making hero, Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio), who advises the young director that ""Visions are worth fighting for"". Wood's vision produced such marvelous and demented films as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", ""Night of the Ghouls, and my personal favorite, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". <br/><br/>Director Tim Burton does a nice job of chronicling the film making career of Wood, who even with all the best intentions, couldn't produce a coherent film if his life depended on it. But they were certainly entertaining in a uniquely creative and humorous way. If nothing else of accomplishment, at least he extended the career of Lugosi, who in his later years descended into the throes of morphine addiction. I got a kick out of the way Lugosi dissed contemporary Boris Karloff any chance he got; it happened in the story at least three or four times. Personally, I enjoy the work of both actors, and it's probably a toss up as to which is the greater movie monster of all time - Frankenstein or Dracula. It's a tough pick.<br/><br/>The most ironic thing about this film is that it's better than anything Ed Wood Jr. ever made himself. However I will challenge the idea that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is the worst movie ever made by the Worst Director of all time. 'Plan 9' doesn't even show up in the One Hundred Lowest Rated Movies ever here on IMDb, and of the clunkers I've seen, I'd have to give the nod to ""The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot"" as the worst one I've ever seen, closely followed by ""Goke, Body Snatcher from Hell"". Now that I think about it, Ed Wood probably isn't the Worst Director of All Time either, though it's probably a distinction he wouldn't mind owning given the cult following that's been built around his reputation over the years."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","2","4","27 August 2005"," Tim Burton's best
","If you like outrageous comedies like Dr. Strangelove and The Loved One try Ed Wood.<br/><br/>It's based loosely on the life of Ed Wood, the crummy director of Plan Nine From Outer Space and other bombs. Wood was not only a lousy director he was a transvestite and the movie touches on that aspect of his life. He befriended Bela Lugosi when he was a has-been drug addict.<br/><br/>Despite the pathetic condition of Lugosi and the transvestitism of Wood, this movie manages to be touching and hysterically funny at the same time. It's a great character study.<br/><br/>This movie is loaded with terrific performances one after another from the major characters to the minor ones. Martin Landau won an Oscar for his portrayal of the aged Bela Lugosi. Johnny Depp does the best job of his career as Ed Wood. Bill Murray is hysterical as Bunny Breckinridge who wants a sex change. Sarah Jessica Parker as Delores Fuller, Ed's first wife and Patricia Arquette as Kathy his second wife are both great. Jeffrey Jones as Criswell is a hoot. Mike Starr as the foul mouthed producer Georgie Wiess is a riot. Lisa Marie as Vampira and George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson have to be seen to be believed. The script is just full of great one liners and the visual gags keep coming. You'll get to see the justly famous scene where Bela Lugosi fights a rubber octopus in a pond -- this scene alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Filmed in black and white with a terrific score by Howard Shore. Not many people have seen Ed Wood and it was a box office flop but it's Tim Burton's best film and one of the best ever. From the opening credits to the end, this film is flawless."
"stefannemanja7","10","0","0","7 July 2020"," About...
","Edward D. Wood Jr. must have been the Will Rogers of filmmaking: He never directed a shot he didn't like. It takes a special weird genius to be voted the Worst Director of All Time, a title that Wood has earned by acclamation. He was so in love with every frame of every scene of every film he shot that he was blind to hilarious blunders, stumbling ineptitude, and acting so bad that it achieved a kind of grandeur. But badness alone would not have been enough to make him a legend; it was his love of film, sneaking through, that pushes him over the top.<br/><br/>Wood's most famous films are ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (during which his star, Bela Lugosi, died and was replaced by a double with a cloak pulled over his face), and ""Glen or Glenda,"" in which Wood himself played the transvestite title roles. It was widely known even at the time that Wood himself was an enthusiastic transvestite, and when Tim Burton, director of the ""Batman"" movies, announced a project named ""Ed Wood,"" I assumed it would be some kind of a camp sendup, maybe a cross between ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Sunset Boulevard."" I assumed wrong. What Burton has made is a film which celebrates Wood more than it mocks him, and which celebrates, too, the zany spirit of 1950s exploitation films - in which a great title, a has-been star and a lurid ad campaign were enough to get bookings for some of the oddest films ever made. It was a decade when there were still lots of drive-in movie theaters, cut-price fleapits and small-town bijous that thrived on grade Z double features.<br/><br/>The people who made many of those films may have been hucksters and conmen, but they were not devoid of a sense of humor, and often their movies had more life and energy than their betters. America's theaters hadn't been centralized and computerized, and you couldn't book 2,000 screens with a single keystroke, and Ed Woods could thrive.<br/><br/>Burton's career has always shown a fondness for touching outsiders, like ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Batman"" and Jack Skellington (the lonely star of ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas""). In ""Ed Wood,"" he gives us a hero who is not merely an outsider, but one who attracts even more desperate cases to himself. Played with warmth and enthusiasm by Johnny Depp, Wood is a guy who simply must make movies - and who is so bedazzled by Hollywood legend that he mistakes poor Bela Lugosi, long past his prime and mired in drug addiction, as a star.<br/><br/>There are others who fall into his orbit: Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), a camp queen who would have stood out like a sore thumb in anyone else's pictures, but fit right into Wood's. And the amazing Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), amazing primarily for being able to find employment for no apparent talent. And Tor Johnson (George ""The Animal"" Steele), physically inept but gifted in Wood's eyes. And Vampira (Lisa Marie), the midnight movie hostess whose cleavage always looked clammy. And then Lugosi (a brilliant performance by Martin Landau), as a man who was half Wood's headliner, half his patient. When Wood assembled his casts, they looked like a cartoon portrait from Mad magazine.<br/><br/>In Burton's version, Wood is a man who not only accepts reality, but celebrates it. Far from being secretive about his love of dressing in women's clothes, he treats it as the most natural thing in the world, putting on an angora sweater, skirt and high heels to help himself relax while directing a scene. ""Are you a homosexual?"" he's asked. ""No!"" he replies cheerfully. ""I'm a transvestite!"" Depp plays Wood as a man deliriously happy to be making movies. He rarely makes two takes of the same shot because the first one always looks great to him. (In one take Tor Johnson misses the door and walks into a wall, shaking the set, but when the cameraman in amazement asks Wood if he doesn't want another shot, he replies thoughtfully, ""You know, in actuality Lobo would have to struggle with that problem every day"").<br/><br/>Wood's partner in his uncertain career is his long-suffering fiancee Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), whose misfortune is to view his situation clearly (""I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here""). She bravely tries to deal with his cross-dressing, however, and pitches in to act along with the usual gang (Wood's salaries were so low and infrequent that his actors bordered on volunteers).<br/><br/>I am uncertain how much of the movie is based on actual fact, and how much has been invented by Burton and his writers, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. But I relished the process by which Wood's project ""Grave Robbers from Outer Space"" became ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" after he raised the money from a church group which objected to grave-robbing, in the title, anyway.<br/><br/>There is a wonderful scene where Wood grows angered when the church leaders try to meddle with his vision, and stomps into Musso and Frank's legendary grill room on Hollywood Boulevard, wearing women's clothes and a wig. he spots Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio) alone at a booth, turns to him for encouragement, and gets it - along with the movie's funniest line of dialogue.<br/><br/>The movie's black and white photography convincingly recaptures the look and feel of 1950s sleaze, including some of the least convincing special effects in movie history. There are also running gags involving Wood's ability to write almost any piece of stock footage into almost any script.<br/><br/>At the heart of the movie is Wood's friendship with Lugosi, a man he truly adores, and who comes to depend on him. We see Lugosi alone and lonely in a flimsy little tract house, inhabiting the deepening gloom of his obscurity and addiction (his first scene in the movie shows him trying on a coffin for size), and Wood is able to lift the gloom, if only briefly, in a final series of roles which gave him double immortality: As the star of some of the best horror movies ever made, and then of some of the worst.<br/><br/>S."

Johnny Depp is so adorable in this role and it's great to revisit the time (that sweet nostalgic time) before the awful Burton/Depp combinations started flowing out.
I don't love SJP usually, but I have no problem with her in this. She suits the role and plays it well with the right balance of levity and silly drama.
All the actors play their parts well & Landau as we know is Oscar worthy as Lugosi. I LOVED the octopus scene it made me laugh out loud.
In terms of the film not being historically accurate I can't fault it on this point because it so clearly telegraphs to the audience that this is NOT intended to be an accurate portrayal of the events but a sensationalised and campy take on the events. What could have happened is likely more Interesting than what did happen. Save that for a proper documentary (which would also be great to see).
Well done Mr Burton and Mr Depp. I can only hope you're remembered fondly for these films & that history forgets the later dross and doesn't let it tarnish the fine work that came beforehand. Bravo boys."

","I'm usually not a fan of films that celebrate incompetence and I don't think I'd like Ed Wood's actual films, but this movie about him was very well made and quite entertaining. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the ""worst director of all time,"" and Martin Landau gives us a very touching portrait of Bela Lugosi in his final years, relegated to bad movies and addicted to drugs. This odd couple's chemistry together is special, and there is a charm to Wood assembling a cast out of other misfits and people he happens upon. The fact that he was openly a transvestite and explains that this doesn't equate to homosexuality was a great thing for 1994.<br/><br/>Burton made a great decision by using black and white, and he keeps this thing moving along with a pace that matches Wood's frenetic style. I think he probably glamorizes Wood a little bit, maybe because he was a fan and saw a parallel to himself, but it's not overdone. Contrast Wood's enthusiasm with one of the low-budget producers he runs across early on, who says ""I make crap"" and simply wants to make money - there are real comments about the motion picture business in all the fun and celebration of cult films. That rises to a crescendo when Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio) improbably tells Wood ""Visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?"" I would be more inspired if it was the story of someone with more talent, but I was touched by the man's optimism and spirit nonetheless."

","After having completed post-production on a documentary Tim directed interviewing Vincent Price on the set of Edward Scissorhands (I've tried so hard to find it; it's a lost document) he began production on a biopic of Edward D. Wood Jr., most fondly remembered as being at the helm of sci-fi cult b-movie classic Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959) and getting a reputation for being the 'worst filmmaker of all time'. It mainly focuses on the making of Ed's debut feature Glen Or Glenda (1953), Bride Of The Monster (1955), his friendship with legendary horror star Bela Lugosi and most entertainingly, his strong passion for filmmaking that wouldn't be diminished no matter what came his way. It was the perfect continuation of Depp and Burton's strong partnership, confirming them as one of the best double acts in cinema today. Martin Landau garnered much attention for his role as Lugosi and for very good reason; he is REALLY good! He captures the physical presence very well but also provides the melancholic backbone of the story along with Ed's desire to become a master. It features cool supporting performances from Sarah Jessica Parker and Bill Murray; also Patricia Arquette as Kathy who is great and accompanies Ed in his eternal optimism, the best and most inspiring quality of the story I think! It also marks Tim's first collaboration with Lisa Marie (here playing the sexy Vampira) and so began their relationship for 9 years! She was the inspiration for a lot of his artwork during this period including the look for Sally in The Nightmare Before Christmas. There are laugh out loud funny moments (my favourite when matey tries to get through a set door, completely missing it and scaring the hell out of Bela and the crew surrounding) and re-enactments of some 'so bad it's good' acting in Wood's films that is a real talent in itself for the cast here to make work.

"andrewburgereviews","8","0","0","21 March 2020"," To love and not be loved
","Edward D. Wood Jr., arguably the worst director of all time, was an optimistic man--he never filmed a shot he didn't like and that is something no other filmmaker can say. His will was nearly unbreakable, recovering from anything. His only perpetual shadow tormenting him was that, in the back of his head, he knew he is not made for movies.<br/><br/>The lack of reciprocity of the love he gave to the art-form is something which director Tim Burton hasn't focused on too much, but it was still felt even among the amount of inevitable comedy that came from his struggles to do whatever it takes to get a movie underway. Johnny Depp gave an Oscar-worthy performance as a misunderstood and strangely flamboyant man--Ed Wood liking to dress in women's clothing, but he was straight. His artistic vision was pure and innocent like a child--you can see it in Depp's performance every time Wood lets his imagination run rampant. Indeed, Wood was a very childish person, but not in the bad, immature way. The movie world fascinated him, he would express his innocence and child simplicity with every piece of work he puts out, the atrocious reviews representing his coming of age. Yet while Hollywood encourages childish and over-ambitious, unrealistic dreaming, it also requires a man's touch to transfer those dreams to the big screen. Ed Wood lacked this transition.<br/><br/>Wood went to great deals to execute the movies in his head. To look at the ridiculous lengths and compromises he did to ensure he can work is a thing of fascination. Looking at his career path, which involves getting finance from ridiculous places like a butchery or even a church makes it hard to believe that it was true--and voluptuously funny. More amazing is his circle of co-workers. It starts off pretty standard with his girlfriend, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), his second girlfriend after splitting up with Dolores, Kathy O'Hara (Patricia Arquette)--then it gets more interesting as he is joined by Vampira (Lisa Marie), a former talk-show host with a shtick for horror, The Amazing Criswell (Jeffery Jones), a fake psychic TV host, John ""Bunny"" Breckinridge (Bill Murray), Ed's close drag-queen friend, Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (George ""The Animal"" Steele) and many others. What an unbelievable and awesome circus-like crowd.<br/><br/>Yet among them was one more person. Retired horror movies veteran, Bela Lugosi. Ed Wood was fascinated with horror's mystery and mysticism and Bela Lugosi was an idol to him--despite everyone thinking he's dead. Martin Landau's performance of the late actor was a great tribute, Lugosi being a scene-stealer every time he would show up. Tim Burton portrayed his fall into loneliness, old age and Hollywood obsolete-ism better than it did its lead character's own struggles. Being the historical face of Dracula in Hollywood, Landau played Lugosi as a man who always stayed in character one way or another.<br/><br/>Of course, Ed Wood had another hero, the great Orson Welles. He would often compare himself to him in wishful thinking and although there was a scene in which the two met at a bar, in reality that never happened. Even if most his dreams remained dreams, after finishing ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and seeing a full crowd at the premier, Wood exulted, perhaps for the first and only time, a sense of accomplishment and self-satisfaction--""this is the one I will be remembered for""."

","Tim Burton struggles with tone and consistency. The film tapers off in the last 30 minutes, where a noticable tone shift and thematic repetition hampers the overall experience. Nevertheless, Ed Wood is easily Tim Burton's most personal film, drawing parallels between the biographical events depicted and Burton's own career - almost to a point that it becomes a contemplation of his philosophies and vision. Never have I seen a more well-crafted character in his filmography than the titular character, whose charm, quirks, and personality are presented with comedic deftness and great heart. The script, acting and direction hold up. It is easily one of Burton's best films and the most realized projection of his frantic ideas. It is a ode to filmmaking, creativity and the freedom of expression, meaningwhile pointing out the restraints of the filmmaking business that hamper such. A grossly entertaining film, Ed Wood deserves a check. I would rank it above Beetlejuice and below Big Fish."

","It is possible to look at ""Ed Wood"" as a sort of ""Sunset boulevard"" (1950, Billy Wilder). In this case not Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is the actress in her final days but we are witnessing the end of the career of Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). Indeed, Martin Landau is one of the gems of ""Ed Wood"" and rightly received an Oscar.<br/><br/>It is also possible to look at ""Ed Wood"" as a sort of ""Freaks"" (1932, Tod Browning). It is hard to believe that the collection of eccentrics in ""Ed Wood"" really were the casts of films such as ""Bride of the monster"" (1955, Ed Wood) and ""Plan 9 from outer space"" (1959, Ed Wood).<br/><br/>Possibly the best films to compare ""Ed Wood"" with are films such as ""Being there"" (1979, Hal Ashby) and ""The hudsucker proxy"" (1994, Ethan and Joel Coen). In all these films a man whose naivity is only surpassed by his enthusiasm is the main character. In ""Being there"" this man rises to a responsible position by accident. In ""The hudsucker proxy"" this man is (unsuccesfully) used as a strawman. In ""Ed Wood"" the main character doesn't reach a responsible position at all. Instead Ed Wood has the dubious honor to be elected as the worst film director ever.<br/><br/>The strongest point of the film is that it never ridicules its main character. Director Tim Burton treats Ed Wood really respectfully. He does so by emphasizing his enthusiasm above his incompetence. The film is also an ode to films of the 50's. Look at all the posters on the wall that come by during the film.<br/><br/>In ""Ed Wood"" Tim Burton proofs that a respectful treatment can be funny too. Look at the body language of Ed Wood and the ""no shaking"" gradually morphing into a ""yes nodding"" if a financier ones again makes impossible demands (such as asking the main role for his son or insisting that the film ends with an explosion). Look also at the meeting of Orson Welles (standing for the best director ever) and Ed Wood, both complaining about the way the Hollywood system treats them."

","Tim Burton's 1994 film Ed Wood is the perfect dramady. It balances a mostly true biographic feature on 1950's director Ed Wood' life with some comedic reshapings. The result, a fun Burtonesque piece that tickles your heart as you begin to understand and empathize with old Mr. Wood.<br/><br/>Ed Wood stars Johnny Depp in the titular role and features several other names well recognized today: Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Vincent D'Onofrio. The story arc covers several years of Wood's life. It begins with the events just preceding his directorial debut (Glen or Glenda) and ends soon after the completing of Wood's most infamous film, Plan 9 From Outer Space. Over the film's course, Wood realizes and answers his personal passion of telling stories through film. Sadly for Wood, he has not talent and refuses to take advice from anyone in the industry. In the end, just as in real life, Wood's films are lackluster and the target of endless mockery.<br/><br/>Burton's choice to shoot the film in black and white, mirroring the world Ed Wood created, was an interesting stylistic choice, but ultimately a successful one. The audience is deeply absorbed into the source material not only due to the visual elements. The old-timey movie cadence in which all the characters speak is immersive too! Every character is perfectly cast. Depp, for once, does not appear as a character created around his real-life persona. Instead, he feels authentic, as though he were Ed Wood in the flesh.<br/><br/>I am almost certain that The Disaster Artist, another more recent film which comedically dramatized a failed director, took several cues from Ed Wood. Gladly so, both films are triumphed and can stand more than one viewing. Kudos to Burton and crew for turning a poorly received director into a relatable and likeable figurehead that represents every artist's internal fears."

","This film tells the story of Edward D. Wood Jr; the man often described as the maker of the worst film in history. What Ed lacks in film making ability he makes up for with enthusiasm. When he can persuade anybody to let him make a film he works fast; never worrying about more than one take and shooting numerous scenes each day. As well as seeing his film making and attempts to get funding, we see insights into his relationships with two woman and his professional relationship with fading horror star Bela Lugosi.<br/><br/>This film could easily have been very mocking of Wood but director Tim Burton treats him with respect. Wood might not have been a good film maker but he strived to be and thought he was. He was also a transvestite in an era that such behaviour was considered a perversion but even this is shown in a matter of fact way leaving those who don't approve, excluding the girlfriend whose clothes he borrowed, looking more laughable than him. There is also a tenderness about his friendship with Lugosi. The cast does a fine job; most notably Johnny Depp who is on great form as Wood and Martin Landau who picked up an Oscar for his performance as Lugosi. Burton's decision to film in black & white works as it fits in with the films Wood was making. Overall I'd say this is a must see for fans of Burton and Depp... it even left me wanting to watch 'worst film ever' 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' again!"

","Tim Burton is mostly known for his whimsical arose animated films starring Jonny Depp. This film has all of these elements but in a far different context. An idealistic and pasty protagonist, a jaded or revolving door of love interests, and some high concept quest as the goal. Ed Wood desires nothing more than to be a successful film producer, director, and actor (and to wear women's clothing on his time off). He is met with failure after failure, between a complete lack of patronage and his relationship issues, but keeps on running. His haphazard dash toward whatever he sees as the finish line brings him into contact and friendship ( a loose term) with old film star Bella Legosi, famed for his role as Dracula. Ads complete lack of awareness of when it is an appropriate time to quit is refreshing, and the clean-cut nature of the roles everyone in his life plays keep an otherwise almost sad to watch series of failures moving at a happy and fun place. Tim Burton certainly knows how to deliver a movie that walks the line between obtuse and obscene and lightheartedly comedic."

","Back before the public seemed to generally go off the once-bankable combination of director Tim Burton and leading man Johnny Depp, they made 'Ed Wood,' the biographical drama of the now 'infamous' Hollywood auteur of the same name. If you know your film history, you may have heard of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space,' largely because it has often been heralded as the 'worst film ever made.' Personally, I think that's a little unfair as Michael Bay is still alive, but it's hardly a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It was Ed Wood himself who wrote and directed this *ahem* 'epic' which he basically blagged his way to get funded. Burton tells this story using Depp as the titular character. Who is also a cross-dresser. Did I mention that? Yes, not only does Ed Wood truly believe that he is destined to become the next Orson Wells, but he also likes wearing women's clothes. Cue Depp turning his quirky on-screen charm up to eleven.<br/><br/>For some reason, Burton chooses to shoot the whole film in black and white. At first some may find this a little weird and jarring, yet, before long, you probably won't notice that colour has been drained, especially when the 'films within the film' start rolling and you see Wood's sci-fi flick in all its colourless glory.<br/><br/>Yes, it's based on the real Ed Wood, but does that mean it's a true story? Well, it's as true as the next Hollywood 'true' story. A few liberties here and there have obviously been taken to further the plot, but, on the whole, it's reasonably accurate. You don't have to know much about Ed Wood or his work to enjoy this, you just have to appreciate a role that seems to have been written for Johnny Depp, who plays the man with so much wide-eyed wonder that you can't help but root for him, even if he probably hasn't got the talent to back up his ambition (but then that can be said for pretty much ever reality TV show participant ever).<br/><br/>Depp carries the film on his own, but, besides Burton's behind-the-scenes presence shining through, it's worth mentioning the bunch of misfits Ed Wood brings along with him, all of which are allowed to have more than one moment where they shine.<br/><br/>The real Plan 9 From Outer Space was a flop. However, it has since found an audience with the 'so-bad-it's-good' audiences, plus Burton/Depp's take on Ed Wood have furthered its reputation. You may not want to see the source material after watching this (although I did and I enjoyed – or appreciated at least – it for what it was), but the time spent with Depp and his band of freaks and desperates should keep you comically entertained with its mix of pathos and fluffy pink sweaters."

We see Wood (Johnny Depp) interact with his friends who among others include Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) the tired old film actor now watching his life fall down. The film showcases the making of Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and Plan 9 From Outer Space. It shows the films being made, it shows the scripts being written, and it shows the interaction between Wood and Lugosi. Now while it shows the making of the film it shows the mistakes made by Wood, and it shows his incompetence. For example there's a scene where Wood is acting in Glen or Glenda, then they see a police car and run away because they don't have a permit. So yes it's funny, and it's even endearing at times.

","One of the best thing Hollywood makes is films about Hollywood. Some may judge these movies like kind of acts of self-adulation, but the fact is that films dedicated to films making and even homage films about past stars and directors resulted into many remarkable creations from the classical Sunset Boulevard to recent films like Hitchcock to remember just the one recent film in the genre I happen to remember now. These films have in common a dose of nostalgia for the times past and a lot of respect for the creators who preceded them. Even when they contain a dose of critical nuances or they describe disputable characters in the history of American film making like is the case with Tim Burton's Ed Wood they still carry a dose of reverence and fraternity across the generation. All this is very visible in this film of Burton which is almost hard to believe that was made 20 years ago, so fresh and contemporary it looks. In Burton's filmography it may be one of the less 'rebelious' movies, yet it contains its dose of inventiveness and the sure mastering the skills of film making.<br/><br/>Ed Wood (the real character) was - arguably - the 'worst director' in the history of film-making. There are certainly many great contenders to Wood for this title. Most of the IMDb ratings for his movies range between 3 and 4, with a deep dive to 2.2 and a stellar 6.2 for one of his latest films. Yet Burton's film shows him as a man of passion, and a fighter with the system and the big studios sharks (BTW - I am waiting for a great film about Hollywood producers!). One of the scenes to remember in the film is the one of the meeting of Wood with Orson Welles. The (problematic) message of the scene is that all directors - genius or trash - had to fight the same problems and the same system. The difference between them is of course that one had a huge talent, the other had just a daring character and a charming personality that allows us to sympathize with him while he is following and partly achieving his dream of creating trash on screens.<br/><br/>It does help of course that the lead role is played by Johnny Depp, the permanent fetish leading star of Burton. He is rendering the character of Wood in its whole complexity, oddity, tenacity and charm. It is however the splendid re-enacting of Bela Lugosi by Martin Landau that caught my full attention. A great star of the horror-fantasy movies of the 30s, Bela Lugosi was all but forgotten, in poverty and sunk in drug addiction when Ed Wood re-discovered him in the 50s and allowed him a few last presences in his films. Ed Wood the movie is to a large extent the story of the friendship between the two men. Filming in black and white also gives style and quality to the film, and reminds us that The Artist may have rediscovered the silent film, but not the black and white movies. If Ed Wood did not create any quality on screen during his activity in Hollywood he has at least inspired a film which is much better than anything he made as a director."

","Certainly one of director Tim Burtons' very best films, ""Ed Wood"" takes an unlikely candidate for the feature film biography treatment: Edward D. Wood, Jr., a man who at least had the distinction of being voted the worst filmmaker of all time, and who had given us a movie that has been cited as the worst movie of all time, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". Mr. Wood wasn't bursting with talent, and worked with minuscule budgets, but he didn't let these things stop him from making the movies that he wanted to make.<br/><br/>Now, this isn't all-encompassing as a biography; it doesn't go into Woods' origins or childhood, basically focusing on his career. We see him as he starts on the stage and soon works his way into the motion picture business, choosing a project (to become ""Glen or Glenda"") that was near and dear to his heart. From then on, it's fascinating to watch as he goes through the process of filming another classic howler, ""Bride of the Monster"", and the notorious ""Plan 9"", and comes to be good friends with the drug addicted and impoverished horror icon Bela Lugosi.<br/><br/>It's to the credit of Burton and crew, such as production designer Tom Duffield and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, that this movie has such a wonderful look. Shot in black & white, ""Ed Wood"" is a delight in the way it takes us back to '50s era Hollywood and the prospect of shooting low low budget efforts back in those days. The story is compelling and just draws the viewer right in. Wood is an easy character to like; Johnny Depp is completely convincing as the man whose passion exceeds his abilities.<br/><br/>But Martin Landau and Rick Baker truly take your breath away with the way they bring Bela Lugosi to life. Landau immerses himself in the role, and Bakers' makeup is so perfect, that one can forget that they're watching a performance and totally buy that this is Lugosi. Both men definitely deserved the Academy Awards that they won as a result.<br/><br/>The entire cast makes vivid contributions, with many familiar faces on hand - Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller (Woods' girlfriend when we first meet him), Patricia Arquette a new acquaintance who becomes his wife, Jeffrey Jones the phony, priceless psychic Criswell, Lisa Marie as TV horror host Vampira, George ""The Animal"" Steele as Tor Johnson, Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks, Max Casella as Paul Marco, and Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge. (There are also cameos by the real Brooks, as a bartender, and Gregory Walcott, the hero of ""Plan 9"", as a potential backer.)<br/><br/>The scene where Wood runs into none other than Orson Welles (a very good Vincent D'Onofrio) is a true gem, especially when Welles bemoans the impositions made on him regarding his film ""Touch of Evil"".<br/><br/>We don't really learn that much about Wood by the time the movie is over, but it's entertaining enough to make up for that. A funny, and sometimes profane, script, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, helps, as does the obvious affection Burton has for his subject, right down to the way the opening credits are done. Fun music by Howard Shore is another heavy asset.<br/><br/>Anybody who enjoys old movies, B pictures, movies about filmmaking, or likes recreations of Hollywood from decades past is sure to get a real kick out of ""Ed Wood"".<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","Original, sweet-tempered and enjoyable movie, one of my favorites out of Burton's oeuvre. Ignored in life, mocked in death, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a real phenomenon in American cinema history, especially famous for his Z-budget filmmaking. Making a biopic about such a schlocky visionary reputed as the worst director of all-time is just a groovy idea, which only Tim Burton dares to do it.<br/><br/>Shot beautifully in moody black & white, the film centers on Wood's most ""prolific"" period, when he relentlessly churned out one movie after the next, from his 1953 beyond-awful debut ""Glen or Glenda"" to his ""groundbreaking"" 1959 sci/fi ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Paying a final tribute to this idiosyncratic director, Burton opts to portray Wood and his misfit menagerie in an over-exaggeratedly sympathetic way, not to depict the darker side of his life. The film ends before his slide into porn, misery and alcoholism. The film charts Wood's tragi-comic career: his flagrant ineptitude as a writer, producer and director; his efforts to beat the bushes for cash; his indifferent, hyper-enthusiastic and over-optimistic disposition against all kinds of professional and personal setbacks; his sheer passion and child-like naiveté; his transvestite tendencies with a particular taste in fluffy Angora sweaters, blond wigs and high heels; and lastly his strange friendship with 70-year old sepulchral Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi.<br/><br/>The film is hilarious and witty from beginning to end, especially the recreation of certain scenes from Wood's original work (e.g. Lugosi's fight with a flaccid rubber octopus puppet and graveyard scene of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"") are hysterically funny. But such a film desperately needs a some degree of gravity. The relationship and chemistry between Wood and Lugosi is the emotional core of the film. Johnny Depp gives a sympathetic and charismatic portrayal of Wood. But, this is Martin Landau who really steals the show, and he is the glue that holds the movie together. His performance is dazzling, conveying the ego, pathos, pride and real dignity of the former horror hero Bela Lugosi. This is the role which won him Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and he really deserved it.<br/><br/>To me, ""Ed Wood"" shows that life is not merely about success, fame or money; but rather about your creative spirit, and how much you cling to your principles and how much you love what you do. Burton portrays Wood as a winner, because he dared to make films yet he had absolutely no gift when it comes to filmmaking. Today, despite the fact that his films are used as a benchmark that the most awful films are measured by, that's not the problem at all. <br/><br/>The wonderful irony of the film is that it won two Oscars with the name ""Ed Wood"" written on it :)"

","In 1994,Tim Burton, the master of casting, directed the film Ed Wood. Despite critical praise,it didn't fare well at the box office and just barely got a DVD release. When people think of Tim Burton, they're more likely to think of films like Batman or the Nightmare Before Christmas. Personally though, I think Ed Wood is the best film Burton has made so far. Most of Burton's films are great simply because of things like the acting, the camera-work, the sets and the music, but Ed Wood is one of the few Tim Burton movies to have a great plot as well.<br/><br/>Ed Wood tells the mostly true story about the man who wanted to be just like his greatest hero, Orson Welles, but eventually became known as the worst director of all time. The film follows Ed Wood, played by Johnny Depp, as he directs three of his most infamous bad movies: Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Outer Space. Apart from Wood fighting his producers and arguing with his girlfriend over his own transvestitism, a very important part of the movie is Wood's relation with the former Dracula actor Bela Lugosi, played by Martin Landau. Lugosi has lost the shine he once had, and is now an aging drug addict. It is because of Wood, who becomes his friend and asks him to perform in his movies, that Lugosi begins to enjoy life again.<br/><br/>What makes this film especially great in my opinion, is that instead of mocking Wood over the many failures that he created, the film successfully portrays Wood as a kind and likable character. Normally, we'd hate him for making so many bad movies, but this film actually manages to sort of make you feel sorry for him. Of course, Johnny Depp's great performance is also a big step up. It's beautiful to see Wood being hooked by how perfect his own creations are in his own experience.<br/><br/>Great acting, great writing, great music, great cinematography, and above all, a lot of fun. It's everything that makes a movie great. I know this film came out a relatively long time ago, but I personally think it deserves a lot more attention. There are a lot of references to cinematic history that might distract you if you're not familiar with them, but even then, I'm still positive you will like this movie."

","Johnny Depp stars as Ed Wood, arguably the worst movie director of all time, in this amusing and at times, touching story of Ed's career in the fifties. Ed was an unparalleled optimist, enamored with movie-making; he possessed little talent, expertise, or money, but he and his little group of pals made cheap and very bad horror/sci-fi movies and loved it. The only star he ever worked with was Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), decades after his success as 'Dracula,' now drug-addicted and in failing health. Wood and Lugosi made several films together, the most (in)famous being, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" which was actually made after Lugosi's death.<br/><br/>Depp is extremely likable and sympathetic as the effervescent Wood. His quirky, driven personality and penchant for wearing angora sweaters seem entirely believable. Landau won a Best Supporting Oscar for his portrayal of the washed-up Lugosi; he's pathetic and grotesque and absolutely mesmerizing. Watching Ed throw together a whole movie in a few days is hilarious. For Ed, quality was in the mind of the beholder and he loved his movies.<br/><br/>This is a sweet, amusing, lightweight tale about a fascinating Hollywood character that may inspire you to see some of his movies.

","Unlike most of the people, i heard about Ed Wood before i heard about this movie. Somebody recommended to me Plan 9 From Outer Space, and i watched it. It was clear to me : this movie was one of the worst, if it's not the worst, movie ever. The realisation, the acting, EVERYTHING was poor! Almost a year after i decided to watch Tim Burton's Ed Wood. This movie is fabulous, and is the best work of Burton. Johnny Depp is incredible in the role of Edward Wood Junior, and Landau is perfect in Bela Lugosi. I know that the events of the movie are not really the same that really happened, but after seeing it, you cannot hate Ed Wood.<br/><br/>You better watch it after seeing Plan 9, or reading a little bit about Ed Wood."
"TOMNEL","9","0","0","9 June 2010"," An all too often forgotten Tim Burton classic.
","A black and white film about a horrible filmmaker made in the 1990s obviously wasn't going to shatter any box office records, or for that matter even break even. This movie in fact seemed to be forgotten and is never mentioned when mention of Tim Burton comes up. Despite the fact that this is possibly Burton's least known film, it is definitely one of his best. This is an outstanding comical character piece with stellar camera-work and direction, not to mention a cast that brings these oddballs to life.<br/><br/>The film follows Edward D Wood Jr. (Johnny Depp), the wannabe film director/writer/actor who worked his butt off to become recognized. It takes place from 1953 to 1959, and goes from Wood's meeting and friendship of Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) to the making of Wood's best known film ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".<br/><br/>This movie manages very successfully to be both funny and somewhat realistic. Mr. Depp gives an exaggerative performance at times, but is the performance unbelievable? Nope. And he never drops out of character either, so it just makes us believe Wood was a bit loony, but still likable. Martin Landau knocks his performance out of the park with his Academy Award winning performance as Bela Lugosi. Again, this character might be a bit exaggerated, but it still always feels real, and Landau plays on the Bela's frailties and emotions perfectly. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are good as Wood's love interests throughout various points of his life also. The only cast member who may have been a tad bit unbelievable was Bill Murray as Bunny, Wood's eccentric manager. His performance was too goofy to believe sometimes. Nonetheless, still stellar performances.<br/><br/>The direction and camera work is really good, as is the lighting. The black and white accentuates the backdrops and scenes and also helps make this thing look really great. And to make the scenes even more lush, Howard Shore replaces Danny Elfman as the score composer, and makes the score just as good as Elfman would have likely done (No offense to the very talented Danny Elfman). The score which switches between corny sci-fi theramin score and beautiful brass and strings is just really fitting music for the film. <br/><br/>Episodic plots can become boring because they just go from one place to another and never set roots, but this movie is never boring. It's interesting to see the processes this guy had to go through just to make no budget films, and it's interesting to see his home life. It seems overall, Wood was an interesting fellow.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a really interesting movie, with enough humor to make it interesting, but not too much to make it stupid. And Johnny Depp's weird performance as Ed Wood doesn't stop the film from actually having a good amount of emotion and sentimentality. Definitely one of Burton's best films!<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. Rated R."
"aefrench","8","0","0","4 April 2010"," A very good film about a very bad director
","When you hear names like Ford, Hitchcock, Scorsese, and Spielberg in discussions about who the best director in movie history is, you are not going to hear the name Ed Wood mentioned with them. Edward D. Wood, Jr. is considered by many to be the worst director ever, and this film tells his story.<br/><br/>Set in Hollywood in the middle part of the 1950s, Wood's goal is to direct, following in the footsteps of his hero, Orson Welles. He embarks on his quest, and at this time happens to meet the legendary Bela Lugosi, who has no money and has been battling a drug addiction for many years. The two become friends and eventually collaborate on several Wood films.<br/><br/>With Lugosi in the mix, Wood and his group of friends begin filming movies that have been rated among the worst in cinematic history. However, the young filmmaker has a never give up attitude. He loves the movies, and feels that this is his calling, and just keeps working.<br/><br/>The movie is very enjoyable to watch. The acting is very good, with Johnny Depp doing a great job as Wood, and Martin Landau giving an unforgettable performance as Lugosi. Landau would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role, and it was deserved. The script is well written, with several memorable lines spoken throughout the film's duration. Not only that, the characters are interesting. None of them are weak. The opening credits pay homage to the movie's main subject (you'll understand if you've seen Wood's movies. If you haven't, you'll see what I mean later in the film). Fittingly, the movie, like all of Wood's, is shot in black and white. ""Ed Wood"" is an example of quality movie-making. Directed by Tim Burton, who deserves praise for this film, ""Ed Wood"" is a movie that you should not miss."
"Samiam3","8","0","0","3 April 2010"," Smart story of a famed moron
","If Uwe Boll makes another film he might steal the title, but so far Edward D. Wood Jr. is the biggest dumbshit to step behind a camera, common knowledge. If the Razzies began thirty years earlier, he'd win them all. It is ironic then that he is gone but NOT forgotten. Forty years later, a film maker by the name of Tim Burton (who needs no introduction) began making a name for himself. Contrary to what many think, Burton is not always colourful and bright. His early work is very dark, in fact his only film with a warm heart was Big Fish. Edward Scissorhands maybe, but it was still a dark tale. <br/><br/>Burton knows exactly what he is doing. To make a movie about B- movies is not enough, the film itself has to look like a b-movie. The first step of course is too put it in black and white. The next step is to have everyone overact, which rarely works, but it's perfect here. Then add a lot of satire, such as the kind of random music quese that draw attention to themselves.<br/><br/>Few actors are as diverse as Johnny Depp. He truly captures the essence of a moron, but he is almost upstaged by Martin Landau, as Bela Lugosi. The movie covers only a short chapter in Ed Wood's life, but probably the most important. In 1952, with funding of the LA Baptist church, he made Plan 9 from Outer Space (also needs no introduction). It was a triumphant moment for Ed Wood, (or so he thought). The movie ends there, but you won't forget it.<br/><br/>Though it is not Tim Burton's Cinema D'auteur, if looked at in a different perspective from his other films, one could argue that this is his smartest film."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","0","7 July 2009"," One-of-a-kind biopic might be Burton's best
","It might forever be known as Tim Burton's most ""normal"" film, but that doesn't mean ""Ed Wood"" is your traditional biography. Burton's obsession with giving things other-worldly qualities simply takes on a different form as it tells the story of acclaimed ""worst director of all time,"" Edward D. Wood Jr., played by Burton favorite Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Wood was a forgettable B-movie director until his naming as the worst of all time a couple years after his death in the '70s gave him a cult following. Burton tells his story in a fitting black and white form that uses both B-movie and classic techniques (in addition to a score with some classic themes by Howard Shore) as an appropriate ode to the director. It's partly fascinating because you want to know why Wood was the worst and how someone who is the worst is motivated to make movies.<br/><br/>For the first time in Depp's career, he gets to really show what he's capable of in a leading role. Depp brings this naive charisma and desperation to make motion pictures however the heck he wants to Wood, who clearly had to have had a few screws loose to make the movies he made. Since Wood also took pleasure in dressing up in womens' clothes, particularly angora sweaters, this adds another quirky dimension to the film that most would recognize as more up Burton's alley. Depp plays those scenes with a silly modesty.<br/><br/>But the dimension that really makes this one of Burton's best films, if not the best, is the brilliant subplot of the relationship between Wood and horror icon Bela Lugosi played marvelously by Martin Landau. Lugosi was aging, getting senile and addicted to morphine when he met Wood and so Landau's performance is the most hysterical and touching of all the roles in the film. He's self-centered and curses a lot, but you can tell that making movies was his life too and how his time out of the spotlight crushed him emotionally. An Oscar much deserved.<br/><br/>With the feel of an old-time movie yet the insight of a modern one, ""Ed Wood"" is as unique a film as they come. Not quite comedy and not quite drama, it is both a satire of Hollywood and light-hearted examination of the business while also getting at what it takes to make movies and why people are so impassioned to do it. In a way, it's Burton's justification of his bizarre style of film-making, though in my opinion he need none."

","Ed Wood, the movie, is an homage to two quirky, dedicated idealists of the silver screen, the director Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) and the actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). It seems to set up as a comedy initially, as we watch producer-writer-director-actor Ed learning the ropes of Hollywood —he's the epitome of the independent filmmaker, operating on a wing and a prayer—and struggling to make ends meet. Right off the bat we learn Wood has a fetish for wearing women's clothing, which really isn't supposed to be funny by itself, but it fits with the sort of lovable offbeat losers he seems to like to surround himself with as cast and crew.<br/><br/>So Wood is going about his business in LA and has a chance encounter with Lugosi, who is doing a promotion for funeral caskets. They get to know (and like) each other as people. Wood is a huge fan, having grown up in the archetypical small town of Poughkeepsie, New York, where he relished the movies... particularly the classic 1931 Dracula in which Lugosi stars, and for which he acquired fame and some degree of fortune. These two men come to have a deep respect for each other, and Ed Wood the Movie does an excellent job of making that respect real.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.<br/><br/>Brian Wright Copyright 2009"

Johnny Depp showed great talent in playing Ed Wood, and all the supporting characters were also just as good, especially the Bela Lugosi character. Even though it was inaccurate in the portrayal in that he died a lonely man, I still think it was wonderful acting and a perfect cast. This is one of my favourite Tim Burton films, and I feel he has outdone himself. My favourite thing about this film was the heart Ed Wood had. I also loved the way they made a lot of subtle jokes, such as, ""Wow, you could make a whole film out of all this stock footage!"", and how the funders of plan 9 noticed the mistakes and Ed said no one would notice after he edited the film.

The first is that I'm collection the Top 250 on DVD, and the second is that I'm a fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton (no, not one of those fans who think he's god because they think he directed The Nightmare Before Christmas, I'm the kind of fan who watched movies like Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks! when I was a kid. I was very happily surprised at how much I loved it.<br/><br/>So why do I love it so much? Well, even I'm not 100% sure of that. I guess it mostly comes down to how much I liked seeing the story of a man that was so genuine a man who wanted to make movies because it's what he wanted to do, not because there was so much money in it. The fact that it's brilliantly quirky and fun definitely would have helped. It also had the great acting behind it, with Johnny Depp doing a great job as the awful director, Edward D. Wood Jr., and Martin Landau doing an absolutely awesome job as horror legend Bela Lugosi.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how accurately it portrays Wood. I don't know much about him outside this movie, and I haven't seen much of his work (other than Bride of the Monster). It's clear that the movie is biased towards Wood, but that doesn't stop the movie from being incredibly entertaining, wonderfully weird and just very well made overall. It has a great score as well! In the end, it's just a very pleasant movie that I instantly fell in love with."

","Some movies are like late Beatles- Songs, you have to listen to them quite a few times to get to fully appreciate their greatness. For example, most movies by the Coen Brothers are like that. Also, Terry Gilliam's work is a little hard to get at the first time. Ed Wood by His Royale Weirdness Tim Burton is another example. When I watched it the first time I thought ""Nice movie"", now it's one of my all time favorite movies. And I will tell you my reasons: Johnny Depp seems to have lost himself completely in his character. His performance is simply adorable. He maximizes the fun of the screenplay in every scene. Just remember when the baptists tell him that they find the title ""Grave robbers from outer space"" blasphemies, and they'd rather call it ""Plan 9 from outer space"". Ed Wood's answer is just ""That's ridiculous."" The way Depp says this one liner makes me give myself away every time I watch it.<br/><br/>Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi is a blast. It's a miracle how he looks just like him, his accent is amazing and his mimic completes his perfect performance.<br/><br/>Sarah Jessica Parker is also great (her best role till today). Still she couldn't even closely play Dolores Fullers roles in Glen or Glenda or Bride of the monster as badly as the original Dolores (believe me, I saw her).<br/><br/>Bill Murray's performance is a little hard to describe. He actually manages to overact using his usual minimalism, which is kind of weird but still he's fun to watch.<br/><br/>The story itself couldn't be better. Ed Wood is a very likable character. He's so positive and dedicated to everything he does (like directing, writing, acting AND producing) even though his career is one big failure. His movies are considered to be the worst of all time, but in spite of his total lack of talent he somehow manages to raise up enough money to do his next film, of course not exactly without having problems on the way down the road.<br/><br/>If you watch an actual Ed Wood movie you can't deny that there's a certain production value in most cases. It's just the little details (besides the plot, of course) that make us laugh. Just like in ""Ed Wood"". So if you didn't like, give it one more chance or maybe two."

","I'd always wanted to see this movie, but I'm kind of a cheapskate and I always wait for movies to be on cable. Well, they just showed it and I felt compelled to write this review because of how good it was. The movie is of course about who's considered yo be the worst director of all time: Ed Wood. And believe me, the guy sucked . They showed his movie ""Glen or Glenda"" the other day and I started watching, but after 15 minutes I changed the channel. <br/><br/>Right off the bat you must be thinking: ""Why would anyone make a movie about this guy, and why would anyone wanna see it? The answer is that Tim Burton made this film, and the guy has made an art of making good, enjoyable films about weird subjects.<br/><br/>The genius of Tim Burton is that he can take something, or someone, ugly or unattractive, and shift your perspective, so that you can appreciate that very same thing from another angle and say: ""I'd never looked at it that way, it's not so bad after all"" When I finished watching this movie I thought: ""Well this guy was really a big loooser. He was a fool with not an iota of talent in his whole body, BUT at least he was passionate about what he was doing, and he refused to quit his dreams at the first sign of trouble"" Tha's more than you can say for many people out there<br/><br/>This is NOT to say that he idealizes Ed Wood throughout the movie, or that this is just a silly comedy about a dumb guy. This is Burton's labor of love. You can see how much he cares about the Ed Wood character. You might even say that he ALMOST looks up to the guy. But at the same time, he makes sure not to make the movie sappy or cartoonish, which is what a less skilled director might have done. Critics talk about ""restrained performances"" I'd say this is an example of ""restrained directing"" <br/><br/>The movie is perfectly casted, down to the smallest roles. Johnny Depp, who has also made an art of playing far-out characters and making them very watchable and endearing, is almost flawless as Ed Wood. Martin Landau s also good as Bela Lugosi. Probably scenery-chewing a couple of times in the movie, but still a good enough performance to win an Oscar. I also liked the chemistry (and the whole mentor-father thing) he had with Depp. There's also Sarah Jessica Parker as Woods first wife, Sarah Jessica Parker as his second wife, Bill Murray as a close friend. and a bunch of other actors who did terrific work.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact hat the movie doesn't dwell on any of the heavy stuff of Ed Wood's life, like the fact that he was a cross dresser (when asked why he does that, he just replies: ""makes me feel good""). By the way, I believe that one of the reasons many people did not go see this movie was because of the TV promos, which showed Jonnhy Depp in a dress. I bet folks saw this and thought: ""Oh darn, this is a movie about a transveti or something"" Having said that, this is not a movie I'd take children to. There's no sex, but I just don't think kids would enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>To sum up, I'd say this is probably Tim Burton's best movie to date. And if you know anything about director's, you know that's saying a lot."

","Edward D. Wood, Jr. was posthumously labeled the Worst Director of All Time. And when one looks upon his motion pictures, such as the infamous Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), even if you find yourself enjoying the movie as a guilty pleasure, you can easily see why. That's really the only reason why he's famous today and why this Tim Burton biopic was even made. Ed Wood cost more to make than all of the real man's movies put together, but it does do the story justice if it is slightly fictionalized.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with the story, Edward D. Wood, Jr. (played by Johnny Depp) was a young transvestite filmmaker during the 50s who was marked by his laughable production values and even more so, his ambition. He stopped at nothing to gain money to make his flicks and also during that time, befriended Dracula (1931) star Bela Lugosi, played here by Martin Landau in a hands-down brilliant performance that won him an Academy Award.<br/><br/>There was only one thing I admired about the real Ed Wood and that was his ambition. It was most certainly not his movies. Burton's biopic wonderfully reenacts Wood's passion for movie-making in an inspiring method. Film critic Gene Siskel called Ed Wood ""one of the year's very best"" and hoped that it would inspire ambitious filmmakers to ""follow their dreams"". And I could not agree more with him on that regard. I did not like Ed Wood as much as him, but I agree that it is one of the great movies about movie-making.<br/><br/>Appropriately, Ed Wood is shot in black-and-white; a brilliant decision since it captured the atmosphere of Wood's scenario and also because it's hard to imagine what Bela Lugosi would have looked like in color seeing as how he passed away before even appearing in one. It gives the movie a documentary-like style, which is also truly effective seeing as how it reflects upon the past. Performances all around are very good, especially Martin Landau. I was truly amazed at how well he mimicked the real Bela Lugosi's accent and mannerisms without becoming unintentionally comical. Johnny Depp was also very good as the optimistic Ed Wood. There are many other famous names in the film such as Bill Murray, but because they play characters exactly opposite of their mainstream course, we buy them for people, which is what any movie should do.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Ed Wood is a very good film by Tim Burton. There were some parts, mostly emotional scenes, that I felt were not carried long enough into the running time, but other than that, it is a pretty much flawless and solid Tim Burton movie effectively blending drama and comedy together along with inspiring a new generation of people to take the challenge and follow their dreams of becoming filmmakers."

","As a B-movie lover, I was attracted to Plan 9 from Outer Space because of it being called the worst movie of all time, and Ed Wood as the worst director of all time. If I remember correctly.<br/><br/>This approach to Ed Wood was wrong, apparently. This movie sure made me reconsider a lot of things about the man and his artistic vision.<br/><br/>Surely enough - he was a pretty incompetent director. His movies are proof of that. Yet - once I watched Glen or Glenda, I began wondering whether I had misjudged the man and his output. Mainly because the love for his craft was perfectly obvious, in spite of all of his technical mistakes.<br/><br/>Leave it to Tim Burton to tell the story about a misfit, surrounded by misfits, who is trying to make a sense of a world that can't understand him at all. Burton's love for movie-making is reflected on Ed Wood's love for movie-making - and it results in an extremely uplifting movie, which makes anyone reconsider their previous stance on Wood. No longer is he the laughingstock of Hollywood - he is, thanks to Johnny Depp, a real human being, with real feelings, fighting for a chance to make his dreams come true.<br/><br/>I never saw Ed Wood the same way after this movie - now, whenever I watch Plan 9 or Glen or Glenda I enjoy it in a different way. No longer do I believe they are the worst movies ever made; far from it. I'm willing to believe many other Hollywood ""blockbusters"" hold this distinction, if only because the people who made them lost their respect and love for the movie-making art.<br/><br/>Thanks, Mr. Burton, for setting the record straight."

","ED WOOD is essentially a biopic about a guy who is listed as the 'Worst Director of All Time' and whose biggest movie PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE was labelled 'one of the worst movies ever made'. So there's no reason why this wouldn't generate a significant cult following, as viewers would flock to it 'just because...'.<br/><br/>The movie itself, shot entirely in black-and-white, is pretty decent. The screen writing is above par and goes to great lengths to examine the complexities of directing and producing a movie with little or no capital at one's disposal. Tim Burton was suitably billed to direct this feature, and his homage to the vintage science-fiction/horror is a testament to fine movie-making. To me, Burton is just one of those guys who revels in the extraordinary.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is brilliant as the cross-dressing, mediocre writer/director/producer/actor Ed Wood who became renowned for the unbelievable speed with which he shot movies (not bothering to re-shoot scenes even where there are obvious flaws), but to me, the real star of the show is Martin Landau, who plays the once famous Bela Lugosi, a man who is now aging, addicted to morphine, and haunted by loneliness and lost fame. Landau deservedly picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and, as Lugosi, steals almost every scene in which he appears, such that there is a considerable drop-off in excitement every time the movie switches focus away from his character. This leads me to wonder if the film should have focused more on Lugosi than Wood...<br/><br/>The costume design, set design, and makeup are simply superb, and the Oscar won for Best Makeup was well-justified. Film-makers in the future would do well to follow the design aspects of this Motion Picture.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie is slightly better-than-good, but rarely reaches the pinnacles of greatness. The nature of the subject will undoubtedly continue to draw a serious cult following and it is no surprise that this movie is featured in IMDb's Top 250 (as I write it stands at #192). The movie is quite entertaining and watchable for most of its ~125 minute run-time.<br/><br/>Deserving of 3 stars (out of 4) and a rating of 8/10. I have no problem placing this film in my 'Honourable Mention' list. Recommended."
"rnakamur","10","0","0","14 October 2008"," For Love of the Movies
","This is Tim Burton's finest film, and oddly enough is the best movie about the the film business since ""Sunset Boulevard."" But consider for a moment the differences. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is about the industry, a play of metafiction with Gloria Swanson essentially playing herself, and Cecil B. Demille and Erich von Stroheim essentially playing themselves, drawing dark ironies to indict the Hollywood world. Everyone knows it'll go down as one of the greatest films of all time, and the definitive picture about Tinseltown.<br/><br/>But ""Ed Wood"" is about film-making, a passion for the craft, the resilience to chase a vision, and the deep reverence for stars we adored but never really got to know. But we do have the fortune of getting to know renown horror actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau, in an unforgettable performance) as a deeply-flawed morphine addict. He's prideful, lonely, and warped by the industry similar to Swanson's Norma Desmond.<br/><br/>Except now we don't have William Holden's Joe Gillis around to exploit the fallen star. In ""Ed Wood"" we have Johnny Depp, in one of his greatest, most moving performances as the famed bad filmmaker Wood. Unlike the conniving Gillis, Wood is kind and unconditionally loving, but just plain untalented. That doesn't matter, though. We come to love him quickly because of his humility and optimism-- two traits so often overlooked in today's protagonists. (An odd coincidence that Forrest Gump was released the same year!) The film didn't do so well at the box office for many reasons. Most notably, it is marketed as a comedy. And yes, it is a comedy. But it's funny because it's got heart, not for the screwball sarcasm you'd expect from the director of ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Batman."" You can see Burton pouring his heart and his pain into characters, the way he did in his more personal masterwork ""Edward Scissorhands."" In this film, you laugh at Ed Wood because he's a quirky yet likable guy. But you love him because he's got dreams. He tries really hard and chases down his passions the way Orson Welles did, the way many of us wish we had the guts to.<br/><br/>The film is a triumph on many levels. Stylistically, it's an homage to the great sci-fi chillers and monster movies of the 40s and 50s like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers"" ""Frankenstein"" and (of course) ""Dracula."" Actors deliver their lines in hammy fashion, with theatrical gestures and overactive enthusiasm. Shot in B&W, the opening with Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) emerging from a coffin to give a prologue is ingenious, as are a montage through a miniature set with gravestones and saucers hung up by fishing wire, and an end credit sequence that concludes with a placard reading ""Filmed in Hollywood, CA, U.S.A."" This film loves the movies and loves its history.<br/><br/>But it's a winning film mostly because of Depp and Landau. They are friends in the way that so many of us wish relationships could be-- a person who loves us for exactly who we are, no matter how imperfect-- who stands beside us even when everyone in the world says we're no good or we're a has-been. There's a scene at about the 1/2-way point where Wood tells Lugosi, ""Sorry about asking you to climb into that ice-cold pond at 3 in the morning. A man as great as you should never have to do something like that."" Without skipping a beat, Lugosi smiles and says, ""Eddie, there are only a few people in the world I would do it for."" That's friendship. It baffles me that in an age of cinema when characters and relationships are so devoid of depth, a film like this hits it right on the head.<br/><br/>The final scene is a stunner in the great tradition of Hollywood endings. Wood has just screened his masterpiece ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" which he dedicated to Lugosi. Most people know he was likely booed out of the theater. But Burton wisely skips over that portion and shows Wood scurrying out under the marquee hand in hand with his girlfriend Kathy (Patricia Arquette). It's raining and as he approaches his convertible parked out in front, he says, ""Honey, let's get married! Right now, let's go to Vegas!"" Kathy says, ""But Eddie, it's raining and the car top is stuck."" Wood smiles and says ""Phooey, it's only a five hour drive and it'll probably stop by the time we get to the desert. Heck it'll probably stop by the time we get around the corner. Let's go..."" This moment defines Ed Wood, perhaps not as he was in real life, but as we've come to know him in the film. He's an optimist. Who cares if he was the worst filmmaker of all time? He's full of hope. And full of love. What more can we ask for from a film, or from a person?"

","A masterpiece of weird cinema, Tim Burton has made his own masterpiece that I don't believe will ever be topped. Taking the true story about a man who was considered the worst of his field, Burton creates a creepy, bizarre, almost disturbing world of the underbelly of Hollywood in the 1950s. This was the part most people don't remember but it was there. The story is incredible as we watch this enthusiastic, positive man try to get his dreams accomplished at any cost.<br/><br/>All elements work perfectly together here. The acting is top-notch with Johnny Depp giving maybe his best performance ever, Martin Landau stealing the show in an Oscar-winning performance as the legendary vampire actor Bela Lugosi, along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Bill Murray and many others giving real, believable performances in bringing this strange group of people to life. What may be the most amazing part about this movie is how well Burton is able to create the remaking of Wood shooting his movies. Every scene feels real, vivid, and completely accurate.<br/><br/>In short, this is the best Burton movie as well as the best Burton/Depp collaboration. In a way this is so different from anything Burton did before or has done since. This is the most sincere, realistic movie he has done and while I admire his off-beat brand of film-making, I think this is one of the best films of the 1990s. See it for Burton, Depp, or Landau. But also see it because it is a great film about a poor director."

","I have just seen this film and I think that it is Tim Burton's best film. Ed Wood is a bio-pic about the worst film director in Hollywood, Edward D. Wood. It is mostly a comedy, but is serious at times and is a perfect project for Burton and Johnny Depp. The film shows that Ed Wood was a struggling director who had to work at a studio as a stage hand to make ends meat. He get an opportunity to write, direct and star in movie about someone getting a sex change and able to get his hero, Bela Lugosi, to be in it. He makes a terrible film and can't find a studio to hire him. He decides to finance and produce his own films and makes a load of B-movies, which are not very good. Ed Wood is portrayed as a nice man who loves what he does and wants to be like Orson Wells. Unforuately his isn't very good at what he does. As well as the comedy in the film, there is dramatic aspects, such as Ed's transvestitism, his relationships and Bela's drug problems. The characters in this film are over-the-top but I think that it works for this film.<br/><br/>The film was well written, has a good cast and I liked the fact that it was filmed in 1950s style and shows how the film industry works. I also liked how Ed Wood was portrayed a man that was too positive for his own good. I admit that I don't know much about the man but he most be better then Uwe Boll who is considered the worst director at the moment is just arrogant about his work and considers himself as a misunderstood man and he will never gain a cult following.<br/><br/>Ed Wood is a good film, and if you like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp then you will like this film."

","While the majority of biopics focus on personalities who were the best and/or the most popular in what they did, ""Ed Wood"" tells the story of the man who is considered today as the worst filmmaker of all time. It must be said right away that the life of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is far more interesting and fascinating than those of many other popular Hollywood legends and this movie shows why.<br/><br/>For starters, Wood was a filmmaker who defined himself as a writer-director-actor-producer, much like his idol Orson Welles. However, unlike Welles, Wood didn't have any magic touch, he never showed any visible talent in his movies, should it be his own or those of his faithful associates.<br/><br/>Ed Wood is played here by Johnny Depp, in what might probably be his best dramatic performance ever. Wood is portrayed here as a fiery film buff who is well decided to leave his mark in Hollywood. His main characteristic is his unequaled optimistic attitude and this attitude pushes him to go forward, even in front of the most insuperable problems. He is always able to find a ray of sunshine inside the most devastating reviews. But in a movie like ""Ed Wood"", the hardest thing to do would be to find some negative in such a genius and entertaining film.<br/><br/>""Ed Wood"" is directed by Tim Burton, probably the most weirdo of all mainstream Hollywood directors and the most capable of presenting the life of Wood and his motley crew of misfit collaborators in the most adequate way possible. Besides Wood, we can find the veteran star of ""Dracula"" Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), drag queen Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), the ""amazing"" Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (real-life wrestler George Steele) and TV show host Vampira (Lisa Marie).<br/><br/>The actors are fantastic in the sense that they are able of recreating such bad acting roles with that much conviction. Once Burton's camera starts rolling, we can see their real talent in front of us, but when Wood's camera starts rolling, they become pathetic, unconvincing and they deliver the Wood-written lines without even realizing their absurdity.<br/><br/>The movie is shot in black-and-white, which is frankly the only logical option for this kind of motion picture. Honestly, how could we imagine in color those sets that we can only see in black-and-white? How could we possibly imagine ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" in color? The recreation of Wood's turkeys is simply perfect. The story is set in the 1950s, the era where Wood directed his worst projects: ""Glen or Glenda?"", ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Plan 9"".<br/><br/>The 1950s, it must be said, represent the golden era of the Z-movies in Hollywood. Although there have been many classics, like ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", ""High Noon"" and ""Ben-Hur"", this era is much remembered for those horror and science fiction flicks interested in the atomic age and monsters derived from it. Besides Wood's masterpieces, we can also mention ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"", ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" and the Japanese opus ""Gojira"".<br/><br/>The 1950s is also an era where the studio system still prevails and the directors are always at the mercy of the producers who are the supreme authority and they own a veto over every aspect of the movies. And it can even go well outside of the movie. For example, in the ""Bride of the Monster"" making, Wood is forced to modify his cast and even his ending in order to meet the requirements of his main financier. And for ""Plan 9"", he must go under baptism (and so must his friends), so a group of Baptists will finance the picture. This adds even more to the incredible, as if the movies were not enough.<br/><br/>Even if ""Ed Wood"" contains numerous scenes showing the stupidity and the lack of talent of the protagonists, there's still some fair level of intelligence emerging from the picture and some goofy statements suddenly become full of sense. For example, Bela Lugosi, even if he's been addicted to morphine for twenty years and lost nearly every bit of his talent since he made ""Dracula"", is able to deliver some interesting utterances, such as why the Dracula character is more interesting than the Frankenstein character and why women should love the classic 1930s horror movies from Universal.<br/><br/>The actors from the movie are all tremendous, but two of them clearly stand above the others. Johnny Depp plays his Ed Wood role in an immaculate way. He knows how to write a script, how to shoot a picture and he's able to detect some qualities in people that very few would be able to see. That's why he casts Loretta King (Juliet Landau) just by watching her commanding in a restaurant.<br/><br/>Depp also seems to be very comfortable when comes the time of wearing women's clothing, just like Wood did in real life as a transvestite.<br/><br/>In the case of Martin Landau, the scale of his (Oscar-winning) performance is difficult to surround. Simply said, he is better as Lugosi than Lugosi himself was. His Hungarian accent is perfectly convincing and he delivers very interesting quotes (""This is the most uncomfortable coffin I've ever been in""). His relationship with Wood is touching and extraordinary. Lugosi finally meets someone who still believes in him and who is able to find him some new work.<br/><br/>""Ed Wood"" is without a doubt the greatest Tim Burton movie for the moment. The Ed Wood story couldn't have been directed by anybody else than him. Instead of ridiculing Wood, which would have been too much easy and far less interesting, Burton seems to celebrate him and making him a symbol for those who idolize movies and absolutely want to leave their mark in Hollywood, whatever the result be good or not. ""Ed Wood"" is the ultimate proof that cinema is far more than a job and an art. It's mysticism."

","If you love movies, you've got to see ED WOOD, Tim Burton's brilliant portrait of the 1950s ""B Movie"" director - an odd, unique figure in the harsh world of Hollywood, who was responsible for such gems as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Glen or Glenda"". Working with nothing but blind faith and conviction to his cause Ed, against all odds, forged ahead with his dreams. Although much is fictional, the film captures the essence of Wood and the era in which he worked. Ironically it took a budget of 18 million dollars to recreate the look and feel of an ultra low budget Ed Wood film. Martin Landau is superb in a well-deserved Academy Award performance as Bela Lugosi. Landau, in his Award acceptance speech said that he ""was grateful that everyone who saw this film is here tonight!"" Pull the strings, Bela, Pull the strings."

The attempt to be horrible is outrageously comical. <br/><br/>This is about a small collection of real people doing what Hollywood does and doing it badly but very really.

You can feel the desperation to get into production and through the final scene before the resources are spent.<br/><br/>Appealing to the Southern California Baptists for production costs is a scream.

","My Take: An interesting and hilarious biopic, as well as a loving tribute to the film-loving side of Ed Wood. <br/><br/>Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors, and ED WOOD is probably his best film. Along with the brilliant EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD is another personal work from Burton wherein he feels right at home with the story and its lead character of the gifted outcast. Whereas EDWARD reflected Burton's childhood, ED WOOD reflected on Burton as the imaginative outcast in Hollywood, as well as his friendship with the late actor Vincent Price (which was uncannily similar to Wood's own friendship with his idol Bela Lugosi). <br/><br/>Johnny Depp really looks as if he is Ed Wood. The weirdness and all. But he is not, by any means, a mockery of the real thing. Instead, Burton and Depp revel in the eccentricity and odd imagination of the man. Instead of condescending the man's lack of any real talent or experience, Burton and screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski embrace them man's love for his work and his insistence to do what he wants. Here we see he loves movies and not the business they make. Wood may be the worst director of all time as he is claimed to be, but does do it right. Other than Depp, Martin Landau's performance as the late Bela Lugosi is one you've got to see to believe. From the accent to the excellent make-up effects, Landau IS Lugosi. It sort of reminded me of the making of Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE where Wood used stock footage and a double to make it look like it was the recently-deceased Lugosi's true final film. Well, Burton would have made Wood proud; this is the closest we can get to bringing the man who played Dracula back from the grave. <br/><br/>I really love this movie. Take my word for it, ""Ed Wood"" is a great film; one of Burton's best films and perhaps Depp's greatest and most eccentric performance to date. <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Ed Wood charts the story of Edward D. Wood Jr., voted the worst director in Hollywood. But to say that this story is about his failures and his lack of artistic ability behind the lens would be a total generalisation, one that would not do this film justice. Instead, Tim Burton has filmed a story paying homage to a man, that, despite his many flaws, you truly have a sort of respect for at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Burton's film is aided by the listing of a stellar cast, not least of which is Johnny Depp in the title role, who plays Wood as a sort of innocent egomaniac, who while he seems friendly and charming as a man, has absolute conviction in his talents, and never questions them for a second. With Depp is Sarah Jessica Parker and Particia Arqutte as the women of Wood's life and Bill Murray as his confidante Bunny.<br/><br/>But truly the star of the show, along with Depp is Martin Landau as the once great horror star Bela Lugosi. Once the toast of the cinema, now nothing more than a drug addled ruin with his career now in tatters.<br/><br/>But this isn't a story about falling from grace, nor is it a story about failure. As much as anything Burton uses this film to pay homage to a man who didn't listen to the executive big wigs, nor was tied down by petty changes that had to be made. In fact Burton, deliberately compares him to Orson Welles, showing that although that Wood may not have had the talent, he certainly had the drive and if anything he should be respected for that.<br/><br/>This is a movie that shows that the weird is often lovable, despite, if it fails. How else can you explain a transvestite director coming across as charming?"

","Ed Wood is neat stuff, especially for those with fond memories of all those low budget monster pictures from the fifties. But, it's not restricted to just those fans; as a movie biography, it's accessible to just about anyone. The bio contains many cases of dramatic license being taken with the real Ed Wood's life and that of Bela Lugosi, but it all fits neatly into place. Their lives were touched by a bit of the fantastic, after all, and this picture emphasizes the idealized versions of events in our memories as much time passes by. Wood (Depp) is a 'never say die' fellow: despite a lack of talent, no money and even bad luck, he manages to persevere through several writing/directing efforts, all the while jumping back into the game when it seems he's played his last card. Just when it seems he's growing despondent and is finished, something galvanizes him to tackle another feature. You can't help but root for the guy. You can't help but laugh along with a studio exec who can't take Wood's work seriously but, at the same time, you want Wood to continue putting out these lame efforts. Hey, at least he's doing it, right?<br/><br/>The viewer really can begin warming up to the picture as Wood begins assembling his 'posse' of actors and production people. Besides Bela (Landau), this includes wrestler Tor (George Steele), stage entertainer Criswell the prognosticator (Jones), strange actor Bunny (Murray) and, later, TV host Vampira. They bond together into a sort of team, even heading out on dark night missions to 'borrow' props from other studios. Though seemingly outcasts from normal society, they're comfortable with themselves; if you aren't, well, that's your problem. I guess that includes Wood's transvestism, which isn't shied away from. Wood's directing techniques, as played by Depp, are flat-out hilarious. I was especially appalled, in a good way, by how he directed Bela & Tor to get through a door. The cast is pretty much perfect. Landau just nails the Bela Lugosi role (he won the supporting actor Oscar), lending much poignancy to the famed actor's twilight years. When Wood gets around to creating his most famous movie, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,""(1959) there is a sense of history being made. Was it about as bad as a movie can get? Yes, but it's still legendary. The audience has a front row seat to witness a legend being created right in front of them.<br/><br/>Filmed in atmospheric black & white, the entire film has a bittersweet taste to it by the time it runs through a brief 'after-history' on the main players. Most of them are deceased by now, of course, and their 'careers' never really improved later. But they all had the pleasure of actually working on a movie set, as a sort of odd family. I felt I'd just seen something irreplaceable - a glimpse into a decade when dreams could be realized on the silver screen, flawed as they were. Very flawed, yes. Well, no one's perfect, are they?"

","After fashioning the stylistic achievements of ""Batman"", and ""Edward Scissorhands"", Tim Burton is directing a true subtle gem in ""Ed Wood,"" opting for substance over style while plumbing the depths of ""the worst director of all time."" But what-a-minute? If Wood was such a bad director why do Midnight screenings of double-bills -- ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and ""Glen or Glenda"", sell-out today? Burton seeks the answer by giving the viewer a look behind the man and the rag-tag group of devotees he leads. And who better to play the man than Johnny Depp. Fresh off his work with Burton on ""Edward Scissorhands,"" Depp continues to show through his undercharged brand of acting that he is truly destined for greater things. He plays Wood as the arch-typical gee-whiz nice guy who at any moment could come undone from the unvented personalities floating inside him who demand an audience. Is it any shock that this man should become a director; projecting that need to draw from people something that may be unknown to even them? He is the Sunday-Morning garage sale hunter looking for treasure among junk. The people he collects don't understand his vision but trust him implicitly. Leading this group is Martin Laundau playing Bela Lugosi which such ferocity he seems to be channeling him. I have never met Bela Lugosi, but I am convinced that if I had I would of met a washed-up actor addled by drug abuse and embittered by the Hollywood's throw-away style of handling old actors. Wood cannot help but gush when meeting Lugosi for the first time and continues to treat him as a legend throughout their relationship. Does Lugosi continue to help in Wood's endeavors for the money or the adulation? The talent does not end with Landau and Depp. This talented cast produce standout performances: Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Bill Murray, Mike Starr, and Jeffrey Jones are never unbelievable in their pursuit of Silver Screen immortality.

The father of Ron Howard, Rance, has a hilarious cameo as one of Wood's backers who wants a movie to end with a big explosion.

","1994 was arguably the best movie year for 20 years. The year had movies like The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, the Lion King, Clerks, Heavenly Creatures and even a good Elm Street sequel! Many were then outraged, when their favorites were ignored in the Oscars when Forrest Gump (a good, but not great movie) cleared the table. Many argue that Shawshank should've won best picture and Pulp should've won the best actor awards. But, to my opinion, a more worthy winner to these awards would've been this gem, Tim Burton's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Burton has always had his own vision that no one else can't have messed with. This movie too is about outsiders, freaks even, who can't adjust to the surrounding world. It's almost tragic that many things described here actually happened. A lesser director would've made a Bowfinger-like comedy that has cheap laughs for the bad talent of the director, but Burton still holds the strings. While the movie has plenty of humor, it is never mean to it's characters and never points fingers and laughs at them, but rather with them.<br/><br/>The movie's best qualities lie in the acting talent. I honestly think Martin Landau's Bela Lugosi is the best performance I have ever seen an actor do. He makes the horror icon seem so vulnerable, so painful and yet a wonderful actor, although given crappy material by Wood. For example, who understands what the hell the ""Pull the String!"" scene means, but Bela's (and Landau's) talent covers it up. And kudos also to the make-up. If Wood would've had the make-up artists, maybe the Bela look-a-like in Plan 9 could've shown his face, too.<br/><br/>All the other actors are wonderful, too. Johnny Depp proves once again that he is one of the greatest actors of his generation. The movie's positive tone is mostly thanks to him and his positive attitude and it's a small wonder that Wood couldn't sell his movies if he resembled anything like Depp in real life. Sarah Jessica Parker, Bill Murray, Lisa Marie, Jeffrey Jones... the movie is full of unforgettable performances! The movie's story is a success-story without the success. The movie is a testimony of how hard it can be to make even a cheap movie made in Hollywood. The movie is about overcoming these obstacles. In that it's like a tribute to the cinema itself. At the end the ever-optimistic Wood thinks he's made the movie he'll be remembered, Plan 9 from Outer Space. He's right, but not after he's gone. The optimistic end is contrasted by the following epilogues, that like in American Graffiti, prove that life doesn't always work the best way for every one. Burton still made the right decision to end the movie in the right point of Wood's life.<br/><br/>***** (the top 10 movies I've seen #3)"

","i had doubts about watching this the first time. just the cover of the movie made me avoid it for some time. i mean, why would i really want to watch a biographical story of ""the worst filmmaker of all time?"" obviously i learned my lesson never to judge a book (or movie) by its cover.<br/><br/>for about 2 years i went to my favorite video store 2 times a week. it seemed as if i had seen every comedy movie in the history of movies. except for one johnny depp movie that stared me right in the face for the longest time. i kept thinking ""next time I'm gonna rent ed wood"" but then 'next time' came, then i thought ""next time"" and so on. finally i watched it, and it was one of those masterpieces that you cant get over. I'm glad i spent 2 hours of my day watching it. it was well worth it.<br/><br/>johnny depp never fails to amaze me. in fact, i think he gets better in each movie. this one not only did he do a good job, but he looked awesome. boy, that hair and his face--it just made me happy to watch him as much as the movie.<br/><br/>i, and like many other people, had never ever heard of ed wood. I'm guessing since how many people liked this film, its accurate. correct me if I'm wrong, but i don't think I'm ever gonna watch an ed wood film until the day i die.<br/><br/>i recommend this film to everyone. i don't even think it should be rated R. I've seen a lot of pg-13 movies with just as many cuss words as this. if you don't like it the first time you watch it, try watching it a second time. even a third. i like it more every time i watch it. definitely a 10/10"

","I have to say that I was blown away by this movie. I mean you have all the right stuff in it. A veteran actor like Martin Landau who out does himself as the struggling, junkie actor Bela Lugosi...You have fan favorite Johnny Depp in probably his best role ever. His voice, his peppy behavior and of course his false teeth are simply outrageous. Also, not too mention great supporting roles by both Sarah Jessica Parker and Bill Murray...Every actor captures what I'm sure these people were like. I find it hard to believe how somebody cannot laugh out loud at the times when Johnny Depp is so excited about a terrible and rushed scene that he just shot (which happens a lot throughout the movie, so lots of laughs will be had.) Also, add in the brilliant eye that Tim Burton has in directing his movies. This film just got me that much more excited about the new Willy Wonka movie..Depp and Burton create masterpieces when they team up..Do not hesitate to see this movie and I didn't want to add too many spoilers on this one because I do not want to spoil anything for any potential viewers...A remarkable movie over all...10/10."
"MovieReporter","8","0","0","27 April 2005"," Burton's best?
","Two towering performances from Johnny Depp and Martin Landau are the jewels in the crown in Tim Burton's glorious satirical biopic of Ed Wood (Depp), the so-called ""worse director of all time"". The film follows Wood as he aspires to create a big-time blockbuster, refusing to let a string of awful flops (Glen or Glenda?, The Bride of the Monster), his own cross-dressing activities and the troubles of his washed-up ""big star"" Bela Lugosi (Landau) stand in his way. Depp and Burton could have gone for the obvious - an outright mockery of Wood - but instead achieve something far richer; Wood comes across a sympathetic character whose blind determination and enthusiasm comes across as touching, even admirable. Depp's versatility as an actor is never more apparent whilst Landau fills the role of the tragic Lugosi inside out. There's little to fault here - the ending is perhaps a bit abrupt - but the film has too many merits for it to be tainted. A wonderfully entertaining movie and one of Burton's best."

","ED WOOD tells the story of the world's worst movie director. He was the man behind a number of inept American b-pictures such as GLEN OR GLENDA, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER and the infamous PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, which was officially voted as the worst movie of all time. Wood had an incompetent directorial style, which included casting non actors that included a group of dope addicts, transvestites, a struggling TV horror queen and the fading Hollywood legend Bela Lugosi. He was content to botch scenes by allowing his actors to muff their lines and he also mixed day and night shots together disregarding continuity. As well as depicting the way he made his movies, ED WOOD also focuses on the way his erratic career and behaviour affected his relationships with his girlfriends and his friendship with Lugosi.<br/><br/>ED WOOD is an outstanding achievement from director Tim Burton who has to be one of the greatest fantasy film makers of the contemporary cinema. Check out SLEEPY HOLLOW! Here he gets fine performances especially from Johnny Depp as Wood while Martin Landau's Oscar winning portrayal of Bela Lugosi is standout. Landau not only bares an uncanny resemblance to the actor, but the way he and Depp portray the friendship between the two struggling film makers is heart rending and also offers a few laughs along the way. For example, it's Halloween night and a group of trick or treaters come to Lugosi's door. He throws on his Dracula cape and goes to the door throwing his arms upward with the phrase ""I want to suck your blood"". This sends the little girls screaming and running away while the little boy among their number isn't afraid and says ""those fangs don't frighten me."" Then Wood appears and says ""how about these"" and pulls his false dentures out, which has the little boy scurrying off in fright. However, there are moments which almost brought this reviewer to tears. Lugosi was addicted to morphine and was penniless in the last years of his life. Wood was a huge fan of Lugosi and his horror movies such as Dracula (1931) and hires him in his movies partly out of admiration and in a naive attempt to make him a star again and also through sympathy at the poverty which now dominates his life. Before Lugosi died he thanked Ed for all that he had done for him by casting him in his pictures. This almost brings one to tears as in the film he never actually sees the films and therefore had no idea how bad they were as when they go to the premiere of BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, they have to leave as the audience is tearing the picture house apart. Burton has expertly recreated key scenes from some of Wood's pictures which have the audience roaring with laughter. For instance, the scene where they are shooting the climax of BRIDE OF THE MONSTER where Lugosi's character is attacked by an octopus in a lake. Wood's crew pinch a rubber octopus from a film studio but forget to pick up the motor that drives it and Lugosi ended up doing battle with a lifeless octopus. The film also accurately depicts the fact that when Wood made PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, Lugosi died before the film was finished and he had to bring in a double (who was a good foot taller than Lugosi) to replace him and he had to keep his face covered so that hopefully the audience wouldn't notice. Another classic scene in the film is when Wood storms out of the studio during the making of the film because the producers were questioning his competence as a director. Wood hops in a taxi and goes to the nearest bar where Orson Welles (another of his idols) happens to be drinking. Welles is brilliantly portrayed here by Vincent D' Oriofrio. Wood manages to meet him and tells him about how unhappy he is with the interference from the money men. Welles tells him that he has the same trouble all of the time and that CITIZEN KANE was the only film where he had complete control over the project and that the studio hated it. He then tells ED that ""dreams are worth fighting for"". This restores Ed's courage and he races off back to the studio to make the film his way or not at all.<br/><br/>In summary, ED WOOD must be a milestone in cinema history as it is lovingly crafted by Burton and Landau's portrayal of Lugosi truly deserved the Oscar. Burton and D' Oriofrio are both exemplary and really there isn't a bad performance in the film right down to the smallest part. It was one of those great movie moments where everything just clicked and if fine acting isn't enough, the film also deserves full marks for delivering a fair amount of laughs as well of it's share of tears."

Its unique style of writing, characters, and humor stand out among the other movie. Oh, and speaking of humor, I think it's funny.

It's funnier than it sounds here, since you have to see it to understand.<br/><br/>I feel the actors did a good job in their roles.

","Every young movie maker thinks he can do anything and everything that has not been done already. Ed Wood is no exception, and that is why he's so special. Often considered THE worst movie director of all time, his life story would have been interesting if he had not made Play 9 From Outer Space. Tim Burton's tribute to the writer/director of the 1940s and 50s chronicles Wood's life from studio ""lot boy"" movie plants from one movie studio to another up to the premier of Plan 9. Along the way, we root for and feel sorry for Wood as he produces what he thinks are the ultimate pictures of all time, but we know they are turkeys. The charm of Ed Wood is how the director never questioned himself, how he always thought what he was doing was wonderful, and how everyone else got him wrong. The film features Martin Landau in an Oscar Winning Performance as the aging star of Dracula, Bela Legosi, and Bill Murray plays a make-up artist who really wants to be a woman. The real life characters that surround Wood make for almost constant comedy, and Burton's use of black and white gives us that feel of 1940s Hollywood. The background information we find in this movie gives us perspective in a man who was doing what he wanted to do in life, no matter what the results may have been."

","This film comes from the talented director Tim Burton. Burton has done many good films including: Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, and even Mars Attacks was enjoyable with its over the top humor and fun. But Ed Wood is a different type of film. Unfortunately, Ed Wood did not get the box office results that was hoped, but it did get him critical acclaim and rightly so. Ed Wood is a biopic about the notorious director Edward D. Wood Jr. Who is responsible for such films as Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and of course the infamous Plan 9 from Outer Space. However, Tim Burton does not try to show how bad of a director Ed Wood was, but rather how enthusiastic and how great of a man he was. The movie is a comedy/drama, and it can be hilarious at times, and also be just a down right great movie at other times.<br/><br/>This movie's strongest and weakest points are it's acting. Jonny Depp did a splendid depiction of Mr. Wood and he was perfect for the role. Martin Lundau was perhaps the greatest virtue of this movie. Portraying Bela Lugosi, Lundau did a phenomenal job being both funny and dramatic. He won the Oscar for this role and is almost believable as Lugosi himself. There are also some good acting from Sarah Jessica Parker. So if you are a Sex in the City fan, or even if you aren't, you will enjoy her performance. Bill Murray fans may also want to check this movie out, for his performance is brilliantly played and also can make you laugh as Bill Murray always can. Unfortunately, George ""The Animal"" Steele and Lisa Marie did not have the best performances. However, their characters, Tor Johnson and Vampira, were still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's directing was exquisite and precise and the music was an added enjoyment. I'm glad Tim Burton was the one to direct this movie. In a way, Tim Burton is just a more successful version of Ed Wood. They both got a chance to befriend their mentors at the end of their life. They both enjoy science fiction. This is perhaps Tim Burton's best film and it is probably due to Tim Burton's similarities to Ed Wood.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a piece of masterful cinema. It has both the power of making you laugh and bring you almost to the point of tears. If not for all the great talents and performances in this movie, original Ed Wood fans and fans of old films should not miss this film either. This movie is a definite must see and will not disappoint you.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Thank goodness this movie has recently been reissued on DVD. If you missed this gem first time around, see it now! <br/><br/>Most movie buffs, both serious and frivolous, have heard of Edward D. Wood Jr. If you're lucky, you've seen one or more of his films. They are so bad that they're entrancing, especially his masterpiece ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".<br/><br/>In making a film of Wood's career, it would have been very easy to just point the finger and laugh. There is a little of this in ""Ed Wood"", but, for the most part, the film chooses to examine and celebrate rather than mock.<br/><br/>The casting is inspired. Martin Landau's performance as Bela Lugosi has been widely and justly praised, but Johnny Depp deserves similar credit for an engagingly irritating effort in the title role. The support cast is excellent, with Bill Murray and Mike Starr (who has the best line in the movie) deserving special mention.<br/><br/>As for the script, it bristles with brilliant one-liners. Music is unobtrusive and appropriate. The black-and-white photography aptly captures the atmosphere, both of Wood's own films and of the time when they were made.<br/><br/>Strongly recommended then.

","One of Tim Burton's best movies, if not the best. <br/><br/>The movie can almost be considered a documentary, since it is showing aspects of the life of director/producer/actor/writer Edward Wood Jr in a believable and authentic way. Maybe a better term would be ""reenactment"".<br/><br/>Ed Wood is famous, or rather infamous, for directing some of the worst movies in history. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood. I would venture to say to perfection, however, I did not know or have ever met Ed Wood. All I can say is if I imagined meeting Ed Wood he would have Johnny's characterizations. I can say the same thing about Martin Landau, who plays an old, morphine addicted Bela Lugosi. They are both amazing and have an obvious screen chemistry that is intoxicating. You just want to keep watching Bela and Ed interacting.<br/><br/>The movie is filmed in black and white. I think this is important to portraying Ed Wood since his most famous(in) movies are in black and white. For those that have never seen an Ed Wood movie, Tim Burton's homage/reenactment story gives the viewer an insight into the man. For those of us that have experienced Ed Wood, it is quite enjoyable to see scenes recreated shot for shot with different actors, yet maintaining the same campiness.<br/><br/>The movie, for the most part, is a humorous look at Ed Wood. There is more however. There are instances where one genuinely feels for Ed Wood, where you share his pain and anguish. There are moments when we are captivated by the sheer positivity and will of Ed Wood. In the end, this movie is enjoyable as a comedy and as a positive look at one of the most criticized and least successful directors. I highly recommend this movie."

","To come up with the idea that people acting in Ed Wood's movies would have lives that were far more unique and entertaining than the actual movies, is an achievement of it's own.<br/><br/>An example: one scene from ""Ed Wood"", where Ed Wood's team are filming in the middle of the night. They have got a bad ""motorized rubber octopus""-prop without the..um.. motor. Actually, they just stole the octopus from a prop stock. The team have just finished the ""sea"" for the octopus, then the scientist, Bela Lugosi, about 70 at the time, steps in the water to ""fight"" with the octopus (ie. sit on it, scream, and flap it's rubber flippers around like a kid lost in his toys) after taking a shot of morphine.<br/><br/>If that really happened - and stuff like that must've happened around Ed Wood - the people in the set were sure to remember it for the rest of their lives.. surreal, funny, unique situations.<br/><br/>Funny film - at times you just feel sorry for Ed Wood, the center of this network of outcasts and weirdos - he basically wanted to make things happen as soon as possible without having the skills to pull them off. Johnny Depp really gives the impression of Ed Wood's will to make it big, and of course, how that driving force ends up making the movies so bad.<br/><br/>The whole film has a very surreal feeling to it, at times it feels like a ""normal"" biography, and at times it's very much like a 50s-movie with that black and white soul to the acting. The end result gives you a great feeling of the mood that must've surrounded Ed Wood, almost lets you smell his bad props.

"Ben_Cheshire","8","0","0","1 March 2004"," Burton: ""We remember, we care""
","This is Tim Burton saying that no matter how many people don't care about B-horror pictures, he does, and showing us that there can be poetry in them. ""Ed Wood"" is a bio-pic of real-life B-hollywood director Edward D Wood Jr, done in the style of one of his pictures - unexplained framing devices, like Criswell's introduction, noirish lighting for no apparent reason, and incidental performances by actors who look like they've just shown up and not been told what part they're supposed to be playing. These last, like the doctor in Lugosi's hospital, are provided for colour, but are an example of the balance struck in this picture. It has the expression of a comedy - yes, we're asked to laugh at Wood's haphazard way of making pictures, and we can laugh about how terrible the pictures are, but beneath the comedy a great truth is found, and a message Tim Burton is passionate about is expressed. The heart of Ed Wood is really in the character of ""washed-up"" Dracula star Bela Lugosi (played to a tee and rewarded with an Oscar, by Martin Landau).<br/><br/>
Twenty years after Dracula, Lugosi's career was over. Nobody cared about him. It was like, as is Hollywood lore, you're only as good as the last thing you've done. And whatever classic roles or films you may have done, it all counts for nothing if you do a bad picture. This theme of the cruel way Hollywood forgets its greatest talents is also why the name Orson Welles keeps cropping up. Its not because Welles made pictures like Ed Wood's, its because, like with Lugosi, Welles's having made what is considered to be the greatest picture of all time, Citizen Kane, counted for nothing in Hollywood. If your pictures didn't make money, you were useless - so Hollywood did everything it could to keep him from working - RKO sabotaged his Ambersons, and eventually he could not get backing for many great pictures in Hollywood that, and here there is another analogy with Ed Wood, he raised money for himself and made independently. It is this determination to succeed, and persist in your work no matter what others think of it that makes Ed Wood (thanks to a terrific fun performance from Johnny Depp) such an important and admirable character. You can't help liking Ed, for his irrepressible spirit and optimism. It was Ed Wood who gave Lugosi another chance, the content of which Burton  romanticises and focuses on in his film. Ed Wood cared about Lugosi's work - Wood didn't care about popular opinion which said Lugosi was ""washed up,"" whatever that meant. Wood had seen Dracula, and Lugosi was a legend, and that was all that mattered. Wood gave him the chance to be in pictures again, symbolising the appreciation of great works, not recent moneymakers. Burton and Martin Landau give the legend of Bela Lugosi his last great performance, turning him into the tragic figure to end all tragic figures. His performance of his ""I have no home speech"" set to stirring, haunting music, on the steps of the hospital - his performance of the infamous flower-smelling scene from Plan Nine from Outer Space, the last footage Lugosi ever shot - all have the tone of appreciating a legend, giving Lugosi his due, saying who gives a sh*t if Hollywood doesn't remember, we remember."

","It is really ironic to me that one of the best film biographies should have been made about a man who people consider the worst movie director of all time. Ed Wood was a transvestite (ironically he was a very decorated Marine in WWII who fought wearing a bra and panties underneath his uniform, he said one of his worst fears was being wounded in combat and having the medics cut off his clothes and revealing his secret). Wood was a good and decent man and this is well shown in this film when he befriends Bela Lugosi. Lugosi was one of the biggest Hollywood horror stars when he made Dracula in 1931, however he made a horrible mistake when he turned down the role of Frankenstein that Boris Karloff took. This part made Karloff a star and he was able to enjoy a bountiful career. He was able to play other parts that proved he was a fine actor when he wasn't playing a monster. However, Lugosi was typecast for the rest of his life and never approached Karloff's success. Maybe that is why he didn't like him. There is a funny scene in this film where Martin Landau as Lugosi goes off on a profane tirade about Boris Karloff. Johnny Depp and Sarah Jessica Parker and Bill Murray all give wonderful performances in this film, but it is Mister Martin Landau who makes it for me. He simply IS Bela Lugosi. This is the finest screen performance of a real life person since George C. Scott played Patton. It is almost like Landau stepped out of his own mortal soul and became Lugosi. I think one of the reasons he did such a wonderful job is that there is a connection between him and Bela. Maybe I should explain, Landau was thrown aside by Hollywood for so many years after he did Mission Impossible. He had to do garbadge like The Harlem Globetrotters On Gilligan's Island (I kid you not that was one of his roles!) Lugosi had to do trash like that as well. One of his films was called Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla. Landau was able to make a comeback with films like Tucker: The Man And His Dream. He was able to make the comeback Bela could not. In fact when he won the Oscar, one of the things he said was ""Bela wherever you are thanks"". The thing about this film that really got me is that Ed Wood was somewhat noble. He was a person who loved filmaking and was as genuinely dedicated to his craft as any great director like Orson Welles, William Wyler or John Frankenheimer, he just wasn't any good at it!"

","Tim Burton and his writers depict the life of the eccentric filmmaker, Edward D. Wood Jr., a man who enjoys his films so much (and the scenes that he shoots, which have obvious mistakes in them) that he is blinded by how ridiculously awful they are. Sure, Ed did make awful films that he considered (and predicted to be) blockbuster hits. But Ed Wood isn't just a simple ordinary filmmaker who makes horrendous pictures, he has so much love for the films he's making, and so much love for filmmaking itself. This film gives you strong insight and depth into Ed Wood.<br/><br/>I watched this movie a couple days ago, but before I watched it, I always wondered why everybody hated Ed's films (I haven't seen any of his movies), but after seeing this, I now know why: Ed Wood had the littlest insight on how to make good movies, because he didn't know what was good in a motion picture, and even worse, he never learned from his mistakes, which was one of his major downfalls. Another major problem in Ed's filmmaking abilities (if you want to call them abilities) is that he loved the scene he would shoot so much, that it overrode the fact that there was major problems in the scene. In one of the movies most memorable scenes, Ed Wood is filming a scene in his film, I which a character walks through a door. The actor who portrayed the character was Tor Johnson. Johnson accidentally bumped into the wall, causing the set to move. Ed Wood liked the take, and didn't bother to do another one, claiming that `In actuality, Lobo would have to struggle with that problem every day.' Ed Wood loved his scenes and his films so much that is resulted in only one take per scene. This movie flat out, and boldly tells you that Edward D. Wood had no filmmaking skill whatsoever.<br/><br/>This film is all in black and white, which at first, I thought would have been a problem for me. I was proven wrong, because the film seems to be better because of the fact that it is in black and white. It bares that 1950's feel to it, and an Ed Wood feel as well. The decision to shoot the film in black and white, I thought, was really creative, and ingenious.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives an excellent performance as the film's mains star, Ed Wood. Edward D. Wood (as mentioned earlier) is an eccentric filmmaker, who is blinded by the rancidness of his films. Wood is also a transvestite, who he proudly admits to almost everyone. He also sees the fact that he is a transvestite as the most normal thing in the world. Depp creates a great amount of character for Ed Wood, and gives strong insight on what Ed Wood was like. Martin Landau portrays the burnt out has-been actor, Bela Lugosi. Ladnau delivers an excellent depiction of Lugosi, and bares a strong resemblance. His character Bela Lugosi is an old, burnt out actor, who, in secrecy (for the first half of the movie), is a morphine addict. Lugosi obviously enjoys being apart of Ed's movies, and is practically in them voluntarily. During Ed's picture `Plan 9 From Outer Space,' Lugosi tragically died, thus he was replaced by a man who covered the bottom part of his face with a cloak. Like Johnny Depp, Landau creates a great amount of character for Bela. Landau also creates a vast amount of humor with Lugosi in some scenes, such as in one scene, before filming a part of the movie, he yells out, `Let's shoot this f***er!!'  The very hot Sarah Jessica Parker plays as Ed's miserable girlfriend, Dolores, who participates in some of his films. Parker too gives an exhilarating, and inspiring performance as Dolores. She too also gives good insight on how Dolores put up with Ed, hesitantly taking parts in his movies (which they never actually flat out specify if she hated them or not, but in one scene, she says how everyone is working on `s**t.').<br/><br/>I like how the film is comical, such as when Wood continually mentions Lugosi's name to everyone, and they reply `I thought he was dead.' The film always seems to make transition from happy moments, to tragic moments, thus making you think that things are starting to go good.<br/><br/>This film is my fifth favorite film of all time. It has excellent cinematography, a good script, VERY good performances from every single actor, the fact that it is in black and white creates ingenuity, and it really gives the audience strong insight on Ed Wood. Though Ed Wood's films were beyond awful, you cant dismiss the fact that he had so much loyalty to the art of filmmaking. Ed Wood has earned a lot of respect from people for that.<br/><br/>Overall score: 10 out of 10."

","""Ed Wood"" is unique among Tim Burton's films in that it is the only one of his films based on a true story, and in being that, it is devoid of fantastic elements (other than those in Wood's films, which, admittedly, weren't that fantastic).  This is because, I think, Burton is making the sort of observation with this film he doesn't in the others.<br/><br/>
One way this film does fit in with all the others is that its protagonist (indeed most of his characters in this film) is an outsider.  Characters from other Burton films like Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee Herman, Batman, Ichabod Crane, and especially Edward Scissorhands are all individuals with special skills or attributes that set them apart and end up, in some way, foiling their attempts to be accepted by others.  Ed Wood is the same, but in this case the problem isn't his skills, it's the lack thereof.  He is, as fan polls have noted, the ""worst director of all time.""<br/><br/>Therein lies the paradox of ""Ed Wood,"" because despite a total lack of ability, Ed Wood firmly believes he is as multi-talented a genius as his idol, Orson Welles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Burton, however, uses a unique approach to portray this.  Although we get film moguls and audiences clearly showing their distaste for his films throughout the film, Johnny Depp, who plays Wood, consistently displays such confidence, even in the face of genuine doubt from his assistants and actors, one is given a curious feeling he, and not they, are right, to do things like leaving in shots where tombstones are revealed to be false.<br/><br/>
Indeed, when Wood is making what has been voted elsewhere as ""the worst film of all time,"" ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" Burton cuts together the sequence, and adds triumphant fanfares, to give the impression Wood is indeed creating a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The clue to this is when he actually does meet up with hero Orson Welles, in their conversation, Welles bemoans how after ""Citizen Kane"" he lost all control over his films.   Welles then tells Wood, ""Ed, visions are worth fighting for.""  Burton is saying for a creator it doesn't matter what others think, but what the creator thinks.  If Ed Wood (or anyone) thinks their vision is worth fighting for, it is.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Ed Wood, like most comic heroes (and despite some serious moments, and the fact this is a biopic, it still is a comedy), lives in a universe where he must fail.  As he watches the world premiere of ""Plan 9"" in a veritable trance of ecstasy, he whispers, ""This is it.  This is the film I'll be remembered for,"" and the irony of how he was remembered for this film is, perhaps, the film's greatest moment of pathos.  In it, we are brought back to the realization that regardless of a vision, regardless of the fact there may be no real thing as bad or good, Hollywood is merciless to all its visionaries, even to Orson Welles."

","There isn't much I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said. But just to reiterate - this is a magnificent film. The symbiotic relationship between the delusional young film-maker and the burned-out former horror star is both sublimely hilarious and deeply moving. Johnny Depp once again demonstrates just how versatile an actor he is, and Martin Landau's Oscar award is one of those rare happy occasions when the Academy rewards talent rather than lobbying prowess. Anyone who has ever made their own crappy B-movies for fun (as I have) will appreciate this. In fact, anyone who's a human being should love this film. It's so lovingly made - Tim Burton obviously has a deep affinity with his characters. To paraphrase Ed himself, this will be the one they remember him for."
"Angry_Arguer","Null","0","0","6 September 2003"," Burton sells his visual soul for a script
","Perhaps, since this movie, Tim Burton has realized that the macabre he creates is too playful in its intentions compared to what others have tried. Whenever he tries creating moods, whether in 'Apes, Batman 1 & 2, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks!, or Edward Scissorhands, he is always trying to make something funny or lighthearted about his topics.  Imagine if Kubrick did the same, would he be so great?<br/><br/>With Ed Wood, Burton tries to create a story about an unfathomable loser. Depp, one of the most diverse actors I have ever seen--no wonder Burton keeps using him, is wonderfully inspired, but it isn't him or anyone else dominant in the cast--not even Martin Landau--that is the standout.  <br/><br/>
I am, of course, referring to Vincent D'Onofrio's fleeting moment as Orson Welles.  Had Welles himself seen it, I bet he'd have thought it was effective.  Granted, Burton strips such a vibrant character of much detail in order to make a B&W version of Robin Williams' character in Dead Poets Society.  Still, the amount of elaboration that Vincent puts into the character, even the mannerisms, make him the highlight.  He also has some great delivery with milking the audience, if they're smart enough to catch it.<br/><br/>Burton uses his camera more like a stage appliance this time.  He probably knew that this was going to bomb upon release, but he made it anyway.  Thus he is no different than the character he is making.  The fact that Burton's movies keep winning or getting nominated for Makeup awards shows how he focuses on altering the acting element of filmmaking to create props out of people, not characters.  Best example: Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>Overall, not as good as the IMDb rating would suggest.  I still think Batman Returns is Burton's best work.  This isn't too bad, though, for the extreme minority that it appeals to.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

","It says a lot about the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that the sole honours they accorded this film were those related to Martin Landau's -- admittedly phenomenal -- recreation of Bela Lugosi. Best Supporting Actor and Best Makeup. That's it.<br/><br/>One must wonder how many of those people have seen Plan 9 From Outer Space, and if so, how many enjoyed it. My guess would be not many. Mercifully, Tim Burton seems of a different mind. Like me, he evidently saw Plan 9 as perhaps the most tragically hilarious film ever made -- a shining beacon of how such a total failure can ultimately be something of a success.<br/><br/>So, proceeding in that frame of mind, this movie is a spectacular success. The script doesn't try to bite off too much; simply showcasing three of Wood's ""best"" movies, delving into his penchant for cross-dressing, and rooting itself in his friendship with Bela Lugosi. Johnny Depp is superb as the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr., embodying the desire to follow your dreams no matter what stands in your way. He never asks the audience for sympathy, no matter how bad things get. He wants only to continue his quest to make movies. This makes his ultimate fate, revealed to us in text at the end, more effective.<br/><br/>As I said before, Martin Landau's Bela Lugosi is miraculous. He disappears totally into the character of the cripplingly drug-addicted fallen celebrity, and irresistably conveys his pain. The affection he feels for Wood for easing his pain becomes our own. Other bio-pics/comedies can only dream of this type of power."

","*******some spoilers********<br/><br/>Definitely my favourite Tim Burton film, Ed Wood is a hilarious, touching tribute to cross dressing director Edward D Wood Jr, a man who just wanted to tell stories and make movies, and refused to let the fact that he was by far the worst filmmaker of all time to get in his way. The message in this film, as enunciated by Vincent D'Onofrio's Orson Welles in a scene where Ed meets the great man, is that visions are worth fighting for, even if, as in Ed's case, they're rubbish.<br/><br/>At the heart of the film is the friendship between Ed and fading horror icon Bela Lugosi. Despite the fact that so much of the film is laugh out loud funny, this core relationship is really quite moving. Martin Landau is quite superb as Lugosi, and some of his scenes will leave you close to tears - in particular when he goes cold turkey in rehab, and when he recites his 'atomic supermen' lines from Ed's film Bride of the Monster. The absurdity of the lines only seems to add to their poignancy. That's not to say that Landau doesn't have some screamingly funny lines - ""Let's shot this f****r!"". <br/><br/>Johnny Depp's portrayal of the eternally upbeat Ed is equally good - his sunny disposition in the face of adversity and point blank refusal to let the constant setbacks he faces get him down will leave a huge grin plastered on your face throughout the film. So maybe Ed's films were terrible, but it's hard not to feel any warmth towards him as we see him directing in drag or going to increasingly bizarre lengths to secure funding for his films. You can't help but share Ed's childlike enthusiasm for his work, as he announces that each take is 'perfect' no matter what went wrong.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are great, particularly Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones as members of Ed's bizarre retinue. Patricia Arquette yet again shows her knack for portraying characters which are just impossible to dislike, while Lisa Marie is jaw dropingly sexy as Vampira. Kudos must also go to Howard Shore for his wonderful 50's B-movie-esque score.<br/><br/>Above all Ed Wood is a paean to filmmaking, even as it affectionately pokes fun at 50's C movies. One last thing - anyone who hasn't seen Ed's infamous Plan 9 From Outer Space but who has considered watching it just to see how hilariously bad it really is could do worse than watch Ed Wood, as it lovingly recreates all the best bad bits from all of Ed's films.      <br/><br/>

Martin Landau is absolutely amazing, he does a brilliant accent for Bela Lugosi, and does the role so well.He is one of the best actors in the whole film. My favourite of all is Juliet Landau (Martin's daughter), she has such a funny role! Tim Burton has done an excellent portrayal of Ed Wood."

","Ed Wood is one of the best films that I have seen. The discreet mix of comedy and sincerity works at so many levels! The acting performances are superb from Martin Landau, Johnny Depp and Bill Murray, though the performances from the supporting cast are impeccable. Tim Burton escapes from his Super-Weird style of directing and leaves the audience wowed by his thorough story telling and nice camera set-ups. Maybe the finest art of this movie is the music, mimicking the 1950's UFO movie scores whilst making the movie comfortable to watch at the same time. The nice thing about Burton's directing is that whilst you can see that Edward .D. Wood Jr. had little to no directing or writing talents, he was someone who enjoyed making films an telling stories. Bela Lugosi isn't a very likeable character in the film. His frequent mood swings are funny, but not nearly as funny as Bill Murray, who plays the unsatisfied transvestite whom wishes to say goodbye to his genitalia. By all accounts, this movie is historically accurate, and anyone who has been unfortunate enough to see Plan 9 From Outer Space' and is interested in its making (even if you're not, you will be after seeing the movie!) you NEED to see this film.

Now, that Disney is finally giving Roger Rabbit the DVD treatment it deserved, maybe it will do the same for Ed Wood, Vampira and Bella. Come on, do it for Bella."

","After being entertained by Plan 9 From Outer Space, I was pretty excited to check this out. I found the copy we own and put it in the tape player. I can say only one thing: I absolutely love this movie!!!!! I had so much fun watching it. I even clapped when it was over! Tim Burton's charming, witty, and flawless comedy is a major contender for the most unique movie of all time. Other than that it's entertaining from beginning to end. Johnny Depp captures the hilarity and ineptitude of Edward D. Wood Jr., a name synonymous with many people and one of the first thoughts that will come to mind when the term ""bad movie"" is brought up. Depp will crack you up as he takes you through the many ups and not too distant downs of Wood's career. Watching this movie has left me under the impression that Depp is a fabulous actor (which I'm sure he is), and I really want to check out more of his movies. In fact, Depp's portrayal was so great, it's one of the best performances I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The movie begins with Wood attending his own play at an old shack on a rainy night, and the audience members are either asleep or talking with one another. Despite being slated in the papers, Wood still focuses on the rare positive comments such as `The soldiers' clothes looked realistic' rather than face the fact that his production stunk. Later that night, Wood tells his wife about his worries of making it in Hollywood, and she assures him that things will get better. After being rejected for the directing job of `I Changed My Sex', Wood meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), who is now old, washed up, and out of a job. Plus, very few people know he's still alive. But Wood is thrilled and wants to cast him in a movie. Ed convinces the creator of `I Changed My Sex' to let him direct it and gets the job. He writes the script, changing the title to `Glen or Glenda'. It is after his wife's reading of the script that she finds Wood in female clothing, revealing his passion for wearing it. `Glen or Glenda' proves to be so bad that it only premieres in Alabama, Missouri, and Indiana. He later slews together several misfits such as wrestler Tor Johnson (George Steele), future-predicting Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), and Lugosi for his next movie called `Bride of The Atom', which is renamed `Bride of The Monster'. Despite being kicked out of the perfect studio for not paying, he still goes on without any doubt. He gets the owner of a meat butchering company to pay for the film after two unsuccessful donation parties. And for the exciting climax, he has Bela Lugosi fight a giant rubber octopus. At the premiere, the cast is pelted with concessions and garbage, and they make it out just in time to catch a taxi, missing the entire movie. Later on, Ed learns that Lugosi, who had admitted earlier that he was addicted to drugs, has just died. He is heartbroken, and as a tribute, his movie, `Grave Robbers From Outer Space', is billed as the final film of Bela Lugosi. Since Wood is in a tight spot financially, he seals a deal with his apartment landlord to help him make the film. His associates provide ideas that he doesn't like, making him disgruntled. But when he gets an inspirational speech from his lifelong hero Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio), he is once again motivated to finish the movie, renamed `Plan 9 From Outer Space'. After finishing the film, Wood claims that it will be the film that they remember him by. And he receives a standing ovation at the premiere. <br/><br/>This is a one-of-a-kind film. What's so funny about the ending is that it takes the common `character gets discouraged, character gets inspirational speech and advice, character gets back in and wins' element and adds a funny and different kind of twist to it. The same can be said about the story in general, which tells the story of one of the worst directors of all time rather than show you the times of a successful figure. It's hard to pick the best scene, but I especially loved when the three men were previewing Glen or Glenda (`Pull the string! Pull the string!'). I also liked the scene where the guy couldn't tell the difference between the red and green dresses that Loretta King had to pick since he was colorblind, which is funny since the entire film is in black and white. The performances of Wood's common associates and cast members are inspiring and fun to watch, and I also have to give plenty of credit to Juliet Landau for being really hot. All of the famous moments of his career are captured perfectly, and there's even a touching subplot that shows how much Wood loved Lugosi. Landau definitely deserved the Academy Award he received, for he too does a great job playing his part. He even delivered some of the movie's best lines. Bill Murray also has a fun to watch performance during the show. 	 Even if you're not into Ed Wood's movies or his career, you'll still be greatly entertained by Burton's out-of-this-world movie. A big recommendation, especially if you need a different kind of movie to crack you up. So sit back and enjoy, because you won't see another movie like this for a long, long time. <br/><br/>***** out of *****"

","Offbeat biography about the eccentric director Ed Wood, notable for giving us what is considered to be the worst film ever made, Plan 9 From Outer Space. If Johnny Depp doesn't win this Oscar, its time for someone else to start up an awards show. Brilliant performance by the kid. Burton too, just completely outdoes himself. So does Landau for that matter, he at least was recognized with an Oscar. But the film should have been showered with them. It's a masterpiece. Shot in black and white, its atmosphere nails postwar Hollywood, in the final days when movies still had no need for ratings. The irony is Ed Wood in his lifetime, never amounted to anything. His films were beyond horrible to the point of just being unwatchable. Subject matter that's just hard to even comprehend.  I can't begin to describe the awfulness of them; it's worth renting one just for the history aspect.  That said, in his own way he was a pioneer. Directors especially the likes of Tim Burton owe a little something to this guy and his work if only for expanding the boundaries of conventionality. And this film is tenderly handled to give some respect to a guy who never saw any in his lifetime. One of recent Hollywood's better achievements."

Batman Returns, this one on the life of Edward Wood Junior, the worst

Well I never watched a mov from Ed, and to be honnest, I don't intend to
spend my money doing so. This mov spare us the torture of it, and Burton
uses again his strange sense of humour to tell the story of a guy who was
convinced that his movs were excellent. In a way, the message is given by
Vincent D'Onofrio in a delicious cameo as Orson Welles- we must go through
with things, even if they're bad as Ed's movs.
As Ed, Johny Depp goes quite well, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker as the
girlfriend who leaves him, Bill Murray (ultrafunny!), Patricia Arquette
(very sweet), Lisa Marie Juliet Landau and Jeffrey Jones as the
omnipresent
Criswell. But the real surprise is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the
horror
star from 30's Dracula. Under his heavy makeup, we really forget we're
seeing an actor, he truly looks like Bela! What a performance! Impossible
not to sympathise with him, he even won the Oscar (which is quite rare in
a
Tim Burton mov).<br/><br/>Overall, this is a quite entertaining doc mov, and a interesting change on
the director's career, that will please fans and nonfans."

","I first saw the real Ed Wood's films ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Night Of The Ghouls"" as a kid and had become interested in the fascinating story of the director and his bizarre group of friends and their experiences in later years.  His films are enjoyable and fun (which is more than can be said for a lot of truly awful movies that others have raved about to me).<br/><br/>This film is a fitting tribute to Ed's dreams.  I know it has it's inaccuracies but it's never less than true to the spirit of Ed Wood's amazing (and sometimes touching) story.  I even went back and discovered that some of the things I assumed were artistic lisence in the story were actually drawn from Rudolph Grey's book (Nightmare Of Ecstacy). Much of the film is hilarious and has a lot of quirky humour and bizarre moments.  There are also some beautifully poignant moments and a definite<br/><br/>sadness to some parts of the film.    The style of the film is great and really recreates the atmosphere of Ed's movies and also accounts of his life. Shooting it in black and white was an inspired and bold move on director Tim Burton's part and is an example of his obvious affinity with the material. There were many colourful characters in Edward D Wood Jnr's life and the film really captures them and almost makes you want to join in with his wild dreams and eccentric films.  The cast is uniformly excellent. Johnny Depp, apart from being in some of my favourite films<br/><br/>(Cry-Baby and Ed Wood) is also one of the finest actors around and has an interesting film career (Sleepy Hollow, From Hell, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Edward Scissorhands etc).  He's a great choice for the lead role and gives the film a lot of energy and wit.  Martin Landau (Space:1999, Cleopatra) is truly excellent as Bela Lugosi and it's great to see him acting alongside hi lovely, talented daughter in some scenes.  Martin Landau provides many laughs in the film but also some of it's more poignant moments and makes you feel true sympathy for Bela in the film.  Juliet Landau (Drusilla in Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel) is perfect for quirky character roles and is a delight here. Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex And The City, Mars Attacks! )has some great bitchy moments and is another great actress.  Patricia Arquette (True Romance, A Nightmare On Elm Street 3) is sweet in her role and brings out the poignancy of Ed's following his dreams.  Both Jeffrey Jones and Bill Murray are great in their roles.  Criswell was a bizarre character and I enjoyed the real person's opening monologues in Ed's pictures. The film is mostly funny up to and including the making of<br/><br/>""Bride Of The Monster"" but gets sadder and grimmer for a period when dealing with Bela's addiction and time in hospital but the film gets funny again for the making of ""Plan 9"".  The end gives the viewer some additional information about some of the main people portrayed and the film ends on a beautiful note (even though the reality for the characters isn't so great).  Ed's left in the film with his dreams of fame and the film is an inspiration to dreamers and non-conformists everywhere.  Funny and sad and always fascinating.  Another stroke of genius from Tim Burton."

","If you look twice at the context in which this movie was made, you can't regard it as anything but serious. It's a biopic that may very well have you laughing hysterically. And if you do find your funny bone being tickled, you're not getting the wrong message; you're getting the right one, because this true story told so accurately and meticulously by Tim Burton is really that funny - and tragic.<br/><br/>Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space won the Golden Turkey Award in 1988 as the Worst Movie Ever Made. This is a singular distinction. Many film critics say that amateur film makers would have done a better job. Check the memorable quotes section to see just how bad Wood's scripting was - it's atrocious.<br/><br/>Yet Wood is history, and through Plan 9 and especially this movie, possibly as well-known as his idol Orson Welles.<br/><br/>The movie itself is done with such care and precision that it can't help but engage you. Depp's Wood is nothing short of fantastic; no one but Parker could have done the Fuller part as well as she did; they're all great.<br/><br/>But Martin Landau stands out from the beginning. Landau does more than portray Bela Lugosi: He is Bela Lugosi. The transformation is so complete you forget you're watching an actor and become completely engrossed in this tragic tale. Wood is tragic, and it's about Wood this movie is made, but the personal real life story of the real life Lugosi is almost too horrible to contemplate here. As Landau quips, 'Hollywood chews you up and spits you out.'<br/><br/>We watched this tale on video just tonight; I'd seen it once before. And I couldn't get over how incredible Landau was doing the Lugosi part, and blurted out loud 'but that should have been worth at least an Oscar nomination.' How appropriate then for the temporarily clueless yours truly to discover that Landau won a total of 11 (eleven) major awards for best supporting actor, including the Golden Globe and the Oscar.<br/><br/>Everything that Ed Wood was not Tim Burton is in this movie. Alexander's screenplay, based on Grey's book, is spot on at every twist and turn. Ed Wood is simply amazing, and its b/w cinematography should not bore you either, but knock you out: this movie is a tribute, as the Golden Turkey Award was, 'to everyone who has ever had a dream, an ambition, and pursued it relentlessly - only to fall flat on their faces.'"

","Director Tim Burton has weaven a film here that is nothing short of a masterpiece. Every serious film buff should see this film, as it cronicles the life of ""the worst director in history"". Johnny Depp is superb as Edward D. Wood Jr. an up and coming director whos dream is to be the next Orsen Wells and make the next Citizen Kane, just to bad everything he makes is hated my critics world wide, he is even seen as a practical joke when he hands his movie Glen or Glenda over to the people at Warner Bros. Studios. Matrin Landau plays longtime friend and once great horror movie actor Bela Lugosi who is best known for his work as Dracula, who is portrayed here in his years where he was seen as a washed up drug addict who no one cares about anymore. Next came Bride of the Atom who's name was later changed to Bride of the Monster. But the movie flopped, people were even rioting in the theater at the movies premire and Ed and his cast had to leave because they were being attacked. Og course by that time Wood was out of money, Lugosi was in a rebhabilitation center and things were looking down. But after the death of Lugosi Ed got the opertunity to make another film through the funding of a baptist church, that he promised to be a huge blockbuster and make lots of money. That film was PLan 9 From Outer Space and it is funny because even though Lugosi is billed as the top actor he only appears in footage that was shot earlier by Wood and for the rest of the movie is a body double who wasn't allowed to show his face in the movie. It's very ironic because in the theater at the premire of Plan 9 Wood said ""This is it, this is the one I'm going to be remembered for."" That statement couldn't have been more true just to bad not the way Wood wanted. See it was the one he was remembered for but he was remembered for it because it was penned one of the worst movies ever made. Burton shot the film in black and white and does a fantastic job of making the movie feel like it is actually from the days of Ed Wood. Depp is great as Wood himself but it is Landau as Lugosi who steal every scene he is in, whether it be him expressing his hate for Boris Karloff (Frankenstien) or to him shooting the final scene in Bride of the Atom where he must be attacked by a giant octopus but he has to wave they tenticles around himself because someone forgot to get the motor to run the prop. The film is often times very hilarious in seeing that Wood thought he was making brillent works and mostly only did one take for each scene and in the beginning seeing how the film crew would have to run away everytime the police came around because they were filming without a permit. The mvie also has several scenes that scream satire, like whenever Wood says he has a big star to be in his movies and he tells people it is Bela Lugosi eveything thinks he is already dead and a scene where Wood asks a crew member which dress he likes and he says well I'm colour blind I can't tell the difference but I like the dark grey one. This film is nothing short of genious and even though it will not grab the attention of everyone who sees it there is no denying Burton has carved himself yet another winner."

Wood Jnr, who today is regarded as one of the worst directors of all time. Having said that, Wood's films are more sought after today than many of his more talented counterparts and have stood the test of time with reasonable success. In the movie he idolises Orson Welles and dreams of being a successful writer/director just like him, and although many have pointed out its inaccuracies - (I only know there is inaccuracies because somebody else told me there was)- I highly recommend this movie.

"jmcsween90","10","0","0","15 May 2001"," 'A' masterpiece of 'B' genius
","In the hands of Tim Burton the story of Edward D. Wood Jr  widely hailed as the worst filmmaker of all time  becomes a magnificently bizarre comic-tragic tale of a unique artist' and his struggle to make incredibly bad movies. Set during the Halcyon days of B' movies in the 1950's, Ed Wood' examines in great sympathetic detail the life, loves, film directing and cross-dressing habits of a man who has symbolised everything that is bad about motion pictures. Wood was a native of small town America who came to Hollywood to achieve fame and stardom just like so many others, and in the process he achieved just that but for all the wrong reasons. Artistically inept in every way, each of his theatrical and cinematic features was always greeted with groans of horror and disbelief on the part of critics and producers alike. Yet with this film the tragedy of Wood's abysmal work was introduced to another generation of moviegoers who were prepared to fondly recognise the eponymous hero as the King of bad movies  a title he truly deserves.<br/><br/>Depp in the role of Wood provides another characteristically quirky performance, brimming with exuberance, passion and a little self deprecating irony. Burton's film  beautifully shot in black and white  paints a loving portrait of the artist as a young battler, determined to realise his vision in its entirety and yet completely oblivious to the fact that he just had no ability whatsoever. A film that could so easily have been a cruel parody about a talentless no-hoper has under the masterful and subtle direction of Hollywood's later day Ed Wood become a wistful homage to a man with a vision that no one wanted to see.<br/><br/>Central to this movie is Wood's friendship with the ailing washed up Bela Lugosi  a major motion picture star who achieved international fame as the lead in the 1931 version of Dracula' and then gradually plummeted into obscurity and drug addiction. Lugosi stared in many of Wood's most famous films including Night of the Ghoul', the unforgettable Glen or Glenda' and the one widely regarded as the worst ever committed to celluloid, Plan 9 from Outer Space'. Martin Landau both looks and sounds like the downtrodden movie star who is desperately trying to recapture glimpses of his former glory, and deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for the role. Ed Wood's reverential treatment and acceptance of the man everyone else forgot is the touching heartbeat of the film that sketches its characters as so inherently likeable despite being outcasts of society.<br/><br/>With its inspired casting and evenly paced direction that blends a mixture of horror, comedy and tragedy, Ed Wood' is perhaps the finest film in Burton's distinguished yet highly unusual career. In some respects it works well as a later day Sunset Boulevard', a damning indictment of Hollywood's shunning of the little guy and burying the stars that have lost their appeal, yet on the other hand it is reverential biopic of a man who followed his dreams and visions as diligently as his mentor Orson Welles  although without the same degree of success. The principle strength of the film lies in the outstanding performances of Depp and Landau, with a supporting cast including Sarah Jessica Parker as his demented girlfriend, Patricia Arquette as his one true love, and Bill Murray as camp would be transsexual providing excellent support.<br/><br/>Wood may well have been the worst film maker of all time, yet as Tim Burton himself said `It takes talent to make a really good movie, but it also takes talent to make a really bad movie.' Wood never compromised what little artistic integrity he had, and in the process he has given us some rare atrocious gems to savour. These in turn have provided Burton with enough material to make a Grade A' film that celebrates the life of Wood and shows him as a man with a vision who was prepared to realise it at any cost. Finally we get to see that vision as it was originally intended. Quite simply this film is a masterpiece."

","For those among us who remember when about half the movies that came out were in black and white, and nearly all of television, and who look back fondly on those days, Ed Wood is, if nothing else, a feast for the eyes. It is a gorgeously photographed film and I loved every second of it for the cinematography alone. Its subject, Ed Wood, was and to a large extent still is a marginal figure in film history. He was a man in love with the movies who wanted to be a great film-maker. Most of his career was spent, sadly, making low-budget pictures, and he apparently never had much talent to begin with. What he did have was enthusiasm, and the movie of his life is (charitably) about this great passion he had for films rather than about his talent. Ed had his problems, which included among other things, a fondness for dressing up in women's clothes. He spent his professional life, such as it was, on the lunatic fringe (literally) of Hollywood, and it is this marginal, if you will crepuscular world, that director Tim Burton lovingly recreates in his film. One of the things I like most about this movie is Burton's total immersion in this world of genuinely eccentric people. Now there's eccentric and eccentric. Purple hair and body-piercing are not, strictly speaking, eccentric, at least not anymore. These Ed Wood characters are eccentric from within. They don't need funny costumes, though most of them do tend to dress oddly, but they needn't have bothered. This bunch would be weird in three-piece suits. Bela Lugosi also figures in the story (natch), and the scenes with him I found sad rather than funny. As Lugosi Martin Landau is extraordinarily good. At its core Ed Wood is a valentine for the world of the might-have-beens and wannabes of the Hollywood's demi-monde. I should add performers here; all the actors are excellent, not good, excellent. Johnny Depp captures what I imagine was Ed Wood's warmth and naiveté to absolute perfection. Jeffrey Jones is a droll riot as Criswell, and he really should be used more often than he is. I also liked Bill Murray's turn as Bunny Breckinridge. As a tribute to the low-budgeters of Hollywood's Poverty Row, Ed Wood could scarcely be better. The irony of all this is that in celebrating the life of a hack director Tim Burton has shown himself to be anything but."

","Highly enjoyable and very amusing biopic of the ""worst director of all-time"", Edward D. Wood Jr.  He made the'classics' ""Glen or Glenda"", one man's struggle to cope with his transvestite tendencies, and his masterpiece, the supernatural thriller ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".  Of course, the film glosses over some of the more unpleasant aspects of Wood's life and takes some creative licence but the finished result is fantastic. Johnny Depp gives a career best performance as the charismatic Wood, making the character very believable and endearing, this being one of the reasons the film works so well.  A great deal of praise must surely be given to Oscar-winner Martin Landau, who plays the frail Bela Lugosi with great aplomb; the likeness is quite uncanny.  There is also able support from the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, George ""The Animal"" Steele, Mike Starr and the brilliant Bill Murray in one of his best roles, as the effeminate Bunny Breckinridge.<br/><br/>  There isn't really much of a plot (who needs one when you're having so much fun?), the film focuses on the Ed's dream of being the next Orson Welles (""He was twenty-six when he made Citizen Kane - and I'm already thirty!""), and there is a truly memorable scene in which he meets his hero, probably my favourite scene in the film, in fact.<br/><br/>I can't praise the film enough, one of the most enjoyable films ever made, and this is still director Tim Burton's second best film, behind the outstanding ""Edward Scissorhands"", which also starred Johnny Depp in the title role.  Bettered in 1994 only by ""The Shawshank Redemption"", I heartily recommend this film to anyone and everyone.  Sheer brilliance."

Ed Wood is portrayed as this endlessly optimistic filmmaker who doesn't mind that his movies are way below average, he loves them and that's what counts in the end.<br/><br/>The one performance that really jumps right into your face when watching this movie is the role of Bela Lugosi, played to perfection by Martin Landau. His portrayal of the legendary horror actor was very moving and sincere. Of course Johnny Depp was awesome as always in the role of Ed Wood, his wide-eyed fervor while pitching his scripts is hilarious.<br/><br/>I especially loved the ""cameo"" of Orson Welles, this was done to such great believability that it was hard to see that this was really Vincent d'Onofrio sitting there playing the legendary director.<br/><br/>This is a must for anybody who recognizes that Ed Wood's movies are both hilariously bad and on the other hand a lesson that everybody can make movies if you just don't think about it too much.

","The first time I saw this film a few years back I was totally drawn in by the way that Depp played the single-minded and passionate Wood, by Landau's remarkable performance as Lugosi and by a host of other exceptional portrayals of very unusual characters. I watched it again last night and I began to feel a little uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Landau was, of course still brilliant and most of the minor characters still came across as simultaneously believable and unbelievable. But the Wood character seemed colder, where once I saw passion I now began to see ruthlessness, where once there was single-mindedness now there was neglect of responsibility to his cast/friends. I'm not totally sure which Wood I was supposed to beleive - I liked the first one better.<br/><br/>This change in my perception of the lead role suddenly made the film seem overlong (actually at 2 hours plus it IS overlong), made Depp's acting seem a little less convincing and made the whole a less enjoyable (if still engrossing) story.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it I suggest you do, if you have seen it you might find that things have changed when you watch it again.

","Several weeks ago a director who won an Oscar in the 1940's died, and I didn't recognize his name or his achievements. Ed Wood wanted desperately to be known as a director, and people remember him better today than many much more illustrious directors. It's hard to consider him a failure, since he did write, direct, and make films, (albeit terrible ones), he is remembered, and his films are popular still. This film captures the essence of his desire to direct films, no matter under what circumstances. It's a perfect film for Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, who seem to specialize in off the wall films about unusual characters. They show the cast of oddballs he gathered around him to make his movies, without casting obvious judgement on them, thereby allowing the audience to draw it's own conclusions. The first time I saw it in the theatre, at least 1/3 of the audience walked out in the first ten minutes, and the remainder enjoyed every minute. Highly recommended, but not a mainstream film. I was surprised and impressed that Martin Landau received an Oscar for his role, since it wasn't a type of film likely to be popular with hollywood's cognoscenti."

","Well, what is there left to say after the justly deserved accolades laid at the feet of Tim Burton's direction (particularly his inspired decision to shoot in black and white), Johnny Depp's quirky but on-target performance (the real Ed Wood, from what I've read, truly did believe that he was making films of importance), and, of course, Martin Landau's career-best performance as Bela Lugosi (anyone who likes him here should check out his work in the old ""Outer Limits"" episode, ""The Man Who Was Never Born"")? Well, how about Burton's subtext about the headaches of getting a movie made?<br/><br/>You see it practically every step of the way. Wood trying to find positives in a decidedly negative review of his play. His trying to convince a producer that only he and he alone can film the story of a transsexual. His infuriating said producer twice, first by changing the story to that of a transvetite, then by making it so badly that the producer will never have anything to do with him again. His pitch session with David O. Selznick, which he had to sell an idea off-the-cuff as it were (I imagine Burton has had to go through similar aggrevation with studio suits, whom Harlan Ellison once described as less literate than a dyslexic). His trying to keep his actors happy with their dialogue, parts, etc. so that they keep working. His never-ending struggle to find financing for his films. His duking it out with his financiers (a Baptist church, no less!) over what his vision of the movie should be. I sincerely believe that there is not a director on the planet who could not relate to at least one of these instances, if not several. The scene where Wood meets his idol, Orson Welles (another director who had to swim upstream for his entire career in film), just underscores many of the points made here.<br/><br/>Not that anything else that's been squeezed into this picture doesn't help make it great. But that little facet of this gem of a film has never been alluded to and I thought that it would be best if it were. I wonder what the real Edward D.

","A touching look at the life of one of filmdom's most confusing figures. Ed Wood, the man, the struggling film-maker, the transvestite, wanted so dearly to be recognized as a Hollywood film-maker, but his works came out so warped and inferior, that they almost seemed like practical jokes. He spent his later years writing pornographic novels, forgotten by the film industry he had embraced, only to become the Holy Fool of Hollywood after his death.<br/><br/>The cast is flawless. Bill Murray's performance as transvestite entertainer Bunny Breckenridge is hysterical, Lisa Marie as the icy Vampira is wonderful, but it's Martin Landau's Oscar winning performance as the near-forgotten Bela Lugosi that brings the film it's dramatic and tragic nuances (Many say that Landau earned Lugosi his Oscar by proxy).<br/><br/>The scenes with Wood and his entourage are to be cherished. The riot that happens at the premier of ""Bride of the Monster"" leaves the party running for their lives. They escape in a taxi, literally at the last possible second, as the mob of unruly teenagers nearly overtake them. Lugosi comments, ""Now THAT was a premier!"" Priceless! <br/><br/>This is recommended to be watched before seeing ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"". You'll swear the same actors are in both films!<br/><br/>An odd yet touching tribute to an odd film-maker, and a sign that despite all the negative press and cold shoulders he received in his life, Ed Wood has finally been justified and venerated."

Seeing Plan 9 From Outer Space prior to viewing Ed Wood helps a lot in getting many of the jokes, but it's not 100% necessary.  The scenes from Wood's films are painstakingly recreated, and the black-and-white cinematography is beautiful to look at. Francois Truffaut once said that he was only interested in films that show the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema - this film does both.

","A funny and surprisingly affectionate homage to the ""Worst Director of All-Time"" Edward D. Wood, Jr., ""Ed Wood"" is easily one of the best films of the 1990's and, despite major success with acclaimed films like ""Batman"" and ""Beetlejuice,"" remains director Tim Burton's masterstroke.<br/><br/>Considering the subject matter, ""Ed Wood"" could have easily been a mean-spirited parody of a man who craved significance and success, but Tim Burton has always had a soft spot for misunderstood oddballs (""Edward Scissorhands"" immediately comes to mind.) Once again working with ""Scissorhands"" star Johnny Depp, Burton not only shows Ed Wood as a likable human being, he also displays warmth and genuine admiration for the cult hero who wasn't fully appreciated until years after his death.<br/><br/>Depp truly shines here in the title role. An actor usually known for his brooding performances in such films as ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and the aforementioned ""Edward Scissorhands,"" Depp is all-smiles and charm as Ed Wood. An eternal optimist with more determination than talent, Ed Wood was also well-known for being a crossdresser...""Ed Wood,"" the film, addresses his transvestism with amusing matter-of-factness and spends a great deal of time on the making of Wood's laughably-bad cross-dressing opus ""Glen or Glenda."" The cross-dressing, of course, causes a strain in Wood's relationship with his usually supportive girlfriend Dolores Fuller (played to the hilt by Sarah Jessica Parker; the real Dolores Fuller reportedly hated Parker's portrayal of her). Wood, of course, only wants to be accepted as is; oddly enough, Dolores is the only person close to him who can't accept his passion for wigs and soft angora sweaters.<br/><br/>Despite being set back by uncooperative girlfriends, disillusioned studio execs, and a constant lack of money, Wood keeps working (the film covers the making of three of Ed Wood's features, including the classic ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""), with his loyal troupe of amazingly amateurish actors and crew members following his every whim. The film captures quite nicely how Wood's optimism and sweet nature allows him to maintain an assortment of odd, but extremely loyal, disciples. But together they all share a common goal...movie stardom. (One interesting note...like Ed Wood, Tim Burton often uses the same actors in different films; Johnny Depp, Jeffery Jones and Lisa Marie are just a few of the actors who have appeared in several Burton films.)<br/><br/>Most of the film, however, details Ed Wood's friendship and working relationship with aging horror legend Bela Lugosi (played by Oscar-winner Martin Landau in an amazing performance). By the time he began working with Ed Wood, Lugosi was a washed-up drug addict who couldn't even pay his bills, let alone get parts in movies. Although Wood and Lugosi initially use each other (Wood wanted a marquee name in his films, Lugosi just wanted to work), they eventually learn to respect and even love one another. Once again, Landau's performance is truly astonishing, and his on-screen chemistry with Depp is a sight to behold. They make a great team.<br/><br/>Filmed in glorious black-and-white, ""Ed Wood,"" like all biographies, takes liberties with the real-life story of Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Lugosi was actually married when he began starring in Wood's films, for example....one interesting note, however, is the original script for ""Ed Wood"" covers Wood's brief marriage after his break up with Dolores Fuller; this storyline was cut for the film). Stellar performances abound...Patricia Arquette is sweet as Kathy, former pro-wrestler George ""The Animal"" Steele is uncanny as former pro-wrestler Tor Johnson, Jeffery Jones is positively brilliant and hysterical as would-be psychic Criswell, Lisa Marie (Tim Burton's real-life mate) gives an appropriately dour performance as Vampira, and Vincent D'Onofrio has an effective cameo as Orson Welles. But the real scene-stealer here is Bill Murray, who gives one of the best performances of his career in a small role as the flamboyant Bunny Breckinridge.<br/><br/>Even if you aren't familiar with Ed Wood, and even if you have never heard of Ed Wood before in your life, ""Ed Wood"" is still marvelously entertaining. Alternating between hysterically funny moments and depictions of true sadness and alienation, this movie has something for everybody. An absolute must-see."

But the movie isn't about 'Glen or Glenda' it's about Ed Wood, his friends, and his career. One such friend was Bela Lugosi (Landau) Star of great movies such as 'Dracula' and 'The Black Cat'. Some of the funny things are about how much Bela hates Boris Karloff. Calling Karloff a s.o.b. and other vulgar words he shows he hates him. Another film of Wood's which I say was a lot better was 'Bride of the Monster' (a.k.a. Bride of the Atom) which stars Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson (George ""The Animal"" Steele), and more of Wood's friends. After that he made a film named 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' in which because of Lugosi's death Wood used a double for Lugosi and made the movie keeping the doubles face covered.

While I don't have a clue about the true real-life story of Edward D. Wood Jr, one thing I know for sure is that I'm having heaps of fun.<br/><br/>This biopic is basically about Ed Wood himself, the so-called ""Worst Director of All Time"" and how he is determined to make it in Hollywood. Although many considered his movies to be awful and regard him as a director with no sense whatsoever about the art of filmmaking, Ed Wood is portrayed as a director of immense passion for storytelling, yet who is so in love with every shot being taken and felt there is no need to take a second one.<br/><br/>In Hollywood, Ed Wood has a bunch of strange and colorful associates from Tor Johnson the Swedish Wrestler to Vampira the Night TV Hostess which are all very amusing to watch.  But beneath all this, the movie's strongest and best aspect is about Ed Wood's friendship with the legendary and ailing Bela Lugosi. Herein lies the heart of the movie's storyline; the fact that both are ridiculed by their Hollywood contemporaries yet still recognizing greatness in each other is just endearing.  They helped out each other, and I really felt a pang in my heart when Ed Wood sadly watched the last film reel of Lugosi ever filmed while ""The Swan Lake"" plays in the background. Credit is to Martin Landau; he truly deserved those many awards that were heaped upon him for his most AMAZING role as Lugosi.  As for Johnny Depp, he is great for playing Ed Wood with a fresh enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is to be commended for his portrayals of all the characters in the movie.  To make us laugh, he clearly pokes fun at them and the whole B-movie culture in the 60's but it's obvious that those portrayals were done with sincere affection.  One of the funniest scenes is when Lugosi were asked for a glass of wine and said ""I don't drink ... wine.""  It was a pleasant surprise for Dracula fans.  Another hilarious scene is when Lugosi gave the performance of his life wrestling a puppet Octopus in a cold lake.<br/><br/>Ed Wood is a great movie that pays proper homage to its characters and the culture that they lived in.  It can be enjoyed again and again, and still makes me grin and laugh.  Most definitely one of my favorite films of all time."

","Ed Wood, was Tim Burton's best for sure. I enjoyed it from the beginning, which is an introduction like they made in cheap scary movies of these years to the great ending where they tell us everything that happened to the characters after the Plan 9 From Outer Space Premiere. it was funny and touching and I'll never see Edward D. Wood Jr. the same way. He was not stupid at all, he simply had no talent. He was nice and positive and happy most of the time, and he enjoyed his movies, he really thought his films were great. He is just the opposite of Orson Welles, who made Citizen Kane, the best American film. Ed Wood made the worst. Martin Landau was EXCELLENT in the role of Bela Lugosi, and his arms were disgusting (because of all the stitches he had) and he won the oscar for best supporting actor, but I thought Johnny Depp gave an AWESOME performance too. It represents the story of Edward D. Wood Jr. the best way we could imagine. The fact that the film was in black and white was another good point too...we were more in the atmosphere of old films. It was funny, smart, and it was not laughing at anyone, even with the main character (the worst director of all time) and that was a good surprise. The kind of film you have to watch over and over again...don't rent it, BUY IT. It is great! Not the best film I've seen, but quite a good piece of entertainment. I was surprised to see Bill Murray in this, who was in my mind a bad actor...but I realized he played in good films and in this one he did a very good job. When I'll see Ed Wood films, I'll remember how he was feeling and how he liked them, and I'm sure I'm gonna like them too, if I watch them with this idea in my head. Watch it at all costs...I didn't find it in the three first videos I went to, but I finally found it and enjoyed it. I give it 87%."

Unlike the star-studded cast of Burton's subsequent film, ""Mars Attacks!"", where it was painfully obvious that everyone was in on the joke, the ""actors"" in the likes of ""Bride of the Monster"" sincerely believed they were making great art, and that's what makes these old movies so much fun.

","Thank god for Ed Wood - and thank god Tim Burton(""Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Edward Scissorhands"") broke all the Hollywood rules and got this wonderful picture made!  ""Ed Wood"" portrays Edward D. Wood Jr, that boy-wonder writer/director who was responsible for ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Orgy of the Dead"", and a whole host of miserably awful, and unintentionally funny, horror moovies in the 50's & 60's. Director Tim Burton's film is a labor of love; he has cast the film to perfection, photographer it beautifully, and has resurrected flawlessly a unique period in film history.  Words cannot describe the near-perfect performances by everyone cast in this film, in particular Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi - he brings a bittersweet tragic quality to Bela's character that was well-worth his Academy Award(finally they picked the right one!). Johnny Depp is no less wonderful as the boyish, angora-craving Ed Wood himself, who idolizes Orson Wells, wears his girlfriend's sweaters, and naively believes he can make a blockbuster Hollywood film.  Depp, in fact, shows another side of Wood, as someone who cares about film, and someone who does not judge people because of their weaknesses, a rare thing in rapacious Hollywood.  Sure, all of Ed Wood's moovies are schlock (and I do mean ALL of them), but at least the first group of them are made with such feeling and innocence that you just have to love them; certainly, they are the fount from which devotion to Le Bad Cinema, and even MST3K, begins.  Burton has made far moore Hollywood/mainstream films (""Batman"", ""Sleepy Hollow""), but it's a moovie like ""Ed Wood"" that separates him from the typical hack Hollywood automaton.  This moovie would never had been made without Burton's creative genius and pull, so no matter what schlock he directs for The Man, we all should thank him for making this glorious, hilareous tribute to the King of Turkeys!  The MooCow says this is a must for all Ed Wood fans, and even those not afficionados of schlock cinema will enjoy this moovie as well.  Great soundtrack is worth getting.

","Being a really big Tim Burton fan, I can't say it's easy to pick which one is the best. Edward Scissorhands had the emotion, Beetlejuice had the comedy, Batman had the quirkiness, Sleepy Hollow had the visual scenery, and so on, and so on. But I still think that one movie stands out when I think of Tim Burton's movie. That movie is Ed Wood. The movie is a total masterpiece! The screenplay was hysterical. The acting was superb. The music was great. The directing was amazing. Every single thing that could be cool in a Tim Burton movie is in this movie! The two actors that stand out for me in this movie is, of course, Johnny Depp, who gave an incredible performance as the worst director of all time, and Martin Landau, who was outstanding as the late horror icon Bela Lugosi.<br/><br/>The mostly true story is about Edward D. Wood, Jr., who made such atrocities as Plan 9 From Outer Space, Bride of the Monster, and Glen or Glenda. He was awarded, after his death, an award for the worst director of all time. The movie is about his life and his journey to become a great movie director. Through his years he befriends Bela Lugosi, Crizwell, and many other '50's icons. Ed also has a problem, a problem his girlfriend (sarah jessica parker) has never known about. He's a transvestite! He likes to wear woman's clothes.<br/><br/>The movie, although a comedy, had some dark Tim Burton moments aswell as a lot of drama in it. It fit so well together that the movie is overwhelming. I'm so glad that a large amount of critics also thought the same about this movie. Johnny Depp and Martin Landau are great, nominated Martin Landau for an award, and everyone else in the movie is great to, such as Bill Murray, Jeffrey Jones, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Patricia Arquette.

","Tim Burton. He's a great storyteller. The first two Batman movies were well directed and nicely performed by its stars, and had some other good elements. Edward Siscorhands was very poetic and good, and Depp was terrificly sympathetic as the protagonist. I loved The Nightmare Before Christmas and I think it is one of the best animated films of all time. Mars Attacks! was very comical and I seemed to enjoy it more than everybody else did(though I would have liked to see stop-montion flying saucers).<br/><br/>But he was born to direct this movie. This movie is so offbeat and so oddly comical it could have only been done by him. And throughout this film you can see clearly that Burton understands Ed Wood. Any other director given this script (and an excellent script it is) would have rewritten and made fun of Ed Wood. They would have scoffed at him and lobotimized the character for laughs. But not Burton. He plays Ed's relationships with the other characters so well. Ed befriending a dying Bela Lugosi is very well done. Not too gushing with emotions but not too rigid, he plays it like they're friends. Bela is played superbly by Martin Landau. Bela knows the movies he's making are not the high quality pieces he was making in the thirties, but he's happy he's getting work and that somebody has faith in him enough to put him in one of their movies. That somebody is as big a fan of Bela's as Ed is. Ed's the shining light in old Bela's life.<br/><br/>And Ed. Somebody knew there was a story in Ed Wood. You feel sorry for the guy, knowing he's gonna turn out to be a porn director. An average Joe who wears Angora sweaters and is so upbeat he doesn't let pesky little things like huge executives denying him a movie. And that's where the movie succeeds the most. Ed's such a likeable guy. In the movie, there's not a mean-spirited bone in his body. He'd never back-stab one of his friends. And Johnny Depp. He's great. He's been a great actor before, but has always played a deadpan personality, but in this he's over the top and very comical.<br/><br/>On one last note, there's on great shining star in this movie: Bill Murray. He has a good time playing Bunny Breckinridge, the homosexual sex-change-wannabe.<br/><br/>All in all a great comedy. I hope I didn't make it to serious sounding, because really it's a great comedic film. The movie is just downright, out-and-out funny."

And some stories are left untouched, like the time when Tor Johnson swallowed five bottles of wine and fell unconscious, and it took a dozen men to get him to the ambulance. Still, this is a very entertaining movie. Johnny Depp is probably at his best here (he's a good neurotic), along with Martin Landau, but my favorite probably is probably a toss-up between the guys who played Conrad Brooks or Paul Marco.<br/><br/>In short, this is a film that will appeal to any fan of the B-movie industry.<br/><br/>Now I just wonder if there could be a biography of Coleman Francis or Roger Corman . . ."

","Although ""Ed Wood"" is a satiric look at the lives and times of the infamous B-movie director and his friends and cast members, it's also Tim Burton's opus to the passion of movie making.<br/><br/>For those of you who know anything about the real Ed Wood, his life was nowhere near as invigorating as this film portrays it (although the film seems to accurately portrays the best years of his career).  True, Wood did progress into alcoholism and directing soft porn, but Burton emphasizes the struggling director's passion for his art.<br/><br/>After seeing this film, I picked up a copy of the book containing snippets of interviews of many of Wood's cohorts, and found that almost all of the film is true to life.  I remember someone saying in the book that although Wood's films were viewed today more for their cheesiness and bad production values rather than their artistic merit, Wood would have been elated to see that his films were so widely watched.  Burton never explicitly says that in his film, but I really wouldn't doubt that fact judging from Johnny Depp's enthusiastic portrayal of Wood.<br/><br/>Keep a close eye on some of the allusion's to Orson Welles's ""Citizen Kane"" throughout the film.  Not only does Wood idolize Welles, but Burton uses several shots and relationships that seem influenced by ""Kane"" (e.g., the opening shot of Hollywood is similar to Welles's shot of the rafters in the opera house, and Wood's relationships with his girlfriends is similar to those of Kane's).<br/><br/>For the record, this is the film that made yours truly go to film school. After a year of vigorous cinematography courses, I changed my major, abandoning my dreams of being the next Spielberg.

Depp is marvelous, but it is Martin Landau that showed us the glimpse of TRULY GREAT ACTING, a completely electrifying moment in the archway of an old building.  I have seen Landau make even lesser roles gleam like he did in this movie enough times to prove that great acting is no accident."

","At the time of its release, Tim Burton's ED WOOD seemed a slight but sweet-spirited charmer; a few years later, it seems like an almost-great movie, a sincere song of love to a giftless Pollyanna's love for filmmaking. Burton cast perfectly down to the tiniest bits, and Peter Suschitzky's steely black-and-white photograph puts the movie's images in the league of RAGING BULL and THE ELEPHANT MAN. Burton seems somehow more deeply connected to this material than anything in his other pictures--in his kitschy way, he has as sure a touch with this story and its milieu as Coppola had with the Corleones."
"jwh-2","10","0","0","23 March 1999"," a touching, hilarious romp through the weirdness of Hollywood film-making
","The late Edward D. Wood, Jr. is (in)famous as one of the worst directors in film history. His repertoire includes  Glen or Glenda, his paean for understanding for transvestites; Bride of the Monster, a mad scientist attempts to creates a race of supermen to take over the world; and his magnum opus, Plan 9 From Outer Space, wherein effete grave robbers from space invade Earth. Ed Wood was the Eddie the Eagle of Hollywood--he loved making movies, but didn't have an ounce of talent in his body. Tim Burton directs this loving portrait of the ups (such as they were) and downs of the career of Ed Wood. I loved this movie. I'd loved every frame of this movie. Photographed in glorious black and white, the movie looks absolutely exquisite and gorgeous. (Do not let Ted Turner in the same room as this movie!) The cast is marvellous. Johnny Depp brings out Wood's eternal optimism without playing him for a moronic simpleton who likes wearing his wife's clothes (""You think it's the worst film ever made? Well, my next one will be even better!"" -- ""Yes, I like sex with girls. Wearing their clothes just makes me feel closer to them.""), and Martin Landau is spellbinding as the tragic Bela Lugosi, the nearly forgotten star who befriends Wood and acts (if one can use that word) in Wood's movies, while his drug abused body is quickly failing him. The supporting cast is stellar, too, particularly Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, Wood's friend and occasional co-star. It would have been very easy for Burton and company to play Wood as a no-talent idiot. Wood was not an idiot. Indeed, one gets the impression that Wood would have excelled at the ""deal-making"" aspect of Hollywood (just don't let him near the camera). Instead, Burton gives us a touching, hilarious romp through the weirdness of Hollywood film-making, delivering a loving homage to 50s B-movies, and an uplifting tribute to the human spirit. The final irony of all this is that the movie's moral is not to compromise your artistic vision, which, to his credit, is one thing Ed Wood did not do. He fought hard to bring to the screen what he thought were glorious masterpieces, and his vision, as faulty as it was, must have some enduring, and endearing, quality to it, because, here we are, forty years later, still discussing, dissecting, and, yes, even enjoying the films of Ed Wood."

","While I found this bio of director Ed Wood Jr. to be very entertaining, I must admit I was rather annoyed by the many historical inaccuracies contained in this film. It's shame that so many people watch a film thats based on a true story and think everything in it is 100 percent true. Perhaps the most annoying was Tim Burtons callous, inaccurate way he portrays Bela Lugosi. Martin Landau is good in the role, but the Lugosi shown here is not the Lugosi presented is several bio's that I have read. Lugosi was a drug addict, but it was a doctor prescribed addiction, he was not just some junky. Lugosi as far as every bio I have ever read, could cuss with the best of them, but being a gentlemen from the old country, he never cussed in front of women, as he does in this film.<br/><br/>
A few other historical inaccuracies contained in this film:<br/><br/>
1)The scene of Wood and Lugosi in Las Vegas, where Lugosi hosted the ""Bela Lugosi Review"" makes it look if the show was disaster. In the fact the stage review, directed by Wood, may actually be the only thing Wood did that received good critical notices from the trade papers. ""The Bela Lugosi Review"" ran  successfully for several weeks, audiences did not boo Lugosi off the stage. <br/><br/>2)The films gives one the impression that the only films Bela Lugosi made in the fifties were for Ed Wood. They fail to mention Lugosi's real last film, THE BLACK SLEEP for United Artists in 1956.<br/><br/>3)Ed Wood did not introduce Tor Johnson to acting in films. Johnson had been appearing in films for years before he ever met Ed Wood. It should be stated that Wood was crucial in making Johnson a star of low budget monster movies however. 4)Gregory Walcott was not cast as a leading man in PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE under the same circumstances as Tony McCoy was cast in BRIDE OF THE MONSTER. Gregory Walcott was a busy working actor in Hollywood at that time, playing minor roles in major films at the time. The real story of how he ended up being cast in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is lot more funnier than the way presented in the film. To bad Burton lacked the imagination to present the real story.<br/><br/>There are a lot more historical inaccuracies in this film, but these are the major ones I think need to be pointed out.<br/><br/>

Not so with this masterpiece of Tim Burton.  Someone finally had the guts to make a mainstream film dealing with a truly bizarre subject, the angora-sweater-wearing worst director of all time.  I was reminded of the fact that truth is stranger than fiction because fiction is limited by the human imagination. Anyway, there are just so many great scenes to mention.  There is no way I could list them all.  My favorite is when Ed Wood and his freaky band of misfits and outcasts agree to be baptised by the Southern Baptist Church. To get all the references you would need to have seen Wood's 3 most well known films: Plan 9 From Outer Space, Glen or Glenda?, and Bride of the Monster. I can truly recommend this film.  Wood's spirit appeals to the idealist in all of us.  Can we really look down on him for at least following his dream, something I doubt many of us would do?

I've never understood why it didn't do better, though I heard some scuttlebutt over the black and white issue. What a load a Cr*P! Color is completely over-rated in my opinion.<br/><br/>
For me a profound spoiler moment in this film:  was B.L. the aging/forgotten star actor trying to make a comeback. We're all going to face a moment sometime in our lives (where symbolically speaking) we find ourselves shooting up heroin in the car right before we go out to overexert ourselves and shoot the wrestling with the giant octopus scene. Is there going to be a hero Director out there trying to squeeze the last bit of star dust out of your faded career?  That makes Ed Wood the hero for me. There is the real truth. It's not about the movie it's about the people making the movie.  <br/><br/>I also love the truth of the low budget cinema. Who in that world doesn't want their ounce of blood from you? I truly believe that if you could screw yourself over to get something you needed for your film you'd do it. Oh right, that goes without saying. That's usually the first thing you do. <br/><br/>

I usually don't like Depp movies. Burton? Well, forget Burton. I'm not ready to start praising Burton for this film when the rest of the crew is fine without. It's a good thing this film wasn't like a Burton film because I would have hated.

I had no idea who Ed Wood was, but to my surprise he was the director of that great movie Plan 9 from Outer Space. Not to mention his other greats. This movie shows how Ed wasn't screwing around he was doing what he loved. I think people that labeled him worst director of all time are ignorant people.

The acting from all corners, the pacing in the directing and editing choices, the beautiful black-and-white photography, and the story setting are all superb. But the very best feature of this film is its tone. It's hard to combine the comedy of the hilarious/ridiculous scenarios that Ed Wood found himself in while embarking on a career as the Worst Director of All Time, while also showing the failure and tragedy of that career where that label was richly deserved. There are moments in ED WOOD, like Ed's explanation of why he doesn't want to re-do a shot where Tor visibly shakes the soundstage's formation and his efforts to get Bunny to not over-camp his PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE role, that are as funny as anything I've seen at the movies. And then there's genuine drama and sadness, in the relationship between Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi, that's a perfect 10 on the dramatic side of the scale.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie is ensconced on the IMDB Top 250 is sort of poetic justice. When it came out in 1994, it was quickly eclipsed by THE SPECIALIST and STARGATE, both of which made scores more at the box office than this film did. The only film of that period to get both critical and commercial super-status was PULP FICTION. After about seven years, it's great to see this film, along with THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and QUIZ SHOW, getting the recognition it deserves. This is a movie where history has given the right verdict."

Tim Burton's portrayal of a man who truly loves the movies and is living his dream almost makes me want to watch Plan 9....<br/><br/>This is a great movie, though.  The acting is superb all around, and while there are not a lot of big laughs in the film, the movie oozes warm, good-natured humor.  How can you not love the always chipper Ed Wood (played by Johnny Depp) or sympathize with the washed-up, but once great Bela Lugosi (played by Martin Landau, who won an oscar)?<br/><br/>The only flaw in the movie is that things seem to come togther  a little too neatly.  For example, there is a scene where Ed is eating at a restaurant with his new wife (or is she still his girlfriend then?).  In walks her chiropractor who moments later gets the role as body-double for Bela. Somehow, I don't think events worked so quickly and neatly in real life. Still, the movie is a comedy, not an informative (though it often is) documentary on Ed Wood.  It almost seems fitting that events in his life come together with unbelievable ease, since most of his movies operated the same way (or so it seems).  If Ed wood were to make a movie of his life, I don't think he spend an hour introducing the chiropractor and setting up his meeting with the young director.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10 and a strong recommendation."

","I can't believe the reviews I'm reading on here.  I'm seeing this film called ""brilliant"" and ""touching"" but personally, the best adjective I could use for it is ""decent"".  Like the recent Bowfinger, another movie about filming bad movies, this one gets so redundant you feel like you're getting hit over the head many times.  You keep on seeing the same scenes over and over and over again, and they lose their magic.<br/><br/>And enough about Martin Landau!  If you read these reviews you would think he gave the best performance of the century.  He certainly did a great job, but please, how hard is it to imitate Bela Lugosi's accent and make a character you feel sympathy for?  That's pretty much all he did, but he did do it extraordinarily well, so I don't really object to his winning the Oscar.  Plus you can never forget the reason he made you think he was the real Bela Lugosi was the makeup..  As far as the other performances go, I thought they were all great.  Surprising coming from a review that has been so negative so far but I must give credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked about this movie was the cinematography.  Filming it in black-and-white was a great idea, and the film probably could have never worked without it.  It's got a nice little unique look going for it.<br/><br/>I think the main reason I didn't like this film was the directing.  The aforementioned redundancy was a big problem, and I felt like this film could have easily been 30 minutes shorter.  Also, the film is presented in a manner that makes it get boring after awhile.  I think it could have been a lot funnier and more informative if they showed WHY the movies were so bad. You never really got to see that, except when it was blatantly(and quite humorously) showed in the octopus scene, which elicited a laugh from me. This film has a bit of an identity crisis.  It's not sure if it wants to be sympathetic to Wood, showing us the stupidity of his movies, letting us know what his friends were like, showing us how he actually got these movies made...it juggles through all and never really decides on one thing to focus on, making the film get muddled. <br/><br/>So I give this movie a 5/10 because it disappointed me.  It could have been a lot better if it had another director, in my opinion.  The editing wasn't very good either.

","This picture is such a good example of the living end of the American sense of humour, it's astonishing that Jud Apatow did not produce it. The basic material is amusing enough: the story of a movie director so pathetically bad that he never even tried to make a good film. Amusing, that is, for about 10 minutes before the real feature begins. Sadly, director Tim Burton is not able to spin out the talentless Ed Wood's forgettable career into a proper movie because of sheer lack of story. The man managed to pull off one ghastly failure after another far into mid-life, when television mercifully put an end to his efforts. The only angle available is his failed attempt to resuscitate the career of Bela Lugosi (Landau), an ancient vampire ham from silent days. Anyone who remembered Landau's comic role in Woody Allen's Crimes & Misdemeanours would not be surprised by Landau's rich comic creation here. But it's wasted on Depp's Ed Wood, who only has two facial expressions: brazen self-confidence and perplexed frown. There must be about half a per cent of the movie-going public that is interested in the basement range of bad films produced in the 1950s, and for them this will be de rigueur, but for everyone else, forget it."

","As someone who has watched movies ever since he was a little kid, I've seen my fair share of good ones, bad ones, and mediocre ones. However, no matter how the movie turns out, I never forget that at the end of the day, almost if not all film directors put their best foot forward on movies trying to make ends meet with art. The exact same thing can be said about Edward D. Wood Jr., the man infamously known as the Worst Director in history, as he made movies cheap and fast resulting in films in laughably dubious quality like Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and of course, Plan 9 from Outer Space...but as incompetent as he was, he made these films out of earnest intention because he had such a passion for filmmaking, and who better to tackle the project of an eccentric weirdo who had such a passion for film than another eccentric weirdo who made his own weird albeit earnest and passionate films than Tim Burton.<br/><br/>What could have easily been a straight up mockery of the filmmaker ends up being a love letter to the man, as Burton clearly understands how hard it is to get a film made, thus sympathizing with the director through trial and error. What gives Wood a spark of light in the feature is that he is so optimistic and positive about the filmmaking experience and his own movies that he did whatever it took, from hiring his friends as actors, to getting washed up star Bela Lugosi in his films, to stealing props, to getting funding from a Baptist church. Sure a lot of this seems nuts, but keep in mind many other filmmakers have done crazy things to get their films made too (look up how Apocalypse Now and Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs were made), and while Wood may have been in the wrong, his unbelievably passionate drive to making the greatest films ever made really is worth the price of viewing.<br/><br/>As for other technicalities, the acting is phenomenal, from Johnny Depp capturing Mr. Wood's upbeat and eccentric mannerisms, to Sarah Jessica Parker presenting his former girlfriend Dolores Fuller as motivating at first and then embarrassed by Ed's transvestism (the inspiration for Glen or Glenda), to Patricia Arquette as Ed's second girlfriend Kathy O'Hara presenting as sweet and accepting to Wood's transvestism, to Jeffrey Jones bringing the weird albeit earnest psychic Criswell to life, to Lisa Marie as the stern fatale Vampire, and even George Steele as the bulky unintelligible albeit sweet wrestler Tor Johnson. But the real scene stealer is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, who rightfully earned his Oscar for bringing to life this iconic horror movie actor to screen with his erratic behavior, heartbroken nature, and gentleness to Ed Wood that gives him a soft spot making one sympathize with the poor old man. Oh, and Bill Murray as the lovable homosexual Bunny Breckinridge? GENIUS!<br/><br/>The film made the right decision in not only shooting it in black & white, but by also on occasion using real stock music to create the right mood for the 1950s, almost like a time capsule. Admittedly, the movie is not 100% accurate to Ed Wood's life, but it still elevates Wood's goal to keep pushing forward through all hardships. Tim Burton even explained, ""In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some of the film is trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it."" Besides, its a movie first, and a biopic second (like Amadeus), don't except everything to click authentically. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Ed Wood is not only my favorite film from Tim Burton, but one of my all time favorites for its wonderful intent that filmmakers always try to make the greatest films ever (even if studios may disagree with their visions), the fantastic cinematography and editing, the marvelous acting, the witty humor, and just about everything else. There is a reason I never judge a movie until I see it, and that's because I don't know something unless I actually view it. Sure I may assume it could be bad, but I don't know it is until I give it the time of day to fully analyze it. If I didn't, then I would not have seen movies I love with all my heart like La La Land, The Lego Movie, Zootopia, and especially this film. That, and even if their films end up poor, filmmakers will always put their best foot forward and I respect them for that every time they try to make a motion picture. As Orson Welles in this film said it best, ""Visions are worth fighting for, why spend your life making someone else's dreams?"""

","This is definitely a good movie about bad movies. I had seen every Tim Burton film except this and his remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" so, due to my interest in old movies and in Johnny Depp, I thought I would finally sit down and watch it. And I'm glad I did. Edward D. Wood Jr. was a bizarre filmmaker who movies are legendary for being awful. But he doesn't know. He is happy and optimistic about every penny he can get and every person he can meet. He is especially excited when he sees the no longer acting, Bela Lugosi, played by Martin Landau, winning him an Academy Award. The movie was shot entirely in black and white, primarily because no one knew how Bela Lugosi would look in color. And it looks incredible. From the promising start with the graves and the lighting, it really feels like an old horror movie. Now, the movie as a whole was good but it there are some questionable aspects of it such as the language, which was unnecessary, and the way Ed's crew disrespected the Baptist church. Other than those and a few other things, the film was a lot of fun to watch and was interesting to see an important piece of Hollywood history. Now, I''m gonna go watch some of Ed Wood's bad movies!"
"axel-koch","6","1","2","3 January 2013"," Strongly acted, but too long to really enjoy it.
","Ed Wood impresses with a good cast (though it can get confusing with the many speaking parts it exhibits) but is a film that leads into nowhere. Obviously, Burton reveres Wood in some strange way, but he can't (or just doesn't) stop this biography of drifting off into a boring tale of a strange transvestite. A 80 minute flick would've told everything that needed to be told. But besides the protracting, Ed Wood is an interesting as well as odd story and you can have a nice time with it. I'll give it an extra point because of the acting of Martin Landau who rightly got the Oscar, Bill Murray who is responsible for the comical parts, and Johnny Depp who portrays Ed Wood as authentic as possible."
"leplatypus","4","1","2","9 May 2012"," Edwood candor-hands (cinematheque) (vhs)
","Well, a movie about movies, it's always a bit narcissus for me. Speaking about his art is the easiest project that a lazy author can imagine. Here, i can make an exception because the real Wood was so goofy that it's funny after all. Above all, he is a passionate man and his fire is contagious.<br/><br/>Beyond this, the movie is foremost a story about an extraordinary friendship between Wood and the old Bela. Martin Landau is totally moving playing this waned star and it's totally right he won the Oscar for this. I was surprised to see that his daughter is playing along him too but even without this, the talent of Tim is to impulse a familial mood to his cast. I would also give a very honorable to her then girlfriend, Lisa Marie, because as Vampira, she vampirises the part!<br/><br/>I really don't know what could have brought Danny but it's certain that Shore is an excellent substitute and his Wood's theme is really good.<br/><br/>Finally, i wonder if Wood was so a disastrous director. For example, i find it was really a stroke of a genius to have the cast printed over the tombstones at the beginning and in fact, the original idea comes from Wood himself. His ""Plan 9 from outer space"" opens like this but in the same time, i admit i didn't have the desire to go further !"
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","26 May 2011"," You don't need to make great films, to be a great director ...
","In the cinematic universe, among the shining stars, Bogart, Hepburn, Chaplin, Hitchcock, there is a mysterious wobbly flying saucer, hanging on a visible string pulled by a God-like Bela Lugosi. This IFO, it's not unidentified since it's pretty obvious this is a plate, is Edward D. Wood Jr., and ""Ed Wood"" one of the most surprisingly pleasant films of the last 20 years and probably, but that's my personal opinion, Tim Burton's masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film works on the primary level of a well-directed biographical comedy. I expected some good laughs: I laughed. I expected to know more about the ""Worst Director of All-Time"": I can say now, that the film grabbed my curiosity enough to make me check about Ed Wood, and his legacy has no secret for me anymore. And I expected a dazzling black and white cinematography handled by Tim Burton's magic direction, and well, my eyes were pleased too. ""Ed Wood"" is a visual, self-reflexive, homage to the Golden Age of B-movies, where cinema was still a creative laboratory with no providential help from technology and 3D effects, a time when visual effects could be disastrous, or unintentionally hilarious.<br/><br/>Now, what I didn't expect was how I would be moved by the story. ""Ed Wood"" is more than a comedy or a biopic, it's an inspirational tribute to the devotion one can have for his work. It's about loving what we do, and enjoying it so intensely that any sensation your passion procures is thrilling. This 'living one's passion' aspect, incarnated by Johnny Depp's childish expression and constantly sparkling eyes, drew a big smile on my face encouraging me to approach my life differently. But the more touching facet driving the movie is the heart-breaking friendship between Ed Wood and the horror icon Bela Lugosi, at the nadir of his career. It's a somewhat sad running gag that many people think Lugosi's dead, as to highlight how Ed Wood literally resurrected him. This friendship is the heart of the film.<br/><br/>And both Wood's dedication to his work, his profound respect and admiration to Lugosi incarnate the simple, but so overlooked, idea that love is what drives our lives. Ed Wood did films, managed to get people motivated and convinced they were doing something good, because his passion was communicative. When his pals were complaining about the harshness of a critic, he reassures them like a good and gentle man, in fact, he never talks negatively except during these moments of doubt he shares with his girlfriend, like some flashes of realization that desert him as soon as he remembers his personal dream : to be the next Orson Welles. And this positive mindset is the rainbow lighting Lugosi's bitter heart after years of stormy lows and a painful drug-addiction. I was blown away by Landau's performance: Martin Landau was the legendary Dracula's player even in the most unnoticeable mimics, looks, and majestic explosions of anger when the taboo 'Karloff' word was mentioned ... one of the most powerful supporting performances of the 90's, well deserving its Oscar. And the story's sad undertones were the perfect balance with the movie's wackiness.<br/><br/>And there's something particularly fascinating in the way Burton presents it. In fact we never laugh at Ed Wood and his crew, but at the situations. Wood's troop is so touching and funny that we'd love to share their mood. The family is getting bigger from Bela Lugosi and Bill Murray as the caustic Bunny Breckinridge, to the iconic wrestler Tor Johnson, the delicious Vampira, and the distinguished hoax Crimswell whose predictions are as priceless as worthless, not to mention the chiropractor who'll replace Bela Lugosi after his death, notably in ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" : Woody's ""pride and joy"", literally, ""The Godfather"" of bad movies. We have a charming gallery of colorful characters so 'cartoonesque' it's like reality plagiarized fiction. Burton didn't need to make films about films, Wood's life is strange enough, marked with nonsensical signs of weirdness from the beginning. God, he wears wigs, angora sweaters and panties, and deals with it in the most serious manner. Is he a homo? No, he just likes to wear that, no big deal.<br/><br/>And again, this is the touching aspect of the film: it shows a gentle face of Ed Wood, a director whose famous career is mostly preceded by the prefix 'in'. But that's because the point is to insist on his nerve, his insistence and his passion. His personal idol was Orson Welles, who inspired him to be an actor, director and writer. He doesn't have the talent, but he's got the guts, and despite the adversity, he still made films with the same passion and sincerity. As Welles told him in a great scene ""Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?"" Wood fulfilled his dreams, his movies are cult, and his genius talent at making bad movies is a reference, when more talented directors sunk into oblivion. He loved the scenes as soon as they were shot, no retakes, when one scene could take a day, Ed Wood was making 20 or 30, due to the rush. This is less an alibi for Wood than a confirmation that he was born to make films. A very interesting scene is when the producer, watching the (in)famous ""Glen or Glenda"" takes it at a joke and then genuinely laughs at the ridiculousness of the film. So bad it's good ...<br/><br/>And this is what ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or any of Ed Wood's films are about, providing enjoyment, even unintentional. And if Wood managed to do that for many movie lovers after his death, that's enough. And it takes a certain genius to be an artist whose name is most remembered than his creations. And if he's remembered as the best from the worst, I guess it's probably more prestigious than being the worst of the best."
"Okonh0wp","10","1","2","7 January 2009"," Burton's best film
","Ed Wood, however, is a brilliant idea for a biopic and it's a celebration of film making and a justification for it, even if the results are less than stellar. The subject of the film is a moderately eccentric man (played by Johnny Depp) who has attracted a cult following after his death by virtue of being considered the world's worst director. I know that's a hard title to place when you have guys like Michael Bay and Raja Gosnell still floating around along with countless film school graduates who have never even made it out of small-town film festivals. What separated Wood from the directors who spew out commercialized crap, however, was that Wood aspired to be Orson Welles and (in the film's portrayal of him, at least) he was so optimistic and upbeat about it that he thought he was well on his way to becoming him. That's what the film's about. It's that life isn't about success or failure but rather by creativity and how much you love what you do. Wood is portrayed as a winner because he dared to direct films and there's no better way to celebrate film-making than finding merit in the worst filmmaker.<br/><br/>I think it was also interesting that with the exception of his first girlfriend, Wood had a creative team (i.e. Bill Murray's character, the wrestler) that followed him through all of his creative pursuits and acted as a quasi-support system. If this story weren't based on fact, I would be left to wonder why these people would keep working with him despite the fact that he failed so often and I think that's another way that the film highlights Wood's optimism. Perhaps, this is a parallel to Orson Welles' consistent use of the same people and his famous repertory company called ""The Mercury Players. Of course, Wood's relationship is closest to Boris Karloff, his idol as a kid, who he later befriended and had the privilege of directing him in film after film. The relationship between the two and the chemistry between Depp and Martin Landau is at the heart of the film. Landau, by the way, is stellar and very deserving of his award.<br/><br/>As for the question of what separated Wood from the many people who never made it far past film school, there was surprisingly little. Wood's films were mostly independently produced and he was largely an unknown commodity when he died. He gained fame when his film ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" won a book-sponsored contest in 1981 of the worst films of all time. It's a film that was shown in the first week of my first film class and it's high number of inconsistencies and bloopers are very easy to spot. The movie answered questions for anyone whose watched this film about why it was made so haphazardly: Apparently, it was simply made as a way for Wood to appease his landlord and Burton's film has this great sense of dramatic irony as Jonny Depp's character says, ""I know this is the film I'll be remembered for,"" but not in the way he wanted."

","Edward D. Wood Jr. had everything needed to be a success  he had the passion, the motivation, an undying belief in himself and a mindless optimism that drove him forward to show the world what he believed were masterpieces of film-making. Unfortunately, the world didn't agree with him.<br/><br/>Burton lovingly chronicles Wood's first major exploits as a filmmaker, his naively positive outlook leading him to pour his heart and soul into movies that were, in a word, dire, and how he sort out encouragement and acceptance among the few people who genuinely wanted to see his next film get made. Thankfully, the film about him shares no aspects of the ones he made, and 'Ed Wood' is an absolute joy to watch.<br/><br/>Aside from the outstanding performances from the principles and supporting cast and the stunning black and white visuals, the enjoyment of this movie stems from how oddly upbeat it is, considering it tells the story of one who failed dismally at something he truly cared about. This positiveness stems from the fact that it seems to neatly overlook the failure of Ed's movies  we see his satisfaction with them and childish love for them, and there is little mention of their failure at the box office and their labelling as the worst movies of all time is hardly mentioned. But that's because the audience doesn't need it spelt out for them; flying saucers on a string, strands of appalling dialogue and constant shots of Ed yelling ""Cut! Perfect!"" are all we need to tell us that Ed had no idea had to shoot a decent film. But never puts a glitch the perpetual optimism that endures until the last frame, bought to life by Depp's terrific performance (though we know, or are told by the ending captions, that Ed's life from then on could only go spectacularly downhill).<br/><br/>If there's tragedy in the film, it belongs to Landau as Lugosi, whose moments of cynicism triumphantly undercut Depp's energy. Lugosi is a truly wretched figure, a shell of his old self given new life by a man that only the audience knows as a failure. Despite his cursing, arrogant, explosive persona being played to the full, it's the quiet moments of poignancy that make his performance really worth watching, as he stands up to his knees in water and admits that he turned down the iconic role of Frankenstein's Monster for being too degrading, then proceeds to flail around screaming, pretending to be attacked by a giant octopus.<br/><br/>Burton ensures that every frame is worth looking at, as well as striking an exceptionally good balance between comedy and tragedy; though we laugh at the characters and their faults, we're behind them all the way which makes the horrible knowledge that they failed so dismally all the more affecting.<br/><br/>'Ed Wood' is a wonderful antidote to the biographies of successes - it reads like a story of one who accomplished great things as we see his ideas coming together, his overcoming of pitfalls and final triumph...the only comedown being our own knowledge that he wasn't a seccess in any sense of the word. See it--then see Ed's movies, and try to see the passion and effort that went into them, rather than the wobbly tombstones or spaceships that cast shadows on the sky."

","How do you make a good movie about a guy who specialized in making bad movies or better yet why would you want to make a movie about Ed Wood? Well, Tim Burton wanted to and he ended up with an Oscar winning film shot in black and white. Based on the book Nightmare of Ectasy by Rudolf Grey it's the cult-like story of the odd and eccentric 1950's movie maker Ed Wood who's forgettable films became unforgettable for how bad and cheaply made they were and were rediscovered by later generations as campy cult classics. Director Burton assembled a fine cast here in Johnny Depp as Wood, Martin Landau in his Academy Award wi8nning role as Bella Lagosi, Sara Jessica Parker, Patrcia Arquette and Bill Murray. Landau in his Best Supporting Actor beat out some fine performances by Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction, Gary Sinese in Forrest Gump, Chazz Palnteri in Bullets over Broadway and Paul Scofield in Quiz Show. The film's other Oscar went for Best Makeup. Stefan Czapsky, who worked with Burton on Edward Sissorhands does a great job of cinematography here and Tom Duffield who also worked with Burton on Scissorhands and Beetlejuice is the Art Director for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar. Another veteran of Burton films Chris Lebezon who worked on Batman Returns is the film's editor. This film has some great humor and is a little slow with not that much of a compelling plot to work with but it is a fascinating watch. I've seen a couple of Ed Wood's movies myself and Buron really did his homework in recreating the world of Ed Wood and great casting too. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10."

","As of this writing, this movie is ranked the 192nd greatest movie of all time on the Internet Movie Database. The important thing is that out of millions of movies, this one is considered in the top one percent. And I tend to agree that it is much better than the average film, and probably better than the average Tim Burton film.<br/><br/>What we have is a biopic of Ed Wood, the B-movie director. And like the man himself, it sure is odd! The closest thing to this film I've ever seen is ""Shadow of the Vampire"", but as this film came first I think I have a hunch where they got their inspiration.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp shines in this film, one of his better films and probably his best with Tim Burton. Jeffrey Jones is well-cast. Sarah Jessica Parker, whom I usually despise, is even pleasant... better than her ""Mars Attacks!"" role. That Vinnie guy from Doogie Howser is alright. But the two best roles? Martin Landau and Bill Murray.<br/><br/>Bill Murray is very hit and miss with me. Some films, like Ghostbusters and Rushmore, he shines. Other times he is just too bland. But this movie? Perfect. Who knew that the best actor to play a flamboyant grandson of a former vice president was Bill Murray? I really enjoyed the sexual tension between Murray and the mariachi band.<br/><br/>Martin Landau is Bela Lugosi, best known for his role of Dracula. But although we already knew the horror movie actor, did we know the alcoholic Lugosi? The potty-mouthed Lugosi? The Lugosi who danced with cross-dressers and wished death upon Boris Karloff? Landau makes us believe this man was real, and even Lugosi's son says the portrayal is accurate. So, that's good enough for me.<br/><br/>I didn't even mention Vincent D'Onorfrio as Orson Welles... This film is highly recommended!"

"FilmOtaku","10","1","2","2 December 2003"," Tim Burton's best film may be his most subtle film
","Ed Wood, Tim Burton's biopic of the `worst film director ever' is a masterpiece.  Not only does it feature an amazing cast, headed by Johnny Depp (doing a dead-on impersonation of Wood), but it more importantly does not mock the filmmaker himself.  Burton obviously has a deep respect for Wood, because he is portrayed as what I personally have concluded him to be after much research about the man  an earnest filmmaker who would do whatever he needed to in order to have his films made.  No, he was not a technically proficient director, but he had more heart than a lot of directors who are much more commercially successful and reputable than he.<br/><br/>Burton's stylish direction and gorgeous black and white cinematography perfectly compliment the subject matter.  Minor touches, from Elfman's Theremin-laced score to his end credits (`Filmed in Hollywood, U.S.A.'  something that Ed Wood added to every one of his pictures) make this film a true tribute to its subject. <br/><br/>Having seen this film a minimum of 45-50 times, there is one scene in particular that is directed so beautifully by Burton that it bears mentioning.  After a particularly stressful day of filming, Wood suddenly stomps off the set and goes to a local bar.  What makes this scenario different from most is that he is also wearing an angora sweater, skirt, heels and a wig.  Wood then runs into his film idol, Orson Welles who proceeds to actually give him a pep talk and essentially say that in a basic sense, there are not that many differences between the two men.  This scene could have been humorous, getting a laugh at Wood's expense, but Burton makes it so touching that it affects me every time I see it. <br/><br/>
The supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant, especially Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge.  It was this film that really opened my eyes to what he could do, before he was awarded accolades for his roles in Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums.  But the real jaw-dropping character was the much-deserved Oscar winning performance by Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Barely recognizable under the makeup, he is both humorous and heartbreaking as the washed-up, heroin-addicted horror film icon that everyone assumes is already dead, or they mistake him for Boris Karloff.  His friendship with Wood is absolutely touching and very and sincerely portrayed. <br/><br/>
Ed Wood is by far my personal favorite among Burton's repertoire, which is relevant since I am a fan of most of his films.  It is a technical masterpiece and a masterfully told story of one of the most bizarre and earnest filmmakers of the last five decades.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"Ikarus65","5","5","27","15 November 2004"," No way!
","Compared to the rating on IMDb, this movie was a big disappointment. How it can rank in the top-250 completely eludes me. I appreciate many of Tim Burton's other works, but this one is going nowhere for the most part. First and foremost, it is too long for the little bit of story it has to tell. Most of the problems are with incoherencies of the script and bad timing of those scenes intended to be funny. The acting is also less than stellar (with one noteworthy exception). Depp is portraying Wood as a retarded moron all the way through the movie and Patricia Arquette's acting is more wooden than Pinocchio's would ever be. Why would anyone care for the fate of such characters? Martin Landau, of course, shines and saves the movie single-handedly. His performance of Bela Lugosi is well worth the Academy Award it earned him."

","Tim Burton's movies are colorful, visually and spiritually both. His movies are art and entertainment, a mixture of both. May be he tells the best tales. He is one of my all time favorite directors, even if he made a few disappointing movies to me like Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. One more thing about Charlie, it was disappointing, but Johnny Depp saved it. As for Johnny Depp, he is a ""colorful"" actor you know, almost all the characters he played were colorful and eccentric. As you know, Tim Burton worked with him a few times and people call this Burton-Depp corporation. Ed Wood is a black and white film. In any case, it does not matter at all, but a black and white Tim Burton film doesn't work at all. There is nothing interesting or dramatic in Ed Wood and the movie was lack of real entertainment and art so it is tasteless like Fellini's Otto e Mezzo. The plot, if there is a plot, it is uninteresting. Ed Wood is not that bad like Otto e Mezzo, but I hardly finished it. Johnny Depp was unbelievably not interesting and his performance was amateurish, he was like an amateur who tries to be Ed Wood or imitates Ed Wood. I disappointed. The other actors are between existence and non existence except Martin Landau. Especially, for Bill Murray, if you saw him in Broken Flowers or Lost in Translation, probably you will say that No, this is not Bill Murray or he is not in his mood."

","It's not unusual for great artists to have to wait many years after departing this life to achieve fame. But it's less common for such a fate to befall a really inept artist. Wood's enthusiasm far outstripped his abilities as a film-maker but sadly this attempt at telling his story doesn't do Wood the justice he probably doesn't deserve.<br/><br/>
The root of the problem is in Depp's portrayal of the central character. Wood comes across as a genial, caring optimist who loves movie-making despite his (in)abilities. Nothing wrong with that although there are some moments in the film when Depp almost verges on the Beetlejuice or Scissorhands characters from his earlier outings. But there must have been more to Wood than an eternal optimism. He loved movies - witness his brief conversation with Orson Welles - thus he must have known how excrutiatingly bad his productions were. There was a story to tell as to how Wood reconciled these opposing characteristics. Yet Depp, presumably at his director's command, gives us only a skin-deep portrayal and the opportunity was lost. <br/><br/>Martin Landau's impressive performance of Bela Lugosi in his last agonising and desparate months overrides Depp but leaves us asking why the director chose to portray Lugosi with such sympathy and depth but leave his main character only at a surface level.<br/><br/>In the end perhaps it doesn't matter too much. Do we really want to know what drove such an inadequate movie professional? Probably not, but if the attempt is made it should be made with some conviction and integrity. Cut, (not) perfect."

","This is not a film about Ed Wood. This is Tim Burton's standard script, which happens to have a guy named Ed Wood in it. How accurate is this account of the man and his career? Who the hell knows. But my impression is that Burton was telling the story he wanted to tell, in his characteristic style. It was amusing to watch, but did it do these real personalities justice? Or did Ed Wood shield himself from not doing them justice by adopting this slightly surrealistic approach, which I presume echoed the feel of an Ed Wood film? At the end of the day, I was entertained. But there was no emotional payoff in the end. And that is a big problem. And, as I said. I don't feel wiser about the real Ed Wood."

","There's something adorable about the pathetic character of Edward D. Wood Jr., at least here played by Johnny Depp at his height. From bio's I've read about him, he wasn't somebody you'd see outside a neighborhood pub, and from the dreck he produced late in his life, not somebody I'd sit down to interview. But the first decade of his career in Hollywood, as unglamorous as it was, gave him a legendary status that only a cult director like Tim Burton can understand. ""We don't have a license! Run!"", he says while in drag, shooting a scene for ""Glen or Glenda"". That's the touching, almost childlike innocence of his character we see here, wide-eyed and sensitive, ambitious yet untalented, and at least three of his films (all those featuring Bela Lugosi) have ended up in a canon of the best of the bad movies. <br/><br/>To say that this is a valentine to the worst director of all times is an understatement. It is a love letter to anybody who tried to break into the Hollywood mainstream and failed, giving a ""fantasia"" to the best of his bad movies ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" with a supposed premiere at the Pantages (of all places) who wouldn't show an A list horror film from Universal let alone an independently produced film so bad that like the producer at Warner Brothers one would think was made as a joke. Painted hubcaps, sets that shake, and refrigerators as part of laboratory equipment are just among the bad props, all ending with ""a big explosion"" and stock footage so unrelated to everything else going on that it has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>There are two standout performances in this film: Johnny Depp as Wood himself and veteran actor Martin Landau who captures every essence of Bela Lugosi yet makes him somebody I'd still want to sit down with, even if he was smoking those cheap Hungarian cigars. Bela Lugosi may not have cursed or slammed Boris Karloff like he does here (according to his own son), but that only comes very briefly, and out of a sudden fit of temperament event the worst of actors can have if the ego strikes. I, too, prefer Lugosi over Karloff, and have everyone of his movies, and even in his Monogram films, there is something about him where you can't take your eyes off of him. Lugosi could be funny, as seen in dealing with the likes of Joe E. Brown, W.C. Fields, Burns and Allen and later Abbott and Costello (not to mention the Martin and Lewis knock-offs (Duke Mitchell, Sammy Petrillo), and Landau instills every level of Lugosi's personality. His winning of an Oscar was also a win for the long dead Lugosi who gained a new generation of admirers thanks to this film.<br/><br/>Depp, with his wide eyed innocent smile, false teeth, slight speech impediment, fascination for angora and the mouthing of his own words as he watches his finished movie on the silver screen, is adorable, and in spite of the obviousness of his bad movies, you can't help but cheer him on, even if knowing he fails. Wood made more movies than the three shown here in production, but this could be almost a Hope and Crosby ""Road"" movie as it focuses on the oddball pairing of a young wannabee and an elderly has-been who come to adore each other, rely on each other, and ultimately use each other for their desire to keep their dream going. The supporting cast is fine, almost parody like, with Sarah Jessica Parker's growing frustration over boyfriend Wood making her a volcanic eruption waiting to happen, Bill Murray's effeminate transgender wannabe both touching and heartbreaking, and Jeffrey Jones' Criswell a master in fraud. George ""The Animal"" Steele is dead on as Tor Johnson, and Lisa Marie's Vampira perfection in cold creepiness. Juliet Landau, as the ""innocent young lady new in town"" who funds ""Bride of the Monster"" with $300 and lands the leading role is perfection in sly child-like manipulation, and Patricia Arquette touching as the young girl Ed meets while caring for a hospitalized Lugosi and ends up staying with him as his wife for the remainder of his life. <br/><br/>When I first saw this in the movie theater, the Century City California audience seemed to be filled with those in the business who laughed hysterically from the time Jones opened his coffin to give the opening speech to the film credits that utilized plot developments and props from the three movies here (the octopus attacking the spaceship and getting ""the shock"" of its life and the gravestones utilized as revealing the actors in the film), all throughout the lower Santa Monica Blvd. locations of Z grade movie studios, the theft of the giant octopus and Landau's hysterics as he fights with the unmoving rubber creature while drenched. The DVD includes some interesting bonus footage, most memorably scenes cut out, some of which I can understand why they didn't make it, and others that might have added some additional character development. References to the original ""Dracula"" and Wood's obsession with Orson Welles (a meeting with him as depicted here apparently never happened), but that's the fantasia of life in Hollywood for some who do not make it: they have dreams of meeting their idols, and while Wood did meet Lugosi, it's obvious that meeting Welles would have been the shining star on his movie career that may not have been a shining one, but has kept his name on the minds of cult movie lovers of all ages."

Johnny Depp plays Edward D. Wood Jr - the worst director ever and this movie follows his attempts to make good movies. He's a cross dresser who idolises Orson Welles. Unfortunately I thought that the plot was quite dull and pointless. It's shame because the direction and cinematography are great (it's all shot in black and white) and all the actors give good performances and there is a bit of good humour, but in general I found it a bit pointless and a waste of time watching. The plot wasn't that interesting and I only sat through the whole thing to see if would get ANY better, but it didn't.

","Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film.<br/><br/>This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is.

","I just saw Ed Wood yesterday on the television and to be frank, it was just okay. The movie pays a homage to the 'worst director of all time', Ed Wood Jr as it journeys through his life, his films and his women.<br/><br/>Ed Wood Jr is portrayed by Johnny Depp who plays it well but does not get into his character. The main problem with the movie was that it looked as if it was mocking Ed Wood all the time. His acting suffered in some scenes where his lost his cool in the film. The trouble with the movie was that rather that showing his passion and determination, it showed how stupid Ed Wood was. In short, I did not feel much conviction in his character.<br/><br/>The one who does a fantastic job is Martin Landau. He is humorous yet he it totally into his character.He plays a vampire in almost all his films and gets deep into his role and won a well-deserved Oscar. Sarah Jessica Parker too does a good job playing Ed Wood's wife. The other characters are all right in the film, perfect for their roles.<br/><br/>The problem with the film was the repetition which got on my nerves. Again and again, it showed him doing the same things in movies. There were some scenes though that were really good- the making of Plan 9 for example. Another problem was the language. It could have got a PG-13 rating easily but it decided to use profanity which is the only reason why it got an R. They could have just cut out small bit of language and lowered the ratings.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it to be a moderate film. 5 out of 10."

I knew nothing of Ed Wood before I watched it and although I will certainly keep an eye out for his films now, I'll keep an open mind on how realistic a portrayal this was, as I've no idea. There were times this seemed more like a documentary or a programme on the History Channel, than a film, not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>

","This movie was unlike many others that I've seen which is usually a very good thing. However it is weird but you really can't expect much else from Tim Burton so if you like his movies then it goes without saying that you'll love this one as it is one of his better helms in the director's chair. It was kind of sad seeing the actual Ed Wood struggling so much and nothing going right for him ever. Johnny Depp did an excellent turn as this happy-go-luck fellow that was always down on his luck. Bill Murray was only in a short part but he was actually pretty funny as a man in dire need of a sex change. Sarah Jessica Parker played a very good bitch since that's what she is in real life and Patricia Arquette was great in her expected nice girl role. As for Martin Landau it is without question that he deserved the Oscar here. Everything he did or said was just carried out with such perfection it was uncanny. I can't figure out why he's never as good in his other roles as he is here because it can evidently be seen that he is a absolute genius when he wants to be. This movie could be boring at times but I still liked it a lot and the wait for it to be released on DVD was well worth it.<br/><br/>Final Hatch:<br/><br/>Theaters: Glad I missed it here.<br/><br/>DVD Purchase: No, but I can certainly see myself renting it again in the not-so-distant future.<br/><br/>Rental: I love it this way!"

Why would anyone think that a film about the worst director of all and his terrible movies would make for a good movie. This is not a mainstream film but meant for those obsessive weirdos that like to watch Burton films by themselves at 3:30 in the morning. This film only shows how bad Hollywood films really can be, with its subject matter and with itself. This film should never have been allowed to be a big budget film with any real actors but if he truly wanted to capture the tone of Wood's life, he should have used a handful of bad B list actors that never made it big."

","Ed Wood is an okay film, but not as great as people make it out to be..., to shoot the film in black and white was a novel idea, but I think this choice hampered the overall viewing experience somewhat, Ed Wood is an eccentric film that would've greatly valued from the use of colour, lot's of colour instead of no colour at all would've been my call, the usage of black and white was to honour the past, give the impression of realism making the film look as though it was actually in the 1950's, but no, it needed bright vibrant colours I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Apparently Edward D Wood Jr was the worst director ever, and the film tries to explain why this is so in a bubbly, comedic kind of way..., but after seeing the film, I'm not quite sure, was he the worst director ever? He sure did make some lousy films granted, but the guy had passion and belief and personally I believe there must be worse out there, Wood was a nice, relatable character expertly portrayed by the sublimely talented Johnny Depp. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is a master of his craft, I'm always mesmerised by his performances, he brings something very real out even if his character is very outlandish..., making Depp one of the most talented actors ever most probably; and that poses a question, one of the best actors ever playing the so-called worst director ever, hmm, was Edward Wood actually that poor? Or was Johnny Depp that good at bringing his character alive?<br/><br/>Who knows?<br/><br/>The supporting cast fitted into the overall project very well, I was particularly impressed with the late wrestler, George ""The Animal"" Steele, watched him as a wrestler as a youngster, didn't know the guy could even talk, wow, first time I think I've heard the animal say anything. <br/><br/>Enjoyable viewing most certainly, but it fails to reach the lofty heights so many people have given it, am I not seeing something that so many others are?

","Despite Johnny Depp's almost menacing performance, the movie left me rather not engaged enough emotionally. The story is told in a linear, straight fashion: It's about how Ed Wood struggled to make his movies. And you get a good sense of what Ed Wood's philosophy could have been like, but I doubt that Burton tried to depict him authentically and rather showed us his vision of the man. Depp plays this quirky version very well, this might even be one of best performances before he finally turned into a walking parody in the 2010s. 
I would have liked the movie to take a breath at some time and just show me a bit more about Ed Wood's relationships or some emotional struggle the man must have had. It feels like a romanticized biopic without any real drama. In fact, we know that the real Ed Wood's life found a rather depressing ending."

","Owning and running an Ice cream store in Queens,New York reminded me of the movie Ed Wood. I felt like Ed striving to make a success out of the business and all the while collecting employees and friends of employees and the weird camaraderie I established with those unforgettable characters. In one of her last Interviews the Original Vampira (Maila Nurmi) who was a host on KABC's late night Horror show back in the 1950's was quoted as saying,"" Birds of a feather."" about how endearing the real Ed wood was to his close friends and colleagues and he wouldn't stop at no expense to help them. Transvestites , dope addicts and misfits were all assembled in the Ed Wood World of movie making in post WWII Hollywood so authentically depicted by Director Tim Burton. Johnny Deep captures the enthusiasm and integrity of this cross-dressing alcoholic and winsome wannabee director of the cinema. Wood would go to great lengths to get the picture done without permits, stealing props and even getting his entire cast baptized in order for the church to fund his movies. Martin Landau was delightful as the Iconic Bela Lugosi with a spot on Hungarian accent yet Landau's performance was never to upstage the real actor as thought by Bela Lugosi's real son who did eventually watch the movie and paid tribute to Landau for portraying his late Father. So much so that they became friends. Furthermore Landau won the Oscar for best Supporting Actor for this role. To me this move was about loyalty, creativity although questionable by higher standards Ed Woods methods and practices were at the very extreme with the one goal in mind, to get the picture done his way! So many characters. Bill Murray as the hopeful sex change recipient. Criswell played by Jeffrey Jones as the master of outrageous predictions. Sara Jessica Parker as Ed's first significant, Dolores Fuller who constantly complains and wonders what she's doing with this non- conformist cross-dressing film Director. Juliet Landau who cons her way into an Ed Wood movie who is allergic to water. George the Animal Steele as the Hefty Tor Johnson. Vincent D'Onofrio as the portly Orson Wells in one of my favorite scenes in this movie when a frustrated Ed Wood chews the fat about the problems of producing movies in Hollywood. I thought it was the actor's voice and kudos to D'Onofrio but the Wells voice was lip-synced. The real voice belonged to Maurice LaMarche. Great film for all those sentimental 50's Sci-Fi schlock movie aficinados. Where giant lizards and mutated humans not to mention UFO aliens were the norm and being produced in huge numbers annually throughout the decade, Ed Wood and his troop of lovable faithfuls put together some of the most forgettable movies ever produced which over time became a new art form of film obscure. Ed Wood hoping with each film project that this will be the movie he'll be remembered for. This movie is a tribute to all those hopefuls out of film school and it's not bad movie to watch if you were ever afraid of horror movies. Bravo Mr. Burton !"
"Dr_Coulardeau","7","0","1","5 October 2015"," There is nothing like bad press
","How can one make a film about the worst ever director in Hollywood? Not a loser really since he managed to do a few things in B movies though from what we see we could think his films are a lot more advanced in the alphabet. But certainly not the winner he wanted to be or become and he never became for sure. That will lead him into alcoholism to forget or go on dreaming, just like Bela Lugosi got into drug addiction to be able to sleep at night.<br/><br/>The film has some qualities but they are ruined most of the time by the fact the whole thing is too long. The few interesting things are the fact that the film is in black and white. Just like great films of an older period and of Orson Welles actually impersonated in the film. That's a good idea and it is rather well done including night scenes which were necessarily a problem. <br/><br/>The way the whole film industry is based on words that mean nothing is really nastily true and even the one who wanted to go to Mexico to become a lady did not. What you say never means anything and the director is nothing but a nice little small barking dog on the short leash of the producers and the producers provide the money, the little amount of money. So you do what they say. If there is a profit they will get it, not you, young dummy.<br/><br/>Those films are so mediocre when they are not bad that I wonder how they can find an audience and make a profit. The point is that they do both. So they must satisfy the deeper desires and impulses of that audience, and many of these people are not children, especially since many of these B movies are slightly restricted at least to younger children. I recently covered a very good film by Tim Burton, ""The Nightmare before Christmas,"" and someone told me that it is funny to have Christmas attacked by Halloween and that Halloween is all fun and joy for children, young people and even older people though these do not go around knocking on doors. <br/><br/>I sure believe some Halloween fun is good now and then, provided you are in a reasonable team because it might be cruel if not criminal to frighten an old person with a pacemaker. But Tim Burton is obviously fascinated by death, here Bela Lugosi who dies on location and is buried who knows and cares where; by marginal people who are breaking all kinds of norms and taboos like transvestites in the 1960s or so. And anyway you have to be morbid, and even a morbid masochist, to be a B movie director since you know it is mediocre and not good at all and that you won't make a name with them and you won't get much money out of them. It is true today you can make more with DVDs and the Internet, provided you are not looted, pirated, hijacked, in other words raided freely since the freedom of the Internet is considered to be cost-free by some.<br/><br/>This film though is sad because Tim Burton could do better. Yet it brought Johnny Depp out and enabled him to make a name and a career, or rather it enabled him to survive for a while and to show his art, and his art is great. The art of the others is more moderate. I guess Johnny Depp must be nostalgic about the good old days when he was able to play foolish tricks to everyone on screen.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","The 1950's and 1960's were the Golden Age of sleaze and schlock film, particularly for the drive-in movie-goers who had better things to do than actually watch the movie! And the King of All-Schlock has to be Ed Wood, voted Hollywood's Worst Filmmaker. If you're going to be bad, you might as well be the worst. No one remembers the fifth worst! Wood employed some of the strangest talent for even stranger projects, and the genius of Wood was not the production value but getting the funding! I mean, who in their right mind would fund ""Grave Robbers from Space"" after having read the script? Conservative Baptists? His one name star, Bela Lugosi, is remembered for being in some of best horror films at the dawn of the talkie age and some of the worst care of Wood.<br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind: Ed Wood was not alone. Aside from some of Wood's more wretched offerings, such as ""Glen or Glenda"", regarded by some critics as far more unwatchable than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", Hollywood was ripe with many memorable celluloid fiascoes. ""Robot Monster"", ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", and (my favorite) ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies"" are all cult classics of bad movie-making remembered for their combination of strangeness, silliness, and unwatchable-ness. None of these were produced by Wood and yet were made during the same era.<br/><br/>The entire era from circa 1950 to 1970 had such nutty movies that if someone wrote a novel about it, no one would believe it! At the top of the heap is the oh-so-memorable ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", so ridiculously bad that it invites after-movie conversation much more than many movies being produced today. The bad sets, the bad dialog, the bad acting are still discussed today. No one discusses films which are merely mediocre. With ""Plan 9"", schlock was elevated into its own category, probably the inspiration behind the ""Razzie Award"". ""Plan 9"" is the film by which all other schlock films are judged.<br/><br/>""Ed Wood"" with Johnny Depp in the title role chronicles the brief career of the one producer of movies who stands on a pedestal above the rest in the museum of cheesy film production where talent didn't quite get their footprints into the Chinese Theatre. If Barney Fife (the frantic deputy from the Andy Griffith Show) wrote and directed movies, the results might be of the Ed Wood variety. Wood's writing was filled with cliché, incomprehensible story lines, bad characterizations, and even worse stage direction. And yet, among his more memorable ""works"" (if works they can be called), the dialog is what we remember most. I mean who else but Wood could come up with: "" I'll bet my badge that we haven't seen the last of those weirdies."" or ""They've been like that all down through the ages. Especially in a spot like this."" Pure Razzie genius. <br/><br/>Tim Burton's homage to the era of schlock works on every level. Ironically, A-list acting talent plays some of the most borderline ""talent"" of the era who ended up in Woods' projects basically because they didn't fit in anywhere else. The Amazing Criswell a.k.a. Criswell Predicts (played by Jeffrey Jones) was amazing because he was the one act who could appear on the Johnny Carson Show without having any talent. Vampira, who in real life later sued Elvira, had just been fired from her local television studio. Sarah Jessica Parker (of Sex in the City fame) plays Wood's girlfriend. Johnny Depp, now just about as A-list as they come, plays Wood, and highest honors go to Martin Landau as the aging Bela Lugosi in a tour-de-force performance. Lugosi never could distance himself from Dracula, and Wood was the only filmmaker in town who still appreciated the Hungarian accent and his tuxedo.<br/><br/>Shot in B&W, ""Ed Wood"" almost feels like a slightly better Ed Wood movie. The film concentrates on three of his most remembered projects, ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"" (formerly ""Bride of the Atom""), and his masterpiece ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". There are a few moments of cliché writing which almost seem purposeful, paying homage to the man who wrote the book on cliché. Of course, the irony is that Ed Wood is now remembered as the pioneer of schlock movie. A few production companies do carry on the tradition, such as Troma Entertainment whose offerings have a look and feel in the Ed Wood tradition: over-the-top acting, cliché riddled scripts, and low-budget sets, such as ""Surf Nazis Must Die"" and ""the Toxic Avenger"". Many of the offerings of Roger Corman are also in a similar vain. Ed Wood may or may not have been the absolute worst, but he is remembered for living and breathing film, believing his catastrophes were art."

","I finally finished the movie Ed Wood after it sat sadly in its Netflix sleeve for over a week on my dresser. I don't know what my hesitation was, but after three attempted viewing sessions I finally got to it. I think initially it was the fact that it was a movie made in 1994. I have been finding movies made in the 90's and especially early 90's to have a trait about them that I find very cheesy. It may be the score, the transitional shotsI'm not sure. A good example, although it is from one of my favorite movies, is when at the end of ""A Few Good Men"" a big cursive ""The End"" is written across the screenlame! Anyways, Ed Wood is also shot in Black and White which initially doesn't either delight my eye or excite me. This movie on the other hand, as a whole, did those things very quickly! I thought Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ed Wood was very engaging. I didn't know anything about Ed Wood but whether he was as unique as a character in life as Depps portrayal or not, his life certainly made for a great bio pic. Everything is bizarre and I believe that Ed Wood would love this movie. As I watched with my computer by my side, I would pause to learn a little about the real life movie makers. It's interesting that Ed Wood never really reached critical fame with any mainstream movies of success. I guess the way that he made movies didn't lend to that kind of stardom.<br/><br/>The question is then, why do we know about him? Why was this movie made? Why do we care? The answer is that he was so passionate, entertaining and peculiar once people did find out about him, that I'm sure they wanted to know more and more and talk about him and his story to everyone.<br/><br/>The other performance in the movie that can't go unmentioned is the Martin Landau's performance of Bela Lugosi. Lugosi is the actor of Count Dracula fame that according to this movie met Ed Wood in a random occurrence and acted as Wood's leading man in many films until his death. I found his performance in relation to his drug abuse most entertaining.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this move to watch and learn about an old obscure filmmaker.<br/><br/>If you rent the DVD I would recommend watching the bonus features as well, there is a really cool little section about the Theremin instrument! It's the one that makes all of the cool horror sounds and is controlled or played by the movement of your hands! Medium Popcorn with Butter!

","d Wood is the story of the ""worst Director - ever"". Until you find out that Tim Burton is the director of this film, you'll probably wonder why someone would choose to, almost, document the life of such a person. However, it is typical of Burton to portray the life of someone different, not typical. It is sad that Edward D Wood Jr. did not receive fame until after his death, spending most of his life creating films that were not accepted in Hollywood. The story of his life has become more popular and watchable than any of the films he made. He does still have a small amount of fans today, but, he really was no Orson Welles, despite aspiring to be. Tim Burton depicts the sad yet, hopeful life of Ed Wood very well. Although we know that none of Ed Wood's films gain huge success and popularity, that doesn't stop us hoping they do. We easily associate and believe in the character played greatly, by Johnny Depp. Ed Wood is filmed in black and white which makes it seem even more true to life. However, the actors cast to play Wood and his bizarre friends such as, Bunny (Bill Murray) and Dolores (Sarah Jessica Parker), are played by modern actors. This lets the audience know that Burton is clearly not trying to make a documentary/docu-drama etc, he is purely making a film; something that will entertain the audience. The many comedic moments in this film also add to this idea. Johnny Depp makes a marvellous Ed Wood, his lack of blinking and goofy smile add to the idea that Wood really was an eccentric character. This without the fact he liked to dress in women's clothing, something I think Johnny Depp, strangely enough, suited. Another performance that has to be commented on is that of Martin Landau who played Bela Lugosi. His performance was so good it won him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The irony in this is that the real Bela Lugosi never won an Oscar himself. Landau is very well suited to the role, and looks like someone who could definitely have played Dracula. He knows himself that, ""what I do best, what I've always done best, is act."" He portrays wonderfully the character of Bela Lugosi and his struggle to find fame and fortune; dealing with a drug addiction and being willing to play any character thrown at him, however awful it was. Overall, Ed Wood is a funny yet sad, portrayal of Ed Wood's life. It definitely deserves to be named one of Tim Burton's best films, and again, we see a brilliant collaboration between him and Johnny Depp."

","This is a really worth watching movie. I wasn't expecting it to be that good. I don't know how much truth was in this film, but I don't think that many things were changed. This movie is really inspiring, especially the ending, right now I can't remember any other movie which would be so inspiring. This film actually made me believe in fate, because Ed Wood was always surrounded by unusual people, who were also an actors of his movies, I don't think it's a coincidence that the people which Ed Wood meets are such an unusual people. I think this movie would be interesting for everyone, not only that it's interesting, but it's sometimes comical too. I noticed that Johnny Depp's carrier is similar with Al Pacinos carrier. Johnny Depp's Ed Wood is like Al Pacino's Serpico and Johnny Depp's Blow is like Al Pacino's Dog Day Afternoon, so Johny Depp can be called nowadays Al Pacino, though their acting styles are different."

","OK, call me a prude, but I absolutely DETEST what the BBC pompously refers to as 'strong language'. For 'strong', read 'foul'. And in 95% of cases, totally unnecessary. Because 'Ed Wood' is a superb film, easily Depp's best performance (and incidentally serves the very useful purpose of making the POTC series look even worse than they actually are). But Lugosi seemingly uttering at least one profanity in every line comes close to ruining it.<br/><br/>Right - let's get positive. Depp brilliantly captures Wood's indestructible self-belief, the conviction that what he was 'creating' was not only worthwhile, but a series of artistic triumphs. One can only speculate what must have gone through poor Ed's mind in the last days of his life, living in poverty, abandoned by almost everyone. That's why the most vivid memory 'Ed Wood' holds for me is its celebration of friendship - which, after family, is surely the most beautiful and precious thing in life. That bunch of weirdos who attended Bela Lugosi's funeral, when the Hollywood elite who'd lionised the man in his heyday were conspicuously absent, were bloody good specimens of humanity. If a comparable bunch were the only mourners at my own funeral... I could live with that! Thanks Tim, Johnny and - most of all - Ed."

"Lady-of-Rohan","Null","0","1","21 April 2007"," Sympathy for the devil of film-making
","In what is personally one of my favorite films of all time, director Tim Burton gives us the true story of the one often named the worst director of all time; Edward D Wood Jr (Johnny Depp). Passionate about film-making but incompetent at the skill, Ed frantically scurries around Hollywood with cap in hand to seek film companies willing to finance his dead-in-the-water productions. With the help of the down-and-out horror movie icon Bela Lugosi (brilliant performance by Martin Landau) and a reluctant team of showbiz misfits, Ed creates the cinematic anti-masterpieces of his own desire. Undaunted by the cutthroat criticism of the film industry, Ed stumbles on with his passion, door knocking for funds, facing rejection, tragedy, and heartbreak, all leading to the creation of his most infamous motion picture...<br/><br/>Compelling, engaging, and frequently hilarious, ""Ed Wood"" has an all-star cast providing brilliant performances from Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Bill Murray, and others. By being filmed in black and white, the movie is able to accomplish the nostalgic effect that is critical in emphasizing the heart of the B-Movie era of the 1950s. One of the central questions which the film raises is if Ed Wood was truly the worst the directer of all time. Many understandably think so due to his incompetent directing skills, penniless budgets, and ""the-first-take-is-perfect"" philosophy. However, with this film, it's almost impossible not to have sympathy for the devil of film-making. Ed really was passionate about film-making and really didn't care about the scathing reviews or cardboard sets, because, as he says in the film, ""movies are about the big picture"". <br/><br/>To understand the hilarity of the film, I would personally recommend watching ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and other Ed Wood films before enjoying this to truly appreciate the inside jokes. ""Ed Wood"" really is a cinematic treat and is the best movie about the worst that cinema has to offer.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Jsimpson5","8","0","1","29 March 2007"," Good film, but a few things off from perfection
","I bought this film a few days ago and I decided to watch it last night. I know this film did not do to well in the box office, but I think it was because not many people have heard of Ed Wood Jr. at the time, nor were fans of his films. This film is biography of the late Ed Wood Jr the worst film director of all time and his struggle to make it to the top of the film industry world.<br/><br/>Now I do have some issues with this film, mainly some miscasting. Sarah Jessica Parker in my opinion could not bring the emotion and feeling of Dolores Fuller. The best quote from her in the film is ""Do I really look like a horse?"" It's the best quote from her because it's true Sarah Jessica Parker does look like a horse in this film. While I am a fan of Jeffrey Jones (Ferris Buller's Day Off, Howard the Duck, etc.) I just could not feel him become Criswell. I think Mr. Jones may I have tried to hard to try to be like Criswell, which really hurt his performance.<br/><br/>While there were some miscasting problems, there were some actors who really hit the part right. Johhny Depp in my eyes became Ed Wood Jr. and I could just almost the spirit of Ed Wood Jr. in Mr. Depp. I also felt that Martin Landau become Bela Lugosi and in my opinion I though My Lugosi came back from the dead just to do his own part in this film.<br/><br/>Overall if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr. films then you should give this film a chance. It gives you an in site to his weird and wacky world of film making."
"charchuk","10","0","1","20 August 2006"," Bizarre, hilarious look at the worst director of all time
","An absolutely hilarious take on Hollywood of the '50s and the worst director of all-time. Though not for all tastes, this is a brilliant look at the life of the titular character, and his crazy antics, strange friends, and terrible movies. Filmed in black and white to recapture the look of films of that era, it successfully recreates the making of three of Ed Wood's bad movies, and the stories behind them, which seem almost too weird to be true. But truth is stranger than fiction, and the movie barely has to fictionalize anything to be interesting and entertaining. Truly bizarre and wildly unique, but still brilliant.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is at his most insane here, combining a weird voice and deadly seriousness to make the character that much more effective. His performance is the centrepoint of the movie's bizarreness, and is quietly one of Depp's best. Martin Landau as the aged Bela Lugosi is nothing short of brilliant, whether it be a perfectly-recreated Hungarian accent spewing out profanity-laced barbs at Boris Karloff, or a depressing cry for help from his morphine addiction. Landau truly earned his Oscar for this one. Tim Burton directs what is perhaps his most visually stunted film, as he is restricted to California of the '50s, but he still manages to make it memorable and creative. The score (done not by Burton's usual collaborator, Danny Elfman, but Howard Shore) is fantastically strange - just like everything else in this film - and the supporting cast is as hilariously brilliant as the rest of the movie. A definite winner."
"caa821","10","0","1","18 August 2006"," A ""10"" the first time
","I remember when I first saw ""Plan Nine from Outer Space,"" when I was a kid. My best buddy and I had our baseball game rained-out, so we went to the matinée at our local theater in our suburb. We knew nothing of the film or Ed Wood, so we assumed it would be a ""B"" matinée flick (at that age we didn't really know or use that designation, but we knew what these kinds of movies, shown on Saturday afternoons, were). We also understood that the quality of work - acting, camera shots, and even story line, would not be the equivalent of the first-run films in the major theaters, or which could be viewed later at this same theater during nighttime presentations. However, we didn't feel cheated by this film. Even in our adolescent way, we enjoyed its bizarre characters, dialogue, acting, scenery - appreciating in amateurishness and the fact that it was so awful it was funny and enjoyable. That film, and Wood's others, are in the category that for quality you would rate them a ""1"" on the proverbial ""1 - to - 10 ""dial"" -- then decide to move it one notch farther to a ""10,"" in recognition that in its awfulness it was so fascinating and funny it actually provided a thoroughly-enjoyable experience. This biopic captures this essence of what the untalented, yet also undaunted, Ed Wood was all about. Johnny Depp is one of the outstanding talents today, and this talent is displayed here. Martin Landau certainly deserved the acclaim for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. All the supporting cast, without exception, were also outstanding. Finally, the depiction of this movie genre, and the feel for the mid-1950's Hollywood, are superb. Give this one a ""10"" on the dial the first time."

I was really ready for this movie, and it more than delivered. Maybe not enough of the general public knows of Ed Wood and won't take the time to learn about him. What a shame. I love this movie and know the words to all of it. Casting did something few movies ever do..... Awesome choices. The actors were the best for the roles. I can't say enough about this movie.

Johnny Depp is awesome here, taking this character to one whole new dimension. And while I look at Martin Landeau's Bela Lugosi now as being just a tad overrated, he's good here.

Surprisingly, Sarah Jessica Parker did a fantastic job, and this is one of Bill Murray's better roles. It was a funny and touching movie, and proves that Edward D. Wood Jr. was not some demented transvestite who made horrible movies. It showed the audience the fuel that was motivating Ed's choices, instead of making him into some freak. What I loved was the bond that was created between Bela and Ed. This is where Depp and Landau come in handy. They did such terrific jobs, Depp turning Wood into a sweet, sincere, funny person, and Landau creating a beautiful picture of Bela Lugosi. I cried when Bela died. It was very sad. <br/><br/>Ed Wood is a wonderful movie, humorous and touching. I deduct a point for the profound use of language. Geez!"
"KSqueaker","10","0","2","9 August 2005"," The third best movie of all time!
","The Lion King, Fight Club and... Ed Wood. Yes, these are my top 3 movies of all time, and Ed Wood had to be pretty awesome movie to get up there. It's easier for a movie to be depressing. There's more ""street cred"", or ""critical cred"", generally, in an incredibly depressing movie (take Million Dollar Baby, for example.) It's the simpler route to striking an emotional chord among audience members. If something is indescribably sad, then you can't poke fun of it. You can't laugh about it-- people DIED, dammit! And Ed Wood is one of the rare, non-depressing, actually inspirational, great movies. Somehow Ed Wood skirts cheesiness with its darker, implied undertones and sincere but rather campy dialogue. The movie is uplifting- it shows how an opus (Plan 9 from outer space) can be created just out of ambition and self-confidence and determination. It shows the success that sprouts from self-acceptance. And the film is about the so-called worst director of all time! And he died of alcoholism-related things in the seventies! And yet Ed Wood still manages to be an inspiration! So it's easy to call a happy movie clichÃ©. Especially a happy movie with an old-fashioned, less than subtle or minimalist directorial style (like the scene about Dolores' angora sweaters- she says something like ""why are my sweaters stretched?"" and Ed turns over toward the camera with a guilty look on his countenance). But it has deep themes of friendship and it really questions society itself. The people in the movie- the freaks and outcasts- were rejected by society and then demonstrate their spark and vitality in the little movie world Ed makes. So to conclude, it's funny, it's sad (but not overly so, almost in a textbook-like sense is it sad. What I mean by that is it shows the facts, but it doesn't dwell on them) and it's inspirational. Plus Johnny Depp is hot."

","Not bad at all. It's another type of Tim Burton's film. I mean there is sometimes sad but well played parts. Johnny Depp was unrecognized to me in the movie. To me it was the lame minded and bad directing Edward D. Wood Jr. Truly. The movie was a bit long but it was worth seeing the performances. Though I couldn't imagine seeing johnny Depp in woman's clothing, Bill Murray acting like a total fagg, and Jeffrey Jones acting like a ""strange man"" in person. But the movie was great. It's like a good director (Tim Burton) directing a film on a bad director directing! I didn't payed much attention to Jessica Parker's or Lisa Marie's performances. But Depp's and Landau's performances were well focused and the judging is simple; Depp-7/10 & Landau 9/10. It usually shows on HBO or the Max channels, or Encore History (If you have those channels) and if I had a choice of watching a brand new film on the channels like for example ""Mystic River"" or ""The Two Towers""... Ed Wood would still be my choice. Why? Because the performances are worth watching. I just can't wait for it to come out on DVD on October!"
"mentalcritic","10","0","1","7 July 2004"," Ed Wood...
","It is hard to believe that a man so obviously short of talent could have such a big influence over people who have such an abundance of it, but this biopic goes a long way to explain how. First, however, one must understand that this film was not intended to be a literal account of this period in Ed Wood's life. It is easy to mistake it as such after Jeffrey Jones delivers his Criswellian monlogue, but it isn't. Tim Burton appears to have more intended to make a film to celebrate the life of one of Hollywood's most creative failures.<br/><br/>The film covers the shooting of three of Wood's best-known films. In the order they appear in the film, these are Glen Or Glenda, Bride Of The Monster, and of course the infamous Plan 9 From Outer Space. The telling how all these titles were changed, and why, from those that Ed originally gave them, is hilarious in itself. Between the shooting of each film, we also get to see representations of how Ed found ""talent"" and financing to make these films. During these sequences, the film becomes the Spinal Tap of the film industry.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is in brilliant form as the titular character. It is hard to get into a character who is so oblivious to his own lack of talent, and keeps such a brave face in spite of such crushing knockbakcs. Depp does this so brilliantly that it's a wonder he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Speaking of Oscars, Martin Landau is dynamite as the ailing, forgotten one-time king of the horror silver screen. As Bela Lugosi, he is so in character that it gives a unique insight into the final days of Lugosi's life. As we learn what happens to Lugosi while Wood is hammering the final nails into his career's coffin, it's hard to say whether we shed tears for Lugosi's unfortunate demise, or because Landau portrays it with such conviction and sympathy.<br/><br/>If there is a weak link in this film, it is Sarah Jessica Parker. In one of life's ironies, as she is portraying Delores Fuller and reading a review of a stage performance, she asks if she really has a horse-like face (or something to that effect). I bet she didn't have to do much research in order to learn how to do that convincingly. Only Gary Busey, Jake Busey, and Julia Roberts exceed Parker for being obnoxiously ugly. The fact that she can't act worth a damn also lets the side down, although not as badly as one might expect, given that everyone who plays an extra in Ed's films is expected to turn in a rotten performance.<br/><br/>Some of the quirks that make Ed's films as great as they are were left out of the film. Jeffrey Jones, for example, doesn't even try to imitate the weird back-and-forth movement of Criswell's head as he explains that future events such as these will affect you in the future. However, one of the funniest incidents on the Plan 9 set, an actor playing a policeman scratching himself with his gun, is captured here with a certain kind of uncanny accuracy. From this, one gets the impression that Jeffrey Jones didn't care nearly as much about researching his character as did Martin Landau or Johnny Depp. In the end, however, the positives outweigh the negative quite dramatically.<br/><br/>All in all, I gave Ed Wood a 10 out of 10. It entertains from start to finish, which, like the titular character's actual films, puts it well ahead of numerous films that made a lot more money or garnered a lot more critical praise. This is another film that proves quality is still possible in Hollywood, in spite of how hard the system rails against it."

But, in the end, what was the point?  Were we supposed to be moved by the sincerity of Ed's dreams and by his intense commitment to his vision, even if the end product of his vision was some of the worst dreck ever put on film?  In other words, was the Orson Welles analogy semi-serious?  This could have been a film about self-deception and delusion, but Tim Burton had too much fun with these delusions to really explore their pathetic side.<br/><br/>In addition, I was very unimpressed by Johnny Depp.  Most of the time he was just glaring and grinning, and I never found him moving in the emotional scenes.  Sarah Jessica Parker, who is so good is ""Sex and the City,"" is merely OK here.  On the other hand, Martin Landau gives a magnificent, unforgettable, deeply moving performance as the aged Bela Lugosi -- ""Ed Wood"" is definitely worth seeing just for him.  Also, Patricia Arquette is excellent as Kathy, the love of Ed's life.  The moment she appears on the screen, you forget all about Depp and you know you're seeing real talent. (Too bad we don't get to see more of her.)  Bill Murray shines in a small part as a would-be transsexual, and the underrated Jeffrey Jones is very good as a TV ""psychic.""<br/><br/>It's a very enteraining and amusing movie, but the only parts of it I'd care to see again are the ones with Landau.
