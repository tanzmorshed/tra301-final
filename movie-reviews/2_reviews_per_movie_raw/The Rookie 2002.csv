"TxMike","Null","34","36","28 August 2002"," Actually two one-hour movies, great inspirational stories.
","My favorite films are those which are based on an interesting true story, and are well made. ""The Rookie"" fits that bill, and I rate it very highly. At first glance it appears to be about getting to play baseball. In fact, it is about making your dreams come true, and the power of friendship. Baseball just happens to be the subject matter. The first one-hour movie is about a 10-member high school team in West Texas that barely manages to win one game each year. It is about their coach inspiring them to become the district champs and go to the state tournament in 1999. <br/><br/>The second one-hour movie comes about from a ""deal"" the kids made with the coach.  ""If we win district, then you have to go to a tryout with a professional baseball team.""  They do, so he does. And to his and everyone else's surprise, his 85-mph fastball as a 20-year-old has become a 98-mph one as a 35-year-old.  The films hints that it might have been divine intervention, a prayer to St Rita, the patron of the impossible. Might have been!!<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid is a bit older than 35, but he does a good job and is believable as science teacher, coach, and finally a surprised big-league pitcher in Arlington, Tx stadium, where he strikes out his very first big-league batter. The real Jim played two seasons, not particularly distinguished, but that point is way secondary. The journey, and the way he made it, with support from family and his baseball kids is what this film is all about.<br/><br/>The DVD is very nice, with a great picture and decent use of the 5.1 Dolby surround sound. Extras include footage of the real Jim, some original footage of his playing days, and his narration and re-enactment of his first trip to a big-league mound. Great stuff!  Plus a few, moderately interesting deleted scenes explained by the director."

","I love it when they actually do a sports story well. So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a genuinely nice movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br/><br/>All the characters in here are nice people, the kind you root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)<br/><br/>Quaid is believable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a nice, inspirational true life sports film, you can't wrong with this one."
"timberline_thunder","Null","21","23","1 April 2003"," Respectable Movie Worth A Look
","Usually I review a movie just after I've seen it, but the last time I saw this one was a full 2 weeks ago. Yet it still sticks in my mind and heart.<br/><br/>
Baseball movies are inspirational by nature and seem to have all kinds of application to life (for example, my review of Field of Dreams). Jimmy Morris challenges the losing baseball team he's coaching to not give up on their dreams and has the challenge thrown right back at him. This wouldn't make for such drama if the majority of the movie up to that point hadn't been to show how Jimmy's own dream had been systematically dismantled. Such movies anyone can write, but when I found out it was a true story, it put the movie in a higher bracket altogether. <br/><br/>The conflict between Jimmy and his father is played very well by both Quaid and Cox. At one point or another, you can just feel coldness of the walls built up between them. They're reaching out (Hunter's baseball glove, Jimmy's asking advice), but can they ever connect? <br/><br/>While some might balk (sorry) at the presence of Hunter, Jimmy's son, I think the kid adds a lot to the film. Baseball is all about kids, anyway. And it's good to see a son who looks up to and believes in his dad. That phase is over far too soon for most fathers to enjoy it enough. I think the dream is as much Hunter's as it is his father's.<br/><br/>The theme of the Rookie is ""never give up on your dreams."" That's laudable. But the affirmation of the importance of families, even through broken relationships, as well as a clean script, makes this one that families can buy to watch every now and then. Disney surprised me with this believable, down-to-earth tale. I'm definitely picking this one up on DVD."

","The Rookie is directed by John Lee Hancock and written by Mike Rich. It stars Dennis Quaid, Rachel Griffiths, Jay Hernandez, Brian Cox, Angus T. Jones, Rick Gonzalez and Angelo Spizzirri. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by John Schwartzman.<br/><br/>Out of Walt Disney Productions, The Rookie is based on the true story of 35 year old teacher and school baseball coach Jim Morris (Quaid). Who having thought his chance of making it to the major leagues in Baseball had long since gone, his minor league career curtailed by a shoulder injury, got that second chance and became the oldest rookie around.<br/><br/>What an absolute treat! A sports movie that inspires and uplifts whilst never resorting to cloying tactics or Hollywood sprucing story additions. First off the bat is that the film is unhurried in pace, time is afforded Morris and his family as well as the key issues that lead to his moment of fulfilment. Secondly is the bare honesty of the story, and that of the portrayals by a wonderful Quaid (at 47 here playing a 35 year old) and a likewise Griffiths. We are not going to be arriving at some monumental cliff-hanger finale (as per most other sports movies), history tells us that Morris made a minimal impact in his two years in the majors, this takes us to an earthy and achievable goal being attained.<br/><br/>Just prior to Morris making his bow at Arlington Stadium, we have seen the love of a husband and father who is separated from his family. He's out on the road playing ball, the emotional tug pulling him everywhere. There's money worries back home as well, really Jim would be better served back there, surely? All of this sounds like a recipe for sappy crappy time, but it's not, it's all beautifully handled by director and actors alike. The baseball scenes are smooth, the score and photography pristine in their execution (it's a Blu-ray must have), there is just no waste here. There's a rich human story to be told and wasting time on incidentals would be wrong, and Hancock knows this and never puts a foot wrong.<br/><br/>Heart warming and impeccably mounted, The Rookie is one of the greatest baseball films out there. But, and here's the thing, it's as much about life and its challenges as it is about fast balls and hot-dogs. 9/10"
"leczorn","8","28","37","11 November 2004"," A feel good movie!
","Walt Disney's ""The Rookie"" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history, ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35.<br/><br/>The film opens with a brief synopsis of Morris' childhood, which included a series of re-locations - his father was a military man. And even when his family settled for good in football crazed Texas, Morris' passion for baseball remained strong.<br/><br/>The childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn't work out.<br/><br/>Morris's team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams. They turn the table on him, telling him that he should try out for a Major League team. At several times when he pitches to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he throws. Morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district, he will try out for a Major League team.<br/><br/>Big Lake does win district and, adhering to his end of the deal, Morris attends a Tampa Bay Devil Rays try out. Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a Major League pitcher. After another try out with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays.<br/><br/>This leaves him with a tough decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his Major League dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home. And the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children.<br/><br/>Morris signs with the Devil Rays, begins at the AA level and moves up quickly to the AAA level, one level below Major League Baseball. But as the season winds down, the chances of him getting ""called up"" grow increasingly slim.<br/><br/>For the most part, I love this movie. There are lots of great performances and likable characters and it's easy to find yourself really pulling for Morris. Also, the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels. And most of all, it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve.<br/><br/>Still, the movie has some flaws. While generally accurate, it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Also, except for one scene in which he prays with his players, the movie completely ignores Morris' Christian faith. But considering Disney's left wing zeal, that's not surprising.<br/><br/>Presumably, a lot of the exaggerations/fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic. Yet the 20 minute documentary on Morris that is included on the DVD features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie.<br/><br/>For example, from birth until his family settled in Texas for good when he was 12, Morris re-located 14 times. And his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left (pitching) shoulder, thus making his throwing 98 mph even more inexplicable.<br/><br/>To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it's good to not only watch ""The Rookie"" but to watch the DVD's documentary, check out the aforementioned link to the movie's inaccuracies and probably also to read Morris' biography, also titled ""The Rookie."" I haven't read the book but I hope to one of these days.<br/><br/>But overall, ""The Rookie"" is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man. 8/10"

","A fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at Doing something about them when the chance strikes.

It took guts. I am glad that they showed his indecision, almost up 'til he got the callup to the majors.<br/><br/>
I can remember seeing him pitch against the Red Sox(I think...), it was a great story.

","One of the best films I have ever seen!  An inspirational true story of a man who gave up his dream of making the ""Big Leagues"" many years ago due to a severe shoulder injury who coached his high school team and was also teaching science.  His shoulder had healed over the years and he was able to throw batting practice without pain and his team was amazed at how hard he could throw.  They made a deal with him that if they won their conference and went to State, he would have to pursue his dream (long ago given up) by going to a major league tryout.  He thought this was a safe bet, since the team had started the season off on a losing note.  The team got hot, won the conference and he reluctantly followed thru on his end of the bet.  The amazing fact was how much harder he was able to throw now, as compared with how he threw many years ago.  The movie left out the fact that when his shoulder was operated on many years earlier, a large bone spur was removed and he no longer had shoulder pain (although he had already retired from baseball)  The movie made his new founded ability to throw 98 miles per hour (he could only throw 85 in his prime) seem miraculous in nature.  Even though it is remarkable, the real Jimmy Morris was a muscular athlete who probably was limited by this large bone spur in his shoulder that wasn't removed till after he retired.  Other than that, the movie follows his true life quite accurately and Dennis Quaid was excellent playing Jimmy Morris. The fact that he was the oldest major league rookie since Satchel Paige makes for an interesting story and it is truly a remarkable, uplifing movie.---definitely 4 stars out of 4 in my opinion"

","This is a feel good film, about one person's dreams and the drive or push to realize them. It is a beautiful and inspirational film. Why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out, especially the good ones. Dennis Quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot at a professional baseball career. With excellent supporting cast, including Brian Cox, as the crusty old ex navy officer who has let so much of his son's achievements go by without his support. It was good to see him as something other than a villain in a film. If I have one complaint with this film it is this: Don't ever let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. <br/><br/>Seriously, this film belongs to that handful of great baseball films like ""Field of Dreams"" and ""The Natural.""

"Buddy-51","Null","22","37","23 November 2002"," another sentimental baseball fable
","When women feel the need for a `good cry' at the movies, they usually seek out some tragic tale of unrequited love to do the trick.   When men feel the same need, they turn to a film about baseball.  And what could be more guaranteed to convert a grown man into a shamelessly blubbering fool than a true-life account of a middle-aged baseball fanatic who gets to fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the major leagues?  How many men can fail to identify with that?   Indeed, most men may not want to admit this, but the baseball movie genre has, in many ways, become the male equivalent of that category of film known, derisively by many men, as the `chick flick,' for they both serve roughly the same purpose.  Apparently, even we stoic males have the need to clear out the tear ducts every now and then - for purely medical reasons of course. <br/><br/>Because baseball has long enjoyed the reputation of being `America's National Pastime,' moviemakers have often treated it less as a sport than as an iconic institution.  From `Pride of the Yankees' to `Brian's Song' to `Bang the Drum Slowly' to `The Natural' to `Field of Dreams,' movies about baseball have been so concerned with all the mythic implications of the sport that they have rarely managed to convey the sense of carefree fun that comes along with it (`Bull Durham' has been one of the few obvious exceptions to this rule).  The tone in these films is sometimes so sentimental and so reverential that one begins to view baseball more as a type of pseudo religion - with the stadium functioning as a sort of temple where people gather to participate in a communal spiritual experience - than as a form of entertainment.  <br/><br/>`The Rookie' certainly falls into this category, yet the film itself has such an air of comforting familiarity about it that it manages to override much of the conventionality of the storyline.  Although we always know where the movie is headed, the easy assuredness with which it charts its course keeps us interested and absorbed for most of the duration.  The majority of the credit goes to Dennis Quaid who, as Jim Morris, the high-school-teacher-turned-big-league-ballplayer, does a first rate job portraying a man torn between responsibility to his family and this golden, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of realizing a childhood dream.  Quaid underplays the role so nicely that we never doubt for a moment the authenticity of all we are seeing on screen.  The screenplay by Mike Rich, though filled with overly familiar scenes and characters, nevertheless manages to avoid many of the potential lapses into overwrought melodrama that could conceivably have robbed it of much of its credibility (the dark hints early on in the film as to Morris' problematic physical condition happily never come to fruition).   Director John Lee Hancock establishes an almost elegiac tone, pacing the film in such a way as to match the unhectic lifestyle of both Morris and the small Texas town in which he lives.<br/><br/>`The Rookie,' like Disney's previous sports opus `Remember the Titans,' eschews violence, sexuality and bad language completely, thereby garnering the film a `G' rating and making it first class entertainment for the entire family.  There may be nothing much new in it for adults, but `The Rookie' has the skill to make what was old seem somehow new again.  Not unlike what happens to the hero himself in fact."
"dk1517-463-296753","8","2","2","2 September 2012"," Balancing family, work and pursuing your dreams
","My only criticism of this movie is that it's a bit long, as they try to fit two stories into one. Would've been fairly easy to make an entire movie of the first half--a baseball coach who inspires his under- achieving team to rally and win district, then an entirely different movie of the second half--a 30-something science teacher giving himself one last chance to make the big leagues.<br/><br/>For me, this movie is right up there with other great sports movies, such as Hoosiers, Miracle, and Chariots of Fire. Perhaps not quite at that level, but the story is great and definitely inspiring. Even if you're not a baseball fan, you can appreciate the emphasis this movie puts on the realities and pressures that families face every day in balancing work and taking care of the kids. And I love that they bring out the challenges of minor league baseball--long bus rides, very little income, and away from family for months at a time.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is after Jim finishes his tryout and is walking back to his truck, the scout comes up to tell him that he, although almost twice the other kids' age, actually threw 98 mph. The scout tells Jim that if he doesn't call it in he's gonna get fired and that Jim can expect to get a phone call. Just wish he'd throw away the dirty diaper!"

","Once upon a time Hollywood produced live-action, G-rated movies without foul language, immorality, and gore-splattered violence. These movies neither insulted your intelligence no manipulated your emotions. The heroes differed little from the crowd. They shared the same feelings and bore the same burdens. Since the 1970s, the film industry has pretty much written off G-rated movies for adults. Basically, modern mature audiences demand large doses of embellished realism for their cinematic diet, laced heavily with vile profanity, mattress-thumping sex, and knuckle-bruising fisticuffs. These ingredients constitute the difference between G-rated movies and those rated either PG or PG-13.<br/><br/>Miraculously, director John Lee Hancock, who penned scripts for Clint Eastwood's ""A Perfect World"" (1993) and ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" (1997), hits a home run with this G-rated, feel-good, four-bagger of a baseball epic that not only celebrates America's favorite summer time sport, but also extols the competitive spirit of the game. Essentially, ""The Rookie"" resembles the 1984 Robert Redford saga ""The Natural"" about an old-time slugger who makes a comeback. Unlike ""The Natural,"" ""The Rookie"" shuns swearing, sex, and violence.<br/><br/>Moreover, rugged Dennis Quaid plays a real-life individual. Jim Morris' autobiography, ""The Oldest Rookie: Big-League Dreams from a Small-Town Guy,"" served as the basis for Mike ""Finding Forrester"") Rich's unpretentious, Norman Rockwell-style screenplay about white, middle-class aspirations. Morris attained his dream when he debuted on the mound as a relief pitcher in 1999. Although it doesn't belong in the same league with the inspirational James Stewart classic ""The Stratton Story"" (1949), ""The Rookie"" qualifies as the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore because audiences find them antiquated.<br/><br/>Hancock and Rich encapsulate their entertaining oddball biography in a halo of mysticism. A wildcat oil prospector convinces two Catholic nuns back in the 1920s to bankroll a West Texas well. Fearing they have blown their bucks on an ill-advised fantasy, the sisters blanket the arid terrain with rose petals and entreat St. Rita's patron saint of hopeless causes' to intervene. The well gushes! The Town of Big Lake emerges, and roughnecks swat at baseballs when they aren't drilling holes in the terrain. The spirit of baseball oozes from the earth like petroleum. Meanwhile, years later, the U.S. Navy doesn't keep Jim Morris, Sr., (Brian Cos of ""Manhunter"") and his family in one place long before uprooting them. The constant moving takes a toll on Jim Junior. Jim's dad shows little sympathy and berates baseball.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Jim has baseball in his blood, enough so that when he accepts a high school chemistry teacher's job in his Texas hometown, he organizes a baseball team. Like the foul-mouthed ""Bad News Bears,"" ""The Rookie"" chronicles Jim's triumph at turning losers into winners. Morris promises the team if they reach the divisional playoffs, he will try out for a professional baseball team. Predictably, Morris' students maintain their end of the bargain. At age 35, Jim stuns the big league scouts when he hurls fastballs at 98 miles-per-hour! ""The Rookie"" never fouls out."

","Having spent eight years helping to coach high school baseball in East Los Angeles the Performance of Dennis Quaid as Jim Morris is as true to the real thing as you can get. The baseball games, tryouts and practices were as realistic as you can get in a film. Quaid's form in pitching proved that he learned to pitch at one time. Yet this film is more than baseball. It is a story of a man that has seen his career in baseball end early in life because of a arm injury. Surgery is performed but he can no longer continue in professional baseball. As with many players, baseball is in his blood so he becomes a high school baseball coach. In pitching practice to his players a miracle occurs, an older Morris is throwing harder now. He goes to a major league tryout. He is an old man by baseball standards. Morris is by far the oldest man at the tryout and given no chance to succeed. Wonder of Wonders as he is signed and then enters the minor leagues. Having coached a player myself that played minor league baseball, the scenes are very truthful. The long bus trips, lonely nights, and the desire to ""phone home"" are a way of life for the minor leaguer. Finally Morris is called up to the ""bigs"" and he and his father are reunited. Both men are not close but the walls are broken down because of baseball. This film is a display of hope for anyone that has grown older. There is a chance to succeed even when others think that you are too old. An uplifting film for all to see."

In 1999, Morris becomes the ""Oldest Rookie"" when he lands a job with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as a 98 mph throwing lefty from the bullpen. Morris' dream is short, but sweet. And his story seems to have spawned from a Hollywood script. Although this is based on fact the movie could have been much better if filmed with a more ""mature"" approach.

An Army brat raised all over the place, but finally in Texas, he has charm and humor and a solid cowboy-like presence.  The boy who played his oldest child was wonderful, if at the cost of making the other children cardboard characters.<br/><br/>Surrounding Quaid and his son are a wealth of characters, from Brian Cox (becoming one of my favorite character actors) as his father (as someone who lost several years with his father through mutual bullheadedness this was tough to watch), to the townspeople (especially the guy at the general store), to Rachel Griffiths as his believably attractive wife, all playing against the beautiful background of west Texas, we have a finely crafted piece of cinema.<br/><br/>While bordering on maudlin, it never crosses over, Quaid plays stolid enough that the flashes of his smile are welcomed and his face as he pitches show the fastballer who only knows one way to throw."

","I first saw this movie 3 years ago, and it was introduced by then Disney chief Eisner and the real Jim Morris.<br/><br/>About a month ago, it came back on TV, and this time I taped it. Since then I must've watched it at least three times.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful, inspirational, feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned. It resists going for every sentimental trick in the book, as well as all of the other clichés.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see a movie where the kids aren't jerks and have a whole slew of behavioral issues, and the jocks aren't portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads.<br/><br/>These are just normal people who have dreams like you and I.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term ""gritty realism"", making movies where everyone curses, and has problems with aggression.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man who has a dream, and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream. The people in Big Lake TX seem so personable that I want to move there.<br/><br/>As I said b4, the film doesn't try to go overboard with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappoints. I've watched him from the late 70's, and he is so underrated.<br/><br/>But this movie has excellent performances from EVERYONE concerned, and kudos to the writers.<br/><br/>A gem in the movie is near the end when Jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game, and his wife calls out to him from the stands. He rushes over and reaches out to his family. The look on the faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the dugout is priceless.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a change of pace, then pick this movie up."
"caa821","9","2","3","9 August 2006"," One of the best of this genre
","This movie has several things going for it. It is a ""feel good"" story. The characters and actors are likable, realistic and present fine performances. Most important, I believe, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in ""The Natural, and so did Kevin Costner in ""For Love of the Game"" and ""Bull Durham."" In ""Major League,"" Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked like they knew what they were doing, but many of the others did not, and that picture was pure silliness - and not very funny. <br/><br/>So many earlier baseball movies, even where the stories might be interesting, presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leads, they were ludicrous in this respect. In ""The Stratton Story"" and ""Strategic Air Command,"" Jimmy Stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player, as your overweight, non-athletic, elderly uncle in the softball game at the family reunion. Other virile and physically robust stars (e.g., Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander; and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also exhibited a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while ""choosing-up"" for a game at the Sunday picnic (even if coed, and even if your uncle were involved). <br/><br/>The scenes of Quaid's high school team he coached, the ones where he attends his tryout with the Devil Rays, and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American League, all ring true. The participants are believable and capable. In addition, he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization (except, to a degree, some of his ""over-the-top"" scenes, and his forced accent, in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he's definitely on-target here, and this movie is a ""9,"" as good, or better, as any others of this genre, except for ""The Natural."""
"chad29bull","8","2","3","2 November 2005"," An inspirational film one must see
","Never too late<br/><br/>The Rookie is based on the true life story of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a father, high school science teacher, and a baseball coach. Jim grew up in a military family moving from place to place. He developed a love for baseball. His ultimate dream was to be a professional baseball player. He made it to the minor leagues, but after blowing out his shoulder, his dream came to an end. He then became a high school baseball coach and a science teacher. His team was absolutely terrible, losing game after game. In 1999 he made a bet with his team. If the team would win the district championship, Morris, who was throwing in the mid nineties, would try out for a major league baseball team. His team ended up winning the district championship, and holding up his end of the bargain tried out for a team. Shortly after, his was on the road to become the oldest rookie in the Major Leagues. I feel that one of the reasons the director John Lee Hancock developed this film was to say we should never give up on our dreams. This movie is a great story to prove this point. If Jim would have given up on his dream, he would have never found himself playing in the major leagues. Another message the film sends is the importance to forgive people for their failures. He never had a perfect relationship with his family; despite this, he had enough strength to forgive them. This film is one of the best films I have seen. I found the film to be very inspirational. It provides the viewers with hope that they can make their dreams come true. The acting in the film was phenomenal; Dennis Quaid was extremely convincing in portraying Jim Morris. This is a great family film that will capture one's attention with an exhilarating plot and story book ending. In the end, thinking that anything is possible if we believe, I left with goose bumps."

"mattymatt4ever","5","2","3","29 April 2002"," Well-acted, well-made and well-intentioned...but altogether unsatisfying
","This is one of those movies that I can say is well-crafted, yet I can also say I was pretty bored through most of it.  ""The Rookie"" is a Disney production, yet it doesn't have that Disney feel.  And it doesn't feel G-rated either.  In fact, this movie does a fine job at avoiding overused cliches in the genre of sports dramas and stands on its own two feet.  The premise of a high school science teacher suddenly becoming a major league ballplayer seems a little far-fetched, but it's a true story!  So I can't complain it was unconvincing.  The performances are terrific.  Dennis Quaid is good in virtually every movie he does, and he again delivers a subtle, convincing performance.  Brian Cox is great as his workaholic father, who tries to convince him that there's more to life than baseball.  Rachel Griffiths is perfectly cast as Quaid's wife, who also tries to discourage him from baseball.  Though Griffiths is Australian, I don't think any American actress could've played her role better, and she perfectly dons a Texas accent.  <br/><br/>I have few bad things to say about ""The Rookie"" other than it was long and dull.  I didn't enjoy the overuse of country music on the soundtrack, though I know that it was used simply to give the movie a Texas feel.  You can't expect the soundtrack to include Metallica!  And though the movie does a pretty good job at avoiding cliches, there are still a few that exist.  Like what I was talking about earlier, about Quaid's wife and father discouraging him from baseball.  There's one scene where his Dad gives him a speech/monologue--standing inside the house, many feet away from his son--about how there's more to life than baseball.  Done with his speech, he closes the door and goes back into the house.  No ""Goodbye son"" or anything like that.  Then he comes home and his wife gives him the same speech, only she goes outside to the porch to apologize to him minutes later and they give each other the ""you were right, I was wrong"" run-around.  Another problem is the film takes too much time stressing the fact that Jimmy Morris is a brilliant pitcher.  I think if the director cut out most of his pitching scenes, the movie would be about 85 minutes.  Now, I love that scene in which he pulls off to the side of the road to practice pitching by throwing the ball towards a meter, which measures the speeds of passing cars.  The meter reads 76 MPH.  Then when he goes to pick up the ball, we watch as it changes to 96 MPH.  Once we watch that scene, we already know that he's a brilliant pitcher, we don't need it pounded into our skulls.  I don't even know how good of a batter he is, because they never show him at bat!  <br/><br/>There's a good deal of things I give this movie credit for, but all in all it just doesn't deliver.  Sure, it doesn't have the formula cliches of last year's ""Hardball,"" but it also doesn't have the charm and fun of ""Hardball."" I wasn't uplifted, nor entertained, so this movie pretty much left me cold. <br/><br/>My score:  5 (out of 10)"

"zkonedog","9","1","1","5 March 2017"," It Could Have Settled, But Instead Achieved Greatness (Just Like Its Source Material)
","Being a Disney production, ""The Rookie"" could easily have settled to become a weepy dramatic tale dripping with over-dramatized scenes. Luckily, thanks to great acting and an attention to detail, this movie is instead a great human drama focusing on baseball themes.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Rookie"" tells the true story of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a 36- year old high school chemistry teacher in Texas. After a lifetime of being uprooted time and time again by his military father (Brian Cox), Morris also had his big-league baseball dream cut short by arm injuries. While coaching high school baseball in Texas and raising a family, he suddenly discovers that his left arm has some serious juice left in it. On a bet that inspires his young charges, Morris shows up at a MLB tryout and begins the journey he had thought was dormant forever.<br/><br/>The reason this movie is so moving is because it weaves so many human-drama themes into the proceedings. Many potential viewers may dismiss it as a ""baseball movie"", but to do so would be foolish. This is more truly a story of family and one man's journey to make peace with his life. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like a story like this. It is just so emotional as Morris interacts with his children, wife, parents, and others affiliated with the baseball side of his life.<br/><br/>Only helping the drama spring to life is the incredible acting. I've seen Quaid in many movie roles, and this one is eclipsed by none of them. His body language and facial expressions carry the emotionally-charged scenes. The supporting cast around him (especially Rachel Griffiths and Angus Young as Morris' wife and son) also shines and really, truth be told, are very much more than ""supporting"". They are the reasons why Morris does what he does.<br/><br/>Overall, I consider ""The Rookie"" to be the epitome of a solid, wholesome family drama (and just an incredibly compelling story to boot). I'm a big baseball fan, so perhaps I can appreciate the deeper, more embedded themes of the film more than the non-sports viewer, but to me this is five-star material all the way."

","Dennis Quaid stars in this biographical film about Jim Morris, once a promising prospect originally in the Milwaukee Brewer system who had several chances with a few teams and never quite made the Big Show as they call the Major Leagues. Now he's settled down being a full time science teacher and part time baseball coach at his small town Texas high school with wife Rachel Griffiths and their kids.<br/><br/>But through some mysterious alchemy the arm trouble that washed him out seems to have gone away. Quaid is back throwing the high heat of his high school days. And soon more than his team notices.<br/><br/>The Rookie is a great film in the sense that it shows people that every now and then dreams do come true. After long years Jim Morris got his chance to pitch in the Major Leagues, the dream of everyone who draws a paycheck playing a kid's game. <br/><br/>His record isn't much for the Tampa Bay Rays and Morris managed to get there because this was an expansion team in existence for only a couple of years. But he's in the baseball encyclopedia for all time to come. Kind of like Moonlight Graham, played in Field Of Dreams by Burt Lancaster who was up ""for a cup of coffee and a look/see for John McGraw"". <br/><br/>The Rookie is a nice baseball film and big Kudos to Dennis Quaid and everyone else associated with bringing Jim Morris to the big screen as well as The Big Show."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","7","1","1","25 February 2016"," Not usually a fan of sports flicks, but this one rocks it
","The Rookie is a wonderfully done underdog story, a film that easily wins us over and has us cheering in the protagonist's corner in the first act. Dennis Quaid plays Jimmy Morris, a blue blooded baseball fanatic who grew up with the game running in his blood and a bucket load of talent, but never the time to pursue it growing up. His working class father (Brian Cox) discourages that kind of ambitious and adopts a vaguely bitter worldview. And so he grows up, starts a family and the dream fades. His skill resurfaces when he coaches the town's high school baseball team. They take notice of his wildfire pitching arm, and make him a deal: if they win one championship, he takes a crack at the major leagues talent scout circuit. It's a pleasure watching an old dog like Quaid take a triumphant eleventh hour shot at success, and it makes for a fine film. Morris's fastball is a 90 plus mile an hour wunderkind and he is immediately drafted into the MLB despite his age. His family is overjoyed and he is filled with a new energy and love for life spurred on by his second chance at his passion. It's great stuff. Rachel Griffiths is solid as Jimmy's eternally supportive wife, Beth Grant is sweet as his mother and adorable Angus T. Jones makes good work of his doting son. It's Brian Cox who quietly steals the show as his father, a man soured by his own misplaced trajectory, who takes his damn time to come around and show some pride is his son. Cox is a deeply gifted pro who provides pools of gravity and anchors the film back on solid ground every time it veers towards excessive sentimentality. Especially his final, wrenching scene. A golden entry in the sports genre."

He returned back to Texas. He (Dennis Quaid) teaches high school chemistry with his wife (Rachel Griffiths) and three kids. He coaches an unmotivated school baseball team. The team wants him to go to a tryout for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He agrees to do it if the team wins the championship.<br/><br/>This is a nice inspirational family film. It's your basic nice small-town guy makes it to the big leagues. It's great anytime no matter what the big league is. That's not to say that this is a nothing special movie.

Jim, who evidently tried a spot in the majors, got injured, and is resigned to the kind of life he didn't want back in his youth. One thing he never loses is the speed in which he throws a baseball.

He'd had his shot playing baseball, blew out his shoulder, and retired without ever making it to the big leagues. Then, in 1999, Coach Morris made a fateful bet with his perpetually losing team. If they won the district championship, Morris - who threw a 98 mph fastball - would try out for the majors. The team went from worst to first, and Jim, living up to his end of the bargain, threw caution to the wind and was on the road to becoming the oldest rookie in the major leagues"" according to the official studio synopsis.<br/><br/>This ""feel good / family"" movie is nicely played, but blandly fictionalized. As the thirtysomething man receiving a second chance at major league baseball stardom, Mr. Quaid is very believable. His character seems unnaturally distant from family members, which makes you yearn for more physical and emotional contact - perhaps, this is intentional. Quaid is closer to his likewise too old high school students: Jay Hernandez (as Joaquin ""Wack"" Campos), Rick Gonzalez (as Rudy Bonilla), Chad Lindberg (as Joe David West), and Angelo Spizzirri (as Joel De La Garza). Along with rookie pal Russell Richardson (as Brooks), the younger baseball players are excellent, and give the Quaid and the film heart.<br/><br/>That Mr. Spizzirri is among the standout young performers - he is immediately impressive, as Coach Quaid's high school catcher kid - makes the sadness of his untimely death linger. Curvaceous Rachel Griffiths (as Lorri Morris), appropriately distant Brian Cox (as Jim Morris Sr.), and ""Two and a Half Men"" star Angus T. Jones (as Hunter Morris) are the family who could have stood some deeper characterization.

It added different genres at just the right moments: a sprinkle of drama, many parts of family, and a heck of a lot of baseball.<br/><br/>Starring Denis Quad, The Rookie was about a Texas High School Baseball Coach/Father who agreed his team that if they were to make the playoffs, he would try out for the major league. Little did he know, he actually had a 98 batting average and of course, was sent to play on a major league team.<br/><br/>If your part of a sports family or just simply love baseball, I highly recommend that you see the Rookie.<br/><br/>Best Sports movie of 2002 Hands Down! My Rating: 9/10"

I recommend this movie to all viewers who like to watch and learn about the great American sport baseball. It was a great movie."

","I wasn't too sure what to expect with this flick, gawd knows I've seen many baseball movies and some are quite impressive (see BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY, FIELD OF DREAMS, THE NATURAL, to name but a few), while others leave much to be desired. THE ROOKIE, based on a true story, wasn't overtly sentimental, too predictable and featured fine performances from the entire cast. While it's not the best film I've seen on the game, the fact that it's as much about finding the strength to resurrect your dreams is definitely refreshing."

"McHuevo","7","1","1","16 November 2002"," 2 for the price of 1
","Following Disney's purest tradition, ""The Rookie"" tells a story of hope and believing in yourself.<br/><br/>This film is actually a two-in-one combo. The first half is the story of the bad (baseball) team that, through some hard work and inspiration from their coach, come all the way from behind to win the championship. This movie we have seen tons of times (""Hardball"", ""Mighty Ducks"", ""Little Giants"", etc, etc.). There are very few references to the Jimmy Morris tale during this first half.<br/><br/>The second half is all about Jimmy Morris and his struggle to pursue a long lost dream: become a major league baseball player. He is driven to gain self-confidence, hope and ultimately courage to take a shot at his dream; even when he's old enough to be retiring from instead of entering professional baseball. On the other hand, he has a family to take care of and a decent job he would be turning down to go after a potential lost cause.<br/><br/>All in all I think this movie is a story of courage. It takes lots of it to go after something you forgot you wanted more than anything; that and a very supporting family. The fact that this is a true story makes this point even more significant.<br/><br/>The movie itself may seem a little bit too long for it's purpose, specially the first half which didn't need so much detail, but it takes its message across well enough."
"FlickJunkie-2","8","1","1","2 October 2002"," Inspirational human interest story
","As someone who loves films and baseball, this film was a mixed bag for me. As a human interest story it is excellent, but as a baseball story it is somewhat of a disappointment.  It is a very upbeat tale of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a high school science teacher who rediscovers his fastball at the age of 35 and tries out for the major leagues.  The story mixes together his personal quest and that of the high school baseball team he coaches, both of which overcome incredible odds to achieve near impossible feats.<br/><br/>As a baseball story, Jim Morris is really nothing more than an interesting footnote in baseball history.  There are far more compelling baseball stories to be told, like Tommy John who came back from reconstructive surgery to pitch another 14 seasons (that were some of his best), or Jim Abbott who was born without a right hand and pitched in the major leagues for ten years, pitching a no hitter against Cleveland in 1993.  Morris only played for Tampa Bay for parts of two seasons, pitching a total of 15 innings with a 4.80 ERA and almost as many walks as strikeouts.  Still, it is pretty inspirational that he made it to the majors at all given his age.<br/><br/>This film plays well on Main Street, where regular folks are reminded of the faded fantasies of their youth.  It strikes a chord because to root for Morris is to root for their long abandoned dreams.  Director John Lee Hancock does a fine job of bringing out the best in the human story, although the sports components are marginal.<br/><br/>There are just too many instances of unrealistic baseball in this film.  For instance, Morris is repeatedly shown throwing as hard as he can with absolutely no warm-up.  Any little leaguer can tell you that you will blow out your arm if you do that.  This is especially unrealistic given the fact that Morris had surgery on that shoulder when he was younger.  Unless he was plain stupid, he would warm up before he attempted to throw flat out. <br/><br/>
As an athlete, Quaid is not terribly convincing, with pitching mechanics that are far short of professional caliber.  Kevin Costner was much more credible in `For Love of the Game', though that film lacked the story of this one.<br/><br/>From an acting perspective Dennis Quaid is marvelous in the lead.  This is one of the best performances of his career.  He is convincing as the high school coach pushing his kids to reach for their dreams and maximize their potential.  His chemistry with the young cast is terrific.  However, in the pursuit of his own dream, he is even better.  This is a complex and nuanced performance showing Morris as filled with desire and self doubt.  Quaid's portrayal of his determination in the face of his own insecurity is phenomenally insightful and compelling.  Rachel Griffiths and Brian Cox give splendid performances and Morris' wife and father.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful feel-good film that is great for the whole family.  I've been a little hard on it because I'm a long time baseball fanatic, but the human interest story is so well done and Quaid's performance so compelling that I have to give it at least an 8/10.  This is a film that everyone can enjoy, regardless of whether you love sports."

","The first time I saw ""The Rookie"" I thought it was too much about the man's life and not enough about baseball. I completely missed the point. The next time I saw the movie, it dawned on me that it is Jim Morris' life that makes the story of a 35 year old high school teacher turned MLB rookie so fascinating. Every emotion in the movie feels so real. The casting is perfect. Dennis Quaid plays Jim Morris accurately, giving off a real sense of concern for his family as he struggles to achieve his dream. My favorite part of the movie is the cinematography and the score. Every scene is shot masterfully, with pleasing backgrounds and solid focus on the action in the foreground. The score is also impressive. The music fits the story perfectly. I don't know how I could appreciate ""The Rookie"" any more than I already do now."

This is a very fast moving movie and may be difficult to keep up with. They put ALOT of stuff into a 2 hour movie. I love the story especially because it's a true one.

","This film has a lame soundtrack, a silly plot, and the sort of preprogrammed ending that feels contrived.  Still, it is the kind of movie that you walk away from feeling as if it somehow summed up everything important in the world, as if baseball really were everything that mattered.  Can we forgive the film's simplistic story in light of the multitude of subtleties that are left unspoken? I believe we can.  This isn't the sort of tearjerker that will traumatize you for the rest of the evening.  This movie is just like a game of baseball on a balmy afternoon."

I was very impressed but was bored with the camera shots. They kept using the same shots of pitching since ""Rookie of the Year.""  Some were actually worse.<br/><br/> Quaid did a wonderful job and the movie was rather touching.  This just isn't my kind of movie.  It was a lot better than I was expecting though. Well worth it if you have small kids."
"KMM","8","1","1","3 May 2002"," A Good, Clean Family Film
","I saw this recently in the theaters. The main draw for me was the theme of baseball, but their was much more to the movie. The Rookie tells the story of a high school teacher, Jim Morris, who pursues his dream after the baseball team he coaches issues him with a challenge to try out for a major league team if they win their division title. Dennis Quaid did a wonderful job as Jim Morris.  He really breathed life into the role. The story was very good in showing the theme of making choices and how those choices affect our lives and the individuals around us. A particularly memorable scene is when his wife first learns of his attempts to get back into baseball. You would expect his wife to initially be supportive of him because it is something he really wants to do, but there is an expression of mixed emotions as she honestly expresses her real feelings on his attempt at trying to get into the majors in his late thirties. She isn't particularly supportive and prefers he not do it in the beginning. The film will leave you with a ""feel good"" attitude after you watch it, and you do not necessarily have to enjoy baseball to enjoy the film. Whether you see it in theaters or wait until home video please make sure you make an effort to see this film."
"microbonnie","8","1","1","1 May 2002"," simplistic, but great!
","Right, so there isn't a whole lot of conflict, and what there is is fairly shallow.  So what?  It's a G movie, and a darn good one at that.  The kids are ADORABLE.  The baseball is fun.  It's generic, but it hits the ""warm, fuzzy"" spot.  Dennis Quaid is cool."
"morgana-6","8","1","1","18 April 2002"," Great baseball film
","Many of my friends have heard me say ""I don't do sports movies."" So why did I go to The Rookie? I gotta admit that Dennis Quaid brought me: I can't resist his engaging grin. But that isn't why I'm writing a review. I went expecting a charming movie and got a lot more. Yes, it's charming. But there are many layers: father-son relationships, husband-wife relationships, how people inspire and support each other, and seeking your dreams. Few of us are lucky enough to know what our dreams are, let alone see them come true. And here's a true story of someone that lucky. The characters are not one-dimensional, and the acting is fine and often subtle by both leads and supporting cast. One of my favorite moments is when the wife says ""go for it,"" and you see the dream fill Dennis Quaid's eyes, and you know the right decision was made. The film moves in loving slowness, letting us get to know the characters and to understand Jim Morris' love of baseball. My friend, as we were watching the credits said, ""for a film with not an unhappy moment in it, I sure cried a lot."" So bring some kleenex if you're susceptible to tears of love and joy. If you liked The Natural or Field of Dreams, you should check this flick out. Did I say I didn't do sports movies? I guess I'll have to revise that and say ""except for good baseball."""
"filmdolly","7","1","1","17 April 2002"," Scores a home run.
","A bit cliche in the making, but the casting was superb.  Dennis Quaid did a great job of portraying an inspiring real-life hero, Jim Morris.  Rachel Griffiths was also excellent as his wife.  The contrasting father-son relationships were angst for the movie, but not thoroughly explored, especially Jim with his father.  However, there was a certain efficiency in character development in the movie that delineated each character in a few lines in fewer scenes.  These were not one dimensional people.  I am not a baseball fan, but I seem to like baseball movies.  Who can say why.  It's no Field of Dreams, but I enjoyed this movie, it's lack of explicit sex and violence especially!  Dear Hollywood, please make more like this one."

Dennis Quaid, the most reasonable jock actor working today, is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player Jimmy Morris.

The cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today(which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out). It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it. Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy.

I can't recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me; here, everybody looks the part.

","This effort is based on the true story of Jim  Morris, a high school science teacher/baseball coach, who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his life-long dream of playing in the majors.  Dennis Quaid, no stranger to sports films, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the real-world events that led to Morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The first half of the film, dealing with his rag tag bunch of High School Baseball players (all of whom look way too old to actualy be in High School) is less effective and probably a bit too long. Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without. However, it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason. GRADE: B-"

Laced with dreams - dripping in reality, the American Dream reignites after 9.11 with a true story about the Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris.

","Disney does like a good old fashioned sports story with a human interest angle. I'm a huge fan of Baseball and Baseball films in general, so even though this is Disney and likely to be a sugar-sweet family friendly film devoid of any real conflict and turmoil , I decided to give this one a punt.
I'd be a liar if I said I had even heard of Jim Morris, the unlikely hero of this true story about a Baseball pitcher who makes his Major League debut at the age of 35. It's the stuff of dreams, and with Dennis Quaid giving a decent account of himself as the humble but tenacious High School teacher who follows his dream after a pact with his pupils, this is actually quite inspiring. Quaid looks the part too. Yes I'm sure there were some special effects used, certainly in the sound department, but he threw well and was fairly convincing. His debut at Arlington against the Texas Rangers did make my heart flutter a little, but hey, this is Disney. Aside from Quaid and Rachel Griffiths who played his wife, there's only a small cameo from Brian Cox of any note in an otherwise cast of nobodies.
Jim Morris apparently had two years as a reliever with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays although according to his stats he never really altered the outcome of any of his games with a record of 0-0. In a day when sportsmen are getting older and carrying on for longer, maybe Morris's story won't be a one-off much longer and that day when I stride out at Fenway to pitch against the Yankees becomes a reality."

The main character is no Superman - he has a family to provide for, the usual bills to pay but he also has a love and talent for Baseball. Part of the appeal of this film was the development of the character from a transient Army family to adulthood with his personal dreams put aside again and again. Dennis Quaid was excellent as Jim Morris - extremely believable in this role. Rachel Griffiths was also very believable as his wife. The scenes involving the Morris family with 3 young children were very natural. Not many films would show Dad taking 3 young children with him to Baseball tryouts! The appeal of this story is that it reminds us all that with determination and a family's support an individual's dreams can come true."

","In this day and age, a G-rated film is specifically a children's movie- replete with cute, worldly children, cute talking animals, cute talking aliens, and cute computer animation. ""The Rookie"" is also rated G, but you'd never know it from its sophisticated script and direction. This is a family friendly autobiography about real people who experience- among other things- divorce, father-son dysfunction, heartbreak, and fulfilling your dream. Those who want to whine about the sentimental edge of the story don't realize that the film is actually more straightforward than usual and hasn't been ""Disneyfied"" in any way. (This reveals a sad commentary on how cynical we've become about sentiment in general.) ""Rookie's"" director John Lee Hancock comments on this same phenomenon on the DVD's bonus documentary; while his film has none of the typical overly-cute trappings of a G-rated film, the MPAA rated it as such anyway. It's so smart and witty that it can even spotlight a corps of baseball playing teenagers (these are the film's best scenes) who are more mature and subdued than in most films of this genre.

","Possible spoilers ahead, drive carefully.<br/><br/>Another in a long line of inspirational sports success stories, presented in broad strokes and succeeding on various levels. What sets The Rookie apart from other run-of-the-mill sports movies is Dennis Quaid's somewhat muted but appealing performance and the fact that the climax is not about winning the big game. So many other sports movies always result in the team making it to that big game and then its over, with Rudy being a notable exception and make no mistake, The Rookie does share a common theme with Rudy in that its about perseverance and not so much about winning the world series/super bowl/championship.<br/><br/>No one is really allowed to stretch themselves dramatically here, yet the payoff is still worth the ride. The director and screenwriter strike a fine balance by finding the right tone that befits Jim Morris' very personal and triumphant story. <br/><br/>I believe The Rookie will hold up over time and can be mentioned in the ranks of Hoosiers and Rudy as fine sports-inspired tales of making it.<br/><br/>Now that covers Football, Basketball and Baseball....I wonder how many screenwriters out there right now are working on a Hockey version ?"

","With `The Straight Story' and now `The Rookie', the Walt Disney Company is quietly putting together a series of quality films that transcend any expectations associated with the company while remaining wholesome, astute and committed. They're doing this by pairing talented filmmakers and actors with uncommon but inspiring true stories that have natural, universal conflicts built into them and the results are intelligent and moving. In this case, John Lee Hancock directs a beautifully convincing Dennis Quaid as Jim Morris, the Texas high school baseball coach who reached the major leagues in his late thirties. Hancock perfectly combines the simplicity of small town Texas life with the mythic purity of baseball and manages, almost innocently it would seem, to make every cliché seem fresh and believable; he has faith in the material (the well-thought screenplay is by Mike Rich) and in the audience's ability to see past the aspects of the plot that they've visited before. This applies all the way down to the typical strained father-son relationship sports films usually center on: using brief but incisive dialogue and the passage of time, Morris and his Navy father (Brian Cox) quietly spar with each other, struggling to achieve détente and the payoff is heartfelt and gratifying. The understated Quaid is a mixture of childish awe at his baseball prowess and grownup regret as he despairs over not following his dream--it's a performance that should probably ring true in most adults and it's his most affecting since `Breaking Away'. Hancock is greatly assisted by his cinematographer, John Schwartzman, who cuts through the Texas dust to provide a straightforward visual sharpness (in contrast to Freddie Francis' offbeat Midwest images in `The Straight Story'); and the inimitable Carter Burwell, whose hushed score is poignant and always appropriate. An outstanding movie, one that should have no difficulty standing the test of time."

"spaceman___spiff","9","0","0","31 August 2002"," It's riddled with cliches... so why is it so good?
","On the face of it this movie should have a boat-load of problems.  It's long (runtime 127 minutes).  It's a potentially unweildy two movies in one--the story of a team in a town with no baseball becoming a winning team, and the story of Jim Morris' amazing rise to the Major Leagues at the age of 35. It contains many long sequences that are very... pastoral... to put the best face on them (and maybe they actually deserve that treatment--they are slow, but beautiful).  It's a Disney movie--usually the kiss of death towards any hope of true depth.  It's a ""based on a true story"" movie, with some definite revisionist history in it.<br/><br/>And that's just the start of it.  The movie contains more cliches and stereotypes than you can shake a stick at.  A boy with a stern father who doesn't understand his son's impractical love of baseball.  A main character who is ""haunted by demons"" and has to overcome them.  An beleagered understanding wife, but with undercurrents that marital discord is just waiting in the wings.  The local team that doesn't have a chance to win, but they do.  I could go on with the list for much longer.<br/><br/>But ""The Rookie"" is more than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>First there is a performance from Dennis Quaid that is probably the best of his career.  It's sensitive.  It's longing.  His version of Jim Morris is one of those rare portrayals of a quiet man, with much more going on behind his eyes than in front of them.  If you loved Quaid in ""Frequency"", it's a similar type of performance, but maybe a bit better.<br/><br/>Quaid is much older than Morris really was at the time, but it gives Morris a ""lived in"" look which only helps.  Quaid is a man who is rarely given a chance to act--for real I mean--in most of the movies which come his way, and somehow things just fell into place this time.<br/><br/>But the movie works for other reasons as well.  It has the mish-mash of cliches, but it never revels or wallows in them.  At most they are bricks and not mortar---elements used to build a better whole, but the filmmakers weren't foolish enough to use weak glue to hold it all together.<br/><br/>The glue is that the film loves and respects its subject matter.  It's not a half-assed attempt which uses baseball as a plot device for another story--it's about baseball.  It's also about Morris, and his wife, and his Dad, and his Mom, and his team, and his town, but baseball is the thread which links them all.  Jim Morris is a true believer--obsessed with the game--and so is this film, in a good way.<br/><br/>All of the cliches--the bricks--and held solid in this foundation.  As are they by Quaid's performance.  Rachel Griffiths, also is good--in a role brief enough that she could have just phoned it in--but she doesn't.<br/><br/>
Give it a shot.<br/><br/>Oh... and its even got a decent soundtrack, if you aren't offended by older folk-like country, as opposed to the newer garbage they crank out these days."

","Boy was I disappointed in this movie!  Cliches, cliches, and more cliches. What a screenplay it could have...and should have...been since it actually was a dream come true for Jim Morris.  My biggest complaint is how joyless Quaid's Morris was.  I mean, come on!  It was evidently written to make Morris look like he was not having any fun whatsoever and that ruined the movie for me.  Considering how likeable Quaid always seems with his infectious grin, this role of a sad-sack was a real downer.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great movies out there about baseball and how grown men are thrilled to be playing a young man's game.

","Hollywood, CA -- Here's an interesting idea for a movie: A 35-year-old high school science teacher and baseball coach from West Texas tries out for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and, less than four months later, is pitching in the Major Leagues.<br/><br/>Yup, pure Hollywood fiction. Sounds like the kind of fantasy that Disney, the same studio that did the remake of ""Angels in the Outfield"" in 1994, would come up with.<br/><br/>Well, the story does come to you courtesy of Disney, only this time the fantasy is reality. It is the true story of Jim Morris and his amazing odyssey from the faculty lounge to the Major Leagues in ""The Rookie.""<br/><br/>In the film, Dennis Quaid plays Morris, the former Major League prospect turned high school baseball coach in Big Lake, Texas, who in 1999 makes a deal with his players. If they win the divisional championship, he in return would try out for a Major League team. Of course, they win, forcing Morris to try out for the Devil Rays. And to the surprise of everyone, including himself, he ends up on the fast track to the big leagues with a consistent 98-mph fastball.<br/><br/>""I just found it inspirational,"" said Quaid. ""If it was a piece of fiction I don't think I would have done it. It's just too unbelievable. He was teaching high school science in May in some little town in Big Lake, Texas, and in September he's standing on the pitching mound in a Major League ballpark fulfilling his dream. You couldn't be more storybook about it.""<br/><br/>Morris, now 38, who retired from baseball after appearing in 16 games with the Devil Rays in 2000, says the events of 1999 changed the direction of his life.<br/><br/>I think it opened my eyes to second chances,"" he said. ""I'm trying to teach my kids in high school a lesson and they end up teaching me a lesson and that in itself is a second chance. Kids see themselves helping an adult and I think that inspires them. I never would have tried to play baseball again if it weren't for them. I'd been out of the game for 10 1/2 years.""<br/><br/>While pitching for the Devil Rays' Triple-A affiliate in Durham, NC, Morris got a call from Mark Ciardi, an aspiring film producer who happened to be a former teammate of Morris' when the two played together in the Milwaukee Brewers' farm system in the mid 1980s. Ciardi and his partner, Gordon Gray, convinced Morris that his story would make a wonderful feature film and immediately set up a meeting with Disney.<br/><br/>With Mike Rich and John Lee Hancock on board as writer and director, the filmmakers had to find the right man to play Morris. They chose Quaid, who has played football stars in the films ""Everybody's All American"" and ""Any Given Sunday"" and has starred in several other had a string of both critical a commercial hits including ""Breaking Away,"" ""The Right Stuff"" and, more recently, ""Traffic.""<br/><br/>Quaid, who grew up in Houston and says that the old Colt 45's of Bob Aspromonte, Rusty Staub and Jimmy Wynn were his boyhood idols, had not picked up a baseball in nearly 30 years.<br/><br/>""I hadn't played baseball since I was in Little League, so it was quite a challenge,"" said Quaid. ""I was always a baseball fan, but I hadn't played in years. Getting the pitching motion down was the most important thing. I didn't want to look like I threw like an actress.""<br/><br/>So the producers hired former Dodger and Pirate reliever Jim Gott to work with Quaid.<br/><br/>""We had the luxury of three months before we started shooting,"" said Quaid. ""Jim would come over to my house and we'd throw balls in the front yard, we'd go over to Dodger Stadium once a week and throw over there. That was very exciting and we would just work at getting the pitching motion down.""<br/><br/>Gott says the 46-year-old actor was a very good student.<br/><br/>""We just went through the ritual of what a pitcher goes through,"" said Gott. ""An offseason training program is what I tried to work with him on. A throwing program of three to five days. Three days in the beginning. We just began to work on his mechanics. Dennis is an athlete already, I think he has more big league time with his football movies and now his baseball movie than I ever did in the big leagues. Here's a guy who's a huge star, who takes his craft seriously, but he loves the athletic side of things and he was able to adapt to whatever training program we had for him right off the bat.""<br/><br/>When he wasn't throwing, Gott had Quaid study videotape of a baseball legend.<br/><br/>""I gave Dennis a tape of Sandy Koufax pitching in the seventh game of the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins,"" said Gott. ""I felt he should learn from the best and Sandy helped me a lot in my career with the Dodgers. Dennis was always looking for the finer points of what looked right and what seemed right. I felt being a lefty and playing a power pitcher like Jim Morris and Sandy being the best lefty power pitcher ever, that this is a tape he should see and he loved it.""<br/><br/>The entire process gave Quaid a deeper understanding of the game.<br/><br/>""I now have a better appreciation for pitchers,"" said Quaid. ""I've always been a baseball fan, but now I can watch a game with a little different point of view having delved just a little bit into Jim's world.""<br/><br/>Morris was impressed with Quaid's work as an actor and a pitcher.<br/><br/>""He threw everyday,"" said Morris. ""He got to the point as a pitcher, as pitchers do, before he let the ball go, he knew if the pitch was bad or not -- he was amazing. He did a lot of work.""<br/><br/>Morris is also pleased with the way his life is portrayed on film.<br/><br/>""I'm just so happy with the way it turned out,"" said Morris. ""I actually got to see a finished product about three weeks ago in Nashville with the religious broadcaster's convention and they didn't know I was in the theatre until it was over and I had to dry my eyes before I could get up and talk to them.""<br/><br/>Quaid says ""The Rookie,"" rated G, is much more than just a baseball film.<br/><br/>""It's about second chances in life,"" said the actor. ""Second chances in our dreams, second chances in our relationships in life and I think that's how somebody who is not even a baseball fan can relate to the film.""<br/><br/>Morris, who now works as a motivational speaker and volunteer baseball coach in Dallas, hopes that people everywhere can be inspired by his story.<br/><br/>""Baseball just happened to be my dream,"" said Morris. ""I think other people can put their dreams into my life because, let's face it, I'm just an ordinary person, I just got to do something that I wanted to do my entire life and I think other people can see themselves in that and see themselves accomplishing a lot.""<br/><br/>Ben Platt covers both Hollywood and the Dodgers for MLB.com.

","There has been a trend the last few years that I like in the film world. With films like ""Buena Vista Social Club"" and ""The Straight Story"", there has been a renaissance of G-rated films aimed at adult audiences--something unheard of since Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"".  Now Disney--the 400lb gorilla of G-rated films--throws it's hat into the ring with this film that should resonate with anyone over 30 who feels life has passed them by (count the author of this review).<br/><br/>Jimmy Morris only has one dream as a kid, and that's to pitch in the major leagues.  Unfortunately he has 3 major stumbling blocks.  First, his father thins baseball is silly.  Second, the Navy sends his dad out to west Texas--where football is king & baseball ranks slightly below sumo wrestling in popularity.  Third, as a minor leaguer, he injures his shoulder & is no longer able to pitch--or so he thinks.<br/><br/>The film catches up with him as a 40-year-old high school physics teacher & varsity baseball coach.  He occasionally yearns for the glory he never had, but is mostly satisfied to be resigned to his fate.  It's not all that bad, after all.  He's got a beautiful wife and 3 great kids, and he's on the verge of a higher-paying job in Ft Worth.  But he has a problem:  his team is unmotivated & under-talented.  They see him as an example of someone who is afraid to try.  So they make a deal with him:  if they make the state tournament, Jimmy will try out for the pros again.  And then we all find out that Jimmy can throw in the upper 90's, something he couldn't do in his playing days.  And guess what?  A team is interested.<br/><br/>All this would seem trite & cliche except that it really happened.  Jimmy Morris was the star pitcher for the Florida Marlins for the first two years of their existence.<br/><br/>One can quibble with certain things about the film.  Why do they need the sound effects for Jimmy's pitches?  Why was the film set today instead of ten years ago when it actually happened?  Why the Devil Rays instead of the Marlins?  Aren't there just too many lush green hills for west Texas? (the film was made in my home town of Round Rock, which is in the hilly green central part of Texas)<br/><br/>However, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  The acting--especially Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths--is superb.  And the dialogue sounds natural, even without the mildest of swear words (the word ""damn"" is in a song that plays in the background and that's it).  And the story itself is the fantasy of everyone over the age of 30 who wonders ""what if?""  When I think of Jimmy Morris, I am reminded of Grandma Moses, Raymond Chandler, Danny Aiello--people who waited until middle age or later to find their true calling and succeeded on a grand scale.  And this film gives me hope that someday--who knows?--I could be the king of heavy metal starting when I'm forty or fifty.  8 out of 10."

","The Rookie was not your usual 'Dreams come true movie,' it was more realistic than most. Being based on a true story, it was just that, true. It was never over the top, it was genuine. The connections between the characters (father-son x 2, husband-wife, father-children, coach-players) were not nostalgic or terribly up-lifting, they were simply realistic. Raw power is the end result of a movie that's story is up-lifting but its screenplay is not. Because all it does is tell a good story, you go away with a smile on your face, nothing else. Do not judge this movie for not being deep enough, judge it as a simple story with a simple moral. Lose yourself in The Rookie and you will be glad."
"SMLA11","10","0","0","11 May 2002"," Excellent!
","This movie has to be the greatest movie of 2002 up to date.  This movie was absolutely wonderful.  Sure it's a Disney movie but this one is great. Dennis Quaid portrays Jim Morris, a High School science teacher and the coach of the school baseball team whose dream since he was a kid was to be a professional baseball player.  His team makes a bet with him that if they win the district, he tries out for Major League Baseball.  He agrees to the bet and the rest of the movie is history.  If you know the true life story of Jimmy Morris than you would probably know what happens during the movie. I won't spoil it for you by telling you what happens.<br/><br/>The performances were extremely well.  Dennis quaid is the heart of the story.  Every time he is in it is absolutely great.  Rachel Griffiths, who portrays Lorri Morris, is also very good.  Angus T. Jones plays Jim and Lorri's son, Hunter.  His performance was good enough and I think he is supposed to be a comic relief.  He made smile a few times.  Brian Cox and Beth Grant are very well and I enjoyed them through the entire movie.  The actors who play Jim Morris's baseball team, such as Jay Hernandez and Rick Gonzalez, are cool and probably the best actors to portray the players. Trevor Morgan is good playing young Jim Morris but he wasn't onscreen long enough to show Jim's childhood.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is good for the entire family and anyone who knows the story of Jim Morris or is a fan of baseball, I definitely suggest this movie.  Rating 10 out of 10."

","After watching The Rookie, I was left wondering about Jim Morris' stats. Here's what I found. He was called up at the age of 35 in 1999 and pitched in five games and 4.2 innings. He had 3 strikeouts (two more after the  Royce Clayton whiff in the movie). He had an ERA of 5.79. In 2000, he pitched in 16 games and 10.1 innings. He struck out 10 and had a 4.36 ERA. He had no W-L or saves in his brief career. Those stats weren't that bad so I would also like to know if an arm injury ended his career in 2000. A couple of other things I was wondering about: How much money did he make and did he go back into coaching and teaching after the flirt with fame? Other questions: How did the Owls do the following season and if he went back into coaching did he return to the same school or take the Fort Worth offer?"

","The Rookie is one of the better baseball movies of recent years, and even more exciting, suitable for all audiences--with the exception of people who hate baseball. It stays relatively true to the autobiography it is based on. With a G rating, it has no gratuitous foul language and nothing was added to the true story to make it warrant a more adult rating. Yet it is entertaining and touching, without being cloying. It touches more on the father-son relationships, and omits most of the husband-wife interactions from the book, so females (and males) who don't understand baseball and it's place in society may not appreciate the film."
"Lexi-4","Null","0","0","26 April 2002"," Very Rookie-level film making
","I went into this movie expecting a sweet, sentimental, feel good movie that lived up the great reviews it's been getting. Instead, what I got was a painfully mediocre movie with absolutely nothing new to offer. This movie is nothing more than a recycled story line from every other movie in its genre, and it fails to offer anything substantially different from any of them.<br/><br/>Meet Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a high school teacher/baseball coach who once had a dream of being in the major leagues. However, somewhere down the line, he got an arm injury and settled for a small town family life instead. One day, he shocks his high school baseball team by throwing a pitch that clocks in at 98 MPH. The kids then launch into a motivational speech, somewhere along the cliche lines of ""you always encourage us to chase our dreams, but you're not following your own!"" Bewildered by this shocking revelation, Morris decides to try out for pro baseball, if, and only if, the high school team gets into the district championship. Hmmm, I wonder what happens...<br/><br/>My biggest fault with this movie (besides the fact that you know the entire story solely from the 1 minute trailer), is that it expects you to sympathize with the characters and feel what they're feeling, but it never takes the steps needed to form those connections. His few scenes with his wife are brief and distant, not showing us any real bond or chemistry between the two characters. The only one of his kids we somewhat get to know is his adoring 8-year-old son, who idolizes his dad's infatuation with baseball and wants to be just like him. Beyond that, we see no real connections between Morris and his family. They are simply props in the background while he chases his dreams.<br/><br/>I would rate this movie a very generous 6/10. While it was not a terrible movie, it was certainly not ground breaking or impressive all the same. If you want to see a genuinely feel-good, excellent baseball movie, rent ""league of their own"" instead."

","I'm also rather partial to 8 Men Out, the only other baseball movie that I like without reservations. Movies about baseball usually fall short, particularly in the way the baseball games themselves are portrayed. You have absurdly metaphorical, fairy tale games (The Natural), or unnecessarily exaggerated action (Bull Durham - I mean does the kid have to be so ridiculously wild?). This movie actually feels like the baseball I've played (though not as well) and watched.<br/><br/>Make no mistake this is a Disney movie. It's a sentimental story. Thankfully it doesn't play the sentimentality in a sentimental way, avoiding that getting-hit-over-the-head lessons trap that so many Hollywood movies fall into. All the secondary characters are clearly drawn. And Dennis Quaid does first class work, making a multi-dimensional character that also serves the story quite clearly. A very satisfying flick."

An intelligent screenplay, with quiet, careful direction, and a thoughtful, almost mesmerizing performance, by Dennis Quaid.

The baseball elements of the film are quite well done (Dennis Quaid actually looks like a real pitcher; although I wonder why he always pitches from the stretch), but the film is about much more than baseball. It is about relationships between families, across and within generations, and between coaches and players.  This is a great movie that should win awards but more importantly should strike a chord with REAL people. In that sense, it is similar to another recent Dennis Quaid movie, Frequency. (I highly recommend that one as well but not for small children.)

","This is a well made and well acted movie.  Baseball and the love for it, can get into your very soul.  Anyone who has ever played the game for any length of time and gained any proficiency in it, can identify with Jim Morris and his round about trip to the ""BIGS"".  To walk into a Major league locker room for the firt time and see a jersey with your own name on it, has to be one of the few top highlights of life for a person who loves the game and its beauty and poetry.  The story is well told once it get started.  The beginning and ending with the fable of the nuns detracted from the real story being told.  Take that ""byline"" out and it is a 10.  Dennis Quaid is very believable as a ball player and the kids on the highschool team were very well typecast.  I got goosebumps many times throughout the movie.  It is a clean wholesome story that deserves to be told.  I would highly recommend it.

And I wasn't disappointed.  Dennis Quaid was convincing as Jim Morris, a man who followed his dreams, and the supporting cast was believable and natural in their roles as well.  The story is told with a deliberate pacing, which may put off some younger viewers.  But the story is so charming and the characters so likable that most people won't mind the slower pace.  Call me old fashioned, but I was almost as excited to see that this adult movie was rated G as I was to find it that it was a genuinely effective and inspiring film.  I never felt like the lack of sex or profanity gave it a less-realistic tone, and it made me wonder why more movies aren't made like this--I guess it all comes down to money.  But if the packed screening I attended was any indication, the public is as excited about a clean, mature, family movie as I am, and ""The Rookie"" will appeal to the same audiences that made ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Rudy"" such hits.

","""The Rookie"" is indeed based on a true story.  I heard an interview with Jim Morris, the man on whose life the film is based, and he said that the film had not been ""Hollywoodized.""  While some things were added or deleted to make the story fit, the overwhelming majority of what you see on film actually happened.  <br/><br/>He did have a difficult relationship with his father. He did challenge his students to win their District title in exchange for a promise to try out for a professional baseball team. He did get called up and pitch his first game as a Devil Ray at The Ballpark in Arlington.  He did strike out the first batter he faced.  And so on, and so on.<br/><br/>While they did clean up the language one would normally hear in a clubhouse, the rest of the film rings true to life.  Quaid is outstanding as Jim Morris, and Rachel Griffiths is delightful as his loving wife, Lorri.  The young men who played the members of the high school baseball team he coached had just the right amount of teenage swagger.  <br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film enough.

","Never knew anything about any sports or wanted to until my now twelve- and-a-half year old son reached the age when he started to teach me about the things he cared about and expected and wanted my enthusiastic sharing of his budding interests (that's when he was three).  Baseball was on the list and remains there so it was a sure thing we'd see Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths in ""The Rookie"" the day it opened.<br/><br/>The film is ""based on a true story.""  How close to base it is I leave to the baseball fans who largely packed the theater tonight.  The core is certainly true.  Jim Morris, one-time major league hopeful, sidetracked by injuries largely reflected in the movie by occasional glimpses of a surgical scar, teaches science and coaches a forlorn high school team in the Texas Panhandle.  With inspiring leadership the team wins a district victory but after Morris promised that he'd try to get a second crack at joining the Majors.<br/><br/>Of course he makes it and in the process we see that's he's a truly great husband and father.  With a spouse as wise and lovingly supportive as Ms. Griffiths portrays I'd be too.  Intergenerational conflict and bonding are thrown in - the whole film couldn't take place on the ball field.  Dennis Quaid is superb in this role - a truly believable and totally likeable guy.<br/><br/>The sentimentality is appropriate for the story.  It's never cloying but it is affecting.  Kevin Costner in ""For Love of the Game"" probably reflected a more realistically identifiable ballplayer in a cynical industry.  ""The Rookie"" can make you forget that major league ball is VERY big business. But that's fine since the focus is an appealing Jim Morris who has the kind of guts, really the gumption to employ an old-fashioned word,  we all admire and few of us have.<br/><br/>As is so often the case, the film score signals and nearly overwhelms big, dramatic scenes.  Tune it out and watch the expressions not only on Quaid's and Grifffiths's faces but also on their kids.  The eight-year-old boy is wonderful.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent and there's a real sense of what living in a boom-and-bust region is like.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if you're a sports nut or not, this is a really fine family film, one of the best I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>Score: 9/10"

","People say `feel-good movie' like it's a bad thing.  I say, if it rings true, and doesn't star Haley Joel Osment, a `feel-good movie' can be a great way to spend a couple hours.<br/><br/>`The Rookie' stars Dennis `Bring Me the Head of Russell Crowe' Quaid as Jim Morris, a longtime baseball fanatic whose major league hopes were dashed by some shoulder injury or another.  At age thirty-seven, he coaches a high school baseball team in a Texas town that makes `King of the Hill' look like `Masterpiece Theatre.'  After a game of catch, he discovers that since his shoulder surgery, he's able to pitch harder and faster than ever before (think `Rookie of the Year' but with facial hair).  In order to encourage his struggling team, he promises them that if they'll buckle down and win a game or two, he'll follow suit by trying out for the major leagues.<br/><br/>Need I tell you how things are gonna go down?<br/><br/>What I'm liking about this is that it's a true story.  Not being a baseball fan myself, I invited my baseball junkie father to the screening in order to get an insider's perspective.  According to baseball trivia's Great One, they got everything with superb accuracy, right down to the fact that Jim Morris was a left handed pitcher.  I was then treated to a tirade on the lack of attention to detail in `Field of Dreams.'<br/><br/>The characters, while flat, are played soulfully and with just the right script as to make us both fear and appreciate crazy old men from Texas. Every little kid in this movie is as cute- cute as a dozen baby ducks in tutus reciting `If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.'<br/><br/>This movie is great for those of us that sometimes need a reminder of how great our lives really are.  After weeks and months of toil and mental anguish over the sport, Quaid's character finds himself watching a little league game, and remembering all the fun he'd somehow sucked out of his favorite pastime.  The next day, he greets his teammates by asking, `You know what we get to do today?  We get to PLAY baseball!'<br/><br/>`The Rookie,' much like `The Sandlot,' is a baseball movie that can be enjoyed by anyone- baseball fan or not.  Also like `The Sandlot,' it reminds us that baseball was created for kids, and teaches by example by grabbing only the SECOND G-rating (in theatres) for the year 2002.<br/><br/>
`The Rookie' gets a B.  Would have been higher, but there are better baseball movies, if you want to look hard enough.  Gotta be fair."

","The Rookie is another based off of a true story movie.<br/><br/>It's about Dennis Quaid portraying a guy who wanted to play major league baseball but couldn't because he's always moving with his family.

He's married, and the kids at school like him as their coach.<br/><br/>One day when practicing with a mph gun. It turns out that he can through a ball at 99 mph. With an arm like that he can be able to try out at the majors.<br/><br/>This movie isn't too bad. I'm surprised that it's ranked as one of the few family sport movies. Due to the fact that it's a G rated movie, it's nothing compared to the other average sport movies. It doesn't have any language or anything that would offend young viewers.<br/><br/>But I only recommend it to those who like baseball or family safe movies."

","After hearing that they were going to make a rated G baseball movie I immediately turned my head. Then I saw that Dennis Quade being the rookie! The guy is like 50 playing a 35 year old! But people kept telling me it was good so I had to put the movie in. It was a good surprise.<br/><br/>Dennis Quade was very good. He had the truest expressions as he moved up in the baseball world. Because this was based on a true story, it seemed that Dennis Quade might of had to method act some of his part and that sure did help. As Dennis Quades's character smiles you know you could only smile yourself.<br/><br/>What I liked the most about the movie was they're are two stories. One being Dennis Quade coaching the team and how the team was dominating. This took up the first hour of the movie. The second of course being Dennis Quade trying to make it to the major leagues.<br/><br/>The only parts of the movie that bothered me was the sound effect they had on the baseball as he threw it. They made it sound like the ball was going 300 mph instead of 98. This is a great family film and check it out if you love baseball and know so much about how it works (minor leagues, call-ups, scouting etc.).<br/><br/>I'd give the acting a 9, directing a 6, editing a 7, storyline a 9 and message a 9."

","One of, if not the best, baseball movies ever. Combines real drama, emotion, and sports in a combination that makes a great fairy tale story and is fit for the entire family. The acting is superb, the locations are true to life. The story has meaning and a moral, items which are so lacking in the vast majority of today's films. As a high school coach myself, I can vouch for the realism in the coaching scenes with the interaction between coach and athletes, the motivation factors, and the love and loyalty between coach and player. To add the icing to the cake, the strong family theme throughout between man and wife, and fathers and sons create the emotional tugs of the heart as well. It leaves the viewer pleased at the end, and iterates the value of following through on your dreams, no matter how silly or far away they seem, and how dedication and hard work can pay off. All movies should be made with this much craftsmanship and quality."

I want my three hours back, Mr Eisner!<br/><br/>Yeah you could say this movie is for kids -- certainly anyone over the age of ten who doesn't want to put their shoe through the screen would have to be brain-dead -- but what kid wants to look at scenes where the characters just stare into space, thinking and feeling nothing in particular, while the clock on the wall ticks... and ticks... and ticks...?

Quaid and the others do a pretty good job considering what they're given to work with.  FWIW, the cinematography is utterly devoid of imagination, too.<br/><br/>All in all, I can't believe this movie was actually released.

It's one that the whole family will enjoy, whether your a fan of baseball or not and an inspiration to never let go of your dreams.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the book by Jimmy Morris and Joel Engel ""The Oldest Rookie: Big-League Dreams from a Small Town Guy"". Although Dennis Quaid is older than the 35 year old Jimmy Morris he portrays, he does an excellent job of giving you the sense of emotions that Jim Morris has experienced over time. This movie also has a wonderful supporting cast of unknowns which makes the movie even more believable. It's too bad that Hollywood doesn't make more of these types of movies. Ones that have a believable story or plot without all the sexual affairs, car crashes and explosions."

The mood of the whole movie is slow, steady, and you're thinking the whole way through, ""when is the team ever going to win?""

","Review: I missed this movie the fist time round so I thought that I would give it a watch, even though it's one of those feel good Disney movies. I personally enjoyed this film, especially as its a true story and Dennis Quaid put in a realistic performance but it is quite corny and predictable from the beginning to the end. It's a about a promising baseball player whose career was shattered after damaging his shoulder and advice from his doctor, so he takes on a job as a teacher in his small town. He also takes on a job as a baseball coach for his district team but they haven't won that many games. In 1999, he makes a bet with his team to pursue his baseball career if they win the district championship and with determination and brilliant coaching, they manage to win. He then tries out for the majors and everyone is shocked that this near middle aged man can throw a 98mph fastball, so the offers start flowing in. He then makes the tough decision to leave his family and go on the road with a baseball team but he doesn't really gel with the other players because of his age. He soon starts to miss his family and there debts start to build up so he decides to give up his dreams and go back home to take on a ordinary job so they can pay there bills. Soon after that, he gets an offer from a major league baseball team and he becomes the oldest baseball player with a unique and amazing fastball. It's a basic zero to hero story which we have seen many times before but the real footage of Jim Morris makes the film a joy to watch. I'm not a big fan of baseball but films like Bill Durham, Field Of Dreams and Tin Cup have brought the sport too people around the world. I liked the relationship between Jim Morris and his son, who always believed that his dad had a special fastball but it took Jim Morris some time to convince his dad who always thought that he had to give up his dreams to put food on the table. It is an amazing achievement for a 35 year old rookie to make it in the majors so this feel-good movie is a emotional biopic about a baseball hero. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Dennis Quaid, 61, really hit it big after starring in the Right Stuff in 1983 and then he had roles in major films like Innerspace, which I really enjoyed, Dreamscape, Enemy Mine, The Big Easy and Great Balls of Fire in the 80's. Since then his career was plagued with hit and misses but his professional acting style has never been questioned. He has some major blockbusters behind him like Wyatt Earp, Any Given Sunday, the brilliant Dragonheart and Flight Of The Phoenix but it's hard to see were his career will go from here. It's been a long time since he has starred as the lead in a big blockbuster but his old movies will always be a joy to watch. This movie was directed by John Lee Hancock who brought you films like the Alamo, the great Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks so he is known for his biopics. I would have liked to have seen the darker times of Jim Morris so it would have made it seem more real and not a typical happy go lucky Disney movie. With that aside, it is still an unique biopic which would be good if it was made for modern times. Judging by the movies takings, it obviously went down well with the audiences around the world so we are still suckers for the zero to hero concept. Anyway it's definitely worth a watch if your fed up with all the doom and gloom in everyday life but for entertainment and excitement, it's very average.<br/><br/>Budget: $22million Worldwide Gross: $81million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their sports/drama/family movies about a rookie baseball player who pursues his dreams into the majors after taking a bet. 5/10"

OK just so you know, I'm in high school, so I can really understand how flipping unrealistic all those scenes that involve high schoolers are. OK you know in the district championship game when Rudy is pitching to the ""bad guy"" in red hair? THERE IS NO WAY THAT GUY IS IN HIGH SCHOOL. even the seniors at my school look like toddlers compared to the kid. Also, during the seen in the beginning of the flick the protagonist is a kid aged 10-12, but later he is 30-40, so obviously the characters have all aged 20-30 years, but the 3 weird old guys he always hangs out with don't change at all in appearance! frank's hair turned white, but other than that there the exact same! it's like the just returned from the set of tuck everlasting. when the young morris goes into the store, all those old guys are between 40-60. Twenty to thirty years later, they look the same. dumb. so does the dad, the exact same.<br/><br/>also during the seen when he's posting the newspapers clippings on his bulletin board, i paused it and went up the the TV and read that newspapers, and IT Wasn't ABOUT BASEBALL.<br/><br/>also this nonsense with the tryouts, tell me the last time you saw a huge billboard that said ""hey have you ever wanted to play in the MLB? well then come here at this time!"" for him to even a freaking shot at the majors he would need an agent! the music in the this film sucks too, particularly when he's timing his pitches with the car radar thing.<br/><br/>also, why is the kid ALWAYS WITH THE DAD? i mean did he get divorced and take custody? that punk is always with him, even at practice. my freshman basketball coach ALWAYS brings his kids (all 3 of em) to our practices, and my teammates HATE IT and the last thing we would want is for one of them to come party in the locker room with us, like ""Hunter"" does."

Don't get me wrong: I applaud the outstanding performance of Angus T. Jones, but it was certainly unfortunate the part he had to play.

","Once again Disney has been pulling at straws trying to make another Blockbuster hit (having only recently succeeded with Finding Nemo, it seems, and being unable to match it). <br/><br/>Dennis Quaid plays Jimmy Morris, a high school baseball coach out of Texas who makes a wager with his team. Win the championship and he'll try out for the majors (making more of this promise to his son than his team). We see him float around from one dive team to another (and getting equally discouraged by his disuading wife and father) before finally being called up for his shot at the majors. Suddenly, this middle aged man, who dropped out of the minors years ago due to a shoulder injury, is playing top notch for the majors. It is based on a true story, but when Disney thought it would be great to spend big bucks on the story, they should've thought about really developing the story into something entertaining. <br/><br/>Despite the true tales of Jim Morris, this movie really lacks a story, or at least an effective delivery if you want to pay tribute to this guy and his 'amazing feat'. Sure, we see this guy struggling as he gets traded around before finally making it to the majors, encouraging audiences members to remember one thing: stick with your dreams and give it your all through even the most difficult moments if you expect to succeed. However, this movie isn't really entertaining since Jim Morris's character doesn't really do much. Even the baseball action isn't that hot. We just seem more of one guy traveling from one team to the next and not much else. Plus, the movie is just too long.<br/><br/>If it's baseball movies that suit you, then there are plenty of good titles out there (the classics: Field of Dreams; Bill Durham; The Sandlot; League of Their Own; etc.).

","Dennis Quaid is well cast as Jim Morris in this true story of an older guy who tries out for the major leagues after coaching his high school to a division title. Quaid is totally believable in the role and that's where the heart of this film lies. The wrong actor would have sunk this film but Quaid has always been so physically fit that he can portray this aging ""wanna be ballplayer"" and his natural charm makes you root for him all the more. I've always thought that Quaid was an underrated actor and he seems to be getting better as he gets a little older. The story is old fashioned and at times sappy but I think that would be nit-picking. Although I do have one major gripe, Rachel Griffiths is a major actress but her role here as Quaid's wife is a throw away. She really doesn't have any effective scenes and her role is reduced to being the supportive wife. In essence, any actress could have played the part. If your making a film with Rachel Griffiths you had better give her something interesting to do! But I did enjoy the film and I liked the way the director John Lee Hancock took his time telling the story. The pacing is good and its also very well photographed. Its not a great film but how can you knock a movie that has so much heart? I couldn't, and I sat back and bought into it and enjoyed myself!"

","Overall good little film based on a true story about a chemistry teacher (Dennis Quaid) in Big Lake Reagan County, Texas who still harbors thoughts about someday playing baseball in the Major Leagues. He coaches a rag-tag bunch of players at the town's high school and challenges them to start playing up to their capabilities in the hopes of keeping the program alive. He makes a deal with them that he will try out for the big leagues if they start playing the way they are supposed to. Naturally all goes well as the team makes it to the Texas Class 2A U.I.L. Baseball Tournament. Now it is Quaid's turn to hold up his end of the bargain. So he tries out and the newly-formed Tampa Bay Devil Rays show great interest and hire him to a minor league deal. What follows is a long and sometimes seemingly hopeless journey to be called up to the majors. ""The Rookie"" is a film that really starts to tire in its second half. It starts off so well and the footage of Quaid coaching his players in Big Lake is really excellent, but when the focus shifts squarely to him the project struggles to stay above water. After a while it seems that Quaid's character is just a selfish person who wants to do whatever he wants with utter disregard for his wife,  children and career back home. Dennis Quaid does a good job here, but he lacks the support that made him so much better in greater films (""The Right Stuff"", ""Innerspace"", ""Traffic"").
